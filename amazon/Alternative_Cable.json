{"reviewTitle":"A Tangled Mess: Disappointing Experience","reviewDescription":"I recently purchased the USB Type-C to A Cable 5-Pack with high hopes for a reliable and fast-charging solution. However, my experience with these cables has been nothing short of frustrating, leaving me thoroughly disappointed.The first issue that became apparent was the misleading promise of \"Braided Fast Charging.\" Despite the braided design, the charging speed was far from impressive. Instead of the advertised quick charger cord, the charging time seemed slower than some standard cables I've used in the past. This inconsistency was a major letdown, especially when in a rush to juice up devices.The 6-foot length, intended to offer convenience, turned out to be more of a curse than a blessing. The cables are prone to tangling, and no matter how neatly I tried to arrange them, they seemed to develop a mind of their own. This constant battle with knots and tangles made the cables more of a hassle than a helpful accessory.Furthermore, the durability of these cables is questionable. Despite the braided exterior, which usually suggests sturdiness, the connectors felt flimsy and showed signs of wear after minimal use. One of the cables even stopped working altogether after just a few weeks, leaving me with one less functional option from the 5-pack.In terms of compatibility, these cables seemed hit or miss. While some devices recognized them without issues, others experienced connectivity problems. This lack of consistency raises concerns about the overall quality and reliability of the cables.In conclusion, the USB Type-C to A Cable 5-Pack failed to live up to its promises. The slow charging speed, constant tangling, questionable durability, and compatibility issues make this purchase regrettable. I would strongly advise against investing in these cables, as they deliver a subpar charging experience and fall short of the expected standard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704153600000}
{"reviewTitle":"All  5 USB Cables Failed in Just 4 Months","reviewDescription":"purchased a set of 5 USB cables back in October 2023, hoping they would serve as reliable connections for my devices. However, my experience has been profoundly disappointing. As of today, February 11, 2024, not a single cable from this purchase functions as expected.Initially, these cables appeared to be of decent quality, and I had high hopes for their performance. Unfortunately, their functionality began to deteriorate rapidly. Within a few months, all three cables have ceased to work entirely\u2014they neither charge nor connect any of my devices. This complete failure renders them absolutely useless and makes the purchase a total waste of money.I had not subjected these cables to any extreme conditions or rough handling that could justify such a short lifespan. Their inability to perform the most basic functions of a USB cable is simply unacceptable. It's clear that the quality and durability of these products are severely lacking, making them not worth the investment.To anyone considering this product, I strongly advise looking elsewhere. The inconvenience and frustration of having to replace these cables in such a short timeframe far outweigh any initial savings or perceived value. It's disheartening to encounter such poor product quality, and I hope this review helps others avoid the same disappointment.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696896000000}

I bought these last August.Durability and workmanship can only be measured after substantial use.  Nice to have a quantity of 5 long cords, but perhaps the reason they give you five is they know they don't last long.  The first cord I pulled from the pack began losing connectivity where it plugs into the phone after a few months use.  The second lost it's turbo and started charging slowly after a month.  The third did the same after 2 months.  After setting my expectations low on cord number 4, it lasted a surprising 4 months but then lost connectivity recently.  Cord 5 is in use as of July 2022.  I use these to recharge a single cell phone.At the present rate, I will burn through all cords in about a year.  Compare that to the recharge cord provided with the phone that is still delivering a good connection and turbo recharge with no problems for the past 18 months.  I took a close look at both cord connections to the phone.  It is clear these cords show noticeable wear after a couple months while the 18 month old Motorola cord has none to mention.  They also fit more loosely even when right out of the box.  Amazon recommends this product.  Obviously they have not tested itClearly the workmanship on these cords is sorely lacking.

Enter SMALLElectric's 5-pack of 6ft USB-C to A cables, a seemingly simple product that surprised me with its quality and functionality.First Impressions:Pulling back the no-frills packaging, I was greeted by a tangle-free bundle of sleek, grey cables. The braided nylon design instantly screamed \"premium,\" and the connectors felt reassuringly solid with their aluminum housings. Plus points for ditching the excessive plastic often found in cable packaging!Performance:Plugging one cable into my trusty Galaxy Note 10, I was met with the satisfying \"fast charging\" notification. Data transfer speeds were zippy, allowing me to quickly move files between my phone and laptop. No dropped connections or hiccups \u2013 just smooth, reliable performance.Durability:Let's face it, phone cables endure a lot of abuse. I wasn't gentle with these cables, tossing them in my bag, snagging them on doorknobs, and generally subjecting them to the chaos of my daily life. But the braided nylon held strong, showing no signs of wear or tear even after weeks of use. The reinforced stress points near the connectors added an extra layer of confidence.Value:Five 6ft cables for under $15? That's hard to beat, especially considering the build quality and performance. Compared to individual cables from big brands, these offer exceptional value for money.The Verdict:SMALLElectric's USB-C cables are a winner in my book. They're stylish, durable, and perform admirably, all at a budget-friendly price. Whether you're a techie like me or just someone looking for reliable charging cables, these are definitely worth considering.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706832000000}

I gave them to different family members to charge their Google Pixel devices.  Everything was working well until, at random, family members (who live in different residences) started reporting the same problem - the phone would stop working all together.  After researching online, Google engineer Benson Leung indicated that there are some USB C cords that can damage your device because they don't supply the correct voltage.  Unfortunately, I believe this is the case with these cords as well.  They ended up frying the devices so that they don't work at all.  It short circuits the device so that it's basically useless.  I had to replace a number of Google Pixel devices because of this.  I really wanted to enjoy these cords because they're braided and durable, but if it can't give the correct amount of current and damage the device, it's not worth it.  The voltage issue with USB C cords isn't common knowledge now, but I will work to inform my friends to get name brand cords and not to try to save money on the cords - it's not worth it.

{"reviewTitle":"They don't work very well","reviewDescription":"These cables look nice, but they don't charge very well. I've had them for about 3 months now and they started out fine, with the exception that on the second day of using it, the cable caused my phone to overheat and shut down to the point it wouldn't turn back on. About 30 minutes later after unplugging it and allowing it to sit, I finally got my phone to power back on. The phone had 40% battery when it did this, so it's not because the phone died due to lack of power. Now a few months later, they won't effectively charge my phone in the car or even if plugged into the wall. I've even tried it on my laptop. When I plug my phone in, it doesn't even recognize that it's plugged in. The charging light and lightning bolt don't show up at all. It might appear for a second and then it's gone. I've changed out the brick for the wall and the charger in the car and it always seems to be the cable. The same brick or car unit works just fine for my husband's phone cables. Yesterday, while attempting to get some tiny charge in the car, the cable caused my phone to shut down again. Thinking that maybe it was the one cable out of the pack of five, I rotated to a new cable and every single one of them have this issue. Like I said, they look nice, great material and all, but they don't actually charge anything effectively.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1524700800000}

They were just as sturdy and stiff at the first bag. I'm sure the things would take quite the beating because they really are quite tough.I've still had mixed results with them. Sometimes they fast charge, but it won't come up on the phone as \"fast charging\", but I can swap to an older type C cable and the charge time jumps up by 45 minutes or so, but I can plug one of these back in and the time drops by quite a bit, but still not \"fast charging\".I've updated my review to 3\/5 \"it's okay\" because they really are VERY sturdy, and they do seem to charge well, but the fact they don't register as \"fast charging\" leaves me a bit put off. The customer service has been very good, and I would buy from the sellers again (just not this item).The cables are very sturdy, almost too stiff. The reason why I am giving it a bad rating is because they are NOT fast charging, or at least the ones I got weren't. Maybe 1 out of 5 will actually fast charge, and sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.

{"reviewTitle":"Fast charging cable (in 2022) but not as good as 2021","reviewDescription":"*UPDATE 2023*The original review was given 1-star because it did not fast charge a Samsung phone but the same brand cable bought from 2021 did fast charge. However, I found out later that the phone's USB-C charger port was collecting dust\/dirt\/debris and needed to be cleaned (see below for how-to instructions), and after cleaning, any USB-C cable plugged into the phone charger port would be more sturdy and no longer wobbly\/loose (originally thought it was the port going bad or physically damaged).So I retested the cleaned phone with the newer 2022 cable and sure enough it Fast Charges! Hence, review is updated from 1-star to 4-star, it loses 1 star because the older 2021 cable managed to fast charge a \"dirty\" port.HOW-TO-CLEAN-USB-C-PORT:You can do a Google or Youtube search \"how to clean phone usb-c port\", or here are brief instructions.1. Turn OFF your phone.2. Get a paper clip and bend it so that you have at least 0.5-1 inch of straight metal, or get any small metal pin but not too thick that will bend or touch the center piece sticking out of the USB-C port.3. Scrape along the gap of your USB-C port, avoiding the center piece of the port. Dirt\/dust\/debris collects inside the hole so that's why when you plug in any USB-C cable it will feel wobbly\/loose instead of tight if the port was clean.4. Blow on the port now and then while cleaning to remove any loose dirt\/dust\/debris.5. Plug a USB-C cable in to test that it's now snug\/tight instead of wobbly\/loose, and you are done!*ORIGINAL REVIEW*Bought this same cable in 2021 (march) and it was fast charging, bought it again in 2022 (nov) and it is NO LONGER fast charging. The pictures will show the difference between the 2021 and 2022 versions, the 2022 slow charging cable's head is slightly darker blue\/gray in color, and the inside of the USB plug is purple instead of black.Tested both cables using the same phone with the same power plug, all 6 of the new 2022 cables were SLOW charging. Very disappointed, because I recently bought a different brand which was suppose to be fast charging but was in fact slow charging, so I thought I would go back to these cables since they were fast previously... but clearly not any more.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"46 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668729600000}

At the end of 30 days, I will update this headline and review to reflect my experience with the new product.Not sure where all the positive reviews came from. The cables I received are not rated for fast charging regardless of the device being charged or charger. Further, the plastic covers on each end (Both small and large end) are loose (Were not heat-shrunk enough) and will not stay in place, making connecting both ends difficult.My kid's S9s and our S10s all threw errors when we connected using these cables, even after restarts and trying several different chargers.
