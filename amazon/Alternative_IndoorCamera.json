{"reviewTitle":"Mixed feeling on the mini","reviewDescription":"I have mixed feeling on the mini Blinks. I have the Blink outdoor units as well as the doorbell, all of which work fine and have done so for a couple of years. In fact I have a few that I have never installed. I ordered the mini's for use indoors to monitor the front door and pets. Unfortunately for some reason they occasions disconnect and require being reset (unplug from the AC and plug back in). This works and sometimes it doesn't. I actually replaced one that I could not get to reconnect even after doing a hard reset and reinstalling thru camera in the app. I had to do this twice and on the third time it went out, I assumed it was the camera and bought two more. After less than a month, the new camera started doing the same thing. I replaced the USB cable and the power block thinking that might be the cause but then it happened again. I did not think it might be the sync unit until the other camera located in another area started doing the same thing (both cameras at the same time). I unplugged the Sync unit and waited and they started working again, but I did this previously when the first camera went out before buying a new one. It's not my network or location of the camera (distance from the sync unit) since I am in a small Condo and each camera is less than 30 feet away from where the sync unit is right next to the router.My next step will be to replace the sync unit, but my patience and satisfaction with the Blink mini product is wearing very thin. The App could also use some work, as it is very basic and very disappointing that they have not made many upgrades in terms of features. How difficult would it be to add a feature to allow your cameras to arm automatically at a preset time like even the ridiculously name Chinese branded products that I wouldn't trust.I'm not at a point where I want to abandon the product completely since I have so much invested in it, with many cameras between my house and condo. Like I said the outdoor units have worked flawlessly, despite having given me low battery warnings on occasions, yet they are still operating without any issues after several years of being deployed. I don't arm them that often and they are not designed to be armed all the time, otherwise the battery will be dead after a few days due to movement.  They are great for monitoring door activity where there should be none.With the issues I've experienced with the mini's so far, it is hard for me to recommend them, particularly since I bought new cameras for what appears to be no reason at all. The next time the stop working and the LED starts flashing, I'll replace the sync unit, but after that, the mini's will go in the trash as well as the Blink reputation. They are too unreliable for monitoring activity indoors particularly your front door when it is connected directly to AC and can be used continuously without having to worry about batteries.The image and night vision quality are good, but image rotation is limited. You can flip the image if you mount the camera upside down, but not when the camera is angled. If Blink fixes to connectivity issue between the sync unit and the minis, and includes the ability to for the software to automatic reorient the image so that it always right side up, this would be a great low cost solution for in home monitoring. As it stands, they are unreliable.I'm not going to replace the sync unit pre-emptively, but once the issue reoccurs as it did last week, I'll do so and then wait to see if it happens again. I'll update my review at that time, otherwise I'd suggest using the Blink indoor unit and just connect it to the AC vs. using it indoors on battery power. The mini are small enough not to be an eye sore or immediately noticed.

{"reviewTitle":"Great cameras - Rushed app that is missing key features and was clearly designed for other cameras.","reviewDescription":"I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks\/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps\/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3,475 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1587081600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Hit or Miss","reviewDescription":"I have a 50% success rate with these cameras. My girlfriend purchased one that, right out of the box, is having some software issues not connecting to my Wi-Fi. I wish I could say something good about customer service but when I submitted a ticket including the troubleshooting solutions I tried, I received a generic email back suggesting I try solutions that, you guessed it, I have already tried! It\u2019s been a few days and I still have yet to get a response yielding any real solutions.It\u2019s not all bad, however. As soon as I realized the first one wasn\u2019t working correctly I remember I had read another review saying they had a similar issue and I purchased a second one myself. It arrived quickly and the setup process was flawless and quick, using the same process as the first non functional one.The camera quality is good. We use it from inside a window looking out around our front door. These cameras are not designed to look THROUGH glass at a dimly lit area because the IR light will just reflect off the glass and back into the sensor resulting in a completely washed out image. If you have an exterior light making the area visible, you have the option of turning off the IR light and the camera has no issue seeing through the glass at that point, just make sure the area you\u2019re trying to view is lit by an alternate source. The motion sensing feature is nifty and the trigger zones can be changed to your preference. Also in the box comes a set of screws so you can mount the camera to a vertical or inverted surface, however there are no physical instructions on how to do so and you will need to scan a QR code on the packaging for those. The included USB-A to Micro USB cable has some decent length to it. I haven\u2019t measured it but if I were to guess it\u2019s probably around 10ft. The Micro USB end has a housing that only fits the Blink camera.In summary, the camera is actually pretty decent if the one you order is working (unlike a handful of reviews I\u2019ve seen) and you use it correctly. Just be prepared to immediately request a replacement\/return through Amazon rather than sit around and wait for a legitimate response from customer service like myself. I\u2019m pleased with my working camera. My low review is due to the lack of a pulse from Customer Service.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713830400000}
{"reviewTitle":"It was affordable","reviewDescription":"(*edit* it turns out it wont record at all unless you subscribe) For the price it's hard to complain but I'm gonna do it anyway. I thought the cameras can continously record but that's my bad for not researching better. Just so others know, they record by motion sensor only. In my busy house I get upwards of 600 clips\/day. But I like to keep them armed because you never know when someone might break in to your home, or the nanny is doing something that they need to be corrected on. In all fairness you can choose an area specifically in the cameras view that you want to record, but whats the point from a safety perspective if you don't have the whole view. When you're looking at the \"home\" screen, a quick view of all your cameras, there is no live view. Instead there is a thumbnail image. This image can be updated whenever you want by capturing a screenshot, essentially, of whatever is going on in that room at the time. So that sucks. In order to see what is going on with that camera at the time you have to click on it for a live view. To record live view it's kind of confusing. You have to click on the \"saved\" button which will be blue while it's recording, and then click the \"saved\" button again to stop recording. It should just say record, stop recording. The fact that the button says \"saved\" threw me off. A lot of the features I had to figure out by trial and error. You can record up to 5mins of live view at a time, or 90mins if you subscribe to their affordable plans ($3\/mo & $10\/mo). You can choose how long the camera records when it stops detecting motion. You can get notified immediately when there's motion or notified after the full video has been recorded. The live view is pretty clear both visually and audio, however, the two-way audio sucks. There is a delay in the audio from both ends and then the video begins to get glitchy. You can snooze the camera from being armed, let's say you don't want to record while you're sleeping you can snooze for 8 hours. You can choose when you want the LEDs on, in case you don't want people to know when it's recording. I find this keeps integrity. You can change the motion sensitivity. Expect it to notify you hundreds of times if you have pets. I had to turn the notifications off. You can set the length of the motion detected clip (up to 30 seconds). The fisheye view has pretty good range. You can link it to your Amazon account and Alexa. For example I was getting notifications on my Alexa echo show when the camera detected motion. Good or bad, up to you. If you live alone probably good, if you don't want it publicly known when the camera detects motion, bad. You can access the cameras from the blink app or the Amazon Alexa app. It's easy to add devices to the blink app, you just plug it in, log it in to the wifi and you're good. The cable is pretty long, long enough to mount it about 7 feet above your standard close to the floor wall outlet. Overall I decided to keep them because they were a deal and they serve their basic purpose. I've posted some screenshots of the the apps settings pages. Hope this helps y'all make an informed decision.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"178 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700092800000}

No issues there.The app however doesn't let you view for more than 30 seconds without either constantly hitting `Continue` or you lose the feed. Maybe that's fine if all you do is quickly check. But if you want something you can leave on and just glance at, then its a dealbreaker. You can either live with that, or pay extra to have it continuous. Given the options out there, I see no reason to do either. The camera also produces an audible click every time you access the feed, so I would constantly distract my dog if she was nearby every time I check in.In this price range, I think the best option is the \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfc by TP-Link 2K. It has a nice app, doesn't cut off your feed, and the camera does't click. It also acts as a standard IP camera that offers the feed over RTSP streams, so if you wanted you could access via third party software and you're not locked into their app. I have two of these blink cams, and wish I had discovered the Tapo earlier.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1720483200000}

Put some research into it &don\u2019t let a sale fool you-like it did me \ud83d\ude1f","reviewDescription":"There is so many things you have to play around with to get it to work everyday and every light change. It also won\u2019t show out a window if you don\u2019t shut night mode off when it\u2019s dark (even if it\u2019s well lit outside) but then if it\u2019s daylight and you don\u2019t flip the night mode back on auto it won\u2019t pick up anything at all, inside or out but even if you do that sometimes it switches back off and you miss 12 hours of monitoring if you weren\u2019t paying really close attention that no alerts were coming in. I also have a really hard time getting it to connect to live mode. The first week it worked fine, now it just stops. No reason. Didn\u2019t touch a thing. Just nothing and no matter what you do nothing fixes it until minutes or hours later it\u2019ll just do it. As far as the sensitivity, sometimes a snowflake or a gnat flying by will set it off. Other times, for 8 hours someone moved Next to me and nothing (also while I was on vacation someone came into my house, took 3 delivered Christmas present bags I had put in my bedroom the day before I left for vacation and they used the restroom, left a key lay in the middle of the floor and who knows what else and I didn\u2019t get one single alert!!! I didn\u2019t know about it until I got home and started to wrap the Christmas presents and realized 3 of my grandkids gifts were gone so I started piecing things together (the key, the toilet etc). It feels so violating & that was the main reason I got it! To feel safe!! I also wanted to be able to watch my car and front door from my bedroom, especially if someone were to knock or something so I could see if it was for my door before going and so that I could hear them all the way in my room but this thing will only stay on about 30 seconds without you having to click the continue button that comes up. It stays on longer on Echo Show (not much) but it records it the entire time & you don\u2019t have a whole lot of room to begin with to save videos without having to subscribe to something-that I haven\u2019t figured out yet but what\u2019s the point of it won\u2019t do what it\u2019s supposed to anyway! Not to mention, you can change how long it will save your videos without starting to automatically deleting them. You maximum time you can choose to save them is 60 days! WT..???? Half the time I probably wouldn\u2019t even know I needed to look at something for longer than that! Like if I forgot where I put something on my birthday last year? Maybe I could look at the videos & see if it caught where I put it (like a pair of earrings I only wear on special occasions). Or if someone took something (that is if it actually worked like it should) but it was something like a firestick or game consol you only use when you have guests or the grandkids are over so it might have been 6 months since you used it last. I don\u2019t know what all to say. I mean, overall I like the concept but it just isn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m going to have to send them back and try a different brand all together.

{"reviewTitle":"Camera great, app very disappointing","reviewDescription":"I have been using the blink cameras, both indoor and out, for about a year now. Originally, the cameras and app were easy to use and on point.After the most recent app update earlier this year, the app performance definitely changed. The app has gotten so complicated amd frustrating to use: recordings get stored out of order; some entire days are missing; switching from video to video used to be easy as there was an arrow to direct- now you have to go back to the home screen in between each one; when you want to download a video, you have to select the download button multiple times to hopefully download one copy as the app doesn't give you any indication the video was downloaded like it used to. This is especially irritating as you need to leave the blink recordings to look in the download\/video gallery to see if it was downloaded then when you return to the app, you have to search through all the recordings again for to find the day\/video you were looking at as the app refreshes the list of recordings to the most recent recording every time you leave. Also noted that the times of the videos being downloaded into the gallery are showing the time 7 hrs later than when the video is actually recorded.I have been in touch with Blink's customer service on these matters since Feb. I have only been told to wait for the next update and most recently- ...thank you for your contributions and well pass them on to our team...The one thing with the cameras performance is that my plug-in cameras often just stop recording for no distinct reason. Usually, simply disarming and arming the system again take care of this for the day.The cameras have been great overall. The app not so much. The customer service- I would appreciate it if the customer could seen their software folks are seriously looking into and trying to fix the issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1715731200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Can\u2019t recommend based on quality and consistency!","reviewDescription":"Just for a little background info before I give my pros and cons\u2026 We have 8 cameras total (3 outdoor and 5 indoor minis). We have them all set up on the same system saving to the sync device that is at a good middle spot in the house by our router and also have the WiFi extended to reach every corner of the 1\/2 acre we live on by using an Orbi system. We placed the three cameras in the front of the house and then the inside ones we placed strategically thought the house.Pros: 1. Easy setup: for the most part it was downloading an app and plugging in the indoor cameras and putting batteries in the outdoor ones. Then you scan the QR code and your ready to go.2. Picture quality is pretty good: It automatically switches to night vision when it gets too dark and I can adjust IR intensity to allow the picture quality I want at night. The daytime picture is pretty good up close but you couldn\u2019t use it to see like the license plate of the cars driving by or anything detailed more than a 5-10 feet from the camera.3. You can talk and hear through the cameras: This is a plus but the quality is severely lacking in this area. You can\u2019t talk and hear what they are saying at the same time and when they talk or you talk it seems to cut in and out quite a bit so you miss some of what is said. It is also delayed by at least 3-4 seconds from when it is actually being said to when you hear it on the app.4. The price is good for a starter security system or if you aren\u2019t wanting to pay a lot but still want to catch a burglar or make sure your packages are being delivered properly.5. You can add on cameras if you need more but beware because the sync device doesn\u2019t seem to like to record and save what is happening on more than one camera at a time so if a bird flies by one camera your probably not going to catch the person walking up to your porch on the other camera (or at least not until they are actually on your porch).Cons: 1. Battery life depends on usage which means with heavy winds moving the top of our trees causing the shadows to sway and then the bees and birds that seem to love setting our cameras off we have now replaced the batteries at least once in each of the three outdoor cameras and one of the cameras seems to need replaced each month. You can change the sensitivity setting to help stop some of that but it seems like we didn\u2019t pick up anything including people walking around outside when we went down a setting or two so be prepared to replace a bunch of lithium batteries or not catch what\u2019s happening.2. As I mentioned above the ability to talk to whoever is on the other side of the camera(or just listen in) is lacking quality and consistency!3. The app takes too long to pull up and then you can\u2019t smoothly switch between camera live views(it gives an error message or says the camera is busy) so if you are trying to check in on each camera your either out of luck or will have to close completely out of the app and get back in to try and see the next cameras live view.4. The inconsistent recording is extremely frustrating!! Some days it will alert me to a fly buzzing past or the mailman putting mail in our box, other days though it won\u2019t catch half of what is going on or it will catch it on one camera showing one angle but not on the other one which should have a clearer view of whatever action is happening.5. The Sync module has a spot for a usb memory drive but their blink usb drive filled up way too fast and the other few I tried didn\u2019t seem to record the videos correctly so we couldn\u2019t pull them up on a computer later. Your only other option is to pay each month for the cloud storage that they offer which will allow you to keep unlimited videos for up to 60days.6. Randomly the outdoor cameras will disconnect to my Orbi satellite or router even though they are within feet of them but the indoor cameras will stay connected. I end up having to take the outdoor ones down from where they are mounted and taking the batteries out for a few seconds to get it to reconnect. This is a pain since the cameras are hard to snap back onto the bracket they come with that is permanently attached to the house now.7. Although I put the LED recording status light to off on all the cameras it still comes on whenever it is recording. That\u2019s frustrating when I\u2019m trying to check in on the house and they hear a click and see a red light and know they are being recorded or we are watching.8. Although it has where you can set up a timer for your system to become active or inactive, you have to have all the cameras that are connected to the sync module go with that timer and can\u2019t keep certain ones active all the time with the timer unless you put them on a different system and get another sync module.So basically they are a cheap starter system for someone wanting the basics and not looking for super consistent recording. I wish they were better because we would have added to the cameras we have now but with all the app problems and recording problems we will be finding a different (probably pricier) system to replace these cameras.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1624492800000}

Nobody is buying it except the interns that fetch your coffee and run blink.Why don\u2019t you stop hobbling your products and let me worry about what needs to be private on my property. I I look at my ring doorbell and it disgusts me, what a hobbled, crippled, worthless waste of carbon.

Not sure why the camera is inactive but essentially half the day it is not recording.For instance, Sunday night, the last recorded motion is 11:27 PM. Monday, the first recorded motion is 8:15 PM. Today there\u2019s a lapse between 4:39 AM and 12:17 PM. Someone usually walks by my apartment at least every 10 minutes throughout the day. Very UNRELIABLE for home security. Should be 1 star, but it could be useful to someone as a live view for a 3D printer or something, but no time lapse feature.***** Look elsewhere for home security. I purchased the Yi Dome Cam + and I am extremely happy with that. Plus it has internal MicroSD storage for continuous recording and 360* capability.Note: I have it set to trigger on motion at all times, no scheduled breaks or turn off when I\u2019m home.UPDATE - 4\/30\/20: 2 stars to 3. The development team has now added an option to turn off the night vision infrared lights. Thank you for being responsive. I still have an issue with the Retrigger time leading to a lapse in event recording, hopefully continuous recording could be an option in the future. Maybe with the combination of the Sync Module 2? Until this feature is added I would not recommend for home security.Original Review - 2 Star:I repeat, DO NOT use for home security. Look elsewhere for a home security solution.This camera is exclusively triggered by motion. While that sounds perfect for a security camera, it is a major downfall of the Blink platform. The camera searches for motion and records at the time it senses motion, and a little before. This is great, however it will only record up to 30 seconds. At this point, the recording stops and the camera has a grace period where it will not trigger due to motion again for a period of time. Blink has a setting for this break period and it can be adjusted, but can go no less than 10 seconds. So if you have an event that is 45 seconds long, you will record the first 30 seconds and the last 5 seconds, leaving you with a 10 second gap in your footage that could be key to solving a break in or similar event.Another issue I have is that the night vision can not be turned off. You can select \u201con\u201d or \u201cauto\u201d. So if your camera is looking out a glass window at night you will not see anything, even if there is a light outside. The infrared LEDs can not go through the glass so you end up getting a terrible glare in the window and an almost completely black screen. Where if you could turn it off, it would see through the window to the street which is lit by an exterior light.In addition, the live view is ridiculous. You must tap a continue button every 15-30 seconds to keep watching the feed. If you do not tap the button when prompted, it backs out of the live view.As for the picture quality, it\u2019s okay. You can\u2019t read a license plate from 15 feet away though. And if you zoom in on someone\u2019s face it would be hard to tell who they are from any more than 10 feet away. For the price though, it\u2019s not terrible.I don\u2019t care to go into detail, but the app is lacking in so many ways.I have returned this camera in search of a better solution. Next attempt is the Yi Dome Camera X.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"1,133 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1588032000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Still missing key features!","reviewDescription":"May 2021 Update: unfortunately I have had to downgrade my original review. After a year, Blink should have added the missing features listed below in my original review especially individual camera notification control. If you have more than one camera; this missing feature is a huge annoyance. The Blink forums have been asking for this simple feature for 3 years and Blink has been unresponsive. If these features are ever added, I will update my review and can recommend the Blink system again.I am very happy Blink is expanding their offerings and this little camera surprised me! We own a Blink XT2 system as well as Yi Cameras.This Camera makes a much better baby camera than the Blink XT2 and works perfectly with our existing XT2 system. I did not have to sign up for the cloud subscription and because Mini Recordings are free as part of our XT2 system (XT2 cameras do not require a subscription). This is a huge benefit and reason why people would purchase both the Mini and XT2. Hopefully, the free cloud storage stays for the Mini recordings, especially for people who own a XT2 system. The daily experience is good, the app works well for the features it does have, but the cons listed below are a big issue that Blink should easily resolve for all their cameras. I am still very happy overall.Pros:-Great build quality and design-Great picture quality-Very responsive when connecting to Echo Show (seems better than the XT2)-Small size-Mountable base-Weighted base (weight can be removed)-Long USB\/power cord-Two way audio with App-Local storage option if you buy the new Sync 2Reliable AppCons:-No Two Way Audio with Echo Shows; both are Amazon companies, and I am not sure why this is not a feature already.-No individual camera arm\/disarm scheduling (you are forced to schedule your entire system)-No individual camera notification control; Blink please also add this feature! This is extremely annoying especially as you add more cameras. I really only want notifications for our front door but want recordings without notifications for the rest of the House. I imagine most people would want the same thing.-Can\u2019t continuously view on the App. This can be annoying especially for this camera in our case (we are using it as a baby monitor). You can continuously view with an Echo Show but it does cut out eventually.-Paid subscription for Cloud recordings; all other Blink cameras have free cloud recordings and it would have been better if this camera followed the same strategy.Overall, this camera would be perfect and get 5 stars once Blink fixes the few App features missing listed above. I have contacted Blink in various forms to inform them of the above missing simple features but the responses have been unimpressive. I plan to modify this review if the features are added, but unfortunately people have been begging Blink for these features for years.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"1,775 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1587081600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Ok but has failed me","reviewDescription":"12\/11\/23 the cameras go offline often and don't detect movement well. Today at 4AM I heard a noise in my dining room and my camera wasn\u2019t triggered. I go on my camera to check the live view and it would not load. I closed and reopened the app and got a busy signal\u2026.so now I\u2019m up damn near about to booboo on myself not wanting to wake my partner up to check for me because he\u2019s sleep and has work soon. The camera have been unreliable on many occasions & it\u2019s frustrating on top of me paying $10 monthly to view and save my camera footage\u2026.now below I\u2019ll post my notes I took on this camera around the time I first purchased it\/them(I have 3 total and 1 doorbell camera)Randomly two went offline at two separate times. I have 4 total on the same WiFi. Customer service said it was normal and it was fluctuation in my internet signal\u2026.since I got it all my camera have went offline at random times. It\u2019s really no explanation for this because my WiFi is working fine and we have a fast connection. I know this because I work from home and I had Internet requirements to meet.Can\u2019t view live footage sometimes. It will just load and load. Can\u2019t view prerecorded footage sometimes. It will also just load and load. Also when I get notified of motion(I have it set to where I\u2019m notified right as the motion begins) I click the notification and it won\u2019t take me to the live view and if the motion has ended it won\u2019t take me to the recorded video(the recorded videos sometimes take 10 seconds to x amount of time to show up in the history after the motion is recorded)When you try to take a new thumbnail of the room\/area the camera is in it will sometimes fail. For me it has done it a lot. When you try to update the motion areas with the squares it will fail saving it multiple times.Random recording times once motion is detected. I have mine set up to were I want it to record and it\u2019ll stop after 10 seconds of no motion detected but the camera will record random time ranges non anymore than 24 seconds. It\u2019ll stop recording even when the motion is still going on. Maybe I need to tweak it more but I have been for a few weeks and still nothing new.Night vision is wonky. It says the setting for where you want motion to be detected can mess this setting up a little. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s the case with mine because the bright areas(windows and doors) of my home is the areas I set to detect motion\u2026.the night vision will be on in a lit room and will flick on and off within the same timeframe. Example: at 4:55 the NV will be on then the next clip at 4:56 will be no NV\u2026this happens in dining area for example and sometimes the shadows from the trees outside will move around from the wind and you can see it on our window. The camera will pick this up on NV\u2026.it\u2019s so weird.Microphone\/audio lags. When I press hold to talk the person on the other end is already talking before I\u2019m done\/before I let go of the mic\/ the feedback from their end doesn\u2019t kick back in right away. So I will miss the beginning part of what they said. Also you have to be close to the camera to be heard by the person(s) listening unless they\u2019re screaming or yelling. Meaning the mic doesn\u2019t pick up audio very well. All in all the audio and mic is very inconsistent.Day 2. LR and dining room went offline both a few hours apartDay 7: dining room 11:20pm by 2:30 it was still online. I tried disconnecting the chord and then connecting again and still it was offline. Around 7:30am still off then by 813am it detected motion finally and recorded a video1\/7\/2024 update! I have my videos to store for 30 days and after that it will delete but I went to try and find some footage from less than 30 days and it\u2019s nowhere to be found actually the videos only went back to 12\/27\/23 which is definitely not 30 days ago. When I searched unfiltered it went to 12\/31\/23. I haven\u2019t been able to see any videos recorded before that point and I 100% always keep my cameras rolling. The only one I unarm sometimes is the one in the master bedroom but for example my door camera I never turn it off. I can\u2019t even see the videos recorded in that before 12\/31\/23. This is giving scam at this point not even gonna lie.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702252800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Started out impressed, then frustrated, now disgusted","reviewDescription":"4 Stars - I have 2 Blink Mini\u2019s linked to a Module2.  I have them mounted inside and pointed toward the outside through windows.  The cameras were fairly easy and painless to set up.  I like the small size of the cameras and that they don\u2019t have batteries to maintain or that can swell and fail over time.The picture quality is excellent daytime and low light.  I can\u2019t comment on infrared night time picture quality, as I have disabled the infrared and LEDs to prevent reflection on the window glass.The app needs improvement.It\u2019s good that you are able to block out zones where you don\u2019t want to detect motion, like normal traffic on the street.  However, this doesn\u2019t work at night as it will trigger cars in the zones blocked from monitoring.  Not just some, but all cars at night will trigger recording in the blocked zones.It\u2019s good that you can enable and disable individual cameras easily from the home screen of the app.  However, I wish they would make it so you could silence the notification from individual cameras without disabling the motion detection and recording easily from the home screen.  The only way is to go deep into the app settings to turn off the notifications for all cameras.I tried the Beta test of the instant notification which would be good, however, it negates the ability to delete clips directly from the notification, which I like when the clip is of the mail carrier or the neighbor\u2019s cat that likes to hang out at my house for some damn reason.  When I turned off the instant notification, I noticed that the cameras stopped picking up any motion, so I deleted and re-linked the cameras to the app and this fixed the problem.  I have not turned that function back on since.Update - Now it's 3 stars because I am starting to become frustrated with these cameras.  First of all, with the aforementioned blocking not working at night.  Secondly, it has stopped picking up the mail carrier delivering mail but picks me up walking the very same path to get the mail every time.?  A lot of users complain about having to keep pressing the continue button for live viewing.  In my case, I only use live view when aiming the camera or watching for the pizza delivery and it can become annoying even with my limited use of this function.  Many times there is a noise on the street so I attempt to see what it is, but then the camera doesn\u2019t want to connect to live view and by the time I get it to connect, whatever was there is long gone.  Whenever I have trouble connecting to live view, I can usually get it to connect after I kill the app and restart it so thinking a lot of my issues with the cameras are app related.I am still within the free cloud storage period so don\u2019t know if any of these issues will clear up when I am switched to local storage or if I will start to have more issues.  Only time will tell.Update - 2 stars.  Time told.  I am into day one of local storage and I can't believe how petty Amazon is with the app if you aren't paying the subscription plus a couple of issues I have been dealing with the cameras and waited to mention to see if it would change with local storage.  The dealt with issues I think is with the cameras and not the app.  I have to go into live view every morning in order to get the cameras to record motion for the day.  I don't get it, it's like they go to sleep overnight when not a lot of action is happening.  Another thing I don't understand, is it will record a huge amount of cars driving down the street past the house, even in the block out zones, but will not record me passing in front of my house as I am coming and going or entering and leaving my drive.  Not that I am interested in myself, but makes me wonder what else is happening that doesn't get recorded.  Now for the pettiness of the app that wasn't too hot to begin with.  The dot that tells you if you have already viewed the clip, gone.  The ability to delete groups or all the clips at one time, quickly and easily, gone.  You have to delete them one at a time in the viewer, which closes after you delete the clip and you have to tap the next clip and wait for it to open the viewer and load the clip.  The thumbnails of the clips so you can see what was captured without having to view the clip, gone.  The ability to save live views, gone.I can not recommend these cameras which is a shame, as the cameras are pretty dang good as compared to others that I have had with the exception of a couple of bugs.  But it's the app that keeps me from paying for the plan and recommending this system to anyone.  What was once a mediocre app that caused frustration, has been reduced to a needlessly onerous turd of a chore that causes angst and regret.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1613088000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Perpetual disappointment.","reviewDescription":"For the money, it's hard to resist these little cameras. The promise that you can use them without a subscription with the addition of the Sync Module is even more enticing. But in practice, Blink just disappoints. To be clear, the cameras work great the Sync Module stores clips locally without purchasing a subscription, but the niggling limitations Blink puts on the functionality as punishment for not subscribing are infuriating. Here is a list of features you don't get unless you subscribe:Motion detection video recordingLive view recording60-day unlimited video historyRapid video access (instantly watch your videos as soon as they\u2019re recorded)Video sharingPhoto capture (images captured periodically for more coverage)I'd almost be happier if the product were garbage instead of feeling like I only purchased a gateway product to entice me to get hooked on the subscription features. I'm not opposed to a subscription model, but only if it's for features that can only be offered remotely or ones that offer constant upgrades. This trend of selling vessels for subscriptions is soul-crushing and ethically reprehensible.So without a subscription, the Sync Module will only record motion-detected clips. Not live-view. That, of course, means you have to have motion detection enabled all the time, and it will record every single time you walk in or out of a room, which overflows the module with useless clips. I use my cameras to monitor my pets, and I'd like to just be able to peek in on a room, see if my pet doing something worth recording, and record it. I should be able to do that without storing my clips in the cloud.Second, when you have a subscription, you can access clips almost instantly. Accessing the clips on the Sync Module is painstakingly slow, and for some reason, you're unable to access videos if you have a live view active. Unless you have a subscription, there is no option to delete multiple clips or even all the clips. To quickly delete multiple clips, you have to eject the USB storage, put it in a computer and manage the files there.Next, live views are limited to 30 seconds without a subscription. Then you have to manually click on \"continue\" to keep watching. I don't even understand why that would be. If I want to watch a camera all flippin' day, I should be able to (barring any overheating). They, of course, offer extended live view with a subscription.The cameras themselves are pretty good. They provide decent images covering a fairly wide FOV. Night vision is sub-par but passable. It's only in black and white and is significantly grainer than a well-lit area. That is to be expected, but I've seen better. Setting up the cameras is a snap, though each time, the process crashes the first time. On the second attempt, after restarting the app, it connects smoothly. The app is fairly easy to use, though I'd like to be able to arrange the camera views in a matrix rather than jut on top of each other. One really annoying thing is when you do a live view on an iPad, even in portrait mode, it shows the video really small, and you always have to hit the full screen icon. Motion detection is too finicky; either it detects nothing or everything regardless of the level. Selecting activity zones is not very intuitive because it can't tell the difference between a moving object and change in lighting or a shadow.All in all, I would say that I am more frustrated by the features Blink withholds from the customer than I am pleased with the actual product. However, I could not find an alternative at a comparable price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663200000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Don't attempt to order in an emergency","reviewDescription":"Had I known what I know today I would have never wasted my time ordering these cameras. Going to try and make this as short as possible So, my stepdad was released from the hospital March 3rd. We were told by his doctor he should be going to Hospice, but respecting my step dads wishes to pass at home I needed to get an indoor monitoring system set up throughout the whole house so all of us could help my mom keep an eye on him 24\/7. Well I placed my order march 5th with same day delivery 5pm to 10pm. Needless to say I did not receive it on the 5th, as a matter of fact, I received a notification that there was an error with my address at around 8:27. Even though I have been getting items delivered to my store address for a few years now and they had literally made two other separate deliveries to this same address earlier that day. And I had been sitting there at my store on my day off waiting for these cameras. If there was ANY order I needed to have come through for piece of mind that day it was the cameras. So I could set them up at home and monitor my stepdad while I was at work with some piece of mind. So maybe about 30 mins after I get that notification I call customer support. Explain to them the address is right and even CS can see the 2 packages that were delivered earlier. CS tells me wait until end of day, if  it not delivered by then, they will try tomorrow. If I do not receive the package tomorrow they will cancel the order and send the money back to my card. March 6th. I wait all day at my store, mind you again, on my day off waiting for these cameras to come in. Midnight rolls around, no new updates or notifications on the cameras. So I assume they are going to cancel the order. I go home. March 7th. I wake up at 8AM on this day. Sometime between 1am and 5AM i get two emails and one notification. 1st email says package is being delivered. 2nd email says package has been delivered. The notification on the amazon app says \"It was handed directly to a receptionist or someone at a front desk. Signed by: Jackdnd.\" I got up out of bed immediately with a WTF!!? and who TF is Jackdnd?. Our store is closed between 2AM & 11AM. The cleaning crew does not get there until 7AM. So I am speeding through traffic to find out what is going on. I ask the cleaning crew if they signed for a package they said no but one was laying out front when they got there. No reason for my crew to lie about it... But the fact, the app said it was brought to reception and signed for.....On top of that it is well known our contract with the towing company has them keeping our P. Lot clear during our closed hours. And I know their drivers names as well...so there's that now onto the cameras themselves. 2 of the cameras worked properly out of the box, one was absolute double vision blurry. And after the fiasco with trying to get them delivered I was not going to try and contact CS again to try and get a replacement. Luckily I know enough about electronics myself that I was able to pull apart the camera and repair the camera back to perfect clarity.I will say at the price cost for picture they are better than my outside ring cams. But the ring app has a few more customizations to it.

{"reviewTitle":"Some issues detecting motion","reviewDescription":"I've had the Blink mini (with monthly subscription) inside my garage for a few years now.It can detect when the garage door is opened at night and\/or if there is motion in the dark like an insect flying around.During the daytime, it often fails to detect if the garage door is opened and someone walks in\/out!I think this has to do with the device not being able to switch quickly from nightime\/dark IR sensing to daytime\/bright motion sensing as the garage door opens quickly and lets a lot of light\/heat in.Update: 7\/2024Amazing customer service!They contacted me based on this review, and decided to replace my Blink Mini (via RMA).Unfortunately, the new unit exhibits similar issues: at times, it misses recording entire human movement going out of the garage quickly. But it can pick up very fine movement in the dark, and when everything is bright for a while, motion-detect recording is very good.I suspect this has to do with the cam getting tuned to IR mode inside the dark garage, and not being able to switch fast enough to non-IR mode motion-detection (and recording it) when a human moves fast enough past it, due to the quick incursion of heat\/light into the garage as the garage door opens.The cam is blinded for a while when the garage door opens too (see pic).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721088000000}

There is no setting for that. If there is no traffic the camera doesn't record anything at all.

{"reviewTitle":"Gets the job done","reviewDescription":"I got a 2-pak of Blink Minis on sale and I am happy with my purchase. Will you be?  Read on.They work great, stand alone, as a drop-in viewport with echo show devices using voice commands, fire TV sticks using voice commands and the Blink app on the phone.  If you want more than that then factor in the cost of a subscription to the Blink cloud service because it is more than just a cloud storage service, it unlocks all of the Blink Mini features except the ability to drop-in and view a live video feed via those three methods I just mentioned.You can not use the Alexa app on your phone, tablet, etc. with the camera at all without a Blink subscription plan active. Here is what Blink says about it: Even without a Blink Subscription owners of Blink Video Doorbell, Outdoor, Indoor (gen 2), or Mini cameras receive Motion Alerts in the Blink app that you tap to enter the camera's Live View. No clips are saved. That is straight from the manufacturer's website. Heads up, adding the Sync Module 2 does not add that functionality.Considering using local storage by purchasing a Sync Module 2 to use with your Minis?  The primary function of the Sync Module 2 is as a wifi booster for the low power Blink Outdoor cams running off only battery power. The Minis do not need this since they run off AC power. The Blink Outdoor cams offload the wifi video upload for the cloud onto the Sync Module 2 because it has an ac power source and so sending the video from the Sync Module 2 instead of directly from the outdoor cams saves battery life in the cams.  Now you know the true purpose of the Sync Module 2.  No, it won't give you recording and motion detection functionality in place of a subscription. To further confuse things, if you have an active subscription, including the free trial that is automatically started when you setup your first Blink device, the module functions only as a once a day backup device and can not function as a local storage device for videos. Once your free 30 day trial subscription runs out, the Sync Module 2 is remotely reconfigured by Blink to become a limited functionality storage device instead of a backup device. Understand the difference. And your Blink app on your phone is automatically remotely reconfigured to remove functionality you had with the free trial subscription.  So don't buy the Sync Module 2 thinking it will provide the functionality you lose with an expired subscription.  And don't think you will be able to purchase a Sync Module 2 right up front with your Blink Minis and start using it for local storage when you setup the cams instead of cloud storage because the trial subscription is automatic and prevents the Sync Module 2 from functioning as a local storage device.  It only functions as a once a day backup device.  Like you need to backup the web to your local device.  I always thought it was the other way around, backup your local devices to the web.  So you have to keep the cams and module for over 30 days before you can even check out the Sync Module 2 to see what it does and how it works.  I purchased a Sync Module 2 and a 128 GB USB stick to use with it for my Minis and it was for nothing - no added functionality at all.  My Minis are sending the motion triggered recordings to the trial subscription cloud storage for the next 27 days whether I want it or not.I'm not happy about the Sync Module 2 but the Mini does do what I wanted for a minimal cost even without it.  My goal with the Blink minis was to be able to check in on my other place when I'm not there during the winter months just to see that its still standing and my cars are still in the garage.  I wasn't looking for a constant viewport that is always recording in an endless loop nor did I think I was buying a serious thief catching security system.  For that I have a professional security service with expensive overpriced equipment for all doors and windows, smoke, fire, CO2, detectors, etc. and high monthly fees so that someone somewhere receives all the alarms 24\/7 and calls the police immediately.  That is a real security system.  For me these Blink cams are a peace-of-mind curiosity system. In that respect I think its going to serve me well.Your satisfaction will vary greatly according to your expectations for the Blink Mini cam and also the Blink Home app and also the Blink options for functionality, from 1. its the worst piece of crap ever made with the primary objective being to upsell amazon Alexa video devices and cloud video storage plans (oh, and unlocking almost all of the cam's functionality) to 2. its a really great product definitely worth the price so I want to get more.  Are you expecting a serious security system with unlimited live viewing and local storage of video with all the features they list for the system with a subscription and cameras with the latest, greatest resolution and features?  You will be in the first, very disappointed, category.  Are you looking for a curiosity cam that lets you check in on your place once in a while via your voice controlled echo, fire-tv stick or the Blink phone app for minimal cost?  You will be in the latter category, I love the Minis.  Are you looking for an inexpensive cam with off-site cloud storage and added, some might say needed, functionality provided by a low cost subscription?  You should be happy with the Blink Mini.ProEasy to setup and use with Blink app and Echo Show devices (although android app has some known issues that might cause some frustration during setup)When I had to call tech support because of an issue with the Blink app on Android, the wait was not too long and the rep was helpful and pleasantVery inexpensive way to drop in and check on a place momentarilyNo subscription or anything else needed for this basic functionalityWith or without a subscription these have good valueConAll features beyond live video feed require a subscriptionNo documentation included at all, you must search the web for everything you need help with or info aboutNo clear explanation of what you get without a subscription, in fact, purposely obfuscated as a marketing planNo clear explanation of what adding a sync module 2 will do for you if you only have Minis - not muchCheap 1080p video - its ok, it works, but we are going into 2023 so how about an upgrade to 2k this yearCheap minimal mounts that are intended for mounting on horizontal surfaces like a shelf and deficient adjustment for vertical surfaces like a wall (curiously the exact opposite of the outdoor cams that are intended to be mounted on a vertical wall and not good for horizontal mounting like under a soffit).  Had they made the mount a little longer it would have been so much better but it probably would've cost a couple cents more.To get the features you think you are getting you need the subscription. In Blink's defense, the subscription is currently reasonably priced and any serious security must include off-site storage of data (to prevent loss by fire or theft) or its just a curiosity system anyway. Their marketing approach for it is very poor though.Blink needs to step up to the same level of customer experience as Alexa devices provide.  And I think if you pay for prime it should include the Blink cloud subscription for up to 4 devices and only pay if you have more devices than that.  How about Bezos holding off giving away some of those billions and put it towards excellent customer satisfaction with its products and services.It should not be so purposely confusing as to what you actually get WITHOUT a subscription. Starting an automatic subscription upon setup of a camera to conceal the lack of functionality without out one until the 30 days has passed is a pretty shady business practice. Internet based tech companies get away with unchecked deception and shady practices as standard operating procedure, and its not just Blink, its all of them. Its too bad because for people who know exactly what they are getting, the Blink Minis are a great product even despite this.  I think it backfires on Blink by raising people's expectations very high only to find out 30 days later that they now have to start paying a fee to keep those features they thought were included with the purchase of the device.  And so they become haters of the product and company.  You can see this in many reviews.  This does not seem like a good long-term marketing plan to me.I hope this helps you make an informed decision whether to purchase the Blink Mini cams.  Now if you purchase them you can be very happy with them based upon your correct expectations of the product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2,025 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670112000000}
{"reviewTitle":"UPDATED: Confusing cloud storage policy on these smaller cameras, but great product once clarified","reviewDescription":"UPDATED: When I saw these smaller cameras announced I was excited and looked forward to adding them to my existing 5 camera Blink system. I figured these would be a great replacement for the XT\/XT2 cameras that I had inside my house so I could then re-purpose those for additional outdoor locations. I thought this was a brilliant addition to the Blink camera ecosystem, adding a lower cost camera for indoor applications like mine where the benefits of the battery power and weather-proofness would be overkill. Soon as they were released I ordered up a two-pack to add to my system. I installed one of the them and found that the picture quality right out of the box wasn\u2019t the best but once you change the video quality setting to \u201cEnhanced\u201d it\u2019s right up there with the XT2 quality. The motion detection is a little spotty, as they use a new digital method of detecting motion (AI compares one frame to the next to check for changes). Some very subtle movement will show up, like a shadow moving across the viewing area, but then actually walking across it won\u2019t (sometimes). A rep I spoke with said that they are working on an update to improve the consistency of that feature, which will be available as an over-the-air update since it is a digital-based feature, which I think is pretty cool. So originally my poor review was based around the cloud storage feature on these cameras. After I purchased these cameras I looked into the cloud storage feature as all of the literature I found on them stated that a subscription would be required. Since this is different than the previous XT & XT2 systems I was not pleased about this. After I posted my original review a rep from Blink reached out to clarify the cloud storage situation. So here is what I learned: If you already have an XT or XT2 system, then you can add these cameras to it without having to get a paid subscription. If you do not have a Blink system at all, and these cameras are the first ones you get, then you get a free subscription until December 31st, 2020; then you will pay $3\/month per camera after that. By then though, they plan to have released a new sync module with an SD card slot so that you can locally store video clips without having to pay for a subscription at all. Personally I don\u2019t think they intend to have too many people on the subscription plan, I think they see the SD card functionality being more of a selling point but they had to piggy-back the first adopters of these Mini cameras onto the cloud storage until the new sync module gets released. Maybe they had delays in getting the new sync module released at the same time as the Mini due to factory closings around the world right now. I am much happier after this getting cleared up, but hope that they update the cloud storage & subscription info on the product pages to make it much clearer how this all works. Had I looked at all of the available info before buying these, then I probably would not have purchased them based on the unclear info that\u2019s out there. In the end, the savior of the situation was the rep that contacted me from Blink. He clarified all of my concerns, gave me a great amount of info on the product, and answered all of my questions (I had lot of them). To be clear, the rep did not once ask me to change my review, take it down, or in any way artificially influence me to do any of those things. The great job he did led to me to change this of my own accord, as they really took care of my concerns. One star deducted for the confusion but three added back in for the great CS experience. Good product can get you a buyer, but good service gets you a customer for life. Blink has done a fantastic job turning a disappointed (and misinformed) buyer into a satisfied customer. So to recap, if you have an existing Blink system, buy these and use \u2018em where you don\u2019t need the wireless ones. If you are looking to get these as your first Blink setup, get them knowing you will have the option of paying for a subscription starting in 2021 or a one-time purchase of a sync module with SD card slot to store your video clips.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4,350 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1587081600000}
{"reviewTitle":"A good, basic camera","reviewDescription":"I live alone in a first-floor apartment, in a non-gated community, in an okay but not perfectly safe part of town.  I can't afford even a mid-price camera system and don't have much technical knowledge when it comes to hardware.  For the past several years, I've been using Wyze cameras to peek in on my dog while I'm gone, see who's approaching my front door, and even keep an eye on and talk to maintenance workers in my apartment when I'm not there.  But recently Wyze had a pretty big failure affecting most of their customers.  Cameras went offline for hours on end, no one could log into their accounts, and (worst of all) communication was nonexistant.  I hated not being able to check on my dog or see that my home was safe that day, so I started looking for other options, and Blink minis looked like a comparable solution. (To be fair, I've been using Wyze since 2017, and I've only run into whole system issues like this twice in that time.)Rather that replace all my Wyze cams at once, I decided to to get a few Blink minis and set them up for double-coverage in the areas most important to me -- front and back doors, and my dog.  I set a price watch on the Blink minis, hoping to get them at a sale price, and sure enough, I was soon alerted to a 3 for $40 deal and grabbed it. I fumbled a little in setting them up, not understanding the networks that were trying to connect, but I eventually guessed my way through it and got the first camera working.  Oddly enough, Wyze had another big system failure right in the middle of all this, so getting all 3 Blinks going last night has already paid off.  As for how the Wyze and Blink systems compare...The Blink mini and the app are a little lacking, to be honest, at least when compared with Wyze.  Both cameras have motion detection, night vision, and 2-way audio, as well as an available $10\/mo subscription plan (to save clips from an unlimited # of cameras).  But while Wyze cameras allow you to continuously record to micro SD without a subscription or additional expense, Blink mini will only record clips to SD if you spend another $50 on their Sync module.  A Blink subscription, however, will record 10-second clips when it detects motion and save them for 60 days on the cloud, no SD card required. (10 seconds is the default. I finally found the setting to change it to 30 seconds, which is the max.) But a Wyze subscription will automatically record longer clips, anywhere from 12 seconds to however long the motion continues (at least a couple of minutes, from what I've seen) and store them on the cloud for 2 weeks.  So while Wyze doesn't store them as long, they do record ALL the motion, even if it goes way longer than 30 seconds.  Plus, Blink requires a 10-second break between clips, whereas a Wyze subscription just immediately starts recording, even if it's only been a couple of seconds since the previous motion ended.Additionally, Blink just isn't as feature-rich as Wyze.  Blink has person detection if you're on a subscription plan.  Wyze does, too, but Wyze also has package detection, friendly face recognition, and pet detection.  So if you want Wyze to notify you when someone drops a package at your door but not if someone just walks by, it can.  Blink can't do that.  Wyze also allows you to set rules and schedules.  For example, I have my Wyze cams scheduled to turn on notifications Mon-Fri at 7:30am (when I leave for work)  and turn them off at 6:30pm (when I get home). The cameras are still on and recording motion clips to save on the cloud 24\/7, but they're not sending unnecessary notifications when I'm home.  Meanwhile, every moment, still or motion, is recorded to SD card -- and I didn't have to spend $50 on another module.  With Blink, I can only schedule times for the cameras to be on and looking for motion, or I can snooze the notifications for up to 24 hours, but I can't actually schedule it not to send notifications at specific times.So what's the verdict?  Blink mini is a good, basic camera at an affordable price, especially if you wait for it to go on sale.  The $10\/mo subscription is worth it to save video clips, and the picture\/video quality is good.  If you're already deep in the Amazon ecosystem with Ring doorbells, Echos, etc., then the Blink mini is a nice little addition.  But if you're not already devoted to Amazon devices for the home, Wyze offers more for essentially the same price.  All that said, I'm not disappointed with my purchase.  These 3 Blink minis allow me to keep an eye on things even on the rare occasion that Wyze fails me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713398400000}

{"reviewTitle":"High quality video and audio, good mount, no batteries to change, but the \"Talk\" feature is useless","reviewDescription":"I have several of both the Minis and the outdoor models, and this Mini is almost identical to the outdoor and indoor models in terms of quality and features. The only real difference between them is the Mini isn't weather-proof, cannot handle the extreme temperatures of the outdoor models (-4 to 113 F), has a better mount, can be image-flipped, and runs solely on a power adapter instead of batteries.* Not Weather-proof: DO NOT use this mini camera outdoors or in an uninsulated building. It is not water-proof and will likely be damaged by humidity and high or low temperatures.* Mount & Image Flipping: this mount is great and allows easier installation locations than the indoor and outdoor cameras, because it's mounted from the bottom\/top instead of the back.  Since this Mini can be mounted from the bottom or top, this means it can be turned at many more angles on all 3 axes than the Indoor\/Outdoor. If you have to mount it upside-down, such as from a ceiling, the app simply allows you to flip the image vertically. The problem with the indoor\/outdoor models is the mounting is on the back, which means you can't \"hang\" it from a ceiling and point it in any direction. Instead, if you want to mount the Indoor\/Outdoor on a ceiling or near the ceiling, you have a very small angle to point it. This makes the Indoor\/Outdoor cameras inconvenient to install from above in most situations because you'll end up having to point the camera directly outward from your mounting surface. If from a ceiling, it'll face down. If from the top of a wall, it'll face outward along the ceiling. The Mini's mount is much better.CONS:* The \"Talk\" feature is totally useless. Regardless of bandwidth or proximity to the router or a sync module (purchased separately), the Talk feature produces broken sound that is impossible to understand. Plus there's a long delay of 3-6 seconds, making this feature useless for conversations, even if the other person understood anything you were saying. Over several tests with all of our different Blink cameras, none of them produce clear enough speech that someone can understand you, no matter where the cameras are located.* No wired Ethernet option. This camera can only be used with a wireless router and Internet connection. There are no other options.* Cannot be used as a USB web cam* Cannot be used for continuous live feeds. The live feed only allows up to 30 seconds of viewing, and you must hit a Continue button every 30 seconds to keep it going. So if need a camera to leave running for frequent live video, Blink isn't what you're looking for.* Cloud Storage Subscription semi-requirement: the Blink Home Monitor App's features become limited if you don't purchase a cloud storage subscription. If you stick with the Sync Module for local storage and do not purchase any of the cloud storage plans, VIDEO CLIPS CANNOT BE VIEWED THROUGH THE APP. The app will only allow you to view the live feed, adjust camera settings, and use the Talk feature. Without a cloud storage subscription, the only way to view your camera's video clips is by physically taking your USB storage device (purchased separately) out of the Sync Module (purchased separately) and placed in a USB port on a computer (purchased separately).To be very clear here, if you do not purchase a cloud storage subscription, you will not be able to view any of the stored video clips (including motion-activated clips) from your phone. Period. This point has not been made clearly anywhere in the advertisements, support screens, Amazon product pages, or Blink Web site, but it's a crucial piece of information that the company is being very ambiguous about.To repeat, IF YOU DON'T PURCHASE A CLOUD STORAGE SUBSCRIPTION, YOU CANNOT VIEW YOUR VIDEO CLIPS THROUGH YOUR PHONE. I have seen some reviewers assert that this isn't technically possible, but as a software engineer I know this isn't true. The Blink developers clearly focused on developing the cloud storage and subscriptions, using the mobile app as the user's \"portal\" app to access and view the cloud-stored video clips, and have simply decided not to develop a mechanism for the mobile app to access the video clips stored in your Sync Module. I want to be very clear here....this IS POSSIBLE and would require a lot of development to accomplish, but Blink just doesn't provide this functionality (yet). Whether they are working on this feature and plan to add it in the future is unknown. But the lack of direct integration between the mobile app and the Sync Module's local storage (over the local network, especially) is a significant shortcoming in the entire Blink system. This also means that if your camera loses its internet connection, it will not capture video, you can't view the live feed, the Talk feature won't work, and you can't change the camera's settings.. The Blink system simply does not allow the mobile app to connect directly to a camera or Sync Module on your local network. It is designed to use the Internet only. This is a very important point that customers must understand. Both the camera and the Sync Module require an active Internet connection to function. They will not work independently or with just a wifi router. Internet is required.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"268 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1618876800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Working Much Better Than at First","reviewDescription":"I bought 4 Blink Mini cameras, including one pan and tilt unit, plus two Blink Wired Floodlight Cameras, a Video Doorbell, and a Sync Module 2 with flash drive.I originally cursed Blink cameras with a flaming one-star review because all of my Minis would stop recording at least once a day at random times every day. Live view still worked, but they stopped detecting motion and therefore stopped recording until they were power cycled. This rendered them essentially useless as security equipment. Blink support reached out to me, requesting that I grant them access to my cameras' log files, and they also sent me a single new Mini to replace any one of the cameras, to determine if it was a hardware issue.I was very skeptical of this being an isolated hardware issue, unless there was an entire bad run of cameras, since all were effected. Note that Blink did not specify that any particular unit be replaced. After just replacing the Mini in my garage, the entire system performed vastly better. I only knew for sure of one missed motion event, and since the replacement I have not had to power cycle any of the cameras.The odd thing about this incident is that even Blink support could not explain what made the system start working when one Mini was replaced at random. I had assumed that they had tweaked something at their end, but apparently that was not the case.Night vision has a couple of issues. Even at the lowest setting of the IR LEDs, at close range peoples faces tend to look blank because of the strong glare. A brighter setting allows you to see further away in the dark, but makes glare at close range much worse. Also, switching from night vision to color mode when a light is turned on or an outside door is opened to daylight, it takes at least 5 seconds to adjust, during which the image is washed out white.When using local storage instead of a cloud storage subscription, access to the recorded videos is very slow. It can take 20 to 30 seconds for a clip to start playing when clicked. With a subscription, playback is almost instant.For now, I am quite pleased with the system I have. It does have a few shortcomings compared to other camera systems, but for the price and the ability to record video locally without a paid subscription, it's a pretty good deal.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693872000000}

We mainly use them to check on our dog (love the voice feature for this reason) and also for peace of mind when we're at work. Then we moved and forgot to put them back up for a while, so we set them up with the free subscription. Aftet that expired came the problems. The issue isn't the cameras--it's the system glitch that won't let us connect Blink to an Amazon account. The system says the Amazon email is already linked to a Blink account, which it isn't, neither on the Blink app nor on Amazon subscriptios. And to get the subscription, you have to link the two, but when trying to link the two, it says the Amazon email is linked, so you can see the problem. The customer service is trash. They couldn't figure it out and told us to sign up for a different Amazon account, which seems ridiculous to set it up just for Blink. I responded as much and said I would contact Amazon to see if they could sort it or else cancel my Blink plan, and the customer service rep just said, \"thanks, have a nice day; we're closing this ticket.\" So essentially a snarky customer service version of the middle finger. I'm not actually sure they even read my complaint given that the different colored text in the email suggests they copy-pasted the salutation and automated response from two different sources. I'm posting here because come to find out, other people have had this same issue. There are entire online forums of people complaining, but Blink apparently doesn't care.

It goes off of wi-fi so that was fine with us because we live in a small town and aren\u2019t worried about the hacking issues people concern themselves with. You can watch past clips which is okay, but I don\u2019t really understand the random clips because they aren\u2019t always by motion (some times literally nothing is happening). My huge issues with this and why I rated it so low are a few things. First off the light on the camera is bright it also makes a click sound when it turns on (so basically any time you want to view your baby) which almost seems to wake her up a lot of the time. For example in this photo she got up and looked right at the camera because of it. They also have it where I\u2019d you want it playing in the background in your room while you sleep to check up on, you just can\u2019t. Extended mode as they call it can only go 90 minutes and if you want that feature you have to pay. I paid for a $20 camera before and this feature you could watch the baby all night long and never has to pay their premium. It\u2019s probably a nice camera for security stuff, just don\u2019t buy it for the nursery. There are better options out there.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690329600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Decent for the price, motion detection and cloud recording not so hot","reviewDescription":"These little cameras are decent for the price. Setup is straightforward and you can get them up and running pretty quickly. The main downside concerns the motion detection and the cloud recording design. Other cameras I've used have better motion detection, as oftentimes this camera will fail to detect motion and thus not record even though I know motion has occurred. With other cameras this wouldn't be a big deal as most other cloud recording systems allow you to continuously record ALL video from the camera, 24\/7, whether motion has occurred or not, and then you can go back through the footage to see what happened even if the camera itself didn't mark something as being motion. With the Blink cameras recording only happens if the camera detects motion. So, no motion detection, no recording. There's no way to set them up for continuous recording.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1715558400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Limited use for my purpose","reviewDescription":"My blink mini was an add on to an echo show on prime day.  I added my mini to a sync2 module which was included in my blink indoor camera kit.  The addition of the mini went smooth, it updated the firmware and added it to my system.  The firmware was updated.Plus -  Plug in camera with no batteries.  A different system of motion detection which works through windows at night.  Alexa integration lets you see live view on your echo show or your TV via Firestick with alexa  Scheduled arming seems to work, it can follow an entered schedule.Minus -  If you currently have a schedule in the system and turn off scheduled arm slider from the system settings page on the fire app and try to arm from the main page, the mini doesn't arm.  It is like the sync2 module never sent the command to the mini, in fact the date didn't even change at the end of the camera parameter page.  The date and time changed on my indoor and outdoor, just not the mini.  I found the only way to fix this was to delete the entire schedule, then hit arm from the main page and the mini started capturing motion again.  So the pause function for the schedule didn't work.  If you turn off the microphone on the mini, the echo show could no longer show you a live view of the mini via alexa,  turn it back on and everything works.  The motion detection through a window doesn't work in the daytime, but seems to work at night with night vision turned off, based on car headlights coming up the drive,  but during the daytime it isn't even triggered  by a mail truck coming up the driveway or a person carrying a package up the driveway.Overall \u2013 it has decent resolution.  While using through a window, I was disappointed it could not detect motion in the daytime but happy it can detect headlights at night with the night vision off.  You should note I am using the mini via the sync2 hub, and I think most people will use this directly without the sync2.  I used the sync2 in hopes of local storage which seems to just consist of a daily backup from the cloud to the USB drive.  Also note the app was running on a Fire tablet.  I plan to retest on a phone to see if the glitch is due to the application or the camera.  Anyways since it couldn't see a delivery truck driving up my driveway, I replaced it with a camera that could.  So if you are trying to catch deliveries during the pandemic, forget this one.  My other camera by someone else, in the same position through a window, triggers an alert if the poodle across the street comes out of their house, and of course a giant mail delivery truck.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1605398400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty good cameras","reviewDescription":"Overall, they are pretty good cameras.  The price seems fair for what you get, the features of the cameras and the app are good, and the picture during the day is really good, usually, but the night vision leaves a little bit to be desired.  Even on the high setting, the IR is not bright enough to make out anything across the room.  As for cons, to start, I have noticed on multiple occasions that when the lighting changes, the camera does not always automatically adjust to the current lighting which makes it miss out on recording some movement that it should have caught.  I can bring up the live view on my phone and that will force it to immediately adjust, otherwise, after a little while, it will finally catch up.  The next con is the loud relay inside the camera that clicks when it detects motion and starts to record.  I know there are solid-state relays out there that will do the job without the noise, so this is disapointing.  And lastly, with a company as big as Blink (Amazon), why do they not have the app for the cameras available for a PC??  I get it that probably most people are content with using their phone, but there are folks like me that would like to be able to access my Blink cameras on my laptop without having to install some RAM and processor hogging 3rd party software that will allow me to run the Android app  on my laptop.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716681600000}

I get that it's an indoor camera, but based on the reviews and videos posted from buyers, I assumed it would work well for this. Well, it doesn't. First of all, the motion detection doesn't go off if someone is walking right outside my window even with the sensitivity all the way up. It only goes off when cars drive by and the clip that saves only shows up until the motion stops, which is useless to me since it won't even pick up when people are walking by and just shows when they pull up in their car and ends the clip. Second, the night vision has a huge glare even when I put it in an open window with no screen or anything in front of the lens. It makes it impossible to see anything and won't even set off the motion detector when a car goes by because it can't even pick up anything but a glare. You can purchase an outdoor security camera for the same price that will be more reliable. Don't waste your money if you're planning on putting this in a window to surveillance outside.

{"reviewTitle":"Functionality intentionally stripped without subscription","reviewDescription":"Updated March 2024: My trial subscription is now over, and I see just how lame these cameras are. They are about as useful as a baby monitor, even with the sync module. They strip the cameras of useful remote functionality merely to force you into their subscription plan. If you see below, I purchased these to avoid subscriptions. Even having the add-on sync module gives you almost zero useful remote functionality. The recording of live views is disabled. Why? This is just greed on Amz's part to get more on-going revenue. Stay away from these poor-video, expensive subscription, function-stripped cameras.Original review: First off, I got this camera because I want no monthly fee. The app allows me to use the camera for free, so I got what I wanted. You can block out about 5% of the picture at a time (20 blocks) to disallow motion tracking, so it's \"OK\" for that; other cameras allow you to draw your own \"do not track motion here\" box (which is bad if you have more than one area to block) or boxes (which is the best option). The picture is OK, but only that. If something is close to the camera, it is clear, but the further away, the harder it is to see anything. After about 15 to 20 feet, you're just going to see a color and a movement. Lastly, there is a definite fisheye around the edges. I would have preferred a narrower field of view that was clearer.

It represents a major fault in the system that owners do not, and will not tolerate. This is for security and safety. If we are telling you that your product is not working and alerting us like it needs to, then, instead of making excuses, you need to fix it.

They do get a good picture, but you are stuck with their app and cloud service, which makes them a really poor choice for security cameras.First off, you can only stream one camera at a time in the app, and only for 30 seconds at a time. You can keep extending it every 30 seconds for up to 5 minutes unless you pay for the service and even then you can still only stream 1 at a time, just for a few minutes more. There is no pc software and they aren't compatible with any pc software that I could find.When the cameras are triggered, only 1 can be recorded to the cloud at a time. If you have one at the front door and one at the back door and both are triggered, only the first one gets recorded and no other camera can record until the motion stops for that camera, and then it will start recording the next triggered camera, but never more than one at a time.They also don't support rtsp or onvif, so you can only use their app to view live video and the only other app I found that will support them can only get 1 frame per second from their cloud service.Even at $5 a piece, these aren't useful enough to be worth the money. Don't waste your time and money on these. There are plenty of choices in the same price range that get an equally good picture and support rtsp and onvif so they can be easily added to 3rd party camera software, and all of the cameras will be active, and able to be viewed and recorded, all the time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697673600000}

To me, that makes all the difference in the worldThe reviews are true - This camera, if it even does connect, does not stay connected for long.  It is the only camera on my Blink system that disconnects itself.  I've ran every test possible with Blink Support and still, the issue persists.  I actually have another mini on my system that works just fine, along with a few other wireless cameras.  I am convinced that some of these cameras are faulty in some way or another that does not allow for it to stay connected.  Often times when inputting the correct password and trying to connect to the proper 2.4ghz band, the app will tell me it cannot connect because the password might be wrong.  I am not as tech savvy as some people out there but I know enough to know that this camera has an issue.  I was finally able to get a partial refund from Amazon but not before going crazy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"40 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683676800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Fantastic camera with a minor audio issue","reviewDescription":"Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I recently purchased the Blink Mini compact camera during the Black Friday sale and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed. Setting up this camera was a breeze, and I was able to get all six cameras up and running throughout my house in no time.The camera quality is excellent, providing clear and sharp video footage. I particularly appreciate the automatic recording feature, which starts recording as soon as I view the camera. This has been incredibly useful for monitoring my home\u2019s security.However, there is one minor issue that I hope Blink can address in future updates. When using the camera\u2019s speaker to listen, I noticed a slight static noise and feedback from ambient sounds. While it doesn\u2019t significantly impact the camera\u2019s overall performance, it would be great if Blink could find a way to eliminate this audio interference.Despite this small audio hiccup, I am still very satisfied with the Blink Mini compact camera. It offers great value for the price, and its ease of use and impressive video quality make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their home security.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1702425600000}

{"reviewTitle":"High Quality, low price","reviewDescription":"I usually like to add pictures to my reviews but honestly they're EXACTLY as pictured. The quality seems great. I'm giving 4 stars because I don't love that you can't view back any footage unless you pay for a plan. Not super sure I want to commit to a lifetime of payments just to be able to look back at footage. Also, the motion detection works GREAT however I gave that portion of the review 3 stars because I'd like better technology that didn't alert you of every single movement. Like I had it set up in the livingroom to watch my kids while I worked in the office but it would send an alert every time a child moved an inch but if I turned the alerts off then it stopped recording all together... I just want to be able to see \"who hit who\" lol not that I want my kids fighting but you know, I just want to be able to get the truth out of the tattles or whatever but I can't physically watch the screen constantly and I can't have my phone getting 374829 alters because someone couldn't get comfortable. I was hoping it would just continously record 24\/7 or until I turned it off, then I could look back and watch the footage as needed. I'd pay the monthly fee for that. Maybe it's user error, maybe it's not the right system for me for that specific purpose. I think I'll move the cameras to a different location in the house to serve a different purpose; such as point them directly at my doors to receive an alert only when someone walks in\/out. Overall I would absolutely recommend these cameras or even gift them to a friend that expressed a need for them. I definitely think you're getting a great product for your money.Almost forgot, the night vision works almost as good as the day time. Also, one last thing, I'm not a fan of the blue light that shows when the camera is on... my kids have figured that part out, however I think it's a good safety feature in the event of someone else accessing the camera. I wish there was a way to disable the blue light at times, like stealth mode but meh, it's fine.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670112000000}

Decent picture quality, reasonable motion detection and with the hub purchased from another Blink product we can save video's locally to an attached USB drive. Overall, for the cost of the devices, they are a decent value. Integration with the app was pretty painless, connect them to power, scan the QR code and setup took less than 5min per camera. They will check and update their firmware if there is an update available during setup. Accessing the cam from the app is also simple as long as you have decent internet connectivity. Remotely viewing cameras and or stored clips is also simple as opening the app and selecting a camera or clip. In the last 5 weeks since buying and installing these indoor cams I haven't had any problems with them.

It worked well to ease my anxiety even if there would be very little I could do about it if something did happen, I always fear that I'l come home to some disaster on the drive back across the state to get home. Now I was able to at least monitor the home and know things were more or less fine. For the price, it was absolutely perfect for this.I have tried to find some more uses for this afterwards and had mixed to poor results. I couldn't get this thing to look out a window because there's a little 'active' light that turns on when you access the light. So, it would reflect brightly against the glass at night and the nightvision couldn't see outside at all. So, I had no way to set it up to spy on our backyard and see if we were getting raccoon or skunks or possums.  The light is somewhat recessed behind glass\/plastic as well so I couldn't even cover it up with tape, it would just shine around the tape. Somewhat frustrating but not the main use of the device anyway, so whatever. The base is also pretty unsteady in any kind of non-flat surface, would probably require mounting in any sort of complex set up whatsoever.I do wish they would let you turn these lights off or do something to fix that, but I suppose there's a privacy risk for others. As is, I recommend this for a simple use, but you may want another product for a more robust plan of use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708560000000}
{"reviewTitle":"THE BEST SECURITY FOR THE PRICE","reviewDescription":"As a father of 2 I'm going to give you my complete unbiased opinion on this camera and let you decide.PROS: So easy to set up. Only time I looked at the directions was to see the app I needed to download. I love the 1080p and the Night Vision is great of set up correctly. Live video feed to my phone is wonderful and even has a 2 way microphone.The camera armed continuously sends you out alerts \u26a0\ufe0f as long as motion is going on. ( PLEASE NOTE THAT WHEN YOU FIRST ARM THE CAMERA YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE FOOTAGE TAKES PLACE AFTER THE MOTION HAS BEEN DETECTED, THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO THINK \" OH WELL ITS TO LATE IF SOMEONE BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE\" YOU CAN GO INTO THE SETTINGS AND CHAGE IT TO ALERT YOU AS SOON AS THE MOTION HAS BEEN DETECTED ) very inexpensive and magnificent for it's price. HOWEVER!!!CONS: YOU MUST PLAY AROUND WITH THE SETTINGS. what do I mean by that? The camera comes default 720p and the Night Vision is low quality. You need to go into settings and change that. The same with the motion detection you need to go in and adjust that. Things that can't be adjusted are what aggravate me the most such as, the speaker used in the 2 way is not lowed whatsoever. It was Night time and my son had his tablet on low and he couldn't hear me talking even though the volume was set to max. The livestream keeps asking me if I'd wish to continue watching what feels like every 5 seconds and if you look away just for a sec and\/or don't click continue in time the live feed cuts off. Sometimes it's hard to get the live feed back up and you have to force close the app. The Night Vision after adjusting it in settings is wonderful as long as there are no reflective or even somewhat reflective surfaces near it. I had min place on the top of the cabinet and the white surface of the cabinet distorted the feed and wasn't real able to see passed it. Once I moved it to have it rest on a darker none reflective spot it worked like a dream.OVER ALLI really do love this little camera. I feel like a good majority of the stuff I dislike about it could be fixed with and update. The only thing that I would suggest changing in the next model is a significantly louder speaker so my kids could hear me. The live feed being cut short could be updated to continue to play as long as the app is open. Yes I get they're probably trying to save us data or battery life on out phones but that doesn't matter to us when we're checking on whatever we care enough to protect which is the whole purpose of buying a security camera. I really do love this little camera and I do highly recommend buying it. It does have its flaws but over all its the best I've ever seen at this price point.That you for taking the time to read my review.

{"reviewTitle":"Very good for the price -  a few caveats","reviewDescription":"This camera will function well for me.  I do like the cloud service, but I don't think I will continue with it after the trial period is up.  I don't have high expectations for this camera, so keep in mind my ratings are me specific.  If you have higher expectations do more research to ensure these will work as you need.  I just wanted a cheap way to ensure if someone lurks around\/breaks in, I have a chance at catching an image of who they are.A few things to think about:1. You must have working Wi-Fi with an Internet connection.  This sounds stupid, but my modem went out the other day, so I still had a working Wi-Fi network, but that is not good enough.  While my Hue lights still worked without working Internet, my Blink cameras did not.If you want hard core security cameras, these aren't going to be your best option. Someone could very easily kill your cameras without even having to go inside your house\/business.2. While I haven't tried it yet, I believe your recordings go to the Blink servers even when you don't have a subscription.  They mention you can backup the clips set off by movement, but given it \"backs those clips up once daily by default\" to the thumb drive attached to the Sync Module 2, it must be temporarily storing those clips on their server (which is why you would need the Internet - See point 1 above).  So if it bothers you that Amazon will still have access to those clips, you may want to investigate other options.3.  Think about how where to install the cameras.  It actually does better when someone\/something moves across the field of vision as per their instructions.  They are correct.  What I mean by this is imagine you are looking at a device screen.  It works best if the image moves across the screen from left to right or right to left.  Coming straight at the camera doesn't set it off as quickly as I would expect.  While the camera I have can see the sidewalk out by the street, I was practically at the door before it started recording.  So you have to think about how to get the motion detection to get the camera to start recording while at the same time having a good angle to get a good picture of a person's face.  -- I haven't tried to see if there are some sensitivity options to try to get the camera to go off sooner.4. They need to provide a longer cord.  I was going to install it to the ceiling to get the \"right\" angle to cover two doors close to one another.  Even if I went straight from the outlet to the ceiling, the cord isn't long enough to then mount to the ceiling.  Trying to get it to move into the corner was impossible.Again, I am going for low cost security.  I really just wanted to make sure no one is coming up to the door when we aren't around.  If I had great security concerns, I would keep exploring other options.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1621814400000}

Overall it works fairly well, but the system stops recording motion every morning at sun up. In order to make it work, I have to open the app once it's daylight, disarm and re-arm before it will capture any motion at all - even if someone rings the doorbell, it will NOT record if I haven't done the daily reset. Sometime this daily reset requires me turning off all the individual motion detectors and then putting them back on, before it will start recording again. For a service that costs me $10 a month, I'm frustrated that I have to babysit it each day. Once it starts \"working\" again, it will work perfectly until the sun comes up the next day. So weird and so annoying.I've noticed other viewers complaints that mention the cam doesn't always detect human motion - I have discovered that detecting humans\/dogs at a distance (my cams are about 20 ft\/6m from the sidewalk) only happens when the exterior temp is above 50F\/10C - it seems that the human body temp is not readable if they are wearing heavy coats or generating body heat, but on warmer days, there's never an issue detecting at a 20 foot\/6 meter distance.The zone section works well - I was able to block out neighbor's Christmas lights, which were setting the cams off every minute.Set up with the App and installing on the porch and doorframe was very simple.My only real complaint is needing to reset the cameras every single morning - no exceptions unfortunately.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703721600000}

{"reviewTitle":"There are no good cameras","reviewDescription":"I'm at a loss. We've had two different \"pet\" cameras for a similar cost, and while they've had their issues leading to me looking else where after a bit of use, Blink is just as bad in its own way.This one was for indoor use, and doorbell was for outdoor (less about the doorbell, more about finally having a camera that works at night) plus needing the sync module that came with it. I didn't want to get trapped in their subscription so I cancelled the trial immediately to know what it would look like with the sync module and local storage. It's kind of weird that it's a USB when, again, cheaper pet cameras have better SD card options but I'll take what I can get here to try. Plenty of people have covered how it's a ploy to get you to have their subscription that you can't record live view (ie, you get a notification about motion, watch it, someone's breaking into your house, but because you're watching it live it doesn't save) but I didn't get my cameras for notifications. We have too much street traffic for motion detection to matter.That being said, I do WANT motion detection. But the doorbell doesn't do this consistently for humans in the least, and the Mini won't stay connected to the internet long enough to watch even me walk inside. All the cars when I had the doorbell out front? Totally. The raccoon that walked two feet in front of it? Super delayed on when it started to record, but sure. When I walk in my own drive way? Nah. I have to be moving the camera to be recorded. I drove ALL THE WAY up my driveway (it's long) and it didn't start recording until my car was halfway in the garage. I get that some of the issue may have to do with \"battery saving\", but I feel like I'm asking for the bare minimum when it comes to proper recordings.The Wi-Fi connection also almost makes no sense to me, specifically for the Mini. The doorbell has worked on the front door, and on the garage which again is looong and quite a ways from the house. But the Mini? Works in one place in the house. And not even at the halfway point of what the doorbell works with. Even the cheapo pet cameras I mentioned had better Wi-fi connectivity in ALL the positions I tried in the house.I think the Mini probably has a chance of recording more consistently than the Doorbell, but the Doorbell is the one that stays connected to the Wi-fi. Like I'm considering using the doorbell inside when we go places (I literally haven't bothered mounting it with how much inconsistency there's been). But I really finally wanted something for outside, too.I'm tired. I'm not even someone totally needing this for feeling like our house is safe and yet it IS supposed to be a security system. For me it's more to keep an eye on neighbors who keep using our yard for stuff but I would really, really love something that works for peace of mind for the unknown, too.

I should have bought Nest or Kasa, much more bang for your buck.Update 10\/29\/21I have managed to get units to record to the USB flash drive on the Sync 2.  I have also found that occasionally the cameras switch to a black and white mode, which I have seen this in their camera snapshot and in some recordings - not sure how\/why this happens.  Also, the camera, on a few occasions, said that it detected motion when there was none.  I'll have to play with sensitivity to see if maybe just a dust particle triggered it.I have not found out what happens when USB flash drive is full - does recording fail or does it start writing over oldest clips.Saying it has Alexa compatible interface is quite a stretch.  The only thing you get is audible notification of motion detected by a given camera.  There is no way to turn video recording on remotely via their App.  Hence one cannot do so via Alexa either.I have noticed that \"Live View Streaming seems delayed by about 2.5 seconds as compared to its less than 1 second when I had the 30 day trial of their basic plan.As to reliability, I wonder about the longevity of the cameras.  Of my initial order of 2 cameras, one was defective.  I had no trouble with replacement as Amazon interceded and shipped me new ones without waiting to receive defective ones.  This brings up an issue for all customers that purchase a combined multiple item shipment.  If one or more items is defective (less than total number of items in bundle) there is no way  of just getting the defective item replaced.  I've read reviews where others have had this situation and have to return all items before replacement is sent out.  This is a shortcoming of online purchasing.I am upping rating to 2 stars (I give  it a 2.5 which you cannot pick).  If it wasn't for the inconsistency with motion detection and cameras switching to black and white for no reason, I'd give product 3 stars.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1635465600000}

In reality, 95% of action needing to be monitored will take much longer than 30 seconds, the retrigger option should be 0! The shortest possible for retrigging the camera is 10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't record. Say a cat enters the room and leaves. I'll be lucky if the camera captures one or the other, or either time at all.I am definitely not happy that there is zero sound detection. As a Deaf person, this is a must. Not all sound will have a motion. I do not recommend this as any type of security camera system at all.I got these cameras (6 total) during the Black Friday deal.

I still bought them and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy I did but I\u2019m also not sad about it. I decided not to subscribe and they still work, but with no features.The night vision doesn\u2019t work great if you are pointing these out a window to view outdoors. It shines on the glass making a very bright reflection so you that you cannot see outside. This would happen with any camera though so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really a big negative. If you use it as intended (not pointed at a reflective surface) it works great! You can adjust the brightness in camera settings.The way you run the cord through the base and then clip it together is the worst design. I hope whoever designed it has to install 1000 of these every day for the rest of their life\u2026 it comes apart constantly even without touching it\u2026 be prepared to swear if you need to try and perch this somewhere difficult to reach.I\u2019m annoyed with paying subscription fees to use basic features. *This is the biggest drawback in my opinion, but I obviously knew about it when I purchased the product so\u2026\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fPositives I stuck it outside my window all winter through negative temps (I\u2019m in the Rocky Mountains and it gets COLD) and it still worked perfectly!Basically you plug it in, point it _(fight with the base for 10 minutes) and connect with the app. It\u2019s very simple to use.Without a subscription, you can still use it to check the live view and you can screen record if you wanted too (no sound though with the screen record).To be honest I never check the cameras anymore, and without alerts about motion detection, it\u2019s not really good for security.That being said, I moved one of mine to my bird cage so I can check in on my lil guy during the day while I\u2019m away.\ud83d\udc96\ud83e\udd9cit works great for this odd purpose so that\u2019s an unexpected bonus!I probably wouldn\u2019t buy again because I want to be able to save my clips without a subscription fee, and I\u2019d rather have like a \u201cpersonal system\u201d that isn\u2019t collecting my data and that I could control access too.

{"reviewTitle":"Cameras are fine, but the software is junk.","reviewDescription":"The blink app itself is the real problem.  The cameras are mostly fine. The quality of the images is really not bad, same for sound.  But the cameras all sync up through the blink app, which is garbage.First of all, the single most useful thing for these cameras would be to sense when you leave the home, and turn on then. Since the phone is the key to the cameras, and it already knows when you go, there is no reason beyond lazy programming that you can't have options of <when *designated device(s)* are not at *home geofence*, turn on; when returned, turn off>. But that would be useful.  So instead,  you have to remember to do it manually whenever you leave (which is more steps and time than I want, and not an easy habit to get into), and\/or set a timer.  In which case, you'd better have a pretty rigid schedule, otherwise the second the camera time starts, you're going to be inundated with notifications of your own movement until you turn it off, and now you're back to having to turn it on manually.  Also, added joy, since the last time change it gets confused on days (mine is set to turn on Tuesday through Saturday, but to this day, even after deleting and reprogramming,  does not activate on Saturday, does activate on Monday when I don't want it). It also has hard caps on how long it will record, even for continued action.  The max you can set it for is 30 second clips, after which it is tired and needs a nap before it can record another. I got these primarily for my dogs, when I got a rescue that needed training and work.  Many times it would pick up her getting startled by outside noises, and catch a bit of movement, and then cut out.  When the next clip started,  it featured a newly destroyed bit of furniture or wall or door frame. That crucial bit in between,  which you really needed to catch? Nah. Didn't get that.So, all told, set-up is easy, cameras look good, but when it comes down to practical purposes, really wish I had gone with another system that had better programmers.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707523200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Let\u2019s Be Honest Here!","reviewDescription":"I seriously think these Blink mini cams are way over hyped. Don\u2019t get me wrong they aren\u2019t totally worthless, but they have a few bad issues that make them not very desirable. First off, they are marketed as being 1080p, but I think once you have one for yourself, you will see that they are lucky to be 720p. And the night vision looks like it could have been from 20 year old tech. Not to mention that they have a bad habit of going offline quite often, like they just lose internet signals at random. Normally fixed by unplugging the power cord on the camera for a few seconds and plugging it back in so they will reboot back up. And if you ever have to call customer support, make sure you are clear about it being a (Blink) camera, because the calls also go to the (Ring) brand cameras customer support people and they will run you in the wrong direction. They definitely aren\u2019t worth the price of the subscription to keep all the backup memory stored. The camera stands are also an issue for me as they are made to only have the camera set at the same positioning. Meaning, if you wanted to mount them to the side of something, or the underside of something, the image would be upside down or sideways. They should have make the casing more diverse for right angle attachments and ways to maybe mount them to the underside of the windowsill top so they can be up out of the way while pointing out the window. Which leads me to also adding that if you do run them looking out of a window, the night vision will create a terrible glare on the glass making the recorded footage almost unusable. And when I said they aren\u2019t totally worthless, I mean they work great as a fake security camera. Haha.  They are more of a deterrent and less of a security measure.  As long as people think you are recording, they may think twice before doing something stupid. That is unless they read this review letting them know just how bad these Blink cams really are.  So,  would I suggest these to other people looking for a camera to post up? I gotta say No. plus, after a week of owning them, the novelty wears off. You just get to the point where you just don\u2019t feel like even checking out the recorded footage or checking out the live feed. So they just begin to collect dust. Nine times out of ten, it\u2019s just the cat setting off the camera. So you do get some nice close up videos of your cats face looking into the camera lens because they can hear the recording function start up.  Listen, I bought 2 of these about 9 or 10 months ago, and can say they just aren\u2019t worth all the hype they get. If it\u2019s cameras for security reasons that you need, I would suggest getting actual \u201csecurity\u201d cameras, And not these gimmicky units only the cats will like.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671321600000}

That site is terrible. I reached out again and sent me request for data form. If blink provides me with ip address or something going 100 miles south, I can reach out to law enforcement.

{"reviewTitle":"This Company Blink isn't it!!!!!!!","reviewDescription":"I have a doorbell with the protection box that slides on and secures to my front door. I also have the sync module with holder and usb. Finally, I have 3 indoor cameras.The cameras themselves were decent enough besides disconnecting when they wanted to and notifying about motion after the fact. The doorbell at night doesn't have a clear picture.Blink allows Amazon to sell other pieces of equipment like USB for storage, with their products. Then when theres an issue with said equipment there's nothing they can do besides giving me a smaller USB bc that's actually blink equipment. \ud83d\ude12 So in total I've had to receive a new doorbell camera, sync module USB and indoor camera. However I opted out of the camera bc by this time I was done with Blink systems.I cancelled my subscription because why would I pay for something that doesn't work properly.  They said my system would still work and store on the USB as long as I had the sync module. It's not saving on the local but on the cloud as if I had the subscription and it won't let me see the videos. I'm over it!I've been back and forth with Blink about their products over the past 2 years trying to find solutions but it would always end up not being long before I had to call again, even asking for a refund on their equipment that didn't work properly most of the time. Of course they told me there's nothing they can do about that and to take it up with Amazon since that's where I bought it but Amazon hasn't given me a refund.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1710720000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great for the price, but\u2026","reviewDescription":"The ten second pause between recordings is really frustrating. Bought this to monitor the litter box activity of each of my five cats for health reasons..needed to know how often one of them is urinating and the amount (for kidney function), how often and what volume\/consistency of another cat\u2019s BM\u2019S (for megacolon), and who might be sick as evidenced by diarrhea. Although we have one litter box per cat, it was impossible to know who was using which one, etc.  This camera helps immensely in this area, but the pause in between recordings means that sometimes (and often) a cat may finish and cover it\u2019s waste during that 10 seconds and I don\u2019t get to see what and how much they deposited. By the time we get home and multiple cats have used all the litter boxes randomly, we can\u2019t tell whose covered poop or pee is whose.Other than that, I love these cameras!!!  We have the plug-in models and it\u2019s simple and easy to plug one in, have the app see them instantly and ask you to label them, etc. and then it starts doing its thing. You can adjust each camera\u2019s settings individually as to length of clip, whether to continue recording the full designated length even if movement stops, sensitivity to motion, which areas \u201cin frame\u201d you don\u2019t want the camera to monitor (I.e. you have a fan going and its causing a curtain or plant or some such to flutter repeatedly which causes the camera to record clips endlessly, which then makes scrolling through thousands of clips to find what you need a time-consuming and tedious process. To this end, a helpful feature enables you to choose  which camera\u2019s clips you want to see, reducing the time it takes to find what you need to review. Other helpful features as well. Quality of videos and the night vision is decent.I think the price is a great value for what you get. You do have to have a subscription in most cases\u2026I can\u2019t remember why\u2026I think it has to do with the storage of thousands of clips for extended periods of time, but I could be wrong. I just remember that to get the full benefit of a camera monitoring system, you have to subscribe and pay monthly or yearly. I don\u2019t mind this since for now we can afford it. BUT I DO NOT LIKE THAT THEY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE SUBSCRIPTION EVERY YEAR AND CHARGE YOU WITHOUT NOTIFYING YOU AHEAD OF TIME AND ASKING IF YOU WANT TO RENEW. Therefore, it\u2019s  one of those subscriptions for which you\u2019d better set a reminder on your calendar at least 60 days prior to the renewal date, so that you can decide if you want to renew and have time to give the required advance notice of cancellation if that\u2019s what you choose.So basically, there are significant pros and cons in using this camera and subscription service.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688169600000}

I usually power cycle it every day. Or change some settings and change it back.  So not very reliable but otherwise I really like it and will continue to use it.On the positive side:As someone who has been writing software since 1982 I was impressed with the software interface.  It is first class and it is refreshing to see software moving forward not backward (which it sometimes does.)I used the camera as a window mount.  Blink does not sell at is such so take my review with that in mind.  Amazon sent me a reminder that I might want to buy a third party window mount.  I did so.As a window mount you have to fiddle with some settings to get it to work at night.  You need to set the Infra-Red settings to LOW, which is to basically turn if off.  I think there is another setting I may have adjusted to get it to work at night as a window mount.You have to pay for a subscription to its cloud storage.  You have 30 days to decide.  The subscription rates are low so if you like the camera I would buy it.WYZE has a camera that has better motion detection but lower software quality. It also has local storage (not subscription based cloud)  I tried the WYZE solution but started to get \"Operational Failures\" within six months. Probably trying to write to the SD card.

{"reviewTitle":"\"Continue?\" - I'm sorry for Amazon...","reviewDescription":"I was looking for a camera to monitor my 3D printer and naturally, because I enjoy my Echo devices, I was drawn to Blink as it is part of that ecosystem and so far I have really enjoyed Amazon products such as Alexa devices and AmazonBasics. The Blink camera is a massive disappointment, and I think I know exactly why it is the way that it is. The camera's feed can only be viewed for 30 seconds at a time, after which a popup button appears and asks you \"Continue?\" and in order to keep viewing the feed, you must press that otherwise the camera feed disconnects until you press the play button again. Amazon claims that it's to \"conserve bandwidth\" and I don't buy it. Right off the bat the app sets you up with a \"free\" 30 day trial. I say free in quotes because it's just another trial that must be canceled before it ends otherwise it just continues and charges you. Now, the app does tell you in very clear and easy to understand menus that you are going to be charged unless you cancel, but it is also a subscription that ends the moment you cancel it, as opposed to simply disabling automatic renewal but still letting you use the remainder of the trial. Here's the nail in the coffin, Amazon also states that \"Alexa enabled screen devices do not provide the Continue button and remain in Live View until the limit is reached.\" The Blink camera isn't trying to be an affordable wifi camera. It's primary purpose is to sell you a subscription and convince you to buy an Alexa-enabled Echo Show, as that device doesn't \"provide the Continue button.\"So, I'm writing this review as I am just now setting up my Wyze camera. I'm sending my Blink camera back to Amazon and I doubt they'll look at these reviews that expose their ulterior motives, but all I can say is that I'm sorry for them. They just lost another customer for their anti-consumer approach. You can't convince me that Amazon needs to save money by conserving bandwidth. Amazon is the 3rd richest company in the world. Amazon, you tell me why you have to save bandwidth by making an annoying popup that you can't disable, while Wyze, a company significantly smaller than you, is offering 14 DAY FREE cloud storage for both events and continuous recording, with the option to use an SD card for storage. That's the reality of this camera. One last time, Amazon, I am wholeheartedly disappointed in and sorry for you.

{"reviewTitle":"9.63 firmware Auto-Nightvision latchup bug","reviewDescription":"UPDATE: After almost 2 years, I picked up a pair during Prime Day deals. These are also the replacements for Amazon Cloud Cam owners, so I wanted to retest. In short, the EXACT same issue remains after all this time and thus you get no motion detection after an evening where the IR lights are no. These are not working, not fit for purpose and Blink refuses to or just plain can't fix the problem.These were a great deal. Plug-in mini-cams that would sync with my existing Blink XT Outdoor setup and that didn't break the bank. It was especially compelling since previous users of Blink had free cloud storage.The good:- Picture quality for the same money, these are MUCH better than the Wyze Cam v2.- Small and unobtrusive.- Audio in\/out is better than Wyze (although still not great)- Motion notifications are very fast.- Motion detection trigger is available for Alexa routines for other use (i.e. motion detect, turn on lights, make an announcement)The bad:- Critically, at least at firmware version 9.63, there is a bug where if the NightVision is left on Auto for a while, the camera will lock up and not detect motion when transitioning from Night to Day mode. It is a known bug that is acknowledged by Blink. Currently the only way to reset it is to perform a Disarm\/Arm. However, this is very bad for non-light controlled areas, say a garage. A Garage would typically be in Night mode with the doors close, but if the light turns on, the camera crashes. This renders the camera unfit for purpose.- Live streaming is limited on time. So use as a monitor is unavailable.- No geofencing. For an outdoor camera, geofencing generally isn't useful as you'd want the cameras to still be on while you're at home. But for an indoor camera, this is important without having to manually arm\/disarm the camera. The older Amazon Cloud Cams had this as an option and was great.- Integration with Alexa is extremely limited. There is no support for Routines. There is no support for Alexa Guard. Disabling cameras by voice is tedious (must say, \"Alexa, ask Blink to Disarm my Outside Front cameras, my pin is X X X X\". Alexa usually doesn't get it done.

{"reviewTitle":"Cloud cam was so much better","reviewDescription":"Absolute garbage. I'm guessing they weren't making enough $ charging a one time fee for the cloud cam (3X as much) and wanted to replace it with a subscription model. Ok. That's the unfortunate cost of business. At least replace it with a worthy successor. I guess I shouldn't have expected much at this price point even though there are similarly priced, better cams. The sensitivity settings and zones are terrible. They're either too sensitive and you have 300 clips and have to turn off notifications, or they're not sensitive enough and you don't get any, rendering it useless altogether and defeating the purpose. There's no middle ground. The quality is average at best, even during extremely bright daylight. Night vision through a window just reflects back on the cam and looks way better literally disabled. Set up was a lot of unnecessary question marks. Coming from an IT guy, they could've significantly reduced confusion regarding the devices abilities. Some features like live view are convenient but sort of impractical. If it's not a continuously recording camera then you rely on the accuracy of the motion sensors. If this camera recorded continuously my rating would be five stars and I couldn't be happier, but as it stands it's almost useless for its intended purpose. I'd never recommend this. I also don't understand how there's a blink AND a ring. I thought they owned both but maybe I misunderstood. I miss my cloud cam. I bought 5 of these. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676851200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty Disappointing","reviewDescription":"I bought one Blink camera to try out before replacing all of my Zmodo\/Meshare cameras. I'm glad I didn't replace all of them right off the bat. The hardware is elegantly designed and seems well built but the user experience is terrible.For starters the Live View, where you can watch and\/or record a real time feed from your camera is really hit or miss. I find it works better when I'm away from home but even then I often get one of an assortment of error messages instead of a feed.Worse, it seems that \"Live View\" is unavailable when the camera is recording based on a motion event. So, you get a motion alert on your phone, open the app to quickly see what's going on but instead it just tells you \"Live View in Progress\" and refuses to give you a live feed. The one moment you really want a live feed you're not *allowed* to have it? There's also a delay before the recordings become available in the app so it's really a frustrating experience.When the Live View does work you have to constantly reply to a \"Continue?\" prompt or the feed will stop after about 30 seconds, so if you wanted to use this to keep an eye on something it's totally useless. Even if you keep pressing the Continue button it will eventually stop the feed after a few minutes at most.Recording of motion events is strictly time-based. You can set the time up to 30 seconds and it will re-trigger afterwards but I much prefer the way most other motion-activated cameras work where they record continuously as long as there's motion. With the Blink you get gaps in the footage that you don't get with other cameras.The picture quality is at best adequate but I was surprised that it's not better. In particular it does poorly if there's a bright light source in the room. It tends to focus on the center of the viewing area so if there's something like a lamp on the edge of the field of view that area is a total, unviewable white out. There's zero adjustment for the video settings other than resolution so there's nothing you can do about this.On the whole based on it being a newer product, a major brand and associated with Amazon I was expecting something far superior to my aging, Chinese brand Zmodo\/MeShare cameras but in the end what this product did was make me realize how much I was taking for granted.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1601337600000}

I had other cameras that these replaced due to they frequently failing to connect, but at least those cameras continued to record as long as there was movement.

{"reviewTitle":"Garbage","reviewDescription":"Cant test any of the features because it simply wont connect to my wifi. im still on a 2.4ghz only network with 802.11 b\/g using wep 64\/40 ascii which should connect this camera. It does not. I have the camera only 1 foot away from the router and can not get it to connect.First Edit 6\/21\/20: i was able to get it working with one of my phones wifi tethering (android s7) While my iphone would receive the same connection failure. The device updated and then i tried to reconnect using my home wifi, again it would not work. Should also state that not only is my router in spec for this device, my internet speeds are 100MB U\/D so this is faulty. Even my cheep chinese lightbulbs work with my routers yet this cant even make a connection.Followup 6\/23\/20: Blink has since contacted me and is attempting to troubleshoot, in the meantime i was able to get it working on another network in my s\/o house which was a pretty easy setup. While the camera works and is decent for the price in terms of clarity from what i experienced its not real time and displays with a full 6 second or more lag while viewing from the same network on both my phone and the echo show the fps isnt the greatest either. Kinda makes the intercom through the camera pointless. Still a few leagues behind setting up picams in both clarity and frame rate, also with the ability to set custom storage on your own network still missing from this device its miles behind the picam, hopefully when this feature gets added it has decent settings that are for more advanced users.Im upping my review from 1 to 3 stars because of the support attempts so far and because the clarity is decent for the price. If i can get it working on my network it will be worth the 4 stars.Update 3, 6\/24\/20 - Blink support had me download an app to monitor my network sending them data that i don't even get to see myself only for support to tell me that i should call verizon and see if they can fix the problem by telling them that i have a blink camera that wont connect, what a joke, do they really think verizon has the time to deal with redoing my network for a single device that wont connect when everything else is fine.

Here's why this little gem deserves a solid five-star review:Setup (5\/5):The setup process is a breeze! I'm not tech-savvy, but I had the Blink Mini up and running in less than 10 minutes. Just plug it in, connect it to the Blink app, and you're good to go. The app is user-friendly and guides you through every step.Video Quality (5\/5):The 1080p HD video quality is crystal clear. I can now see every detail in my home, day or night. The night vision is impressive, providing a sharp and clear picture even in total darkness. I've got my peace of mind 24\/7.Motion Detection (5\/5):The motion detection feature is spot-on. I receive instant alerts on my phone when there's movement in the camera's field of view. You can adjust the sensitivity to suit your needs, which is a handy feature. It's a game-changer for security-conscious folks like me.Two-Way Audio (4\/5):The two-way audio function is a nice addition. It allows me to communicate with family members or even my pets when I'm away. The sound quality is good, but sometimes there's a slight delay. Nonetheless, it's a useful feature.Compact Design (5\/5):The Blink Mini is super compact, so it doesn't stand out in a room. It blends in effortlessly with my home decor. The camera can also swivel to get the perfect angle, ensuring you capture everything you want to monitor.Value for Money (5\/5):The Blink Mini offers amazing value for the price. It's an affordable solution for home security, making it accessible to a wide range of users. You don't need a subscription for basic functionality, but if you want more, the subscription plans are reasonably priced.In summary, the Blink Mini is a fantastic indoor security camera. It's easy to set up, provides top-notch video quality, and offers all the essential features you need to keep an eye on your home. If you're looking for an affordable and dependable smart security camera that won't break the bank, this is the one.

{"reviewTitle":"Horrible for low lit area","reviewDescription":"I bought these cameras to put inside of a window looking out. I paid $20 with an Amazon deal that came up. I got 2 cameras, one for my driveway and one for my backyard. If the area is not well lit, the camera is useless!! So my driveway camera at night is completely black because there\u2019s no light outside. Also, this camera is extremely sensitive to headlights so you have to white out every single zone on the camera app where you will see headlights if it points to a road. Otherwise, you will get 300 notifications every night especially if you live on a busy road. But in whiting out these areas in the \u201czone\u201d, you also may white out important areas that you need \u2026 every night I have to turn off my notifications from my driveway camera for this very reason.My back yard camera as you can see, only the one spot is visible. So keep that in mind if you plan to use these inside of a window. Also the blue light, there\u2019s no way to cover it up and it was reflecting off of the glass on the window, so what I did was I got a very tiny piece of black electrical tape and put it over the blue light and now I don\u2019t have that reflection.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701820800000}

It took approximately 6 attempts for each camera to connect to my wifi. I have no idea why.The video quality is decent. However the audio quality is questionable at times. I also wish that I could record longer than 30 seconds for motion events as the camera doesn't retrigger quickly enough to keep recording if there is motion past the 30 second window.Other than that they have been a great help to keep an eye on my dogs and house while I am away. I just wish they weren't so mentally draining to set up.Bought these to keep an eye on my house while I'm away. Never had so much buyers remorse over a purchase as I do with these.After fighting with an immediate failed connection attempt 9 times in a row on one of the two cameras, I went to google and discovered that the Xfinity Gateway router needs to have the wifi bands separated to 5ghz and 2.4ghz. I did that, managed to get one to connect after 4 attempts, still cannot get the second one to connect to the same network 14 tries later.I've tried everything the help article stated. Nothing works. Literally nothing. It's 9pm and I'm not going to bother calling support at this point. These are likely going back in the box and back to Amazon. This is obnoxious. I've done every single step the exact same way as the camera I did manage to connect and this second one just will not do it, no matter what I try.Taking everything in me to not throw my phone across the room every time the \"Failed to connect\" message pops up.

I asked blink support about this and they gave me a generic copy paste answer so they don't seem interested in making a firmware update to allow you to have the camera actually armed 24\/7. I would have the app disarm and arm one minute later but the app requires a full hour or more disarmed and even the Alexa app can't trigger the disarm and arm in a routine. It's as if they designed this thing to not be a good security solution for constant monitoring situations.Also, unlike the outdoor cameras, the motion zone config is very rough and it ultimately leads me to get a lot of unnecessary alerts because I don't want to exclude huge chunks of the scene. The outdoor cameras have more fine tuned motion zone configuration.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709337600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good for Live Views, Motion Detection Doesn't Work","reviewDescription":"I'll start of by saying I've been a Blink user since the first generation and I love their products and have convinced several friends and family to buy a system. I have all Blink XT cameras and they work wonderfully but I wanted something to put in the garage and leave on all the time to record motion without killing batteries. This product seemed to fit the bill as it was a cheap add one with all the features I wanted such as night vision, motion detection, 2-way talk, and plug in power. However, after almost a year of use, I've not been able to successfully figure out a reliable way to get the motion detection to work automatically like the rest of my Blink XT cameras. The Blink Mini seems to have a hardware or software bug that won't allow it to record motion unless you manually disarm, then rearm the system. If you do this, it will record motion until it switches to IR (night mode) and then it stops recording motion. The same happens if it is armed\/dearmed from night to day mode. It seems like it can't transition automatically from night to day on its own. I thought they would push an update to fix this error but 9 months later, I'm still waiting...... I've tried numerous workarounds such as leaving it in IR mode, day mode, turning off status indicator, etc with no luck. I guess I should chalk it up to only costing $25 so you get what you pay for. If you just want a plug-in camera to check periodically via live views, this camera works great! if you want it for part of your security system and home monitoring, stick with the regular blink cameras. If you really want to nerd out you can read about how (allegedly) the mini cameras use some sort of pixel difference technology versus infrared heat on regular wireless cameras. I found the Blink Mini to be a nuisance when motion detection actually does work, especially at night. The camera would pick up moving dust particles floating by the camera reflecting the IR light. I suppose its better to pick up more motion rather than less and since it's plugged in, it's not killing the battery, just flooding my free storage (yay for free cloud storage as legacy customer!). Bottom line, stick to regular Blink wireless cameras for motion detection, but this for live views indoors.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1632182400000}

Unless you are looking really hard for the sleeping dog I found it very hard to see her. As this was the whole reason for buying it I was pretty disappointed not to be able to see her at all times of day.Day quality is a bit blurry but overall okay\u2014especially when I remember this is not an expensive quality camera.The app was easy to find and sign into but there was a small learning curve with it and trying to figure out how to record, put in video mode, and picture. It seems to me you can only save one picture and see that one picture unless you pay for the membership (not an expense I wanted to pay for such low quality photos). To watch video you have to tap on the video camera each time you open app(or even switch from it to another app). This was also very annoying to me as there are several unnecessary steps to getting it to work.Finally, the motion detection is crazy sensitive even for the lower percents(I have it set on a 5). In the beginning I was getting text messages every time she moved and while this would be nice for intruder or other thing this was not something I needed for my dog. Very glad I had the option to turn this off.  There are also features to flip the picture (when you mount camera upside down.Overall, for the money it is not bad.

{"reviewTitle":"Can't handle transition from daytime to nighttime and back again","reviewDescription":"I have run into an extremely annoying technical issue with this camera that severely limits it's usefulness.  It's a little hard to describe but I'll try to explain:First off, I use this camera in a front window next to my front door overlooking my porch.  I've noticed over time that I've missed some notifications of movement for actions that should have been caught (for example, a very large package being delivered to my front door which should have caught movement).  Some times I can go an entire day w\/o notifications even though there is activity that should have triggered it.I have tested my theory and the issue is as follows:  The camera doesn't do a good job of transitioning from daytime to night time and sometimes gets \"stuck\" in one mode or the other.  If I notice I haven't received notifications in awhile I will go into \"LIVE\" mode to view a current stream and one of two things will happen:1) The screen will either be super bright and washed out (think almost completely white) and 'adjust down' into a normal picture.  If in this state the camera won't pick up movement because it is seeing almost all white until it adjusts2) The screen will be all black and 'adjust up' to a normal picture.  If in  this state it won't pick up movement at all as it is seeing almost all black screen.  SOMETIMES something very bright will make the system see it and adjust at that point.  For instance. If it is seeing all black something like very bright car lights will be seen and make it adjust.  Something like someone walking right up to the camera and waving will not be seen as the camera hasn't adjusted.It's a very unusual problem where the only fix that I can find is to manually pull up a live view in the morning and at night and making the camera adjust automatically.  I can tell this works bc the screen is either all black or white depending on whatever mode it got stuck in. I don't have confidence in the system as I have to manually intervene up to twice a day to make sure the camera can see things properly.  If I were to leave my home for a few days and forget to pull up a live view a few times a day I could potentially have someone force entry into my front door and or vandalize something and the system would be completely blind to that.My attached photo shows what the camera sees before it adjusts back down to normal levels during a live view.  In this instance it is using night time sensitivity during the daytime causing it to see hardly anything at all.  It can't see movement in the state and will not trigger motion notifications nor will it record anything.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1612483200000}

I purchased these during Black Friday so I got a pack of 3 for a good price.I set up the first one since I only received one initially until they sent the other two later, and everything was dandy. The picture was good, the night vision was good. The one thing that I quickly learned (when I propped up my phone at work) that wasn\u2019t my favorite, was the fact that I can\u2019t just keep the video on. It asks me three times if I wanted to continue before it glitch then kicked me out of the app entirely. I tired several times and noticed after the third \u201ccontinue?\u201d That it will just glitch and shut down the app.I read another review by Haley where she also said, \u201c The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the \"continue?\" prompt.\u201dMy husband had bought a different brand similar to the one I got for his work, but he has the ability to just bring up the video and set his phone down with no issue.The other really frustrating part is that you get a 30 free day trial before you have to pay for a subscription to be able to access certain features. 1. Why can\u2019t I just be able to save video without having to pay for it? 2. When I have tried the save feature during the trial, it\u2019s very confusing. I switched it over to save, but as soon as I exit out of live view then go back into live view, it had switched back to discard on its own. I also tried switching it to save then exiting and seeing the result after a minute, and as soon as I saw the saved footage, before I could even click it to watch it, it disappeared and I have no idea why. I go back into live view and it switched itself to discard again. So what\u2019s the point? Why would I pay for something that doesn\u2019t even work?

It worked well (almost too well) by sending Alexa notifications to both my iPhone and the Echo Show.  I eventually turned the notifications off on my phone because I didn't need two things waking me up at 3am.

It's ridiculous what it chooses to record and what it chooses to just ignore. After checking the recordings from about a week ago I found it's insane how much it ignores actual motion but then picks up the trees blowing in the wind.I have it aiming out my front window since my doorbell camera is on the fritz. We were out on the deck for about 35 miniutes waiting for my friends vehicle to be dropped off so they could get to work. 2 people moving back and forth in front of it constantly. This was about 5:35-5:45 am  until around 6:20-6:30 am. I look back at the recordings so we could see what time exactly it was finally dropped off and there's nothing picked up from 5am until after 10am. This is one of the busiest times on the street I live on. It should have been constantly being set off and recording.  Since other times it picks up most of he cars that pass on the street.Bad enough it typically records then shuts off missing the things it should pick up. Or starts too late to pick up the important parts it should be recording. Part of the reason I can't use it for indoors when I'm selling items. It didn't pick up anything useful and only got useless parts of any interaction. It wasn't useful for watching for shoplifting when my back is turned or anything else. Now this.Then there's the lousy 20 to 30 second recording times. Will never understand how this is useful for any security cameras. What good is 30 seconds. So why bother.These don't have any type of decent live record or live watch on them unless you keep hitting continue. Half the time it takes about 2 miniutes to get the live view to even open. So that's no good for security at all.The only redeeming quality is the picture isn't horrible as long as the light is just right.I'm just hoping the wifi recieved on it is really good cuz only places left for it are upstairs where no one is much these days or the garage to keep an eye out for squirrels getting in there. After that it can go in the trash if it doesn't work there cuz I'll have no use for it at all.Unimpressed and rather unhappy with the blink cameras and won't buy another ever again.

The cameras seamlessly transition from camera to camera when saving clips. Voice function is extremely handy for hearing conversion from his side. Since he's hard of hearing, he can't hear us talking to him (but others can. Would love an enhancement to increase volume.) Easy to configure individual device settings for zones and sensitivity. Extremely sensitive to motion, as we quickly learned when the reflection from the TV onto a glass frame triggered notifications!

Based upon the notifications, we were able to begin choosing which zones to turn off, where to adjust the sensitivity, length of clips, etc. This blink system is just the extension of care monitoring we needed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723766400000}
{"reviewTitle":"An Unforgettable 5-Star Experience!","reviewDescription":"I never thought I would be writing a review for a security camera, but after my unforgettable experience with the Blink Mini, I couldn't resist sharing my story. From the moment I set my eyes on this compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, I knew my home would never be the same again.Unboxing:When the package arrived, I eagerly tore it open like a kid on Christmas morning. Inside, I found the Blink Mini, beautifully wrapped in its pristine white color. I have to admit, the camera itself looked adorable, and I couldn't help but chuckle at its tiny size. It was like a cute little spy on a mission to protect my home.Easy Setup:Setting up the Blink Mini was an absolute breeze. Even for a technologically challenged person like me, it took no more than a few minutes. I plugged it into an outlet, connected it to my Wi-Fi using the Blink app on my smartphone, and voila! I was ready to go. It's worth mentioning that the app was incredibly user-friendly, guiding me through the entire setup process with clear instructions.Crystal Clear HD Video:The Blink Mini boasts an impressive 1080p HD video quality, and boy, does it deliver! The first time I viewed the live feed on my phone, I was blown away by the clarity and sharpness of the image. It felt like I was watching a high-definition movie, except this one was starring my own living room. The camera captured every detail, from the texture of my couch to the fur on my pet's back.Night Vision Magic:Nighttime is when the real fun begins with the Blink Mini. Its advanced night vision feature turned my house into a stage for some comical shenanigans. I caught my mischievous cat, Mr. Whiskers, attempting to conquer the refrigerator at 2 a.m. The night vision mode illuminated the scene in eerie green, giving Mr. Whiskers an otherworldly glow as he tiptoed across the kitchen counter. It was like watching a feline James Bond.Motion Detection Follies:The motion detection feature of the Blink Mini had its fair share of funny moments. Every time a fly buzzed around the camera, it triggered an alert on my phone. It was hilarious watching myself rush to check the feed, only to find out it was just an insect causing all the fuss. I even started a game with my friends, betting on how many false alarms the camera would give me in a day. It was all in good fun, and it never failed to provide a good laugh.Two-Way Audio Pranks:One of my favorite features of the Blink Mini is the two-way audio. Oh, the pranks I pulled on my unsuspecting family members! I would wait until they were in the living room, then remotely activate the camera's audio. Their puzzled expressions as they tried to figure out where the voice was coming from were absolutely priceless. I must admit, I took great pleasure in pretending to be the voice of their conscience.Works with Alexa Magic:Being able to control the Blink Mini with Alexa was a game-changer. I could simply ask Alexa to show me the camera feed on my Echo Show, and in an instant, my house became a live reality show. My friends were in awe when they witnessed this magical interaction. It felt like I had just stepped into the future, where security cameras respond to my every command.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Blink Mini exceeded all my expectations. It provided top-notch security for my home while offering endless entertainment. The easy setup, exceptional video quality, night vision hilarity, motion detection follies, two-way audio pranks, and seamless integration with Alexa made it a true gem. If you're looking for a smart security camera that will keep you safe and entertained, I wholeheartedly recommend the Blink Mini. Trust me, you won't be able to wipe the smile off your face!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"616 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684886400000}

The video and audio quality is great.A year after that we bought another 3 outdoor Cameras, again video and audio quality is great.Just before Christmas 2021 Blink came out with the doorbell camera, and we purchased it.

To neighbors, Friends, Family, and even the police department.Cons\/irritationsWhen an outdoor camera faces the sun at any point of the day, the motion detection will go off, until you adjust the motion activity spots in the camera settings. This can take a few days to work out the kinks.Indoor mini cameras the motion activity spots don't always work. Sometimes it will go off when there is motion in the grayed out zones, and sometimes not go off in the non-greyed out zones. This maybe human error on our part. We are looking for a longer cord for the mini's to mount on the wall or ceiling.  The are options to rotate the camera view, so that you are able to mount the camera wherever you need.Overall we are happy with our Blink system and hope the company continues to grow and come out with new products.Compared to my parents very very expensive Arlo system, Blink is more reliable, and is more cost-effective. So much so, my parents have ditched the Arlo camera system and have purchased a new Blink system.We highly recommend Blink to anyone who would like to have a home video camera system that works, and won't break the bank.We love that you can start out small and work your way in to as much as you want\/need.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"146 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644105600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Updated Review: Problem with Motion Detect Remedied (From 2 Stars to 4 Stars)","reviewDescription":"Updated (4 Star) Review (Original Review Below):After posting my dissatisfaction with the motion detection regarding these cameras, a Blink tech support representative reached out to me to help me resolve the issues. First off, part of the problem was user error, in that I set these Blink Minis up right after I setup the Ring doorbell camera and spotlight camera. The UI within the Blink app is designed in a way, in terms of motion detect zones, is opposite to Ring's app in that the shaded portions in Blink are inactive zones (not to trigger an alert & record), whereas in Ring, anything you draw as shaded is to be detected as a zone. I made the mistake in not reading the instructions carefully within the Blink app as the text just blends right in to everything else. I partially blame the developers for not making that piece of information standout or for making it the opposite to their sister company, Ring's app. I feel that this should be updated to be the same as Ring or make the instructions pop out and highlighted so it's easy to see! I attached a screenshot of the Blink motion zones versus the Ring's motion zone screen. Quite the opposite if you're like me and speed through the setup thinking they're the same. Anyways, I removed the shaded squares and the motion triggers started working again!As for the other issue. These Blink mini cams are not made to be placed behind a window, the IR light which renders these useless as the glare reflection on the glass window makes these useless. Fortunately there's some workarounds that make it work to an acceptable degree in my opinion. Besides, I use the Ring cams as my main security cams, and these Blink minis are supplemental to them. Anyways, there's an option in the app to turn off the IR. It's important to note that they are somewhat capable of motion detection through glass, since they use pixel difference analysis instead of IR heat signature. This can only work under very limited conditions such as when daylight is present, with the camera positioned as close as possible to a window, and with the recording LED and IR LED disabled to reduce reflection. I did all of those things and I added a Mr. Beams motion activated spotlight over the top. So during the day no problems, but at night it's complete pitch black until the spotlight is activated which in turns triggers the alert and subsequent recording on Blink. I uploaded a video demonstrating that. It was completely dark and the only illumination on the night recording footage is from the Mr. Beams. The solution and workaround worked in my case.With all that said, for the price point, these Blink Mini Cams are a good value with decent picture quality. I still find my Ring cameras to be superior in every way, but they are also significantly more expensive. I wish that these Blink mini cams would just record to the Ring Protect Plus subscription, which includes unlimited cameras and cloud storage. But since they don't, the best solution instead of spending per device with Blink's cloud storage (which should be one flat rate like Ring) is to get the Sync Module 2, which will allow you to record on a flash storage device for the footage to be reviewed within the app. Overall, after fixing my motion detection issues with the Blink, I'm now happy with them and would recommend them for the price. If you have the extra money, go for something more refined and advance such as the Ring cameras.Original (2 Star) Review:Both my blink minis are hit or miss (mostly miss) when it comes to motion alerts and recordings. Just got them a month ago and if they weren't so cheap bundled with the echo shows I bought, I'd send them back. My ring cameras are on point, but these blink cams are disappointing to say the least. And yes, I've armed and disarmed them several times, and still the same. I could be jumping right in front of them, day or night, and they still don't detect motion. They need a firmware update or something because they're not that good. The video is not bad for the price of these, but not stellar by any means. The app looks like it can use an update in the UI department, it looks and operates significantly interior to the ring app I use, can't believe Amazon owns both companies and can't allocate a little more resources to polish up the app and the firmware to get this system functioning somewhat on par to their ring products.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"277 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1604534400000}

Moving it closer cut down on circumference view for live view but it wasn\u2019t able to pick up motion clips  being further away and that\u2019s what I needed was motion clip alerts. I do wish it would record longer than 60 seconds at a time and that there wasn\u2019t a re trigger lag. 10 seconds is the shortest re trigger option, a lot can happen and be missed in 10 seconds.

The camera was to go in a custom mount in the enclosure lid, looking down onto the colony. This would give a focal distance of about 4-6 inches, with a goal of a fairly high-resolution picture. This was certainly not the case. The clarity, either due to distance or resolution (or both) was pretty poor.HOWEVER, that being said, my daughter uses these exact cameras in her apartment to allow her to keep an eye on pets in her absence.

I was on the premium plan at the time. I ended up turning off alarms and using them for just live monitoring.

{"reviewTitle":"Major Disappointment","reviewDescription":"UPDATE 9\/13\/20What I feared - and predicted - would  happen came to pass. Last Friday, 9\/11\/20, my landlord called me and asked me to review the footage on my cameras because another tenant had seen someone on the premises behaving suspiciously. I checked my Blink Mini app on my cell phone and sure enough.NOTHING.As usual, the cameras had STOPPED WORKING the night before sometime around midnight. As a result, there was nothing recorded during the day on Friday. Nothing.A few days earlier, I spoke to Amazon who said that, since the 30 day window had passed, there was nothing they could do. They suggested I deal directly with Blink, even though Bling is OWNED BY AMAZON, supposedly. I called Blink \"tech support\" (laughable) at the number the Amazon rep gave me.I wound up wasting 35 minutes with a woman who knew nothing about the Blink system, could barely speak English, and whose background sounded like she was rattling pots and pans in her kitchen. She asked me to hold a few times and, so help me, it sounded like all she was doing was rattling things around to give the appearance that she was actually doing something.As I've mentioned before, the Blink Mini cameras UTTERLY FAIL at their primary, stated, function: to provide you peace of mind relative to home security. Neither Amazon nor Blink will be of any help to you in getting your issue resolved and the only thing you will have accomplished it to waste your money.It's too late for me but if you are considering purchasing this system, I advise you in the strongest possible terms to look elsewhere. You may want to shop at Costco since they have a very liberal return policy.I hope people get to read this review since it appears Amazon has obscured many one-star reviews from site and only a few show up on the Blink Mini page. Do not waste your money on this camera.UPDATE 9\/2\/20I received an email on 7\/28\/20 from a Blink employee named Haitham. In part, he wrote:\"I would like to clarify that we are fully aware of this issue where the camera will stay on the night mode and not fully recognize that it has to switch to the day mode, and that will mostly happen in the early morning once the sun rises. We are working one the fix and it should come automatically to your camera. In the meantime as a work around, you may need to schedule disarming the system in the early morning and arm it back right after.\"As of today, ZERO has happened.I want to be clear that the Blink mini camera can be a genuine hazard to your well being because of this issue. It simply goes off a ledge around midnight and NEVER wakes up unless you remember to wake it. This means you could be away from home and be burglarized. You think you're covered because you have the Blink camera system only to discover that it has recorded absolutely nothing.The worst case scenario is you and your family go out to dinner. While you're out, intruders get into your home. Since the camera stopped working at midnight yesterday, you are completely unaware you have unwelcome guests until you return home and walk in on them.In short, this system poses a danger to your well being because it fails in its stated purpose. Since Blink has done nothing to correct this problem, which is purely software based, you will be taking your chances by purchasing this system.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased a two-pack of the Blink Mini. What attracted me was the low cost of the item. They were $35 each or the two-pack for $65. Turns out I might just as well have taken $65 and thrown it out the window. Of a moving car.I only set up one camera by a window, looking out through the glass. I was very happy to see that the motion sensing worked and it should have since all it's doing is noting changing pixels. I was also happy to see that the microphone was sensitive enough to pick up what was being said on the other side of a dual-paned window.However, for some reason the camera decided to stop working or, more specifically, to stop sensing and recording motion. I first noticed this when I fired up the Blink app and noticed that all the clips were tagged \"Yesterday\" and none from \"Today\".It turns out that, for some reason, the camera seems to decide that its work is done sometime around midnight. Beyond that, it will NOT record ANY video UNLESS I proactively disarm and re-arm the motion sensing on the camera via the app. Alternatively, I can do a \"Live\" view to see what the camera is seeing, also through the app. Both of these actions have the effect of seeming to \"wake\" the camera up to a new day. From that point on, it will continue working as normal. Until midnight. At that point the whole process begins again.Another odd thing is that it records video - when it decides to actually work - only for a specified period of time, between 5 and 30 seconds. It OUGHT to work like motion sensing lights that turn on and remain on for a specified period of time BUT will stay lit if it continues to sense motion. These cameras should continue recording if the motion they detected continues or resumes within the designated video clip length. In other words, if you set a clip length of 15 seconds and 12 seconds into it the motion resumes, it should keep recording until there is no motion.The point of these cameras is to be able to set them up and forget about them until you are notified it senses motion. In this regard, the system is a complete failure. I tried power cycling the camera by physically disconnecting it from the power supply then reconnecting. Nothing. I tried deleting the camera from the app and re-installing it. Nothing. It's got nothing to do with the app because it has no physical connection to the camera. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and all the camera settings I had previously set were still intact, so it ain't the app.As a last resort I did the unthinkable: I called \"tech support\". What I got was a call center somewhere in the Philippines and one of those maddeningly persistently cordial persons who is anything BUT \"tech support\".  I finally just let him believe he actually helped me and ended the call.So here I am without a functional camera system and, of course, well past the return date. The bottom line here is that this system, ostensibly meant to alert you if there is an intrusion into your home, simply CANNOT be relied upon for that purpose. Your home could be broken into and you would be none the wiser. You would be much better off to do your research and purchase a system that, while potentially more expensive, will at least serve its stated purpose. This one does not.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"392 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1595635200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great for a couple months, then stopped functioning correctly. Terrible customer service.","reviewDescription":"Review updated after 3 months:My original review is below.  I mentioned that these cameras make a nice toy, but are not good if you are looking for a home security camera.  I've had the cameras 3 months now and the motion detection on one of them stopped working. It would either continuously detect motion so it filled up my storage, or it would not detect any at all, making it unusable for anything other than live viewing (which is very glitchy and doesn't always work either).I contacted support via e-mail. I told them I had tried various debugging things: unplugging the camera, moving it, verifying the network could reach it, etc.  They asked me in e-mail to unplug it (which I had already done), and then asked me to do a hard reset, neither of which fixed it.  After a few more e-mails with different support people, they again asked me to do a hard reset. I told them they already asked me to do that, and could they just please replace the unit, and they said \"Well try it again and let's see what happens,\" which I did.  I again re-iterated everything I did told them that resetting it didn't work.  They then replied and asked me to move it to verify the network connectivity. This was after almost 2 weeks of e-mail exchanges back-and-forth, and finally I got frustrated and decided to just stop using the units and find something that works better.Original review--------I got this system primarily to monitor a pet at home while I am at work, which it is good for.  I've deployed and managed professional security video systems at large and small companies, and if you are looking for something to serve as a security camera, you should choose a different system.The Good:  It's a very inexpensive system. The cameras can be moved around very easily they take very little effort to set up and configure.  You could use one to watch a living room one day, and a back yard the next day if you like.  The video quality is pretty good and the wide-angle camera means that you can cover relatively large areas with just a single camera.  If you get the Sync module, you do not need the subscription service so you can operate this with no monthly fees if you like.  That means for roughly $100 you can have a 2-camera system with absolutely no additional costs.  There are a few caveats to using just the blink module which are described below.  The 2-way voice communication is ok, and it is a fun feature for messing with my dog when I'm not home.  (It does make you sound a little bit like Darth Vader though).  The sync module takes any USB memory stick. I have many of those laying around so I didn't need to buy one.  I have an 8GB USB on it and have been using it for almost a month with 2 cameras and it's only 30% full. I do unplug the cameras when I'm at home, though, so they are not used 24x7.The Bad: The system is very slow.  It takes several seconds to start watching a live stream video or to watch video playbacks.  If you do not use the cloud service, it takes even longer to start video that is stored just on the blink module.  The system will only record a maximum of 30 seconds of video and then it has to wait at least 10 seconds before it will start recording again.  Also, several times it's evident that motion continues beyond the 10 second reset, but it doesn't start recording again until several minutes later.  This means that you can miss critical events in your playback.  About 30-40% of the time when trying to view live video, it gives an error message of \"Playback is not available at this time\" or \"System is currently busy\" or something like that. I believe this has to do with it not being able to record and play back live video at the same time, so if it has started recording a motion event and you want to watch the camera, it won't let you.  In addition, it won't let 2 people try to watch live video at the same time, so if you have multiple members of your household want to use the app at the same time, forget it.  If you use the cloud service, the stored clips will have a picture associated with them so you can easily identify what triggered the movement detection. If you use just the sync module without the cloud service, though, you do not get this image preview. This makes it difficult to identify which clip you may want to watch if you are trying to find a specific event amongst the several stored on your device.  Also, the motion sensitivity does not really seem to work too well.  It keeps triggering with slight changes in shadows even though the sensitivity is turned to the minimum level (i.e. if you have changing light intensity coming into a room through a window due to a car driving by or shadows from a tree, even if the car\/tree\/window is not in view of the camera). Due to the wide-angle lens, you won't get a lot of very good detail (i.e. facial features, text that is written on things, etc) out of images, but they will be good enough to see what is going on.Bottom line: This is a fun system, but it really is a toy compared to some of the other systems out there. If you are looking for something very low-cost for a non-critical type of usage, then this should be ok.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"128 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687910400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Frustrating & Unreliable - Not Reliable for Home Security or Critical Applications","reviewDescription":"Update Sept. 4, 2020================I was able to improve the night vision of my Blink Mini at the expense of decreased motion detection reliability during the day. However, I am lowering my rating from a 3 star to a 1 star due to reliability issues with the Blink ecosystem.Several days after further adjusting my settings in an attempt to improve the night vision, my Blink Mini stopped responding altogether. When I went to my APP I noticed that I had been logged out by the app for no apparent reason. I tried logging in several times, but each I was informed by the APP that my credentials were incorrect - they were not! I decided to go the simple route of resetting my password which I thought would resolve the problem - IT DID NOT! Blink sends you a pin that you need to enter to reset your password, it also pretty much wipes all your previous settings according to the notice I received. When I attempted to log into my account with the new password, the app again stated that my credentials were incorrect and would not allow me to log into my account. So I tried again, but still no luck. At this point I was becoming very frustrated that a device that was supposed to be providing security was actually making me less secure. I went to the BLINK website to try and contact technical support. It appears that the only way to do this is to fill out a ticket and wait for them to get back to you.At this point, I have to state that this is the worse security device that I have. It may be cheap, but without any reliability - it is completely worthless. While more costly, I would recommend a RING or ARLO camera instead. I have both RING and ARLO products and both have proven extremely reliable.Original Review============The Blink Mini has a lot of potential in my opinion and overall I like it, but it is not at all reliable in my current (and some would argue not intended for) application. Based on my experiences so far, I would not recommend as a primary source for Home Security. However, the Blink Mini might be a satisfactory or even a great fit in your particular application especially if you use it to augment a more reliable system you already have in place. My review is based on a specific application. It could be that I just need to find the right combination of settings to get it to work for my application. The BLINK APP does offer a fairly nice set of Camera Settings to allow you to customize your camera.I have had the Blink Mini operational for several weeks now. I have it placed inside a window observing activity on one of the entryways into my home. During the day it works really well. However, I find that I typically need to perform a soft reset each day as it seems to go into a sleep mode during the night effectivity becoming non-operational.  I have used a different security camera\/motion detector alongside the Blink Mini and it doesn't exhibit the same issues. I may end up repurposing my BLINK MINI for garage duty and swap it with the camera I currently have installed there. I am sure garage duty would be much less demanding for the BLINK MINI\u2019s capabilities.It will work really well in detection and recording during the day and then as it gets dark it seems it enter a state where I either get a completely black screen or a reflection from the window and it effectively puts itself into a USELESS mode until I activate some type of video activity using the BLINK APP.I have had the Blink Mini NIGHT VISION setting on AUTO (which is apparently the default). I tried setting the IR setting to ON to determine if there is any improvements. Having the NIGHT VISION set to ON during the day disables color and results in poor video quality due to window reflection. I have turned NIGHT VISION to OFF and IR Intensity to LOW to see if this results in any improvementNOTES: (1) Turning NIGHT VISION to OFF effectively turns motion detection and video recording off unless there's an external light source. (2) The APP doesn\u2019t allow one to turn IR Intensity to OFF. You can only set to LOW - MED - HIGH. It would be nice if you could turn off completely.CONS:1 - Extremely poor or no night vision or motion detection in my application. It's possible that this can be improved by the right set of camera setting - I am experimenting and will update if things improve.2 - Consistently goes into a SLEEP\/Non-operational mode at night requiring a soft RESET the next day to make it operational for day activity.3 - Sometimes unable to connect through the cloud to an Eco Show at a different location - this is random and can usually be cleared by activating the BLINK APP. While not ideal, it does seem to clear the problem.4 - Detection notification is noticeably delayed.5 - While new owners get a free cloud subscription until December 31st, 2020; post that date requires you to pay $3\/month per camera or purchase a yet-to-be-released Sync Module.6 - Requires that you plug into an electrical outlet (I would say that this is a SOFT CON and possibly a PRO for some depending on your particular situation).7 - IR Intensity cannot be turned OFF.PROS:1 - Good day-time video quality for the price.2 - Good for non-critical monitoring and detection.3 - Nice low-cost augmentation to existing and primary security system.4 - Easy to setup.5 - BLINK APP offer a nice set of Camera Settings to allow you to customize your camera. One caveat is that you cannot turn IR Intensity to OFF which is an issue in some applications.6 - Good day-time motion detection quality.7 - Well made for the relatively low price.In summary, I would say that the BLINK MINI is a decent and even good product depending on your particular application. It\u2019s especially good if you\u2019re augmenting an existing security system for a non-critical application or area. However, I cannot recommend for primary Home Security or Critical Applications at this time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"143 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1596931200000}
{"reviewTitle":"You get what you pay for- keep an eye on return window","reviewDescription":"Did it record videos? Yes. Could I tell what anything was half the time in the video? No. I had these set up to keep an eye on my living room and adjoining patio.  You have to use an app to view the videos. It alerts you when a video of something has been taken. I had both cameras armed all day. It would rarely record anything during the day and at night, it would go off when it registered car lights down my street through my patio window. But did it record people in my house? No. I\u2019d have 50 video motivations every morning and maybe 2 during the day. I really wanted to like these cameras. I was so close to ordering the doorbell system since I bought these cameras already, but that wont work unless you have a Sync Module device or doorbell wiring. I don\u2019t have either so I\u2019d be spending more money to have a video doorbell and two cameras that don\u2019t work during the day effectively. So I tried to return these just now and I was a day late for the return window. So I paid for subpar cameras, and pay $10 a month for the storage \/video feature since I want alerts saved just in case. I can\u2019t sit around watching the app all day. That defeats the purpose. And if I want a video doorbell, I\u2019ll have to pay for the sync module device since I don\u2019t have doorbell wiring. $40 bucks on these cameras, and $98 for a bundle with the doorbell and sync module device, plus $10 a month subscription. It might not be much money for some but as a single legal guardian\/\u201cparent\u201d who works full time as a teacher, it\u2019s a lot for me to afford in the summer. I took a chance on this company because I needed a way to keep tabs on my latchkey kid everyday and it doesn\u2019t even detect when they walk by in the day. Also, I\u2019d like to mention the mounting was annoying. Be careful ordering this- make sure you have an outlet for the power cord close to a surface you want to put it on. Not a fan of having to use the super glue sticker to hold the camera in place either. It\u2019s a pain in the butt to position and it would really stink if you ever wanted to move it somewhere else more than twice. I just wanted to return it and get my money back. Pay attention to your return dates! It was one month for me. I\u2019d wish I had returned it sooner and tried the doorbell instead. I honestly forgot I every had these cameras because they stopped recording much of anything and I stopped getting notifications. Once the free trial subscription ended I got a notification to start paying for it.  30 days had passed and so did the return time. If you buy this and it works, don\u2019t forget to keep checking it up until the return window so you aren\u2019t late like I was. I should have read more reviews and wish someone else would have warned about this. Good luck.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1720569600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not Good Anymore Get Something Else \ud83d\ude15","reviewDescription":"FINAL UPDATE: We live in a world of greed. People wanting to get rich. Not just make a living. Certain aspects of technology allows certain people to throttle performance. It worked great at first but a combination of internet providers and this manufacturer taking away features unless you pay them is a cop out against advancement. Why offer a better product capable of more at the same price when you can charge more for nothing... I really liked this system and hoped they would improve. Instead they chose to cheat the consumer. \ud83d\ude14 I have 8 of these mini cameras and 1 failed. Wouldn't connect back up. Worked for a year then went out. I invested so much money purchasing the minis and outdoor cameras for its ease of use and battery for easy connection and small footprint only to have them swindle people by taking options away and charging for it when previously it was an incentive to buy these. \ud83d\udc4e Looking back I should have purchased a more reliable security system. This is now just an expensive baby monitor that is not reliable. The minis are plugged in yet it only records in 30 sec slips with a minimum 10sec delay. If it is plugged in with constant power it should be able to record all day long or as long as your thumbdrive will let you. Its cloud service so they don't want you to cloud up their cloud. Bottom line this entire system is not recommended anymore. With some tweaks it would be THE system to get but with the quirks unreliability and paying extra for options that use to be included ... this is not a system worth spending money on for a real security system.UPDATE 4\/28\/21: I put up with all the flaws and problems and cloud storage was not a problem as you can save to a thumbdrive. But now they took away the ability to save live clips. You have to sign up for a monthly plan. I no longer recommend this system. You might as well pay for ADT or something.picture quality is good just as good as the all new Blink. Maybe a hair less maybe but overall clear image quality. The contrast colors dynamic range sharpness all pretty good and i don't even have it on the highest quality setting. \ud83d\ude2e Night vision is also just as good and you have some adjustments with the app. Audio is good doesn't have the humming and hissing as much as the battery powered ones. Speaker is ok you can clearly hear and speak but at close range like within 6ft. Volume could be louder. Motion detection works good. You can't be 50ft away and expect it to pick up motion consistently. You can adjust the sensitivity but you risk it picking up the slightest bit of movement. Its pretty good turning on slightly before entering frame especially with the beta option on the app at a normal reasonable range.I have 2 of them one in the garage and one in the back porch. I know these are indoor cameras but will see how they hold up. They are not going to get wet and we'll see how they handle hotter and colder temperatures than being indoors.The weather is nice right now so I hooked up an external battery and hid one in a flower pot. Makes for a nice spy cam sorta the white color sticks out. If you have the Blink system I don't see how you can pass these up. I got a 2 pack at $65 and they were also on sale for $25 each. At that price get some whether you plug it in to a wall socket or use an external battery this makes for a great addition to the Blink system. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4dI like the size of this camera. Too bad its not waterproof or battery powered. I hope they plan on a zoom feature in the future. \ud83d\ude09UPDATE: I'm about 5 months in and about a month ago there is a steady increase in the amount of failed views and failed thumbnails. It will also all of a sudden drop from the 30sec recording setting I have to a sec or two or even just a screen shot with blur. I can't get it to record back to normal. Frustrating and unreliable. I'm dropping the stars.UPDATE: After some troubleshooting I found that resetting the router and modem got everything back working again. So I'm raising the stars. Lets hope it doesn't need a reset frequently. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d Next version should be HD with zoom.UPDATE: It seems I'm having to reset the router and modem again and again more frequently now. The clips are shorter than what is set sometimes freezes skips or fails altogether. It's not working the way it should and happened after an update. \ud83d\ude10","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"90 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1602979200000}

I feel bad for ever putting these cameras in my home to feel safe yet someone else who is random was clearly watching us.My adult son and I were having a private conversation in kitchen when all of a sudden we hear this camera click on. It stopped the conversation. Our active sensor light is shut off so no lights came on, but when a camera stops recording, a green light flashes that shows the recording is being saved. We both saw this green light and looked at each other, I grabbed my phone to go to my app and see what was just recorded. I see my saved recordings, numbered 321 recordings. I click it and it refreshes and drops down to 314 recordings! Umm.... wait a sec right?! So then, the video list comes up and nothing from that exact time is there. I thought...

{"reviewTitle":"Decent for recording things, terrible as a security camera and live view","reviewDescription":"I really wanted to like the cameras, as I was hoping to move away from Nest cams to something else.  The Blink cameras were extremely simple to set up, and the video quality is excellent.  However there are way too many flaws to make them my primary home security system cameras.1.  Motion detection doesn't really work well.  When I was out of town, I had family check in on my house 3 different times.  Of those 3 times, with someone walking directly across the camera field of view about 8 feet away from the camera, only once did it trigger a motion alert.  The nest cam I had in the next room over picked up the motion even though the person was 20-30 feet from that camera and only walking across a small portion of that camera's field of view.2.  There is no home\/away assist to turn them on and off.  I want all my entry\/exit\/outdoor cameras to be on and alerting 24\/7.  However for my indoor cameras, I typically want them to turn off when I come home, and then turn back on when I leave the house.  Several other camera vendors offer that capability, but I haven't found a way to do that natively in the Blink app.3.  No multi zone-based detection alerting.  The app does have a \"zones\" feature, but unfortunately, it only allows you to define two zones, on and off.  It doesn't allow setting up multiple zones, each with their own specific recording and alerting policies.  I have one camera facing my front yard, which covers the street where I park my car, as well as the walkway to my front door.  Ideally I want to have my front walkway always detecting, recording, and alerting me when there is any motion.  For where my car is usually parked, I want it always recording when there is motion, but not to alert me, since cars driving by would typically set that motion detection off.  For the rest of the street as well as the sky, I do not want any detection or recording.  Other competing produces allow doing this, but Blink does not.4. Live view often fails (probably close to 50% of the time that I want to access them), especially if motion detection has just triggered.  When I open the app and try to open the live view, I often get a \"Live View Failed\", \"System is busy, please wait\", or \"There was a problem, please try again in a few minutes\" popup.  This especially almost always seems to happen if I get a lot of motion alerts in a row.  Force closing the app and reopening doesn't fix it, it stays broken for at least 10-30 minutes.  This makes the system unusable as a security system, as I cannot check what events are occurring and whether or not someone was trying to break in and I need to call the police.5.  Theres no multi-camera view.  I have multiple cameras set up, and in the Blink app, while the home page shows all your cameras, they're just pre-recorded thumbnails that you manually refresh.  You can't view all the camera feeds at once to see the overall state of your home.  Again, this makes it less useful as a home security system.Overall, I like the cameras themselves, however the software on them especially the Android app leaves a lot to be desired, and is lacking the feature sets that several competitors have.  I don't think I'd use these as a primary security system camera, but they are good as informational cameras.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"21 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705017600000}
{"reviewTitle":"OK daytime camera, 2nd morning, no detection","reviewDescription":"I continue to be amazed at how bad this product really is. My friend bought one on sale. I warned her she should return it but it's just $20 so small loss. Amazing bad ui. Get a motion alert (many moths, etc) tap it a few hours later and it brings you to locked live view. Useless. Have to close the app, find it and Launch it to see the non events. Wyze on the other hand let's you get alerts only for people, if that's what you choose. Wyze will be pretty bad without service so plan on 15 to 20\/yr per camera, but way less than blink for up to 5 cameras and their AI is actually good. Week 4. After spending hours corresponding with tech support and trying all kinds of stupid steps because their device simply doesn't work, I ordered a Wyze V3 to test it out. Set it up so it sees the same area. Turned off night mode so it uses its high gain color sensor and wow. What a difference. I'm not sure everything works correctly, but even if it doesn't, what does is better than this junk.Based on all camera reviews, I purchased $3 2 year warranty just in case.Camera quality - wyze, sound and speaker - blink, notification actual - wyze, notification sound - blink (probably setting for wyze), night camera - definitely wyze. Cost \/ yr for service - wyze @15 per vs blink at 36 per or 120 for bunch. Onboard recording - wyze.No service option. Neither. It seems like with both while the camera works without annual service, with blink you need sync module which probably also has technical problems since they seem incompetent, and with wyze, they clearly disclose many limitations on alerts, recording options, review options, etc. For the effort 1.50 to $2 \/ mo will be worth having full feature set.Region marking for detection wyze. Mounting and pointing - blink. I'll have to buy better mount for wyze to put it in a good location. Probably would have with blink to.Return - BLINK IS HORRIBLE. Wyze, I don't know and hope not to. With blink, because the product didn't work so I was returning it as defective, my choices were print a label. My printer stopped working. Or stay home from work to hand the $20 junk to ups. Amazon rep had difficulty with the detail, but when I typed in all caps that no one would be home for ups, is this OK? He went away for 5 min and just gave me my money back. OK, but I really would rather return it. Of course what's the point. It doesn't work, but it probably works as well as any other new part of this item because the problems are firmware\/software.Night Vision horrible compared to Wyze V3, motion detection good when it works but non existent on transition from night to day. Picture quality OK but nowhere near wyze V3 quality.Week one.. We'll this is a bust. Tech support says. Check the early notification box. Nitwit. Is not that I don't get an early notification, it's that I get no notification, recording, etc.Basically, the camera ceases to function until I access it with the app. Seems to only happen overnight. I'll bet it has something to do with night to day transition or update check, but it's basically worthless without a Reliable detection function.Also getting late night recordings where the first 5 seconds have audio but no video. I suspect it's a prerecord feature where the light is not on until motion is detected. I like that it prerecords.Day3: tested yesterday evening and night before bed, picked up motion no problem. Walked out front door this am and nothing again. Gave it a minute. Checked app, test again nothing. Live view, lock phone, test and it picks up.Seems like you have to live view to reset which is DEFINITELY not acceptable.Day2;I have it set up so it catches my front door. Worked great first day, second morning I walked past 3 times and it occurred to me I didn't get notified. Checked, everything correct. Searched problem, apparently app is still crap. Returning defective. Not worth the $20 sale price if it doesn't detect. Was about to invest in a bunch of outdoor, but I'll go with a different brand for sure. I'll give it a week, but definitely not ordering all the other products today as I had planned.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"48 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1629158400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not a security system, just a monitor system, a mediocre one at that","reviewDescription":"I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have \"zones\" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your \"security recordings\" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"54 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1647302400000}
{"reviewTitle":"PRIMITIVE CAMERA SYSTEM STAY AWAY","reviewDescription":"This is the worst camera system ever created. The limitations of the blink cameras compared to ALL others including XX are humongous.  After having invested so much money into this system for two homes and pets, I will erase it. Here what you WILL NOT be able to do:1. Most importantly, when you are out of town and someone is guarding you house and pets, you may need to share the cameras. This is not possible or easy. With other systems you can not only chose WHICH camera to share, but also assign a completely different password to the other user. Here EITHER you share ALL, or you share NONE and the other user will have to use your email address and YOUR password to share. TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.2. The motion sensitivity is just horrible. The cameras miss so much, both outdoor and indoor! Especially during the night.3. Night vision is poor compared to other systems. Not clear and crisp with many other less expensive cameras.4. All of the sudden the cameras will stop working and you will have to plug and unplug multiple times, shorting of erasing it from the system and reset the whole thing. Now you understand that when  you are in a remote location that is unfeasible?5. For saved recordings: You cannot chose a date to see recordings only for a particular date\/day. You have to scroll all the way down each and every time. All other systems have a scroll down menu where you select the day you want to see on the calendar.6. The same problems is for deleting!!! It is so tedious and annoying. You can not touch the recording you want to delete, for example if you want to delete say 20 at the same time, with touch screen most of the systems allow you to delete the same way you do on your iphone. NO. With blink you have to delete one by one!7. ALL the pan tilt cameras in TWO different houses, and on animal rooms,stopped tilting. There is no way to get it back.  They are plugged as per instructions with authentic BLINK material -although this is never an issue with any other system-.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724025600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Easy to set up and gives peace of mind","reviewDescription":"Recently had someone pass away and this meant an elderly person was now going to be living by themselves and also, most likely may be leaving the house empty for long periods of time. We traveled there to take care of things, but before leaving, I installed two of these cameras covering all of the entrances into the house.We also interfaced them to Alexa, which we also installed, to remind them when to take their medications each day and to make it so they can just ask Alexa for help if the find they can't reach a phone for some reason.This all took only a couple of hours to set up.It far exceeded expectations.The camera view is clear. You can install an app on your phone so you can open up either camera to check in in the event someone is not answering or responding, to make sure everything is ok.I wasn't even aware this had motion detection when I bought it. We set it up so they can just tell Alexa, \"Alexa enable cameras\" before they leave the house. This is much easier for them then figuring out how to run an app on their phone and enable them. Then when they get home, they just say \"Alexa disable cameras\" followed by a password. If any motion is detected after they have been enabled, your cellphone will get a text, and a snippet of video is recorded so you can see what triggered the alert.I was so impressed with it, I bought another set for myself when I got home. I will use them whenever I travel to be able to check in on my house and make sure it is still there. The next time I visit my mother who is in her 80s, I will be installing a similar setup for her too.It just gives peace of mind to know you can check in if needed, even if you are hundreds of miles away.Another unforeseen benefit is, if the cameras are no longer communicating to the internet, you can get an alert sent to you via text. If you are away, this lets you know that either your power at your house is out, or your internet is down. If you are not away, and you are at your home, it lets you know your internet is dropping out for some reason, even if you are not actively using it.The one thing I don't like about it, I created an account for them to set everything up, but if I want to check the cameras, I have to long into the app with their account. With Alexa, I was able to easily set it up so if they aske Alexa to get help, it contacts multiple people. It would be nice if all of those same people could have access to the camera using their own account instead of having to use the primary account owners credentials. That would allow you to potentially give temporary access that could be revoked after a certain date. It would also be nice for once I have one set up in my mother's house. I will have three systems at that point I might want to check in on. It would be nice to be able to just log in as me and pick any of the three systems that I have access to to check on them, rather than having to log out and then log in as a different person for each one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"83 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670371200000}

The \"Galayou\" cameras and other Wansview compatible cameras look better, respond faster, and give you a better image quality with smoother video. I am not affiliated with any brand, it's just my honest opinion. It doesn't have to be Galayou in specific, just buy another brand of camera with an sd card slot at leastOn top of that, Blink cameras are essentially useless without the paid subscription. If you don't pay, all you can do with the cameras is watch a short clip IF motion is captured. No live-view, and no recording on demand. They are also only cloud-based devices, so if your internet goes out or someone were to jam\/deauthenticate the network, no footage will be captured.All of these issues are alleviated with any camera that has an sd card slotI do not recommend Blink cameras at all","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1724803200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Horrible security camera","reviewDescription":"Why? Because it doesn't do anything you need a security camera to do.1. There are no time\/date stamps on the video. The camera saves the clip with the name being the date of the clip and camera name. Take that to court and best of luck proving that video\/audio was taken at the time\/date u named it.2. \"Saved\" clips are still automatically deleted by the app once it passes the \"save for x days\" mark. Awesome, thanks.3. You cannot download more than one clip at a time. So if u leave for the day, and someone is robbing or vandalizing or worse at or near your home, you now have DAYS of homework to do. 10 hours divided by 30 seconds is ridiculous! I almost went full fight club on the blink after trying to download just 30 minutes of videos.4. Imagine #3 if ur away on vacation! Days or a week. Not gonna happen.5. There is no setting to make it continue recording while motion is going on. It has to be retriggered. There will be a clip of someone walking into frame and doing things. 30 seconds later the video stops until it resets and retriggers.  It is random how long that takes, but it could be the 15 seconds it took them to grab the thing in full view and turn their back. So you'll have a juice video of them walking away and no proof of your property in their hands.6. I know all of this bcz I have been trying to submit video footage from 32 hours that I was gone to the police and my HOA. I now have NOTHING that will prove that the guys \"standing in front of the window of my house\" where my blink camera is located,  actually were the ones that broke in!Thanks for a complete misrepresentation of your product.

{"reviewTitle":"Not quite ready for duty","reviewDescription":"Last update 1\/6\/2022The basic job of this camera is to detect motion 24 x 7.When it works, it works well.(I wish the Blink outdoor ones are like that capturing motion a few seconds before it starts (at least when plugged in).)Video is clear.Microphone seems to pick up sound pretty well.I would have given this camera at least a 4 stars if not because of a day one bug that is still hauntingthe users despite support said they are working on a fix with no ETA.My camera firmware version is 9.74.Still no fix in sight as of this review revision.It seems like the camera just failed to match the exposure to the environment at all times.When the camera experience a transition from dark to bright, it failed to adjust its exposure (thus over exposed) and missed most motion until it gets dark again.If you wave your hand very close to the camera, you may get the camera to work again as the camera will adjust its exposure to the environment once motion is detected.The suggested workaround by Blink is to disable\/enable the camera daily after dawn.  That adds another 15 mins of uncertainty.This workaround doesn't really solve scenarios at night though.If I keep a light on for the camera at night so that it doesn't adjust its exposure too much, that seems to help.If the camera experience more motions during the night to day transition, it seems to help.If I am using the camera in an always dark environment so that IR mode is always on, that seems to work too.Need to test these workarounds for a longer period of time to know for sure.BLINK, PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!No reason customer has to waste their time to figure out how to work around a day one defect.The Activity Zones setting is pretty coarse like the XT instead of XT2.Each motion video can be recorded between 5 and 30 seconds.Live view on phone app will pause every 60 seconds.I also ran into random minor issues once in a while:1) Camera setting is not in sync with the app settings.2) Recorded clip is not the specified length without changing anything.3) Playback progress bar is out of sync with the video.4) First playback seems to take quite some time before it can start.5) Notification of motion can be a min or two behind.  Typically it only takes 2-3 seconds if early notification is on.Some of the above can be related to the day one bug.Would be useful to have the following:1) Allow retrigger time to be set to zero so there is no additional uncertainty.2) Time stamp on the video.2) Report number of times a camera failed to notify motion due to intermittent communication issues.3) Continuous live view as an option even in the Blink outdoor case (at the expense of battery life).4) Skip notification for individual camera but continue to detect and record motion.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1609200000000}

One of the Blink Mini Camera's stopped working.  I initiated contact with Blink Support about getting an RMA on Nov 21.  On Dec 2nd, they finally took a look at the Blink logs (that I had given them access too on Nov 22).  After looking at the logs they finally decided that it was a hardware issue.  On Dec 5th, an RMA was issued.Today is Dec 17th, 2023 - I still have not received the replacement.Even after more than a few contacts with Blink Support over weeks - Blink has not replaced a Mini that Support says has a hardware issue and was purchased directly from Amazon.com - and the Blink Mini is still covered by the 1 year warranty - buyer beware - warranties are only as good as their Leadership team allows.edit: Dec 18, 2023 Called Blink - was hung up on by support staff when I asked for more help.  Called again, I was on the phone for an about 45min, while they tried to figure out where the RMA was.  As it turns out, Blink Support staff who answer the phone don't have access to the RMA replacement tracking number - so support staff who answer the phone or reply to emails can't really help - I had to give them the tracking number.  But, they still could not figure out what happened.  They said they would call me  back after looking into it more.  I will be calling again.Called again, finally got a reasonable customer service response.  They are resending the RMA.  Replacement arrived Dec 22, 2023, a little over one month from when I first contacted Blink about a malfunctioning Mini.  This process cost me about 15 hours of my time.Buyer beware - Blink support delays warranty replacements.  It took me 15 hours of my time to get a replacement.  Warranty support is only as good as the company that backs the warranty - in this case, it actually cost me 15 hours of my time to get a warranty replacement for an item that I could buy new for about $20.00 (Common price after discount from MSRP).  15 Hours for a replacement indicates an environment that management has designed to run up 3rd party support costs and discourage customers from seeking help from support.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702857600000}

I contacted support through the app they take forever sometimes a whole day to get back to you not only that the phone number they have listed rings and rings and rings and Rings no one ever answers so that is useless. After a lot of back and forth which took a lot of days they had me download an app I sent them the Code this app checks the device, they told me in that conversation but that camera was defected and said they would send me a new one. They never said anything about returning that camera and after thinking I am not going to try to connect with support again I'll just call Amazon because I'm honest and did not want to keep it plus it I told them I wanted to find out how to return it and the woman I spoke with was absolutely wonderful with me. So after having UPS print a label for me she said they would pick it up as long as I had the Box taped up and we could put the label on it and they would take it and bring it back to Amazon I got a receipt to check the tracking it has been returned. Now after all of that support sends me any mail which is how they have been conversing with me to say like a print the label they sent me in the email so I could return it to the support center, I could not print it because my printer is broken and I proceeded to tell them I called Amazon and it was being returned back there.

Before I purchased the cloud service, the system would randomly refuse to write to the USB drive. Now that I've purchased the cloud service, the blink module never succeeds with backing up the videos to the USB drive.Restart it, redo the whole system (adding all cameras again), log out, log in, reposition the module, sacrifice a goat .. doesn't matter.It simply works whenever it does, and you can't predict when that will be.The doorbell, as wasn't clearly advertised, is not capable of running off the electrical power supplied to the unit from the doorbell transformer. It eats very expensive batteries. Probably 10 every four months.The XT2 units are relatively ok in function, but again, do eat batteries.The best of the best has been the indoor units. Pretty solid, but useless whenever the module randomly decides it doesn't want to work for a few days.But this review is mainly about the Blink Solar mounts.I purchased three Blink Solar units whenever they were at a steep discount in December '22.Just got around to hanging them up, and I now know why they were so cheap.The solar panels included with Blink Solar simply do not function. The main reason I purchased them is that they are supposed to be powered by the sun, so that I don't have to keep shelling out money to feed them.I received three units, and not one of the solar panels produce an adequate voltage to charge the included battery (YES, I PULLED THE TAB).I am in the sunk cost fallacy zone here .. continue to pay the service fee for the cloud service, purchase solar panels and mounts from a 3rd party that are highly reputed to work for an additional $200, and continue feeding batteries, or cut my losses and just hard-wire some IP cameras with an NVR.If I would've just spent the $500 I've invested for everything so far, I would have had a much better system.If you're reading this, and you're considering entering the Blink ecosystem .. even at a steep discount ...

It is quiteinconvenient to have to check the app every time to see what is going on.It takes almost as long as getting up. So I have found myself just gettingup more than checking the cameras. I need to check out what is happening inreal time not what hit the servers, authenticated, bounced around and came backto me. When I check while in the house there is at least a 20 second delay.20 seconds can make a world of difference with a 6 and 2 year old in eachother's company.After writing this and analyzing my experience so far I think that I willjust return them. I basically just wanted some WI-FI cameras to make suremy kids were ok while I worked at my desk. Set up motion sense to record onto adrive while we were out.It is sad because the camera quality itself is great. They feel nice andsolid. The speakers and mics are good quality and clear on both ends. Thepictures are crisp and need no focusing. The price point may be too low.$10 or $15 more for longer cords with slim, wall-hugging plugs, anddevelopment of an app that works the same across all devices, PC included.Also the ability to watch cameras in real-time, WI-FI mode while connectedto your home network. And 2 way communication work through the Show devices.To boot after and initial \"Free trial period\" you have to pay a monthly sub fee of up$20 just to use them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"71 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1592611200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Once you have to pay for a subscription, activations become sketchy. **Plus an update**","reviewDescription":"**Update** So a Blink rep contacted me after I posted this review and wrote that it was obvious that the blink mini was not working properly at all and that there was probably a problem with the unit. Though my goal was only to get the camera to work as promised, or get a replacement, the rep upgraded our blink mini to either the Indoor or Outdoor camera. We chose the outdoor and received it, and the synch hub within a couple days. I had to take a star away from my initial review because since connecting the camera, it has not worked properly. There were no activations- even when I stood right in front of and even touched the camera! What?! Then, things changed. Around 5pm, activation after activation notice started blowing up my phone. When reviewing the near 50 clips this morning, only one showed anything- a clip of the night sky quickly turning to bright blue. Literally nothing else was in the clip. I continue to get clips of nothing, but when I know people have walked in front of the camera because I see them, there is no recording. No activation. No protection. I emailed the rep over 5 hours ago asking for direction and help to make sure everything was connected and updated and whatever correctly on my end, but have heard nothing back yet. I saw a review that said to hang in and wait for 24 hours because he had similar issues. After 24 hours, he said his camera basically fixed itself and started working as promised. Well, this new camera's 24 hours is almost up and I have yet to see any improvements in service. Very annoying and makes me feel scammed.I really wanted to love this camera- especially since being able to get it at a great price. At the start, activations were not always good- sometimes the camera would send recorded clips that showed nothing in frame that would have activated it, or would not be activated at all when people were standing right in front of the camera. Once we had to pay for the subscription service, quality plummeted. I tried everything I could find online- google, reddit, blink's help hub to no avail. I tried facing the camera inside and would walk around in front of it and it was only a 50\/50 chance that it would pick up even that movement. I tried all kinds of lighting conditions, placements, and suggestions that I found and thought of before finally contacting customer support. After about a bajillion activations during the time period I gave them access to my camera, they said everything looked fine. They also said that my account showed numerous activations so that it seemed as though the camera was constantly recording-  all during the time period in which they were in the account! Had they viewed the previous months, they would have seen that this was not the issue I was asking for help with and explaining over and over. At the end of a few days and numerous emails and no fixes or workable solutions or suggestions, they blew me off and sent me a CS satisfaction survey. So in all, since they've already gotten their money, they would no longer help me. I complied with\/tried everything they said, am technically savvy, and now am just mad that I lost money on a shoddy camera and very shoddy subscription service.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1628899200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Blink Camera Review - it's a toy. Unreliable Performance unless for novelty","reviewDescription":"Summary: I've been using Blink cameras (total of 9) across two locations for some time now, and unfortunately, their reliability has been consistently poor. While they occasionally detect motion and record clips, it's completely unpredictable. Cameras might pick up insignificant movement such as an insect in flight but miss major events like a car entering the garage. Days can pass without a captured event on a camera, with numerous people passing in its path, and then it will record several instances of a small dog walking past. The capturing of events appears to be almost entirely random.  This inconsistency renders them unusable for any serious security purposes.Pros:  User-friendly and reasonably well-designed app  Convenient wireless and battery-operated functionality (for some models)  Attractive price point (if the devices functioned as intended)  Fair image and audio qualityCons:  Highly unreliable motion detection - Cameras miss crucial events while recording irrelevant ones.  Inconsistent performance across all cameras at two different locations.  Lacks trustworthiness as a security camera due to unpredictable behavior.Overall: Blink cameras seem more like novelty devices than reliable security solutions.Update. I now have 10 of these cameras. They are only for novelty use. They are toys and are absolutely not for security purposes. An insect might activate motion sensing now and then, but the garage door opening, a car driving in and people walking around may not. Blink had no response other than they typical advice to check my device settings (done repeatedly), reconnect my device (also done repeatedly)... If you want to connect in manually to see if the dogs are barking, you can usually do that. If you think you might catch a thief in the act of carrying your big screen TV out the door, though, good luck. They can walk right past your Blink cam & you may never know.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714003200000}
{"reviewTitle":"UPDATED - MUST READ REVIEW - This is NOT a security camera","reviewDescription":"UPDATED:Do not use this product or the subscription service.Amazon and Blink were supposed to cancel our subscription months ago but instead, didn't cancel our subscription and have charged us again without our permission. The Amazon\/Blink support suck.  Now I'll have to file a dispute with our bank due to all this. The cameras a re junk, they do not work as advertised.I purchased 2 Blink Mini smart security cameras and my intention was to use these cameras as they were advertised; as  \u201csmart security cameras\u201d.The advertising, and the listing title, is at best, misleading, and possibly false advertising.If your intention is to purchase the Blink Mini to use as a security camera (as it's advertised),STOP.Read this entire review before you make the mistake that I made.The cameras themselves are of good quality and the recorded streams are more than adequate. The up to 60- day clip retention on the plan I purchased is a good feature.Setting up the cameras was easy and quick.The app works well and the settings are presented well and are clearly named as to what their functions are.ISSUES1. Customer support is a coin-toss. You might get a knowledgable rep who completely understands the product, or, you might get a rep who is completely clueless. For example: One rep that I spoke with didn't know the difference between a data connection and a Wi-Fi connection. Another rep understood the situation competently, but was still unable to do anything about the issues outlined below.2. The camera either stops recording, or the server doesn't retain recorded streams. This happens intermittently \u2013 maybe once or twice a day \u2013 still way too much for a product that bills itself as a security cam. You can google this issue and find many results that explain it away by saying that this issue is caused by a weak Wi-Fi signal. I experience this issue and have a strong Wi-Fi signal.3. Maximum 30-second recording time. That's not enough recording time for this product to claim it's a security cam. Additionally, the retrigger time, sensitivity, and activity zones features do not work correctly, if at all. It's great camera to watch your pet dog or cat and say hello to them through the camera's microphone, but that's about it.4. The cameras cannot be used with any other cloud storage service.I only have myself to blame for not researching this product as thoroughly as I should have. With a useless product, I can't even transfer the annual plan to another person.This review is solely my opinion about this product\/service and you might find that your experience differs from mine. With that said, I cannot recommend this product\/service and highly recommend that potential buyers think very carefully before purchasing it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665100800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Beyond Disappointed & Warning on Blink RMA Policy!","reviewDescription":"Let me first say that I do not typically write reviews. However, this experience warrants one to warn other potential buyers of Blink's RMA Policy, especially if you have purchased more than 1 camera.For the record, I have ordered and used other Amazon Cameras with great success - really like them. They are easy to install and use and have never had an issue.With Blink however,  I had an issue immediately.  After hours of trouble shooting alone and  then with Blink Customer Service, it was determined the 2-way microphones were not working and live view created constant clicking noise when \"push to talk\" was selected.  All features (microphone allowed) were enabled on 2 different cell phones (my iPhone 13 & my Android) and Blink App.  Microphones did not work.The Blink Customer Service Rep was good and followed her trouble shooting script. However, my issue resides with the Blink RMA Policy.  After spending 1 hour and 40 minutes re-trouble shooting all the steps I had previously taken multiple times (unplug cameras, delete cameras, delete app, delete account and re-create\/add all checking all settings which were confirmed on) camera 2-way microphone did not work.  I was then told that an RMA would be issued, but for only 1 of my 2 cameras. I requested an RMA for 2 cameras and was told it is against their policy.  I would have to wait to receive a new camera, send back 1 damaged camera and wait until diagnosed - and then what?!  I asked for an RMA for my second camera and was told it is against their policy -unacceptable and poor customer service policy.  I explained these are for home security and I do not want to be without my second camera, still no RMA. I asked why they made me trouble shoot both cameras for 1 hour 40 minutes if only one would be RMA'd?! So, I then asked to speak to a supervisor\/manager and was told one is not available and would call me back within 1 day --  also not acceptable!I simply requested an RMA for 2 cameras and was denied.  So, countless hours at home trouble shooting, 1 hour 40 minutes re-trouble shooting, camera approved for RMA (but only 1)  all for 2 x$35 cameras. So not worth my time or money spent.

From the wired floodlight just not connecting at all, to the lovely random outdoor cam going offline.Today, or should I say this morning I came out to my sync module that was no longer connected to the router less than  foot away. So, after resetting the sync module and connecting everything, I then could go to work late. Yup that's my mornings now. Try to get the cameras up and working, hope they stay active and try to get to work on time. I just don't think the tech was ready with this brand, low quality.One star from me. And that star is only for the customer service guy who tried to help, but this is a lost cause.I have checked my internet and have actually expanded it to better work with the broad placement of the cameras.

Save yourself from the headache I have created for myself.Update 12.05.23So I have a ticket in with customer service for this and all the rest of the 10 Blink cameras I \"invested\" in. Numerous problems that cannot be resolved at the user level. From being notified via push on my phone of motion alerts, and then nothing in clips to review, to cameras just shutting down. The representative read my email which stated ,\"I have been sick, and not up to climbing on a ladder to get you the serial numbers to all these cameras. I know you want close this ticket, but you will.have to wait until I feel better to get you the numbers off the cameras\". The \"Customer service \" person seemed to think that meant close it out, We're done with you. I wanted to add this to my review to show my experience with their customer support. Not good.

Second, the camera light turns on and makes an loud click\/buzz that sounds like an electrical spark every time you click the play button on the app, which absolutely freaks my dogs out when I try to watch them on the cameras. Trying to switch between watching one camera to the other is nearly impossible, because it always says that the system is busy and I'll have to cancel out of the app completely and start over again to view the other camera. God forbid you unplug the camera or the power goes out, the system freaks out and makes you reset the cameras before you can view them again. I have had nothing but issues with the system and it has been so inconsistent and finicky about everything. I chose not to pay for the app because I didn't need to record videos or have the motion sensors on, but I didn't realize that if you don't buy the app, you can't watch the videos live for more than like 60 seconds at a time before the feed times out and makes you click through to play the camera again - which constantly gets angry and says the system is busy.

{"reviewTitle":"Known Issue Causes Camera to Become Unresponsive and Not Sense Motion with IR","reviewDescription":"I was excited about this camera and it worked as advertised for about a week. Then one morning I came into my office and it didn't alert upon me entering. I couldn't get it to trigger with motion no matter what I did. This continued more days than not. If I opened the app and did a live view, it would \"wake up\" and work, but any time the IR turned on in the dark, it would subsequently not turn off as it should, so once there was light again, the screen could not sense motion because the IR was stuck on (IR + light = white screen).Upon contacting support (after many other unrelated troubleshooting steps), they informed me \"the issue you are experiencing is the known issue about blink mini where it doesn't detect motion and displays red\" and \"we are still working to get this fixed because the way this camera is designed is the reason why this known issue is created. Basically, this happens when there are rapid light changes in front of the camera, especially in the garage, when you open the door or turn on the light, these can cause the IR filter to get stuck, and the motion won't work unless you issue a command.\"I can say from my experience that the issue is not limited to rapid light changes. I have a window in my office, and every night when it gets dark, the IR comes on. Then, when the sun rises, the IR refuses to turn off and the camera gets stuck. I can \"issue a command\" (basically interact with the camera in any way through the app) to get the camera to work again, but I wanted reliable notifications of motion without having to remember to open the app every day and do a live view some time after sunrise.Support did offer that I could do a scheduled disarm\/arm command so this interaction would happen automatically, but scheduling it to arm when it was already armed didn't work, and disarming then arming it would require 15 minutes of downtime between the two commands. While the likelihood of anything being missed during those 15 minutes was very low, I purchased a camera based on the promise of uninterrupted monitoring, which this does not provide. I also have no good way of knowing when to schedule a command like that since I don't know at what point it becomes \"stuck\" as the sun comes up, and that time would change throughout the year and based on weather. Amazon kindly returned it for me outside of the return window (since the return window closed before we got to the \"known issue\" in troubleshooting).If you don't need IR or automatic motion detection after the IR has been triggered and before you interact with the camera, this would probably be a good camera for you. I essentially wanted a security camera in an office during the day and night, and while this was advertised as that, it isn't until they fix this issue.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1629072000000}

Camera in one room kept hover off over and over for approximately 30 plus times yet NO ONE Ws in the room. Today there was HIGH ACTIVITY IN BOTH ROOMS WHERE MY TWO CAMERAS ARE LOCATED... not one camera detect any motion for hours. Last night it did not detect motion when there was motion yet went off when no motion. Return\/ exchange time has passed a few days ago. So I am stuck with this trash. I waited thinking an update would be in place to repair bugs because I was not dealing with one camera so unless both are defective which is not probable, they are just TRASH. Returns during holidays need to be extended on ANY and EVERY PURCHASE. Got stuck with several things causing lost of hard earned money. It seems as if the camera(s) record when they want to.... not when they should or when you really need to go back and view to see what happened. Every time I want to watch something that has happened it\u2019s not caught in camera. It records then stops to reset during what I need to look back on. Last night there was several hours of no motion detection during high activity time. One camera shows son walking toward camera yet second camera did not detect anything in the other room he entered. At one point when it did detect pictures are clear then suddenly you barely see video. Cameras firmware just updated so I will see how the motion recording goes today\/this evening. If it\u2019s better I will update if not I will look to replace. Both cameras use to make a loud noise (click) when they would start recording which they no longer do. Glad not to hear the clicking but I need these to record. I would keep because I purchased them both with a bundle deal. Good for live viewing from a different room but not when you need to know what HAS ALREADY HAPPENED or when you\u2019re home. When it doesn\u2019t capture a pet I was disappointed but when it fails to capture a person then something is definitely wrong. Keep in mind I have two cameras with exact issues, which lead me to believe it is the quality of the camera and not a defective camera. Will purchase something better for the two important rooms and move these to area I was only considering and use for live view. (BLINK THANKS FOR THE ECTRA EXPENSE) Extremely disappointed. I don\u2019t like doing returns and hate doing exchanges because I find those more complicated but don\u2019t have a choice at this point. Not worth having two useless cameras. Although I am sure I stated I use them for live viewing that also fails very often. When you hear a noise and need to see what is happening you need a reliable camera that will start fairly quickly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Now I understand why they added them to a bundle deal only way to get rid of stock.

{"reviewTitle":"It's Not Worth It","reviewDescription":"REVISED REVIEW:  Don't bother. Its useless without a subscription and it's just not very reliable. There's a delay on the devices after it detects something so you're always behind a good 7 seconds after you get warning a motion was detected.  Its pretty much useless if you want to stick it in a window pointing outside because the blue sensor light bounces off the window and it simply won't give you an image unless you like staring at a giant white orb. The app is faulty and doesn't always work and frankly the monthly subscription isn't worth it. I wouldn't bother with the blink at all. Amazon needs to get their sh!t together.Here is my FIRST REVIEW: I have two hooked up. One in my main Kitchen area in front of the entrance to my very tiny apartment and another in the window facing the entire outside entrance to where I live. The one facing the window really only works during the daytime. As one reviewer pointed out there is a reflection that mirrors off the device and basically creates a giant, white orb that's impossible to view or detect anything at night. The one in my kitchen area works well and the night vision is impressive but the camera as a whole misses the point. First, it's wired and you're limited as to where you can put it. Second, it's obviously not weather proof and you can't hide it somewhere outdoors. If you're trying to detect intruders coming from outdoors at night you're basically screwed because of that stupid sensor. It's also constantly buffering despite the fact that I have a reasonable high speed internet connection. It's also got some sort of delay that takes a little getting used too. For example, when it detects motion you basically have to remember that it's a recorded clip you're given warning about and have to wait for the damn thing to present it to you BEFORE you can watch it in live mode which is also REALLY annoying. I'm on day two of my free trial subscription (which is really sneaky price wise when the free trial ends) and I'm on the fence about it.  It also has an issue when hooked up to your Alexa devices. I have three different generations of Echos.

Little did I know that letting a friend borrow them would turn into the ultimate exercise in futility. Here\u2019s the kicker: I got the cameras back, but because my so-called friend registered them and never removed them from her account, they\u2019ve basically turned into expensive paperweights.I contacted customer service, expecting a simple fix. Spoiler alert: There\u2019s nothing they can do! WOW! It seems that these cameras are more loyal to the account they\u2019re registered with than a dog to its owner. So, unless I manage to summon some magical tech powers or get back in touch with that elusive friend, I might as well toss these in the trash.Bottom line: I didn\u2019t just lose a friend; I lost the functionality of my cameras too. If you\u2019re looking for a product that you can never fully own or control, even after purchase, this is it. Five stars for the concept, zero for execution and customer support.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1724198400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Save your money because cameras are useless if account after 2020","reviewDescription":"camera is basically useless after the free trial is over with. Now I have to find a new way to keep my eyes on my home when not at home. I understand a subscription but when you want to self monitor they need an option that will record while you are viewing it live so in the event of something going on at the house I can continue to watch and call 911 and tell them what\u2019s going on and have it all saved to go back over later on for training and teach my children what they could have done better and how to learn from a situation like that in the event I\u2019m not able to help. Also I hate that while viewing I have to continue to push the continue button to keep watching as it is so annoying. If I didn\u2019t want to view I wouldn\u2019t be viewing. Please disable that and fix it to have continuous viewing along with continuous recording. Until then I will no longer recommend blink products. I have a useless paperweight that really isn\u2019t going to hold a piece of paper down. People nowadays like the option to self monitor and record without having to pay a subscription. Only 10 cameras for the largest subscription offered and that\u2019s the most stupidest thing. If I was gonna pay I would want to pay that one fee for everything on my account. I can pay $20 a month for someone else to monitor my home and have fire and carbon monoxide monitoring with it so when I decide to self monitor an you want me to pay for your services then I need to be able for all of my cameras to be included in your subscription fees. If you want to change that and keep it at the same price then maybe I might pay and buy more cameras so I can self monitor but until then thanks for nothing but wasting my time and money. I don\u2019t want to buy extra products to make something work unless it is gonna do what I need it to do and that\u2019s to record as I watch it live. I am beyond pissed at the service for these cameras. I thought I was buying something that was gonna work the way I wanted it to especially when buying a camera that\u2019s way overpriced in the first place and shouldn\u2019t be more than $10 to begin with since they constantly move on their own when sitting in an area no one goes near because the cord is heavier than the camera and double sided tape won\u2019t stick good to it to help hold it and even when adding a rubber mat under it or hot glue dots to the bottom it doesn\u2019t help to keep it from moving. All accounts should get the same up to so much storage to record and view and not just old accounts. I\u2019m so disappointed in blink for this and wasting my time and money for something I can no longer use without paying a monthly fee when I bought this for self monitoring like they said I could do but NOPE you can\u2019t.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1610323200000}

It does click VERY loudly when it's recording, and you can hear it 15+ feet away which is annoying. I'd rather not hear it all the time. My cat also caught on the first time and now stares at it with her face right in it, smacks it and activates it way more than it needs to be activated. It is activated by shadows. If someone walks by and the curtains are open it activates. I have tons of clips daily of nothing because the curtains are open and it's sunny and someone walked by the window inside the house - not even in view of the camera...behind the camera! The live view is basically USELESS. If something is happening that I need to see more of & I click on LIVE it just doesn't work and stops. Also, the 10 second break between recordings needs to be optional. Important occurrences have been cut off in this time period. If something is happening why does it stop recording?! Even more importantly, if someone was robbing your house do you want it to STOP for 10 seconds then start again when the person has left? Those 10 second breaks could be the time (s)he looks right at the camera! There is no option to remove this break which is ridiculous. I have missed important events because of this. There need to be an option for longer recordings without a 10 second gap every 30 seconds.The positives: the clips are clear, even in the dark.Would I buy this again.

{"reviewTitle":"Hope You Never Move & That Their Cloud Service Works Indefinitely","reviewDescription":"The Blink Mini worked really great out-of-the-box when I first bought it. The moment I changed the SSID of the camera and the SSID of the network it became completely confused about what to do. Deleting the save camera settings and adding it again via the QR code added the camera but it then continued to add itself automatically to a neighbor's wireless network somehow. Even by overriding this with my own network, which it said it was connected to, it continued to search for the camera even though it had found it during the process off asking for the QR code. It appears that if I had not changed any settings ever after initial installation camera would have been great. If you never plan to move or change network settings this camera may be great for you. Otherwise be cautious and look into alternatives. This was my first foray into motion cameras and I am pretty disappointed as a simple change of settings has rendered it useless.EDIT: Customer Support had very helpful to troubleshoot the problems I had and now there's another problem about it saving to a cloud service. If that service happens to be down, which it has been down several times, it does not save the clip that is picked up from motion nor can any other clips be view in the app. Is there an option to store everything locally that I am missing? It really needs to have this feature.EDIT: It took two days for the cloud service to respond and suddenly 40 videos show up in the video section of the app. That is not helpful at all if that sort of delay is going to be consistent.EDIT: Moved the camera again and resetting everything has proven fruitless. No blinking light and it is connected to the new wireless network. After the first incident I was given another camera but it is still sealed in the box as there is no point in opening it unless there is actually something wrong with the one I have. This camera seems to work well for others judging from the reviews so maybe I got a lemon. I do not know but I am tired of bothering with something that was supposed to be a breeze to set-up. I am ignoring the Blink line of products from now on.Edit: As stated before the cloud service stops working and asks for a subscription. This is very silly as being able to save videos locally is not a new feature to cameras on a network. Now the camera is useless without purchasing additional hardware such as the sync module. Very disappointed I chose to go with Blink and wish I had known how this was going to go down the road. Do not buy this camera unless you are willing to pay for a subscription or if you are buying the sync module too.

{"reviewTitle":"Subpar Video Quality, Night Vision, and Motion Detection","reviewDescription":"Despite its compact design and advertised features, the Blink Mini indoor intelligent security camera has proven to be frustrating and disappointing in my experience.One of the significant drawbacks is the video quality. Despite being marketed as 1080p HD, clarity needs to be improved. The video feed often appears grainy, and details may need to be captured more crisply. This compromises the camera's primary function of providing precise and reliable surveillance.Night vision, another highlighted feature, has its shortcomings. The infrared illumination could be more effective than expected, resulting in a lack of visibility in low-light conditions. This undermines the camera's performance during crucial nighttime surveillance, leaving blind spots that defeat the purpose of having a security camera.The motion detection system, while present, is overly sensitive and prone to false alarms. This can particularly frustrate users who expect a reliable and accurate detection system. The constant notifications for insignificant movements diminish the overall effectiveness of the security camera.Setup, touted as \"easy,\" may not be as straightforward for everyone. Users have reported connectivity issues during the setup process, leading to delays and frustration. The user interface for configuring settings and accessing footage may also be less intuitive than anticipated, adding to the overall user dissatisfaction.Additionally, the reliance on cloud storage for recorded footage raises privacy and security concerns for some users. The lack of local storage options means relying on Blink's cloud service, which may not be suitable for users who prioritize keeping their footage secure within their premises.In conclusion, despite its compact size, the Blink Mini indoor intelligent security camera needs to improve in terms of video quality, night vision, motion detection, and overall user experience. Users seeking a more reliable and advanced indoor security solution may want to explore alternative options in the market.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702425600000}

I am glad I did.  This is literally the worst camera that I have ever used.  I bought the mini because it had \"extended view\" which is supposed to allow 90 minutes of viewing time before the camera shut off.  WRONG.  More like a random time between 2 and 30 minutes.  It NEVER stays on.  I am constantly trying to click play on it and MOST of the time it just keeps saying the camera is busy and won't go live until I try it over and over again about a dozen times.  The camera is not busy and it is not even recording when I try to start it.As for recording, half  the time it doesn't record when cars or people go by ...oh but if the clouds cast a shadow on the ground for a minute, that is a whole different story.What is the point in night vision on this?  I have it in the window and all the night vision does is glares on the window.  I tried it outside and the night vision is virtually useless.  It's like a kid's toy.I hop you don't ahve it hooked up to Alexa.  Every time you ask Alexa a question, the cameras turn off.  When you are using the camera, you can't set a time, check the time, ask a question, or anything.

Garbage and I\u2019m returning it.Bottom line, if someone knows you\u2019re going to be away from your home and say, in airplane mode on a long flight, they can come into your home during that time and you\u2019d be none the wiser because the Blink app will not record and store their movement while your cell phone is off line - and, won\u2019t alert you when you\u2019re back online\/out of airplane mode. See below for more details.Wife and I bought it to secure our house while away on a hiking trip. We armed the camera when we left for our trip and pointed it directly at our door where all family\/visitors always enter. Before leaving for our trip we did a few test runs with the camera in \u201carmed\u201d mode. It picked up our motion and recorded our movements each time without missing a beat.Fast forward, we leave for our trip out west with the camera armed. We were hiking in remote areas with no cell reception. When we returned into cell range, there were no alerts that any motion had been detected nor that anyone had been in our home. Wife then gets a text from her in laws that they\u2019re at our house and have been there for a few hours. I check the Blink app and it says our camera is armed, yet no alerts re anyone entering our home - and, no videos of them entering our home. Then, about 5 mins after being in cell range the alerts on my Blink app start blowing up, but it\u2019s all from current movement in my home not past movements when my family first came over and came through the door at which the camera is pointed.What good is a security camera when you have to have cell reception for it to actually record and send you alerts?! It should record and store even when you\u2019re not in cell range and then save the videos and alert you when you come back in range. It doesn\u2019t do that. Even the Canary (which we used to have and was marginal at best) would record videos and keep them stored and immediately alert you once you\u2019re back in range that someone had been in your home.Again, don\u2019t waste your money. Get a real alarm system from a legit company if you want something that works like it should and spend the $$$.

I'm an IT guy so understand the quirks of wifi signal, setup. etc.Over time, things stopped working.  A camera would just go \"offline\".  Thumbnails and Live views would not work.  Would only trigger one out of maybe 10 times.  In the end, out of two floodlight cams, 5 or 6 outdoor cams, and multiple sync modules, it's all failed.  Today was the last straw, I still had one brand new cam and new sync module, figured I would rip all the existing config out and start from scratch with new hardwares, batteries, etc..  Can't even add a new cam with a new sync module anymore.

I should've returned them while I was still in the window. Lack of simple common sense features in the app, and other issues, are EXTREMELY aggrevating to say the least.First, actual issues I've experienced...1.) Cameras randomly decide to stop working. If I don't remember to disarm and arm daily, it seems one or two randomly just stop recording (even though app shows they are armed)2.) LIVE mode freezes then cuts out completely. I'm lucky to maintain 20 seconds on it. Videos upload flawlessly to the web, however.3.) Seems to be quite some time in between clips, sometimes 20 seconds. I got these to monitor my cats while I'm away, as well as front door \/ vehicle. And its pretty clear that there's at least 15 seconds or more in between clips, regardless of playing with settings.Now for my annoyances! If these were corrected, the rest I'd live with.Why the heck is there a snooze option of only up to 4 hours? Most people sleep on average for 8 hours. Heck, why stop there? Perhaps a \"custom\" number of hours you could set, even 24?There should be an option in each camera to completely disable notifications for that specific camera. Wouldn't this just be common sense? Some cameras you'll want notifications, others you may not.And the last EXTREMELY annoying non existent feature... The FILTER settings under Clips, don't stick when you move between Home \/ Clips \/ Settings tabs. If I'm ignoring a couple of cameras or a system, I have to click Filter, and unchecked it, any time I do anything in the app.Whoever develops this app clearly doesn't actually use it, nor consider all of the scenarios average people would use these for.

{"reviewTitle":"Very disappointing","reviewDescription":"Hey Blink Camera, I was given a Blink camera about six months ago and I used it for a month and once my free subscription was up I decided to go ahead and purchase three cameras, the ring doorbell and the sync module. The picture quality is good, the voice quality on them is good but when I have the motion activated sensors on, my cameras are intermitting. I stood in front of the camera with the motion sensor on and wave and jump up and down and it never activated. That\u2019s not just one camera that\u2019s all four of the cameras I have. Two cameras point outside were  my vehicle is at and I\u2019ll come home to a vehicle in front of my apartment and when I look on the cameras it never caught anything. I just came home today and the vehicle was parked in my spot and when I looked on the camera there was nothing there. When it did show the vehicle in front of my apartment, it was picking up a vehicle on the road. It never picked up when the vehicle pulled in and parked. I heard some talking outside and looked out my window and saw the guy getting in his car and again my cameras never picked it up. I even tried to look at the live view but the live you would never come up. Then all of a sudden it says my camera is off-line, just that one none of the other cameras. That is another issue I have. If it was my Internet then all the cameras should be off-line but all the cameras are intermitting. What\u2019s the point in having these cameras if there not gonna work like they\u2019re supposed to. I\u2019ve cancel my yearly subscription and I\u2019m looking at different cameras.

My son bought a small camera for his room just to have, and his camera doesn\u2019t require a subscription or anything, you can use an SD card or if you want to store stuff on their server you would have to pay for that.

I attached a video to show the quality of this camera working outside of its scope. It's literally pitch black outside (quiet\/dark neighborhood) and the night vision on this camera is incredible (and on the lowest setting). In the beginning of the video you can see the camera get nearly destroyed (our fault for not securing it) but it's still working! Installation and set up is too easy and I'm shocked the wifi reaches since it's at the farthest point from the router (maybe 30meters and 3 walls).

{"reviewTitle":"Serviceable, but the plan makes a difference.","reviewDescription":"If you\u2019re looking for a cheap quick solution for monitoring something then Blink is your company. Their wireless cameras are cheap and work great will under a subscription plan and are usable but noticeably different out of plan. They work, bottom line is you\u2019ll get some activity on them just apply the rule of \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d.The longer version: I\u2019ve had blink cameras for over 3 years now, 3 mini\u2019s, 5 blink 3rd gen, 2 blink 4th gen and a doorbell. Like you I was searching for options to monitor my house, dogs and wildlife and based on reviews it was really a no brainer. Without getting into it all, I noticed significant differences in motion detection while in subscription\/trial and out of it. The delayed alert was expected, however the actual motion capture became apparent as soon as the 30 days ended. I\u2019ve been in trials a few time, first buying 3 outdoor cameras and a mini, then 2 more camera and a mini - then strategically buying my latest 2-4th gen cameras and another mini where I stretched out adding them to increase the longevity of the subscription. That within itself was a great idea however I did this specifically to collect data at the network level as well as stage examples of motion capture. I\u2019ve been back and fourth with blink support for over 4 months now ever since my last subscription trial ended - they have been less than useless. Over 22 years in technology as a developer, network administrator and now cyber security and I can clearly see functional differences between how the cameras operated in\/out of trial. For example, one of my dogs will run past a camera and it would have been captured fully while in subscription - however now the dog can run to the door, sit by the door twitching to go out - and the camera doesn\u2019t even set off. In other cases out doors an alert will trigger and I\u2019ll see a tail in the first frame then 14 seconds of nothing. They are deceptive, fully in how these work with local storage. While the battery life is great arming my system only over night and select day times, it\u2019s the motion I wanted. The devices are perfect size, very durable in the rain and can be mounted pretty much anywhere. I\u2019ve been happy with everything with the exception of local only support. This is undisclosed and aforementioned pretty useless to use it local only. They need to make these exclusive cloud only cameras and I still likely would have bought them. The fact that major corporations continue to get away with intention deception annoys me to no end. Hundreds of complaints about blink litter the internet on forums everywhere, seems nobody has challenged them about it, I intend to. Truth be told I will likely spend the $100\/y for the sub, but not till I get closure of the functionality differences first. Otherwise I love everything about this while in subscription, just keep all this in mind when you solution your home monitor needs.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717200000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not impressed - many false alarms AND just stops detecting motion","reviewDescription":"So far, I am not at all impressed.The camera's motion detection is going off very frequently just from blowing tree limbs & shadows, but is missing cars going in and out of the driveway, the front door opening, people moving around, etc. (The camera is aimed right at the front door and driveway, and picks up motion in these places SOME of the time--maybe 30%.)I cannot find a \"user guide\" for the app and the online \"support\" is configured as a series of \"how to\" blurbs using jargon you'd only know once you've been using the system, so it's very difficult to find info as a new user. (I graduated magna cum laude with a BS degree in computer science & have been a professional software engineer--writing software and supporting documentation for everything from hardware controllers to radar systems to 3-D modeling--for decades, so I'm not a technology idiot--this is a poorly designed, executed, and supported system.) There should be an easy to find & use Getting Started Guide that provides app and system overviews. Just a 1-page Quick Start Guide in the box would make a big difference. Right now, I simply want to know what all the icons and buttons on the app mean, and cannot find an explanation of them.Based on what I read on the user forums, the app gets changed with no explanation to users, so even if you do figure it all out, it can change and suddenly there are new or changed icons & you have no idea what they do. Although I've figured out enough to get the whole thing set up, it's not intuitive, and I've used other similar security cameras and apps. I still have not figured out some of this app. Plus, the online\/app info tries to cover all the Blink camera models, even though they don't all work the same, so that could be confusing to some users.If there's a way to access your camera's live feed or the recordings from a desktop\/laptop PC\/Mac (vs. app on phone\/tablet), I haven't found it yet.The camera quality is OK and the 2-way talk seems to work in testing, but I don't know what it'll be like in a real world scenario. You cannot record more than a 30 second clip. It's difficult to tell when you are in \"live\" viewing mode. The app interface is just not well designed. I haven't had time to experiment with everything--have wasted too much time just trying (and mostly failing) to find basic information.No idea what the \"local\" (non-Cloud) storage Blink talks about will be like--I can't find much info about that, either. It seems like it'll be in a device that's on your WiFi network so the camera can communicate with it, and would therefore be exposed to the world. A closed system would be more secure. The storage will obviously NOT be in the camera itself--there's no place for even a microSD card. An SD (or micro) card in the camera would be a good idea (at least as an option).And one more thing--Blink is \"an amazon company.\" So why is the app not available for Kindle devices?UPDATE: I've been using this camera for a couple of months now and it is such a mixed bag. I like the \"activity zones\" that (theoretically) allow you to define the areas to detect motion. And the image is pretty good. The audio is so-so. But the motion detection is terrible--and I've tried all the setting options. I have mine mounted in an outdoor mounting kit, under a protective roof. The thing goes off constantly--every 30 seconds, for rain, wind, shadows, bugs (bugs seem to be drawn to the camera's blue light at night), a slight change in lighting due to a distant car headlight, any little thing--it will sometimes get literally hundreds of constant triggers over a few hours over nothing, but EVERY SINGLE DAY (including overnight), it just sometimes just stops detecting anything, even cars and people being very active all over the entire viewing area. If I \"go live\" for a moment, it seems to start detecting motion again! For a while, anyway. This is maddening. It completely defeats the purpose of the camera. The frequent \"false alarms\" made me turn off notifications because it was dinging constantly, and the inability to detect REAL motion makes no sense. Having to \"reset\" the camera daily, sometimes multiple times in 24 hours, is crazy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"111 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1596585600000}

{"reviewTitle":"No security, won't record continuously, completely ignores 17% of every minute happening","reviewDescription":"So I can't lie and say this is great, or even good. Any Blink camera has massive drawbacks that people should know. I was completely unaware of these huge problems and I wish others know what they're getting into. They have no method for granting or restricting access. In the world of security, especially with internet protocols, access is the first wall of defense. Not only that, but it will never record entire events, you will get 30 seconds and then it cuts off; and that's the maximum in the settings.~**~ Acceptable Noting ~**~- The quality of the camera captures is decent, as expected for a cheap box cam.- The way clips are displayed to review is decent, but heavily cluttered due to the way it cuts clips so short.~**~ Big Cons Worth Noting~**~- If you want to share anything at all, even one camera, you can't. You have to divulge your account login information for Blink, the whole account. You can NOT share a camera with anyone, you would have to share everything including access to change settings, zones, alarms, everything.- The system barely records, and is incapable of recording a solid stream because it will only ever record up to 30 seconds. The only way to get your camera to record (it's only purpose in life) an event happening is to be in live view, watching it on another device. If you are not watching it every waking moment, it will record UP to 30 seconds, turn off for 10 seconds, and record a new 30 second clip. That is the maximum, that is the intended function as per customer service. It will shut off every 30 seconds. That's all you get.* So for example, if someone was breaking into your vehicles for 20 minutes, you would have end up with 30, 30 second recordings recordings with a total of 3 & a half minutes missing entirely due to its auto shut off. So for every minute of time you're trying to capture something happening on your property, you will only ever get 83% as the other 16% will NOT be recorded.^ Considering a security camera is supposed to record things for you to be able to review or hand over to you know, secure your property; the fact that the intended function is to ignore 17% of every minute makes all of the Blink cameras relatively useless. Especially for any form of security in any regard.- The wireless technology is vulnerable, it can be hacked, and it is not through sophisticated means.The only possible use for this I can think of is as a baby monitor to check in once in a while for a few seconds. Anything surveillance, or security related is basically like shooting yourself in the foot.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697155200000}

Yesterday I had no recorded clips at all from 6 am to 9 pm, and it was armed the whole day. I was almost jumped in my parking lot by 3 people and went to pull the clips from the camera for the police and low and behold, nothing. I have to go into live view of the camera and then it will restart getting clips and notifications of motion. I have tweaked all the settings possible and it just isn\u2019t working as a normal security camera should.Also clips will only record 60 seconds at a time. That\u2019s it. There is no option to extend that at all, unless you are in live view and recording it. You can put a camera to retriever motion after 10 seconds but that leaves a gap between clips. I was hoping for something with continual recording if needed, or motion sensor recording with at least 3 minutes.Also these cameras disconnect from the wifi a lot, and it is a pain trying to get them back online and reconnected. I have to delete the cameras from the app, then reads them by scanning the camera then having it join the \u201cblink\u201d wifi, and then it loads for like 5 minutes and 50\/50 on whether it errors out or connects but doesn\u2019t show.All in all, these are rather frustrating cameras to work with and I will be getting different ones of a different brand tomorrow.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1680134400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Junk!","reviewDescription":"I'm new to home security so not sure what to expect. This is ok, but often at night vision mode I'll get a big ball of light in the top of the camera. I go wipe it down and nothing works to clear it. Even if it isn't raining it does this occasionally. I don't know what's on it to do that. But if anyone would try and break in you couldn't see their face unless they got up super close because the glare blocks out a large area of what's recording.The app isn't that great either. I have used the advanced settings to clock out an area of the road in front of my door, yet I still get constant notifications. If I adjust the motion detection then it will stop triggering that area as much but then it stops triggering if I walk directly in front of the camera sometimes. So that's not helpful.I'm not sure if other cameras are any better though.Update: now the app is barely functional. It no longer lets you select a bunch of videos at once to delete, you have to now play each video and click delete on each individual video to delete it or wait for it to delete after 3 days on it's own. I don't like looking at clutter. So this annoys me.Also it stops recording even when there is still movement. I mostly got these to record in my home if my landlord's one worker that sexually harassed me as a \"joke\" comes over and I need to record to have proof this time. Because we all know any femme types that even have actual proof are never believed. I'm on housing assistance so could easily end up homeless if I try to fight this. But I also don't trust this guy to not escalate something to violence if he's alone with me and I trigger him. But without getting into my trauma, I need all the cameras going constantly at once if he comes over. Basically, with these cameras you can only live stream one of them at a time to get a constant stream like I need. I'm not even sure if the others will properly catch motion if you're live streaming one camera either. It might not, these things are just worthless unless you want big chunks of the action missing. Imagine getting these for home security and it only catching some person breaking in, then catches their back in another movement, yet never catches their face. So basically worthless to give to authorities to help identify someone.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706227200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Horrible inferior replacement for Cloudcam","reviewDescription":"Amazon sent all cloudcam customers a blink mini as replacement for ending cloudcam today Dec 2 2022.  Blink is inferior to Cloudcam in almost every way.  Blink mini audio is horrendous and id the worst of any camera I've tried, so much background noise you can't hear anything really, and cloudcam I picked up whispers and footsteps even with no background noise, not even comparable in the least it's like going back 50 years in time switching to blink.  Cloudcam recorded up to 5 minute videos to the cloud with no subscription for up to 3 cameras.  Blink mini requires subscription to record 30 second clips, with 10 second re-arm delay meaning you miss 10 out of every 40 seconds when there is longer motions.  Cloudcam live viewed for days with no problem, blink limits you to 90 minutes live view even with paid subscription.  The cloudcam app could swipe from camera to camera in under a second, blink you have to select the camera, then click on live view to see the camera which takes 5 seconds at least at the fastest to connect and view.  Blink mini may be cheap and a somewhat useable gimmick camera, but it's far from cloud cam, I want a replacement closer to what I had this is ridiculous.More:. Blink only allows 1 connection at a time, you can only view on 1 device at a time, and can only update the device settings when device is not viewing or recording, and worst the device don't record  motion events when your live viewing.  Amazon cloudcam could view on was many devices at a time you want, and you could update setting at any time, and either record even if your always live viewing.Blink has no color night vision like many newer $20 cams in 2022, Amazon needs to stop making and pushing these and make something better even for $15 on holiday sale 2 pack, there much better quality and features out there for $20.  And in  the end when is Amazon going to brick blink devices like they did Amazon Cloudcam (5 years cloudcam went from launch to Amazon ending support and use of the devices)?, Blink cams are very low quality picture and sound, and the way they connect only one connection allowed at a time is like the stone age, stop pushing this junk, and stop insulting loyal customers with very short product life followed by an inferior replacement.No lie not only 2017 Amazon cloudcam better, I had better security cameras than blink 25 years ago when i used a VCR to do 6 hour loop recording, it's absurd your pushing this product in 2022, and an unacceptable replacement for Cloudcam.I'll buy a subscription, not for an inferior camera though, don't your want to sell subscriptions and keep customers?  Guess not no one cares at all, when you contact Amazon or the now extinct Cloudcam support.Anyone giving this camera over 1 star either is leaving fake reviews, works for Blink\/Amazon, or never tried another camera ever in their entire life.Where is the class action lawsuits?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"64 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670025600000}

Sends fake alerts every 30 seconds or so until back into day mode. (3 vids\/min until daytime- over 200 false alarms every night) Cameras will wake to the flutter of a moth but don\u2019t catch myself walking right in front of it to my car. Every single day when I wake up I have to physically go into the app and check the live stream of each camera at least once for them to work for the day. EVEN WITH 24hr SCHEDULING. even tried scheduling them every hour on the hour. Wi-Fi is long reach, all cameras show full bars with no connection issues. Matter of fact the furthest camera from the router is the one that works the best. Every night around prime time hours (12a to 4a) every single blink mini will go down and not turn on until I manually view their live feed. Very much so a PITA to say the least. Cameras are supposed to give peace of mind and the BLINK camera system DOES NOT GIVE YOU THAT. If anything they add to the stress because chances they work when they\u2019re supposed to are slim to None- leaving you wondering. Tread lightly with the outdoor cameras.

I will be buying something different and getting rid of Blink.Blink cameras are worthless without a $30 per year subscription or a Sync Module for $35 and storage card for an additional cost.  Blink Cameras will only let you view real time video - not record. Cameras will NOT record ANY video clips, even if motion detection is turned on unless you have a subscription or sync module with storage. There is no security value from these Blink cameras without the subscription or sync module. Blink gives you a 30 day trial to see the subscription services you wont have unless you subscribe.  Don\u2019t wait for the trial to end or you will be outside your return window.  Most user complaints are about the need to buy a subscription and that you must remove the memory card from the sync module to bulk delete video clips. If you try to delete video saved on the Sync module through your mobile you cannot bulk delete - you must select one video at a time.  This is very time consuming. Another complaint is on video quality. Video is ok for about 15 to 20 feet.  Images are not clear when you zoom in.

I contacted Amazon to inform them of my concern that there was a defect that was posing a genuine safety risk and their only solution was to make me uninstall BOTH cameras to send back for a full refund, or to make me order a new single camera, and upon its arrival, I could then ask for a refund of that unit due to my troubles with this camera. All of this over a camera that has had issues since right out of the box and that is SUPPOSED to be backed by a money-back guarantee.

But now after having paid the subscription, our front window camera (facing the front of our apartment, the main security concern) no longer recognizes motion and or records anything during the day.

{"reviewTitle":"Not a good product without the subscription.","reviewDescription":"Bought the Sync Module 2 so that I wouldn't have to pay for a subscription. It will record only 30 seconds maximum at a time and the only way it saves video is if it detects motion. After the video is recorded, it will send a notification to your phone (I haven't been able to find a way that I can easily access my cameras via my computer, only the app on my phone. It may be accessable via PC but if so, it's not easy to find). If you select the notification and open the app, it will show you a Live Video. You cannot save Live Video without a subscription.  So let's say that someone breaks into my house and is there for a half hour. In order to have a recording of the crime, I have to watch 60 separate video clips that have been saved to my phone. Instead of getting a notification that someone is currently in my house and logging into the app and watching\/recording it happen, I have to pray that nothing happens within the minimum 10 seconds that this system takes between clip recordings. Think about that, someone walks in and gets recorded for 30 seconds MAXIMUM and then does not get recorded for 10 seconds MINIMUM before getting recorded for another 30 seconds. There's no reason to give this system that handicap, all they want to do is screw the customer and keep you paying for the holy grail that is subscriptions. Furthermore; they of course outsourced customer support which results in choppy phone calls where the line cuts out for 5-10 seconds randomly.  Why give the video clips a time limit at all if I'm OK with filling up my storage with potentially useless footage? Why have a cap on the USB storage size I plug into the Sync Module? Why isn't there a program I can run on my PC to access and edit video? Why does my system get kneecapped if I shell out for the expensive \"storage\" system instead of paying for a subscription?  I have attached two screeshots from the app that highlight my complaints.  I'm sending my cameras and Sync Module 2 back immediately.

{"reviewTitle":"Extreamly Dissapointed","reviewDescription":"I rarely take the time to wright a bad review but I will make exception in this case so read on...Started out in Nov- Dec 2018 with 6 XT Cameras. The first attempt was a fail because batteries only lasted 2 months and the signal does not work reliably with cellular data. When I asked Blink cust. service why such a short life compared to the claimed 2year battery life they said \"it depends on your usage\" and maybe \"its too cold\". So I explained the camera installed in my heated shop that does get at least 12-24 activation's per day and is within 20 ft of my WiFi router. It was recommended to keep the video clips short so I did program the camera to take short 10sec clips. Even still the batteries lasted only 2 months. At that point although disappointing, I abandoned the system without even trying any of the other 5 cameras which I assumed would not work well here in the Northest cold months. Fast forward to today. I had read about a Blink camera that could be plugged in to always be powered. I thought, problem solved but this was another failure. When installing the new, always powered white camera, it didn't register with the sync module. Of course I called Blink Cust. Service only to now learn that my 450.00 Orbi WiFi system is not truly compatable with Blink because according to the Blink Rep. Orbi, although a fantastic system, works on \"mesh\" and the Blink system doesn't play well with any \"mesh\" WiFi system. Now I\"m pissed.Here's the problem. The Blink system claim of \"Two Year\" battery life is a wild exaggeration that only could work under the most optimistic conditions, always warm, not a \"mesh\" WiFi system and always a perfect 5bar cellular signal but Blink doesn't tell you about this until you have a problem. I suppose they figure for those situations, they would rather apologize after you buy the system, in the hope that by the time you figure this all out, the return window will be closed and they have your money. I guess the plan to have some people who will wright a bad review but that people may not read these before buying?If your reading this, I hope you will think about not buying the Blink camera system.

It was the exact opposite.It took 2 weeks to get all the cameras to record. The blink minis only record when they feel like it. Amazon has removed most of the features in the app that worked with the cloud to try to force you to buy cloud storage.  All thumbnail images have been removed. Sorting events by camera has been removed. Etc. Etc. It's now a dumbed down version of the app, making it the worst and most basic of any home security app that I've ever seen. I would pay for a working app, if one existed. I would write my own, if an api existed. Amazon claims blink works with IFTTT but there are no functions for recording or accessing the files on the sync module.I can only access files for around 40 hours. After that they disappear from the app. I cannot save live views. I cannot just click record when I want to record with something. And they have purposely made this thing slow to try to get you to buy cloud storage. They say it's slower because it's usb. I call BS. If I'm in my house, on the same wifi network as the sync module, it should be way faster to access a local usb drive(I bought the fastest one made), than leaving the network, accessing amazons cloud, returning to my network and then having my network serve the file to my phone. I'm not stupid. I have shared usb drives connected to my router and other devices on my network. When I access them it's almost instant. I don't get a message that says \"please wait: USB drives are slow\". That is a timer that was put in by the coders to make it slow.I could go on and on but I have other things to do.DON'T buy these cameras unless you want to pay cloud storage for the life of the camera.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"31 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1623542400000}

But if you are patient and leave it, it will miraculously reconnect after a few days - we've had 2 that have been out of service for 2 weeks.Had this happen to us numerous times and of course it occurs when we are away from home and want to check in on our home and dog. I've  experienced this issue on 2 different devices.Their support is useless and suggestions do not fix the problem because it is basically \"reset the device and reconnect\" which doesn't work. Or their support tries to gaslight you into thinking you entered your password incorrectly or your wifi is messed up.I don't know if the problem is with the device or their servers but if you buy this device and subscribe to its service, you should expect to randomly have your home security camera offline for days or weeks at a time.We had the old Amazon cloud cam and never had problems with it, but had problems with both older and newer blink minis.What sucks more is that we were unable to return either of these devices. The only option Amazon gave us was to read support tips or watch their support videos, which as I noted above, are useless in resolving the problem.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1692576000000}

Asking echo for a simple view of the camera gives an error statement most of the time that it can't reach the camera.Playing with an app every day to rearm a camera every day, is not a feasible option for me.And now updating this, another problem has come up with the Blink demand for a phone number.  So you go to use it, and it could be an emergency!!! You might really need that camera to be there, but it's more important for Amazon to extort a phone number from you and they make it impossible for to sign into the app without giving them a phone number.So two months, and i have a useless device.... Unless I feel like having my privacy violated.I want my money back  But I imagine that's not possible, they wait until enough time has passed to pull this so that you can't even return it.Run the other way  ... Build your own camera, anything.  The way they have this business structured is a very bad business model.  I didn't know companies were still using business models this bad.  How do they sleep at night?  Probably go through their customers videos for fun.  I'm not kidding, you see an operation like this, you know they do not have a moral code.  They promise you privacy, the promise from a bad person or company is worth exactly zero.When they extort a phone number by locking you out of the app... They are capable of anything.

One of my cats has taken to pooping on our carpeted basement floor and I haven't been able to catch the culprit so I thought I'd order this inexpensive camera so I could figure it out. I saw that there was a subscription plan when I ordered, but I just assumed that was for people who wanted to do fancy things and keep their videos for the long term and stuff like that. Little did I know you HAVE to have it. In the app, without understanding this, I said to cancel the 30 day trial thinking I don't need to store videos of my cat pooping. Once I did that, the camera still recorded I guess but it would no longer let me look at the video. If I can't see the video, the camera is of no use whatsoever. Granted the basic plan is only three dollars a month and perhaps I would pay that for security reasons, but I can't see paying $3 month to get a video of my cat pooping.  So if you want to actually use this camera, you HAVE to have at least the basic plan. That wasn't clear when I purchased it.Edit:  I forgot to mention also that before I discovered that the camera is unusable without the subscription plan, I was having constant problems with it dropping my Internet. I just kept seeing that red light and sometimes it would record and sometimes it wouldn't. In two days of owning this I was beyond frustrated. The ironic thing is that the cat did its business at that point in time when the camera had the red light and wasn't recording, so I don't know who did it even now. Thanks Blink.

For the last four years, we have used the Amazon Cloud cam paired with our Echo Show as a baby monitor overnight since we have a little one on the opposite end of the house. We paid a couple hundred dollars for the Amazon Cloud Camera and loved it. We even bought 3 additional Echo Shows for the purpose of watchung the baby overnight and during naps. We now have a newborn and we were using it in her nursery when the app and camera were  discontinued and not function as a paper weight.Amazon replaced my Cloud cam with the Blink, a $20 camera that is not even close to comparable. There is no continuous live view option and the camera times out after 5 minutes (90 minutes max if you pay for a subscription). I can't watch my newborn or hear her cry overnight if the camera does not remain live on my Echo Show. The Blink can not be accessed by two people at once, so my husband can not watch the baby at the same time as me if we are in different rooms during her naps.I bought the (very expensive) Nanit pro because it claimed to be compatible with Echo Show. The Nanit camera and app are great, but the Nanit Amazon skill is AWFUL: 1) the continuous live view randomly times out and I wake up in the middle of the night and have to pull it back up; 2) there is no two way audio feature; and 3) the volume is muted and muffled. I will continue searching for a camera that is compatible with the Echo Show and has continuous live view without timing out.I feel robbed, cheated, and beyond angry that I paid for the cloud camera and several Echo Show devices for this very purpose and was given such an inferior replacement that in no way functions as I need it to.

Yes.Do you really want to depend on them as a security camera? Probably not.First, the image quality is great. Can't complain about that. The field of view is pretty solid as well, especially for overlooking a yard or longer room\/hallway.The motion detection is fickle and leaves you with either too much sensitivity or low sensitivity to the point that someone needs to basically smack the camera to get it to trigger. The zones, while in theory are nice, don't seem to work either.My biggest gripe is the sync module. It just doesn't seem to work well. I had it working for a while, purchased new cameras and got a cloud storage plan and now that the plan is over my module has gone bust. I have to try a full reset along with purging all the clips that are on it (I suspect the cloud may have been using the sync as a backup) however the app doesn't even seem to recognize that there's a module connected any more - at least for clip purposes.Further, the cloud storage gives you a nice preview image whereas the local storage forces you to download each clip. I understand it's a marketing gimmick but it's one that contributes to a 1-star review instead of a loyal monthly subscriber.The end result is a camera system that will notify me, sometimes, if something moves but that I can't actually rely on to be consistent or provide saved clips in case anything happens.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693440000000}

I've looked in the app-ware, but can't fine options... Kinda weird. Who knows may figure it out eventually.2 Mar 2021 - Updating this review and changing the rating. I put this camera in my garage to monitor the door. Then I started having issues opening and closing the garage door. The wall button worked (wired), but none of my remotes did. Not even the one in my car. I thought my Opener went buy buy and started looking to buy a new one. In the course of t-shooting, I disconnected the Blink CAM (sense it was the last thing I did in there) and all worked again. WTF. I finally figured out (with some Web help) that Cheap LEDs on cameras (or the cameras themselves) will emit stray RF\/IF and disable some garage door devices. REALLY???? Wow  So I covered all 3 LEDs with dark tape. BAM!!!! Everything works as advertised. Seriously??? So this Camera is no good for me in the garage (which is where I wanted it.)

{"reviewTitle":"From a former Cloud Cam user","reviewDescription":"Disclaimer: Received one free cam from Amazon to replace their branded Cloud Cam they have decided to no longer support.Still, I HATE THIS CAMERA. The features offered are so diminished in comparison to the five year old Cloud Cam device and app I was previously using, so this rant review is really only for the benefit of venting to Amazon. Sorry, real consumers.Main issue: There is no more continuous live viewing and no more free viewing of the last 24 hours of recorded motion. I can\u2019t pop in to watch when I get a motion alert; I have to wait to view the recorded clip, or else it won\u2019t record everything if I interrupt it. The recorded clips are now limited to 30 seconds whereas the Cloud Cam recorded motion for as long as it detected ongoing motion. It takes AT LEAST 10 seconds for this Blink cam to start to record the next motion. If you are using cams for any kind of security \u2013 for property, for elder or child care, etc \u2013 you know a lot can happen that you would want to be recorded for those ten missing seconds if an incident were to occur.Secondary Issue: The night vision is terrible: the only \u201ccontrol\u201d option you have is the IR intensity and it\u2019s essentially useless because the picture quality is so crappy to begin with. Also, the actual motion detection at night, even with available (artificial) ambient light, is sketchy at best. I have missed a lot of recorded clips because the cam\u2019s sensitivity is so poor.It\u2019s hard to justify complaining about being given a compensated replacement, but this one is just such an awful substitute for the mediocre Cloud Cam that was working just fine for my purposes.

{"reviewTitle":"I wasted my money on a Blink camera system","reviewDescription":"Over the course of five weeks - June to July, 2021 - I bought 13 Blink cameras - 7 wired Blink Mini cameras, 6 outdoor wireless, and two sync modules, all connected to the same router, 8 cameras on one Sync module and 5 on the other Sync module.First, the good: Installation was easy, set-up was relatively easy, picture quality and audio are decent, and it is helpful to be able to block out certain \"Activity zones\" on individual cameras. It's also helpful to be able to set a schedule for arming and disarming either system, and to be able to disable individual cameras while the rest of that system is armed. The app is fairly intuitive and provides a fair amount of control of individual cameras.Here's the not-so-good: All cameras except two outdoor wireless are between 15 and 40 feet of a high-quality router with a great signal, the other two are about 50' and 75' away. All cameras, even the one 75' away, show excellent Wi-Fi signal strength and excellent Sync Module strength. It often takes several tries to get a live view and more often than not I get \"Live view failed\" on random cameras. I also occasionally get \"Camera off line\" on any of the plug-in Mini cameras, though they almost always come back on line by themselves - sometimes within a few minutes, sometimes after a day or so off line. I have \"Early Notification\" enabled, but when I get notified of a camera detecting motion, it always takes several seconds before I can get a live view, and more often than not, I get \"Live view unavailable\". When I switch from one camera view to another, it takes several tries  before the \"Live view in progress - Please wait\" message goes away and I can get to the other camera - ten seconds or more. The minimum ten second re-trigger time could mean that that camera misses something important. I'm also disappointed that the battery level on the outdoor cameras only says \"Ok\", but doesn't actually give any indication of actual battery level.I'm really sorry I went with Blink. I'm considering just taking a loss on the $600 I've spent so far and switching to a more reliable system.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636675200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very nice mini Cameras","reviewDescription":"The Blink mini camera is great. The picture quality is great.

{"reviewTitle":"OMG U HAVE TO GET THIS CAMERA","reviewDescription":"This is definitely the best little camera I\u2019ve ever got. It\u2019s extremely reliable. It\u2019s never crashed on me. I\u2019ve had some issues with it catching cars at night, but I just have to adjust the sensitivity and the zones of motion at night. There\u2019s so many things that you can change and work with. I have mine outside and it doesn\u2019t even go outside. It\u2019s an indoor camera but it\u2019s withheld rain. It\u2019s been 100\u00b0 in Texas. I love this camera I get notifications it has people recognition I love love love it.!! Normally, when you buy cheaper, you have to pay $50 a month for a cloud subscription so your camera record and work. But this doesn\u2019t gave me 30 day free trial, then I Subscribe through Amazon and Blink and pay less than four dollars a month for a membership to be able to record! Worth every penny!!The infrared at night works pretty darn good. I would say it\u2019s a six out of 10, which is really good because again mine is indoor not outdoor and I\u2019m using it outdoor.. If you wanna make sure you\u2019re picking up something on your camera, don\u2019t worry Blink will get it because if anything it over picks up and you can also adjust that. There\u2019s so many things that can adjust the time of capture, the indicator light can stay off that way the intruder won\u2019t know they\u2019re being recorded, or you can turn it on to where they know that they are being recorded, and it can be a deterrent. This camera has held up and I love it and I\u2019m buying 10 more.lol","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719532800000}
