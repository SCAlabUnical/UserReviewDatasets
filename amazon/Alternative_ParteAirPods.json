{"reviewTitle":"Nothing will make these stay in-ear","reviewDescription":"My return window closed two days ago. That's after waiting over two weeks for the earbuds to be shipped, and then deciding to give them one more try by buying an accessory that would help them not fall out. That accessory arrived today so I'm screwed, as they say. I had the first generation airpods and at least those would stay in the ear. You couldn't run or do heavy workouts but they would stay in. But the microphone and battery life deteriorated (aka planned obsolescence-d) so I needed new ones for calls and such. I tried wearing the new ones around the house, walking the dog, or just sitting down and taking a call - I have to keep them in my ear with my hands if I don't want to lose them. I tried the over-the-ear plastic thing (another $10 wasted), but the fit is still so loose that they eventually fall out. Also, if you want to hear anything with these, they have to be right up against your ear canal, otherwise the sound dissipates and the volume is too low to hear - enjoy holding them both pressed up to your ear if you want to use them. I'm so disappointed... I'm an Apple fan and would pick their products before any others but lately they've had a lot of fails.

{"reviewTitle":"Crystal Clear Sound with Comfortable Fit!","reviewDescription":"I recently purchased the Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) and have been thoroughly impressed with their performance. The personalized spatial audio is a game-changer\u2014it feels like I'm in my own personal concert hall with a full range of sound that is just astonishing. The earbuds fit snugly and comfortably in my ears, and I've had no issues with them falling out, even during my morning jogs, thanks to the sweat and water-resistant design.Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, with no noticeable lag when I'm watching videos or taking calls. Speaking of calls, the call quality is pristine; I've received comments on how clear I sound. The battery life is also a standout feature; I can go nearly a full day without needing to recharge, and with the charging case, I have up to 30 hours of listening time, which is perfect for long trips.The only slight downside is that they don't have active noise cancellation, but the sound quality and spatial audio more than make up for it. They're so intuitive to use\u2014just a simple setup with my iPhone and I was good to go. The Lightning Charging Case is a sleek and convenient way to keep the earbuds powered, and it's small enough to slip into my pocket.Overall, the AirPods (3rd Generation) have been an excellent purchase, providing a combination of great sound quality, ease of use, and robust battery life. They're an ideal choice for anyone looking to upgrade their listening experience.

{"reviewTitle":"AirPods 3rd Gen: The Earbuds That Have It All (Except Maybe a Coffee Maker)","reviewDescription":"In the whirlwind of technology and endless gadget releases, Apple's AirPods (3rd Generation) stand out like a beacon of simplicity and sophistication - much like a well-written piece of code in a sea of programming chaos. As someone who's no stranger to the tech world (hello, countless hours of coding and debugging), I've found these AirPods to be an essential accessory, almost as crucial as my laptop.First off, let's talk about the personalized spatial audio. It's like having a surround sound theater plugged directly into your ears, minus the bulky headphones and popcorn kernels. Whether I'm immersing myself in my favorite tunes to escape the monotony of debugging or catching up on tech podcasts, the sound quality is nothing short of stellar. It's an auditory experience that makes you question if these earbuds secretly house a team of tiny musicians.Sweat and water-resistant? Absolutely. For someone living in sunny and sometimes sweaty Florida, this feature is a godsend. It means I can go from a coding marathon at the University of Florida to a literal marathon (or, let's be real, a brisk walk) without worrying about my earbuds throwing in the towel before I do.The convenience of the Lightning Charging Case is like having a portable power bank specifically for your earbuds. It's compact, efficient, and ensures that my AirPods are always ready for action - much like my trusty laptop, always charged for those unexpected coding sessions.Now, let's talk battery life. Up to 30 hours? That's longer than some of my longest coding sessions (which is saying something). It's reassuring to know that my AirPods will likely outlast my laptop's battery and my own energy levels.In the world of Bluetooth headphones, the AirPods 3rd Gen are like the sleek, high-performing sports car everyone wants to drive. They pair seamlessly with my devices, ensuring I'm always just a tap away from crystal-clear audio, whether I'm taking calls or drowning out background noise to focus on my work.In conclusion, Apple's AirPods (3rd Generation) are more than just earbuds; they're a lifestyle upgrade. For tech enthusiasts, coders, or just about anyone who appreciates quality sound and convenience, these AirPods are a must-have in 2023.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"131 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700265600000}

I have previously used AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) and the audio containment\/quality could not compare. Even using $20 wired headphones with earpieces hold the sound and immerse you into the song. I'm assuming this is the absence of earpieces on these AirPods, but regardless, the sound is crisp but not amazing.

Another issue I had was that whenever I ran- the airpods would fall out of my ears.

Further, the stems on them are shorter and the \"tap\" feature from the 2nd Gen has been replaced with a button you press on the shortened stems.  So every time I reach to squeeze the stem to push the button they fall out even more easily.

These are a sneaky \u2018save-a-buck\u2019 option Apple released without telling anyone. So they have a lightning charging port, but no wireless and no magnets to stick to a MagSafe charger.The next issue is that there is no easy way to return them via Amazon.

If you set up a return you have to call them to authorize the return and then they set up a delivery with ups with no time except the next day. The drivers will attempt 3 other days. I call ups and they don\u2019t give me any window except be on standby till 7. No option to drop it off at a ups store. Absolutely a nightmare.

{"reviewTitle":"Junk","reviewDescription":"What a waste. For the money that Apple charges for these 3rd Generation AirPods, they truly aren't worth the investment. I purchased these because I was looking for improved sound from my 2nd Generation AirPods. First, the sound is a very slight improvement over the 2nd Generation AirPods and definitely not worth the extra $$. However, several months after purchase, the AirPods started experiencing intermittent charging issues. I spent hours on the phone with Apple Support trying to fix the issue with no luck. Finally, they had me send the AirPods back to Apple for bench testing. What a waste of time, Apple plugged the unit into their bench testing unit and determined that there was nothing wrong, they literally had the AirPods for two hours and returned them without being repaired or replaced. Several days ago, after one week of non use of the AirPods, I went to use them. Once again, the AirPods were at zero charge, even though the case showed 63% battery. These things are expensive, yet Apple doesn\u2019t support the product, and they simply don\u2019t work. Also, their bench test is a complete joke. I\u2019ve provided photographic proof of the issue, yet Apple continues to deny and accept their responsibility for shoddy manufacturing, oversight, and quality control, even though these AirPods are still under warranty. Bottom line, don\u2019t waste your time or money on this poorly designed, manufactured & supported product. In the future, I'll take a very long look at competitors products before purchasing another Apple product again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"57 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683158400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Ambient Noise AMPLIFIED","reviewDescription":"I purchased these with the intention of upgrading from my very worn 1st generation AirPods that I bought refurbished. They worked great, just were starting to get a little grody. There are a number of issues with the 3rd generation AirPod pros that make them basically unusable.1. The background\/ambient noise is amplified through the microphone. If you\u2019re talking on the phone, the person at the other end is assaulted by any small noises going on in your background. So if you\u2019re loading the dishwasher, taking out trash, or god forbid TYPING on a keyboard the other person will hear those things MORE than your voice. Apple support seems to know this is an issue, and all the \u201cfixes\u201d have done nothing.2. The tap sensors do not work. I used these on my 1st Gen model to pause music and hang up the phone. These sensors are not responsive to do either of the functions even though they are enabled on the settings.3. The AirPods will randomly disconnect and reconnect. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why or when this will happen.Needless to say, I am disappointed that I thought this would be an upgrade. I thought that the stereo sound would be cool, and it is, but not cool enough for me to overlook the other issues. Wish I could return, but no luck with an opened\/used product here.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689984000000}

Got it on an Amazon flash deal in July, so not sure if this was a new product of a returned product, but it definitely isn't what I would have expected having never had them before.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1694131200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Downgrade from previous versions","reviewDescription":"Sound quality and battery life is great.  However, I am disappointed in two changes they made with this generation.  First, they changed the shape of the part that goes into the ear.  The previous shape was my favorite thing about Airpods...they fit my ear perfectly, never fell out when running, biking, etc.  These fit, but not as tight, and while they haven't fallen out yet, I could see it happening in the future.  The bigger complaint though is they changed how users interact with them.  Instead of tapping them, you now have to press the stem.  This may not seem like a big deal, but I loved the old Airpods where if you were wearing a hat and gloves, you could still tap on them through the fabric to pause\/play\/answer the phone.  I think Apple would argue that you could use Siri to do this hands free, but I feel Siri gets worse and worse over time.  Even basic commands like \"resume podcast\" will sometimes trigger no response from Siri and I end up having to take off my gloves and resume on my phone.  Really disappointed in these two changes and will go back to the old version.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672617600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Made for big ear holes","reviewDescription":"I\u2019d give it 3 1\/2 stars if I could.It is nice, sound quality is great, links to my phone almost immediately- it is also HUGE. It\u2019s made for big ol\u2019 ear holes. I have teeny ear holes so I adjust it and sometimes it pauses the audio when I do. Oops.Overall good, works consistently.Cons are the size and sometimes you have to hold it in front of your phone and open it the case if you want to use it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695081600000}
