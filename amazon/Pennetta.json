{"reviewTitle":"Errors Without Formatting First","reviewDescription":"First of all, I purchased the 256gb model, and it only has 232gb of capacity.  With the first one I received, I tried transferring some files to it, and it kept giving me an error like the drive was disconnecting and reconnecting.  So Amazon sent me another one and the same thing happened.  HD-Tune showed 98% damaged sectors.  I figured I would just try formatting the drives before I send them back, so I did.  After formatting the drives, both work as they're supposed to.  Also, this drive gets extremely hot.  It makes me wonder if the heat is somehow responsible for the damaged sectors.  Both times I formatted I let them cool off to room temp first.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1718496000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Try these as soon as you get them","reviewDescription":"Had these for 4 days past the 30 day return window.  Went to copy 28 gigs of photos to share with relatives only to have 1 of the 3 thumb drives get really hot and disconnect from the pc after 4 minutes of copying files.  It does it each time it is I've tried to copy files.  I've tried copying smaller batches of files and the same thing happens: it overheats and disconnects.  I guess it will eventually take the files if you allow the thumb drive to cool off between transfer sessions, which I would recommend be no more than 4 minutes of copying at a time with a 5 minute cool down before your next attempt.So........... Highly recommend you copy 10 gigs of test files to these when you first get them to see if you received a dud as well.Overall, I have always been very happy with SanDisk equipment.  This is the first BAD experience I've had with them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713830400000}

Although it does not have blazing speed, you don't expect that at this price point.

This is before any partition table or filesystem is created.I created a FAT32 filesystem on the drive, and sequentially wrote 60 files of 1.00GB each, containing encrypted zeros (effectively, random data). The total time was 4744.81 seconds (including the sync command), for an average rate of 12.6MB\/s. Non-sequential writes would be slower, but 12.6MB\/s should be considered the maximum possible write speed of the drive.On reading back the files, the first 52 files were error free. After that, the drive failed, and seemed to reboot its controller repeatedly. I noted that the drive was too hot to touch, even through its plastic case. I disconnected and reconnected the drive, and the rest of the files verified correctly. The overall read speed was 142MB\/s when there weren't any errors.All these tests were done with the drive sitting in open air, at 72 degrees F ambient temperature. Reading a huge amount of data off the drive should be done carefully, in shifts, to avoid overheating it. Idling and write accesses don't seem to make the drive overheat, but the metal connector always feels uncomfortably warm after unplugging it, even if you hardly do any operations.Note that I did all these tests on a USB 3.x superspeed port. If you use a USB 2.0 or USB high speed port, your speed will likely be limited to 30MB\/s.I removed 1 star for lying about the capacity (3.9% is missing from the advertised size), and another star for lying about the write speed (it claims to be 10 times faster than a 4MB\/s USB drive, which is 40MB\/s, but it actually can't write faster than 12.6MB\/s).

{"reviewTitle":"Good for basic use, but QLC flash like performance will be an issue for large files.","reviewDescription":"I purchased the 3 pack of the 32GB drives knowing that it would be slow to write, but the marketing will mislead many users. The write speeds are slower than many low cost USB 2.0 flash drives from 7-10 years ago, and that is likely due to the use of QLC NAND which has a major write speed penalty. Read speeds being high is common since additional flash levels only really carry an ECC burden, where if the controller is fast enough, then the speed penalty is minimal.Since the drive seems to also have a tiny amount of faster storage (likely to also handle other controller management data), it will also create misleading results from smaller benchmarks that may only use a fast region of NAND. With this in mind, I did a linear read and linear write from 0 to 100 %.Read performance: Reads are quite good with an average of 159.7MB\/s that is largely sustained throughout the entire length of the drive.Write performance: Writes are significantly slower, with a 0-100% average of 17.9MB, but that average is influenced by the initial higher speeds in the 30-36MB\/s range. Without that initial faster section, the speeds very frequently bounce around 15-17MB\/s. Furthermore, this represents a best case scenario as it is a 100% linear write done as raw writes, ignoring any partitioning or file system. Anything that increases the IO workload, will result in lower write performance.Overall, if you need a flash drive for basic use (documents, images, audio, etc., then this Is a great budget option, but if you need something for larger transfers, such as multiple GB videos, linux live USBs, and other mixed uses that can result in wither large transfers, then don\u2019t go with anything lower than the Sandisk Extreme flash drives, as pretty much all of their lower end units have gotten slower over the years in terms of write speeds, while read speeds have steadily increased.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1635724800000}

But I started buying the New Generation 32GB and even 2 64GB drives, and they all suffer from the same \"bugging out\" problem. Meaning that when I initially plug them in, the antivirus chimes and asks if I want to scan the drive. After that the Old Gen can sit in the port for hours without issues. However these New Gen will bug out within 1-15 min, repeatedly, meaning there's the chime that's made when the drive is removed, and immediately the antivirus asks again if I want to scan. Any file transfer is stopped, any video being watched crashes, etc. So there must be some bad connection in these New Gen. It would be easy to blame a bad lot if they were all the same size or came from the same seller, but when the problem affects both multiple 32GB and 2 64GB drives bought from different sellers, I can only blame some change in the product by SanDisk. The only physical difference between Old and New is that the blue plastic slab seen at the bottom, the connection point, is much thicker in the Old Gen, with that in the New Gen barely perceptible. No clue if that's part of the problem, simply pointing out the only physical difference I can see. And it's not my USB ports since other makers, like Samsung and PNY, work just fine on the computer, for hours and hours. So I won't be bothering with SD Ultra 3.0 New Gen anymore.

I am pleased at the size at which these USBs are available. The actual size available for storage was roughly 460GB out of the 512GB.As many previous reviews mentioned, the USB tip (metal part) gets really hot upon plugging in. Therefore, it is definitely not something I want to plug into my laptop for prolonged work sessions fearing heat damage. Also, I had varying experiences when writing files to this USB. Writing numerous small sized files significantly drops the transfer speed, sometimes, to as low as 100Kb\/s.Overall, I would recommend the USB if you just need many cheap, and highly portable devices for double or triple back up of your less frequently used files. The USB provides the most storage per cost basis compared to many alternatives.

{"reviewTitle":"Lots of space, but pre-formatted with FAT32","reviewDescription":"I bought these to store large file for video editing when it's not practical to transfer them over the network.  The first thing I found out is that they are pre-formatted with FAT32 which has a maximum file size of 4GB.  I reformatted them as exFAT and the problem is solved.Performance is decent for the price.  I measured speeds using USB 3.2 Gen 1 (aka USB 3.0).  Sustained read speed is about 135MB\/s.  Burst write speed is about 66MB\/s and it maintains that speed for about 1GB before it drops down to 35MB\/s.  Most of the files I transfer are 3GB to 5GB in size, so it was a few months before I noticed that write speeds drops down again to 22MB\/s after somewhere between 5GB and 6GB of sustained writes.  The speed remains at 22MB\/s until at least 17GB which is the largest file I've tried.I also had the opportunity to try this flash drive on a USB 2.0 port.  Sustained read speed is about 38MB\/s which is close to the limit of USB2.0.  Burst write speed is about 22MB\/s for about the first 1GB, then the sustained speed drops to about 17MB\/s.  I expected this to be around 35MB\/s since the device can transfer data on USB2.0 at speeds of at least 38MB\/s and it can write to it's Flash at speeds of at least 35MB\/s.Something else I noticed is that while plugged into a USB2 port, the drive temperature doesn't increase, even when reading or writing for several minutes.  However, when plugged into USB3 port for a few seconds, even when the drive is not being accessed at all, the drive gets fairly warm.  It's not hot enough to burn your skin but it makes me think that leaving the drive plugged into to a USB3 port for extended periods of time (something I normally do) will shorten the life of the drive.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1656892800000}

This performance is ok for drive size of 32GB but not for 256 GB unless you are only adding a few files at a time and mostly reading. The drive slows down as it fills too. Capacity value is good. Performance value is poor.A better SanDisk, with increased cost, is the Extreme PRO 256GB. It still doesn't approach the advertised 380 MB\/s write speeds. But it averaged 140MB\/s on NTFS.  Still no where close to the Samsung T5 2TB which does match write of 380 MB\/s. But it also costs 5x more.Tested the Ultra with 72K files ranging is size from 3 GB to < 1KB. Mean size was <10MB.  Best write performance was sizes <100MB approaching 65MB\/s . Read time on small files approached 85 MB\/s. Surprisingly, files systems exFat and NTFS had similar performance with a slight edge to NTFS.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1597449600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Blatant lying about the storage size","reviewDescription":"I have purchased the \"512 GB\" version. I am quite familiar with the usual practice of the storage industry of using decimal Gigabytes to advertise the capacity. The drive I have received has 494206451712 bytes. This is the raw capacity of unformatted and unpartitioned drive as reported by Linux kernel. Obviously, it will be less after formatting. Obviously, it is much less in \"true\" Gigabytes defined as 1024*1024*1024 bytes (460 GB).I suppose most users will be convinced by the argument that formatted drive has less capacity, as they might have a limited capability to access the size of the raw device. Others will be convinced by the argument of different units for MB and GB. How would they answer to my complaint? Maybe they would say that Linux is not supported? Extremely unlikely, as devices like that use a general protocol not tied to any particular OS.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1629158400000}

For comparison, I used an external SATA III SSD 1TB Samsung drive in an external drive enclosure and was able to back up 400GB in the same amount of time. This is a flash drive transfers large files in a frustratingly slow fashion. If you plan to transfer small files around from one device to another, it will suffice.

{"reviewTitle":"Sustained random write speed is ~8.3 MB\/s; read is ~100 MB\/s","reviewDescription":"It might make for a good backup medium if you run your backups in the background so you don't get distracted by the speed. I used up 253 GB of this drive with a backup and at least verified that it's not a false-capacity scam like most of the cheaper drives on various major websites. It took 8 hours and 37 minutes to complete the backup, hence the random write speed estimate in this review's headline, but it's vastly slower at writing small files (Windows reported <1 MB\/sec) and faster for large ones (Windows reported >60 MB\/sec). I ran my backup and supplementary tests by copying files to and from my insanely fast M.2 SSD (ADATA XPG SX8100, benchmarked around 1 GB\/sec write and 1.8 GB\/sec read).Unless maybe you're reading this 5 years after I wrote it, you may as well just get an average 1 TB portable spinning disk drive for any short-term storage\/between-locations transfers, but the relative longevity of flash memory (as long as you don't write to them often) makes this a decent option for slow backups. This drive would also be fine for write-once, read-many-times needs, especially in cases that your write speed is throttled anyway (e.g. if you're downloading straight to this USB drive from a <500 Mbit\/s network).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636156800000}

(20 pictures only took like 5 seconds)Will probably take long to move 16gb but that's to be expected.Only complaint is after testing and removing it (only used for a few minutes) the metal USB part was very hot, hotter than other usbs I've used.But I think it'll be fine if I'm just using it to store some files.I ordered the 64 gb and the actual usable storage on it was about 57gb. That's understandable though. So if you need a certain amount of gb, always buy a larger storage amount just in case.Anyway, if you need a USB that's affordable and decent, this is for you.

They have a nice compact design that slides easily onto a keychain or in a pocket. The USB 3.0 interface means fast data transfer speeds when using USB 3.0 ports.However, I was disappointed to find the write speeds limited to USB 2.0 speeds, even when plugged into USB 3.0 ports. Saving large files seems to crawl compared to reads. There is also no LED activity light, so you don't know when data is transferring.That said, the read speeds are fast, allowing quick access to media and documents. The drives feel well-constructed and sturdy. And you can't beat getting 3 drives for the price.Overall, the drives work reliably and I'd purchase them again for the convenience of having multiple flash drives. But the slow write speeds and lack of activity indicator prevent this from being a 5 star product.
