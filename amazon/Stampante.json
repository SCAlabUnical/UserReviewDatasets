{"reviewTitle":"Great value and lots of functions","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with this printer so far. After my old reliable multifunction printer stopped working, I needed a new one and this seemed like an inexpensive option, even though it\u2019s a factory-renewed unit.I was worried after reading some of the reviews on Amazon, but the setup wasn\u2019t terribly difficult. The only problem I had there was with some of the questions that asked me to share more information than I was expecting with HP and deciding whether it made sense to sign up for their ink replenishment service (so far, I haven\u2019t run out of ink). The print quality seems pretty decent, considering the price. The scanner and copier functions also seem to work well enough with a Windows laptop, though I was disappointed that the software didn\u2019t seem to work with my Chromebook. It seems you need a Windows computer (or maybe a Mac). But the HP Smart app seems to work well on my Windows computers as well as an iPhone and an Android phone.It\u2019s nice to have the wireless functionality, which my old printer didn\u2019t have. The one difficulty I had during use was when my computer switched over to a different Wi-Fi network and couldn\u2019t connect to the printer. But I figured out eventually what the problem was. It would be nice if the printer had Bluetooth connections available. There is a USB port that can be used with a USB cable and that may address some of the Wi-Fi issues some reviewers have commented on.All in all, it\u2019s got plenty of features. I haven\u2019t signed  up for the mobile fax service since I have nowhere to send a fax, but it\u2019s nice to know that\u2019s available for 2 years.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644624000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Works fine when it decides to work at all, but double-sided copies are problematic","reviewDescription":"Overall it does what I want, but in the first day of use I discovered two issues.  The first one really ticked me off.  That is that the printer cartridges supplied with the printer straight out of the box only contain a bare minimal amount of ink and half way through a printing job the black cartridge ran out of ink.  I did about 30 pages and then a page or two of low ink print quality and then nothing.  The second issue that I did not realize while reading the product description is that if you have a double-sided page, it is cumbersome to print both sides as a double-sided copy.  You have to print one side first, then take that copy and reverse it properly in the paper feeded and then reverse the original in the copy feeder tray and then print it and hope that you get it all correct.  That takes awhile to figure out how to line every thing up properly.  Haven't used the fax, scan, wi-fi or blue tooth features yet.  I returned it.  The second one doesn't work any better.  I think that it is just not very compatable with a computer that still uses Windows 7.

I guess for the price point this would be fine for your family's purposes (using the scanner glass for a page or two) or maybe printing concert ticket vouchers or something. It's been a nightmare to try to use consistently for work. And it constantly gives me \"ink low\" warnings even right after I change out the ink.

Maybe it is a PC only or Cell phone only printer. If so I missed that!

{"reviewTitle":"READ IF YOU NEED HELP WITH SET UP","reviewDescription":"I was in a pickle and needed a printer FAST. During COVID, all of the printers have been limited supply so I felt I would take a chance on this one. First thing I noticed about this printer when I received it was there were NO instructions. You are instructed to download an app (HP Smart) and configure it all from there, however when I tried, the app wouldn't find any WiFi networks (when I knew there were plenty in my apartment building). THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IF YOU HAVE ISSUES SETTING UP:1. Plug in the printer2. Place ink inside and paper in the feeder3. It will print a page (that I have attached in photos just in case) to help you set up4. Hold down the WiFi button AND the cancel button for 3 seconds until the power button flashes5. Move onto the app to continue configuring - it will \"find\" the printer and then allow you to connect to WiFiThey made this printer unnecessarily complicated to set up but once it is up, it works like a charm and you are even able to change the printer's email address. I tried to set this bad boy up on 4 different attempts and had to walk away 3x because it wouldn't connect to WiFi and I got frustrated. Happy with my purchase now, but I was about to throw it out the window for a second there... Anyways, overall, if you are tech-savvy, I would recommend this printer! I just suggest to the manufacturer that it COMES WITH the instruction sheet rather than making you print it prior to setting it up... that was odd.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"456 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1605657600000}

Some of my dislikes:  1) Does not print double sided.  2)  Cannot preview photos prior to printing so they're always off center, and there is always a white border of varying degrees even when selecting fill page.  Using my Samsung phone to print, perhaps that is the reason. 3)  Photo quality is very disappointing.  Select best quality and they don't come close to comparing to photos from CVS.  Maybe I chose poor quality photo paper, I'll purchase some more expensive paper and see if the quality improves.  On the bright side the fax and copy features were a breeze to set up and use. Also, I have not a single problem with a paper jam or any other mechanical issue.  For what I paid, $60,  I'm  satisfied and would buy it again.

Thers are no known attacks in the wild of third party print cartridges being used to exploit a printer, only theoretical research funded by.... You guessed it... HP!

Slower than previous HP printer we had and doesn't hold as much paper as previous HP printer we had.  Haven't printed any photos yet, so can't comment on photo print quality yet.

{"reviewTitle":"Great printer, terrible setup software","reviewDescription":"When this printer works, it works very well. The output of prints, scans and copies is excellent, though it seems to be quite ink-hungry (I burned through 2 black cartridges in 3 weeks, and I didn't print but 100 pages.) What genuinely sucks is the HP \"Smart\" (here a euphemism for \"Stupid\") setup software. I couldn't get it to work over Wi-Fi, and every time I deleted the printer and reinstalled, it did something different. I couldn't even get it to work using a USB cable. I backed up and installed HP's previous setup software, HP Printer Assistant and finally got it to work using a USB cable, but why buy a Wi_Fi capable printer in the first place if it needs a cable to work? You can't even set it up with either app without a USB cable. Both apps make you use a cable because the printer does not have a touch screen, and it says nothing about this on the outside of the sealed box, so I had to make a second trip to buy a cable. Since HP knows darn well that it requires a cable to set it up, they should include one with the printer or at least warn you that you need one. Bottom line: great printer if you don't need to run it over Wi-Fi, but seriously FAIL setup software.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1617408000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Wow! That first ink cartridge went quickly!","reviewDescription":"I didn't find set-up for the printer difficult on the app. On my laptop, it did have the spinning circle of death as the app loaded and loaded. I had other things I was doing, and it ran like that for a couple hours. While it was still doing that, I went out to the Search function for the computer, and it showed the app had already loaded and was waiting for me!I like the printer and it is doing nice work. My only complaint is similar to other reviewers. It produced perhaps 80 pages of work in black and white and I had to replace the cartridge. I have printed zero color pages except the test pages and the level was down a third. In all fairness, I just went over and looked just to verify and now it is back up to full color levels.Will see how the next cartridge goes...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1648944000000}
