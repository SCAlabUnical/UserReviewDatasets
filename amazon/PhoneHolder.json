The dash doesn't have a lot of flat real estate to work with and it's not a smooth surface. The instructions call for waiting 24 hours before using the phone holder after attaching the holder to the base. I waited longer and could tell it wasn't going to work. The base never stuck good to the dash surface.The remaining options are using the suction cup to attach it to the windshield (don't want to do that) or use the included clip to attach it to the A\/C vent.  The problem is that that's not on Hondas.

It worked very well at first, great suction, good handle on the phone, great for the drives. Summer came around and because of the heat, the adhesive on the suction didn't work anymore, without it, the suction didn't seem that great either. Our stand fell from our dashboard twice and figured we couldn't keep it anymore.It did great for the time being, but figured the heat wouldn't be too bad, there's hotter places out there and California weather isn't that bad. Our parking has a roof, so I didn't think we would have to worry about the adhesive wearing off much. With all these issues, 3 stars seems appropriate, should've lasted more than 4 months I think $24 was too much for just a short time.

So I wrote to them and told them exactly what had happened and asked them if they sold a replacement suction cup replacement.  They checked on it and approved it and sent me not only just the suction cup, but the whole end and all we have to do is replace the end piece, clean the windshield really good again and re-apply.

The size of the mounting disk and the angle of the hinge of the mount took up more space than a previous installation of a smaller unit.  I emailed Vicseed on a weekend with a question about installation (of note, I had not yet found the installation guide, which was under a flap at the bottom of the box).  I received a quick response from the company with a request for a photo of the dashboard, which resulted in an equally quick response with instructions to dispense with the disk and use only the suction cup and a link to an instruction video.  Installation proved to be both simple and workable in the space I had available.  Phone mount seems very stable and works well.  Customer rep also mentioned that she had notified their marketing folks to ensure that the instruction manual was more prominent in the box.  Excellent customer service.5\/15\/2021 Update.  The suction failed about 1 1\/2 months ago after well over a year of use.  I reviewed the installation instructions and viewed a Vicseed video, then re-installed the phone holder.  The suction cup failed again about 3 weeks later.  I emailed Vicseed and communicated with Alice, who I believe was the person I communicated with about my original installation.

You have to undo the suction, turn the arm, and then redo the suction, but it's fairly easy.Two-part suction - This feature was one of the main selling points for this model.  You peel and stick a base that gives you a flat surface to attach the suction cup on the arm.  So far, the arm has not fallen off and seems very stable.  The true test will come this summer when the vehicle reaches over 100 degrees.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1612915200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Go ahead and click buy!","reviewDescription":"I was looking for a really good mount for my work truck. I deliver for a living and my truck isn't exactly made for comfort.  That being said....I needed something that would really stick to my windshield and not drop my phone. Got to work on Monday and opened the box. Boy was I impressed! First of all....the suction cup is heavy duty and thick as well. It already has sticky stuff on it to help it adhere. I moved it several times before I found the right spot. Keep in mind I ride with my doors open so everything is dusty. The entire mount is adjustable with screw like things to really tighten them down to lock it in place. The part that holds the phone is strong as well. And the quick release button is located in a super convenient place. I go down dirt roads and crappy driveways all day and this thing has not moved or dropped my phone at all! I feel completely confident that my phone is safe even without a case! I like it so much that I bought a second one for my car the next day! It also comes with a small mount for your vents but I only used it once....didn't care for it being on my vent.When it's all said and done...you can't go wrong with buying this... especially if you need one that's tough and want to keep your phone safe. It really is worth the money! If it wasn't I would not have bought two! Get one and you won't need another one because it comes with a year warranty on it....yup sure does!

The suction cup was not something I was thrilled about. It has gooey silicone stuff on it. I had one before that was similar and the goo eventually got weird and sticky collecting dirt. It had the same washing instructions as the suction cups on this product which it never really got clean and remained sticky in a bad way.The unit also comes with a clip that attaches to the ac vent. THAT I find practical and is how I use it. One thing I didn\u2019t realize at first is the tightening screw needs to be used for the ball joint. This means you take it off the suction cup holder and transfer it to the ac vent holder.It works very well as a vent holder. I give it 4 stars because the company should get rid of the sticky goo stuff on the suction holder.

I was impressed...for a day or two. Fast forward to turning a knob to tighten the sides around the phone and this being such a pain and u could never get it quite right. It even fell out one day while I was driving which was really dangerous. The sides also had foam inserts in them to cushion your phone as it held it. They were both falling out. I actually brought the phone holder inside and was super gluing it and securing it with clamps to dry when it struck me how ridiculous the situation was and how this product was so much more trouble than it was worth.I am getting ready for a road trip and needed something to hold my phone safely so I can use it for phone calls, navigation, music (and be switching back and forth between all these functions. To be honest, for once I didn\u2019t really read a lot about the product or look at the reviews which is wild considering the nightmare my last holder proved to be. I picked this one cuz it was an Amazon Choice and it had almost perfect stars. OMG!!! The button on the side is AMAZING! I just rest my phone on the \u201cshelf\u201d for the bottom and squeeze the sides together and it just stays put. NO KNOB TO TURN!!! But WAIT...it gets BETTER...to release your phone, you just push the MAGIC BUTTON!!! WHAAAT??? Who is the genius who came up with that? This seems really well made and I don\u2019t anticipate any unusual wear and tear like I ran into with the piece of crap I had before. There is no foam in here to fall out and I am not worried in the least that my phone will slip out when I\u2019m driving and be sliding around under my feet.

{"reviewTitle":"Doesn't fall off","reviewDescription":"All of my previous experiences with car mounts involved things falling off.  I've had various Garmins with Garmin mounts, and they always fell off (whether from the windshield or a disc).  It got to the point that I would leave my GPS plugged in constantly while using it, so that if it fell in floorboard while I was driving, I could pull it up with one hand using the power cord.  It did that a lot.  Inevitably while I was driving in very heavy, crazy traffic with an exit coming up in under a mile.  So that's what I have to compare this mount to.This mount came with a disc to put on my dashboard, but I didn't want to pry off the old Garmin disc.  I was afraid that would damage my dashboard, since the thing has been there for 12 years or so.  I considered stacking the discs, but thought I should try the new mount on the old disc first.  The mount just barely fits on my old Garmin disc.  The disc that it came with is slightly bigger.  But it did fit. Just have to be really careful to get it lined up, since the fit is so close.  And it does NOT fall off.  Honestly, I can't even pry it off.  I have to get my husband to pull it off when I want to remove it, and it takes him a minute or two to get it off.I've had this for two months now.  It's had a decent amount of city and country driving, and it's been on one roadtrip so far.  Lots of bumpy roads and such.  And it never once fell.  That's all I really wanted.  Was something to not fall.It fits my iPhone SE well.  Because of the case I have, it is difficult to insert the plug into phone in while it is in the mount, so I just plug it in before I stick it in the mount.  I like how adjustable it is.  I was able to position it to where it was comfortable for me very easily.  The air vents in my car would not take air vent clips, and those were too low for me to see easily.  This one is perfect.The one thing I can't speak to is how meltable it may be.  It spent most of the hot days at the end of summer in the garage.  Not a lot of chances for it to melt the gel.For what I wanted though, this is great.  It just barely fits on the pre-existing Garmin disc, and it doesn't fall.  It's never dropped my phone.  It was a good purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"135 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1571875200000}

I do carry a larger phone with a pretty durable case around it and one of the issues I have had with other mounts I tried was they just couldn't hold the phone well or would detach completely from wherever I had it mounted in the car with even slight bumps in the road. I will say that the suction works best on the windshield, which is perfect for me since I like my phone mounted in the left corner of windshield behind the steering wheel. Although, it does stick pretty well to other surfaces in the vehicle.I have only had the mount itself detach once when the inside temperature of the car was well above 100 degrees on an unusually hot day. I have never had an issue since.My one issue, and this is very nuanced, is that because I have a case on my phone, when I go to plug in a USB cable and then place the phone in the mount it does not fit perfectly with the case\/USB combo. This may be in large part due the fact that my phone case does have a dust protector over the USB charging port that hangs from the bottom of the case when a USB cable is plugged in. However, if they would just make a small adjustment bottom of the mount (since many decent phone cases do have charging port covers) that would accommodate phone cases with or without charging port covers, it would make for an almost perfect phone mount.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1641168000000}

To my surprise, this product has never lost suction or fallen off the dash. My phone is a Samsung s5 active, plus I have a case on it.. and it holds my phone adequately, although more depth in the holder itself would have been nice.As for the side support arms, they simply ratchet click in place to hold the phone.. and has a quick release button for removing the phone. The bottom support arm slides in and out as desired.If I had to complain about anything it would be the suction cup. The suction cup uses an adhesive film in order to assist the suction cup with sticking and staying on a surface. The problem with this design though is that every time you remove the holder from the car, a little bit of the adhesive film wears off. Eventually if the holder is removed too many times the adhesive film will become useless. For that reason, it's best to pick the vehicle and spot that is desired and leave it.. don't move the holder to a different spot unless nessesary.Other than the adhesive film issue.. I think this is a great holder.update: 10\/2\/2022I finally retired this holder last week.. only because I got a new phone and wanted to have wireless charging not because this one broke..

However, once I got it on it was very secure and did everything I wanted the mount to do.

Also, I do not use the mounting plate provided with he mount, but the windshield instead because I move the mount to different vehicles. Sadly, the unit keeps detaching from the windshield falling to the dashboard. It is a real disappointment. Unfortunately, I purchased two of these mounts before I realized that they don\u2019t work (at least how I use them), leaving one in the States and taking the other overseas where I live full-time. By the time I realized my mistake it was too late to return them.

It seemed to be working great for about a week then suddenly the 3M disc detached and the mount with my phone in it flew to the floorboard. The 3M disc isn't reusable so I'm pretty much SOL at this point. Extremely dissapointed that I basically wasted $25 on this thing.

Also, the arm isn't quite long enough. With windshields so steeply sloped these days, you have to mount the holder so far away to position the phone low enough but the arm doesn't extend far enough to keep the phone within reach. Build quality is pretty good - the arm is hollow plastic, but everything else is solidly made.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620259200000}

Measure out the full Mount arm and when you reach to interact w\/ your phone. I placed mine in the middle of the dash and forward, toward me with full Mount arm out and it was PERFECT position without distracting my field of driving view...Don't over tighten the joints...

I did lots of research to decide what phone mount would work best for us. I was excited about this product but it failed very quickly.First, the adhesive plate designed to stick to our dashboard didn\u2019t hold. I followed all the steps, cleaned and prepped the surface, and it held until the sun came out. I\u2019m not talking about desert sun, or Florida sun or even super hot days. Just a minivan, in the Midwest on a normal June day. When the sun came out, and the car warmed up, the adhesive stopped working and the mount fell.Second, I figured \u201cWell, maybe I can try the suction cup directly on the window rather than the dashboard mounting plate.\u201d  WRONG!  That normal, average sunshine that made the adhesive ineffectual, also completely melted the suction cup to the plate!  The picture attached shows me trying (unsuccessfully) to separate the two pieces with a chisel. The suction cup entirely melted and permanently attached itself to the plate.So, the plate didn\u2019t hold and now I can even separate it from the suction cup. This thing lasted about 4 days total.

{"reviewTitle":"Very good, but not ideal","reviewDescription":"Not perfect, but pretty good. The suction cup is made from a clear silicone rubber compound that adheres very well to textured surfaces common in interior car plastics. Mind you, you'll likely need to clean the surface with rubbing alcohol to remove any slick shiny stuff. I'm quite sure it will stick to glass, but that's not where I wanted my phone, so I didn't attempt it.What it will not stick to is any surface that has even a slight curvature. This is unfortunate because my first choice would have been such a location.Also problematic was the included plastic disk with a back adhesive covered with a red plastic, similar to auto trim tape I've seen and used many times before with good results. This disk is so you can apply the suction cup after sticking it to  where you want it to go. In my case, it didn't stick any better than a post-it. I think this particular disk had bad adhesive. Disappointing, but not a deal killer.I imagine that the soft silicone rubber of the cup (which must be clean when you use it) would warm and deform and pop off a windshield in a hot summer day. It is much softer than most suction cups of this type, which seems to help it adhere to tougher surfaces. It works well but I don't imagine it lasting as long.This also comes with a vent clip holder which works very well, but I wish I could use the included arm with it. This is not possible as it currently ships; i.e., I wish the main arm attacked with a ball socket on both ends and could be swapped. I'd recommend this change to the manufacturer when they update the design.I've had this phone holder for a couple of weeks and it's one of the best ones I've tried.

I had the product mounted to my dashboard in my Subaru Outback. I cleaned off the surface before using it, and the summer heat got to it. It was surprising that a product intended for cars couldn't handle summer heat (Indiana, 80s and low 90s outside). I have a larger phone (Galaxy S10+) which may have contributed to the problem.UPDATE: The seller replaced my product for me and provided recommendations on how to make the most out of it again. They recommended using the included \"flat pad\" to help even out the surface I had it mounted on, but this product didn't stick to my dashboard (even after cleaning) so I just mounted it how I did originally, looking for the flatted surface possible. It's no longer summer, but the product has held up longer than it did originally. I made sure to remove all cases from my phone to try and cut down on the weight. I'll update this again next summer if I run into any issues again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1595548800000}
