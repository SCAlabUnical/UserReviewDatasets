{"reviewTitle":"Hurts your butt.","reviewDescription":"I'll start with the negatives.Where your butt goes... it's a bit too firm. After 30 minutes your butt is gonna hurt.  That's the most important part of the chair....The leg rest is okay. It just doesn't extend as far as I'd like. The leg rest also doesn't slide with ease like others I've had.The massager is terrible. Didn't expect it to be good tbh. It just vibrates and hums. 0 effect on your back.  The pillows are fine. But I wouldn't even advertise it as a massager if I was the company.  It's a gimmick.The arm rests are pretty comfortable. The back is fairly comfortable for me. A short person. If you're 5'10\" or taller you'll want a different chair.Back and neck pillows are good. I'd almost say you need them for the chair to be somewhat comfortable.Overall it's an uncomfortable chair. It wasn't expensive so I won't say I didn't get my money's worth. I did. It does the job.But the seat is too d*mn firm. Needs some fluff. Consider buying a 2nd cushion to use if you decide to go with this chair.  I waited to see if it'd need a break in period before writing a review.  After 2 months use.  My a** still hurts. \ud83e\udd23Positives:Neck\/Back pillowsArm restsLook\/designNegatives:Everything that makes a chair good, ceases to exist.Hard buttShort Back restVibrating pillow gives your back a hummer.If you recline it wants to tip over.The recline isn't a full flat lay down.

{"reviewTitle":"Decent \"For The Price,\" but is showing its cheap quality with normal use after only 3-4 months.","reviewDescription":"Overall, this is a decent chair \"For the Price.\"  I have used it on a daily basis at my computer, normal use, no spills, no tears, no accidents of any kind... and after only 3-4 months (May-August) the fake leather is starting to peel and get discolored in the corner of the seat cushion as you can see.  The back cushion is significantly flattened from when I purchased it as well from normal use.  The back of the seat reclines, but the bottom does not lean with it, so it sometimes feels like I am about to slide out of the chair when I recline.  The footrest is chintzey - when I really want a footrest it's better than nothing, but it's not really that comfortable and not convenient to pull out, so I mostly don't use it as a result.All in all, it's a chair, and it works, and if you're on a tight budget - it will work for you too.

{"reviewTitle":"Very poorly made","reviewDescription":"I've had this chair for two years now. When I first purchased this chair I thought it looked nice and it was comfortable. When I was assembling the chair there were some parts of the chair that weren't exactly straight, but it wasn't bad enough to not let me put it together. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the foot rest, but other than that things were okay for a short while. I started having to tighten the arm rest screws monthly because they were loosening greatly. Within a short period of time I noticed the frame of the chair was bending towards the left because I lean to my left. A better made chair would not be doing this or at least not that soon. Also, the cushion padding on the seat was flat and non-existant after 6 months. Now, after only two years, the metal part on the side of the base of the seat where the arm rest screw tightens into completely broke off. Not the screw but the metal part of the chair frame! How does metal break? This product is not worth the investment. This was too much money for me to waste on a chair that was warped after 6 months and completely broken after 2 years.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716940800000}

It was then that I noticed that the zippers on the backrest were broken. There was no finger tabs to hold onto to use the zippers, so I had to go to the store and buy a repair kit to fix them. No way was I going to take it apart, box it back up, and try to find someone to help me get it to a return spot or to the post office to return it. I'd rather spend the extra 5 bucks and just fix it myself since the manufacturer can't seem to box it up without breaking it.It's a good thing it has a back massager, as I needed it when I was done assembling the chair.Overall, if you don't mind wrenching your back just moving the box and can do some basic self-repair, then go for it.

I did find a pdf of instructions for a very similar chair that got me through it. Assembly isn\u2019t hard so let\u2019s get into it.1. MAJOR MALFUNCTION - The armrests are nice but they get loose after a few reclines. I\u2019ve tightened the bolts as much as I dare without damaging the backrest or the screws themselves.2. The leg rest. FLIMSY. If you\u2019re a big guy and saw the 400lb capacity and said \u201chey that looks great!\u201d You\u2019re gonna be disappointed. It dips down when you put your legs on it. It\u2019s basically unusable.3. Seat, backrest and lumbar support:Not terrible. Lumbar pillow could be firmer and larger. Vibration is a joke. My phone vibrates harder. No seat depth adjustment but it\u2019s not a deal breaker as most gaming chairs don\u2019t offer this. Back rest is comfortable enough that I fell asleep in it. Adjusting the backrest isn\u2019t super easy nor is it sufficiently spring loaded to come back up all the way on its own. The seat is kinda hard but it\u2019s 110$ chair I can\u2019t complain about it too much.4: HARDWARE - gas cylinder, base and wheels: it doesn\u2019t lower smoothly for its purported capacity. You\u2019ll drop like a rock. Wheels are not color coordinated which is a bummer but not a dealbreaker. Universal wheels are 14$ and fit great if you have carpet like I do. Base is also a bland black plastic seems sturdy enough.Over all the loosening armrests are the biggest issue the other chairs on here like Dowinx have a car style lever to adjust the backrest and I think I may go with that unless we can get the armrests to stay put.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1706572800000}

UPDATE: Although assembly was relatively easy once I received all the missing parts (actually I was still missing a few screws) after only a few weeks I have had to tighten the arms several times.The seat of the chair is not near as comfy as they say, the footstool is not very useful or sturdy and the back support of the chair is already losing the padding there and is now very uncomfortable. UPDATE: Chair needs more durable padding in all areas. The padding in the seat and back (shoulder area) are already worn and I have had to replace with a pillow to pad the entire back rest. Because of the failing back rest padding I had to remove the lumbar pillow so I could use my own pillow for support and padding.  Also the velco strap holding the neck support pillow is losing strength and that pillow is sagging.Also - not made for short people - I'm 5'3\"  and I can only just barely have feet flat on floor and the arms are too short (it'd be nice if they could be adjusted.)

{"reviewTitle":"Impressed. Good buy!","reviewDescription":"If you\u2019re like me you probably spend hours sifting through reviews before making a purchase online.  Reviews for this chair are pretty high, and for good reason.However I did come across some criticism reviews, and I\u2019m not going to say that others\u2019 experience with this chair aren\u2019t valid.  The main complaint that stuck out was screws loosening over time.  The assembly manual that comes with the chair clearly states that this will happen, and you may need to tighten them.  The reclining feature means that parts have to move and rotate, so this really shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise.  Another complaint I saw was that the footrest wasn\u2019t very sturdy\u2026well, it\u2019s a footrest and not meant to be sat on.  The chair is sturdy, no creaking or popping of parts.  The casters are smooth on carpet, short carpet, which is great. The padding on the seat is comfortable, but I would say it could use a little more on the seat side panels, and could be firmer on the armrests.  All-in-all I\u2019m pretty happy with it thus far.*I\u2019m only 5\u20197\u201d and 200lbs, it feels like it could handle way more but I personally can\u2019t verify that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"52 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719619200000}

While the chair has some positives, there are a couple of notable drawbacks that have left us with mixed feelings.Pros:1. **Stylish Appearance**: The white color of this gaming chair gives it a modern and sleek look that fits well in his gaming setup.2. **Lumbar Support and Headrest**: The inclusion of lumbar support and a headrest provides additional comfort during extended gaming or study sessions.3. **Footrest**: The footrest is a nice addition, allowing him to stretch out and relax between gaming sessions.Cons:1. **Limited Reclining**: One major drawback is that the chair doesn't recline all the way, which my son found disappointing. He was hoping for a more extensive range of reclining options for maximum comfort.2. **Non-Adjustable Armrests**: Another notable issue is that the armrests are not adjustable in height. This lack of flexibility can lead to discomfort during long gaming sessions.In conclusion, the GTPLAYER Gaming Chair in white has a stylish appearance and provides some essential features like lumbar support, a headrest, and a footrest. However, the limited recline and non-adjustable armrests have left my son somewhat dissatisfied. While it may suit some users, those who prioritize extensive recline options and adjustable armrests might want to explore other gaming chair options.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694736000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Built for looks, not durability","reviewDescription":"Pros & Cons listed at bottom if you don't want to read all this.I received this chair yesterday. Packing was fine, and assembly was pretty straightforward. The chair looks decent, and is moderately comfortable.It was designed with very cheap plastic, and without much quality. A lot of the plastic pieces had nicks, scratches, and even a couple gouges out of the plastic, which is so soft you can tear into with your fingernail. The pleather is not good for long sitting, as it can cause sweating. I work from home 8 hours a day and typically can spend up to another 5 hours per day on top of that at the computer. It is not comfortable enough for that kind of use. Also, I'm a fairly wide shouldered man, and the \"wings\" on the side of the chair curve inward, so I feel squeezed rather that supported.The armrests are also very fragile. They're bending armrests and they're only connected at two points to accommodate that, but that also makes them very weak to any kind of sideways pressure.The back without the lumbar pillow is almost comfortable, but has a weird knot about halfway up that sticks into the back. This isn't as noticeable with the lumbar pillow, but that pillow is very uncomfortable, probably because of the mechanisms inside for the massage function. I did not try the massage function.Without the lumbar pillow, it's not bad when reclined with the leg rest, though the leg rest is only held in place by a single screw to prevent the bar from sliding out. I doubt that would work very well for long. However, you have to manually bring the back up after reclining. Not a huge deal, but another annoyance on the long list.Pros:+Fairly comfortable without lumbar pillow\/massager.+Nice when reclined+Looks nice+Not terribly priced+Leg rest comfortable+Easy to assemble+Well packaged for shippingCons:-Cheap Material-Uncomfortable with lumbar pillow\/massager-Narrow Shoulder \"wings\"-Flimsy armrests-Material doesn't breath\/Makes you sweaty-Plastic came damaged, can be scratched away with fingernail.-Head Pillow strap not adjustable, annoying for tall people-Not comfortable for long work\/gaming sessions.-Back of chair does not come back up automatically (have to pull it up)Recommendation:Do not buy this chair.

Next the cushion is not soft. It is quite firm. I'm 190 and found it too hard and probably too thin. The arm rests are too low for an adult. I'm 5'7 (not tall) and I found them too low.

{"reviewTitle":"TERRIBLE PRODUCT! TRUST ME!","reviewDescription":"This has officially become the last product I ever buy from Amazon. I am sick of the platforms terrible ability to control quality. The screws back out within four or five days of buying it. It has happened so often that I've had to disassemble the entire chair and put loctite on all the screws and reassemble it. I don't expect it to last much longer. Though it may look good it is not comfortable and the noise it makes just sitting it or trying to recline it is unacceptable. The screws backing out started with the arms of the chair and then it became the back of the chair so that it would pop and snap every time you lean back. The compression cylinder has already worked itself loose so the chair wobbles in every direction. The lumbar vibration vibration is super hard and there's no switch so you are going to have to manually plug it in and unplug it each time you want to use it. The chair back has very little to no padding at all and when you recline the chair there is a large gap between the seat and the back. And since the seat is solid in the back you are going to be very uncomfortable unless you slouch. The so-called leg rest will only work if you are under 4 ft tall. Because when you extend it out it lays perfectly horizontal to the ground whereas your legs will be a slight angle which means the back of your calves are going to be resting on the front edge only. There is no way to change this so the leg rest is useless and is also parallel to the seat which means your legs are going to have to stick straight out. Amazon used to be a great place to get things but now they just push absolute junk and their customer service has become inept at their jobs. And when there's a problem with a product Amazon refers you to the seller and usually the seller is in China and they do not care what your problem is. The company told me that they would send me whatever pieces I need and they weren't listening when I explained this whole situation to them that it is not a individual part problem it is the entire chair and the fact that regardless of how tight you tighten the screws they will back out. If you don't put loctite on them it's only a matter of time before they back out enough to either strip the threads or snap the head clean off. You're better off buying a more expensive chair because for $128 I would rather have purchased a bean bag chair. If you're a gamer, that means you probably spend a lot of time gaming and you do not want to sit in this chair for more than the length of a movie or you will be crawling down onto the floor to try to straighten out your back. This chair, just like so many other products that I'm tired of receiving, is absolute junk and you really have no recourse unless you want to box this thing back up and ship it back so they can send you another of the exact same problematic product. Goodbye Amazon, I'll shop brick and mortar even if it cost me 50% more per product simply because I won't have to deal with the headache that comes with being on this platform.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1725148800000}

I work from home, if you do too, steer clear of this chair. This is the second chair I\u2019ve lost hundreds of dollars on, because Amazon will not give me a refund unless I ship the chair back to the seller WHICH IS CRAZY. If I kept every box that I was mailed just in the off chance I would have to mail something back, I would have no room left in my home. Amazon claimed that I could simply disassemble the chair and put it in a ups box large enough to fit all the pieces, but I don\u2019t trust anyone to give me my money back if I did that. Most sellers want all of the original packing that came with the item, which is just a clever way to not offer anyone refunds. Horrible.

{"reviewTitle":"Lasted one month longer than the warranty","reviewDescription":"At first I was extremely happy with this chair. The back massager was great, but then the new chair feeling began to wear off. I spend almost all day in front of a computer and have a service connected disability, so I purchase a chair with more weight allowance than I place into it. The seat cushion became hard after a few months and I have almost damaged my USB ports several times trying to get out of the chair  with the message cushion still plugged into the USB port needed to power it. 5 feet seems like a decent length until you realize that you need 6-8 to back away from a desk to stand up. So I am reduced to using only on days that it is too uncomfortable to stand up, lie down, or sit for very long. The leg rest is kind of nice and would probably work great for a pre-teen or short adult (under 5' 5\") I am 5'11\" so the rest sits just below  the knees, about mid to upper calf when I sit in the chair with my back resting on the massager. This results in the blood circulation being cut off to the feet after 30 minutes or so.This chair was rated at 250 lbs. The VA doc told me last month that I weigh less than 220. So it is hard for me to understand why the weld or whatever is used to hold the front of the arm brace to the central seat portion has broken. The left arm now lays off to the side and is wide enough that I cannot rest my arm on it comfortably when sitting in the center of the seat. I do not trust a chair with wheels on the bottom of it to try and stand up so I know that is not the issue, same with sitting down.I have contacted the seller about the issue and will try to update this review with their response.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"33 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688428800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Deceptive","reviewDescription":"Chair is meant to support an adult up to 300lbs. I am 6ft tall and 180Lbs, and this chair is barely wide enough for my 33inch waist to both sit\/lean-back in. It has to be at the lowest setting to allow my feet to touch the ground giving me a correct 90degree knee bend for posture. This is not ergonomic in any sense, as I've used a month now and am developing right hip pain. The front of the chair and side of the chair look like the photos posted on product page, but the backing is not shown. There is a good reason for that as the chair back attaches to the chair seat via a large metal bracket that is ugly and machine shopped as poorly as the rest of the components showing large welding spots. This is very visually upsetting as well as visually shows poor workmanship. The backing needs to be adjusted every few days as it is only hand tightened without a locking feature, and keeps sliding downward over time. This chair already creaks as much as the chair it was meant to replace which was a no-name brand and over 12 years old. I followed the lame GT Racing \"support suggestions\" (just re-tighten the screw-end of support), and re-tightened the screws, and it helps with the problem. However, this is less then 2 months in and I've had to readjust the backing, and screws 5 times. The armrests are incredibly flimsy (visually would be nice if they had covers for the screw holes or provided black screws so you didn't have to see them after assembly (every other manufacturer has figured this out decades ago). The look isn't of concern to me, but the fact that they are not durable or safe is. The armrests are very cheap with the smallest of washers actually holding the arms to the chair tight. These armrests are not safe to use to help you push up or sit down into the chair. Like previously mentioned, I am only 180Lbs, and I cannot put more then a few pounds of pressure on the arm rest without them bending outward. This will clearly leave them broken within the year if not 6 months. So be very careful as I was not and check warranty, 1 year or less = junk that will either barely make the mark or fail spectacularly beforehand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"33 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1642032000000}

Honestly, it seems like a hoax as it's not just putting things together so it ships in a smaller box- you must assemble the entire thing. It costs $25 -30 to return so really not worth returning.

{"reviewTitle":"Dont Buy Gaming Chairs","reviewDescription":"This just arrived and I spent a full half hour on step 1 trying to place the wheels in only to find that they dont fasten in place, at all. When turning the thing around to go through more steps, the wheels fall out and it's literally impossible to put them back in unless the thing is upside down. Rinse and repeat. Not dealing with this when I have to work a 12 hour shift.Edit: I'm highly incompetent and learned that yes, the wheels do click into place! It only requires you to use the force of two colliding black holes to do it. Took me about an hour or more to put the entire chair together. Its recommended that you have two people put it together, but c'mon. You're getting this chair if you're a gamer. 0x0 is still zero and that's exactly how many friends we have.Overall I really enjoy the chair. It's pretty comfortable and seriously worth the 159 I paid. It did come in with a tear at the top of the seat but the tears in my eyes from my loneliness hides it pretty well. The massage cushion is also just alright but I enjoy using it while I game, it helps soothe my lower back just enough. If you're just like me and this is your first gaming chair but you're also fat enough to eat a full pizza and still get hangry, be warned that the chair doesnt allow for nearly as much sitting leg room as a normal office chair would. With that being said, it's easy to get used to.Edit: Purely for the sake of keeping the stupid crap I put fir this review, I wont be editing what's been said, but man...don't get Gaming Chairs. A week after I wrote this review the back of chair began to bend to the side. As it was my only chair, I had to keep using it. The side it was leaning towards caused that side of my back to become virtually incapacitated as when I moved it around, it caused me extreme pain.It's possible I was simply incompetent when putting the chair together, but after doing extensive research, you'll find it's not worth buying a gaming chair. They're cheaply made with low ergonomic design, low comfort, overpriced with a \"GAMER\" tag added onto them. They will cause back issues, they will hurt your poor tooshie, and most of all, they dont even last long. If you're thinking of buying a chair, just buy a nice office chair. You can slap a nice Gaming logo on it and boom, you've got a gamer chair that actually beneficial to you. Gaming Chairs look cool but have absolutely no practical use when you realize just how important it is to take care of your body.If you want to pay 150+ for back problems, be my guest!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"38 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1593216000000}

Probably a quarter of an inch of pad under the bum area and then your sitting on hard plastic.It will still not roll as they should. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in cement even though I have hardwood floors. I should be sliding across as if I\u2019m on ice. I contact customer service in regards to the problem with the casters and I\u2019m spoken to as if I\u2019m a child and how I should understand that different floor surfaces could affect the operation of the casters. I did not appreciate the way customer service just made an assumption as if I was an absolute idiot, and didn\u2019t know how a caster should roll across the floor.  Again I have hardwood floors. I should slide across it very easily. The issue I reported with the casters as if they were locked in place. These casters do not have a locking switch on them so that should not be the case. They do not spin and swivel as they should nor do they roll very well.As far as the armrest go, they have already loosened up quite a bit. I feel that this is a very cheap game chair. Those chairs probably worth maybe $50. And if that is probably giving it too much credit.I bought this chair based on the mass of amount of reviews.

This chair looks great, but is very badly designed from an ergonomic standpoint. The seat cushion is far too hard, and after hours of being seated (I'm a lightweight person on the thin side) my backside was in pain and turned red. After about a week of use, I also noticed my spine being dug into by a hidden horizontal bar in the middle section of the chair back. Absolutely horrible, human-unfriendly  implementation.This chair is cheap, good looking and a lot of people say they like it. But when you get it and sit in it for 8 hours a day, it's pure torture to your body because of hard bars and planks that are hidden behind a thin layer of soft looking faux leather.Spend the extra money and go to thee Swedish store, where you can try before you buy.

The steel construction of the frame itself and the quality of the pneumatic that adjusts the height is above par.However... The plastic wheels, after only a few months of use, have broken at the axle and fallen apart. Also, the footrest relies on plastics that have begun to stretch out of place or broken and no longer support my legs comfortably. To top it off, the seat itself has \"wings\" going up the side of it that has irritated and bruised my hips. Also, the covering on the armrests and seat has begun to decay, horribly cracking, splitting, or being worn down far more quickly than it should be given the cost and age.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663286400000}

Now I am popping a wheel half back on almost every day, almost every time I move the chair one falls off. Frustrating and low quality wheels.

I work from home, go to grad school and I like to game and write in my spare time. I have back issues due to a congenital condition, so a comfortable and supportive chair is very important. I sprang for this one because I really, really needed a better chair than the one I had. I'm not the best at putting things together without a visual like a video,  but the instructions were clear and very easy to follow. I was able to put it together myself, shaking hands, motor control issues and all!The chair is so comfortable and feels sturdy when I sit in it. I have really long legs and the seat itself doesn't feel too short to me at all. The foot rest is a fantastic feature; I will say that it's a bit shorter than I will like, but I chalk that up to my legs being so long. Even with that, putting my feet up at work and being able to recline is a godsend on long days. The armrests feel sturdy and come up to a comfortable height. I tried the massaging lumbar support; it was a bit loud but it's by no means a deal breaker.If you're on a budget and are looking for a gaming or office chair, I would recommend this one for sure! If my husband likes it, I may even get him one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711411200000}

{"reviewTitle":"LOVE this chair","reviewDescription":"I have only two issues regarding this chair, one is price related and one is actually chair related (but minor):1. Shipping Cost: $30 for shipping is insane. It\u2019s a big, heavy item, I get it. But I almost didn\u2019t buy this chair because of the shipping costs, but it had good reviews, looked the way I wanted it to in the pics, and I had an extra coupon I applied to it.2. The footrest is great, BUT it is very hard to pull out. I like that because it means it\u2019s not easy to accidentally push it with my feet, but it also means when I\u2019m very tired and comfy and wish to adjust the footrest it is a PROCESS to get it to move.Overall though, this chair is great. I personally recommend having a second person to help you put it together (at least if you\u2019re inexperienced like me) specifically to put the back on. It\u2019s super comfy, I love the little pillow behind my head, and I love how I can lay down in it or sit up. It\u2019s a little too tall for my desk even at its lowest, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m in a college dorm \ud83d\ude05 I definitely recommend this chair!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1712793600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good for short-term but the quality shows over time.","reviewDescription":"If you need a decent chair for a couple months until you can save for a better one, then this would be a great pick. It will get the job done but the quality is sub-par at best, when it arrived the leather had cuts in some places and when screwed on i noticed the armrests were a bit loose despite being tightened all the way. The \"massage pillow\" is a literal brick that shakes(straight into the trash) and a pillow was needed on the underside due to little to no cushioning. But I looked past all this as it was all either visual issues or resolved easily. What was not easily resolved or ignored was when the weld on the base sheered away like nothing in the matter of a night, which is not what I'd expect from a chair that is moderately used by someone 170lbs, I had owned the chair for just over a year and one night it just gradually leaned further and further back until it snapped. If you need a chair in a pinch this will do but it is overall your typical mass produced Chinese garbage with no quality control, invest a little bit more in a better one or break this one within a year so you can get your money back from the warranty.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1649203200000}

If you are looking for a comfortable chair for working at a desk all day, you probably want to pass on this one. The seat is hard, barely cushioned at all and it tilts toward the back of the chair as if it was designed for reclining. I placed a level on it so that you can see just how much of a difference there is from front to back. This is definitely not ergonomically comfortable in any way.I am 5'6\" and my behind sits lower than my legs do at the front of the chair which causes a lot of pressure on the back of my legs at the front edge of the chair. This pressure is there no matter if I sit to the back of the chair or scoot toward the center, the pressure on whatever part of my leg is at the front edge of the chair is very intense. I found a box to put under my feet to lift my legs upward and the pressure was relieved. It would be nice if the chair had a seat tilt feature, but it doesn't. Honestly, had I tried out this chair in a store I would have immediately disliked it and done a hard pass on it.I really don't have anything positive to say about this chair other than assembling it was pretty easy and everything was labeled and packed well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691107200000}

That being said, what it has in comfort and appearance, it lacks in build quality. The arm rests are attached via 2 L brackets on each side (4 brackets total). This means that it is extremely easy to bend the bracket when hitting the arm rest and It eventually breaks off. It is strange however since only my right armrest broke off while the left side is still in tact with moderate stiffness. This is a good product but for over $100 USD I expect higher quality especially in a freaking CHAIR. I bought a racing chair for my '00 Honda Civic for less than this. How can you possibly justify a \"gaming\" chair costing more than an automotive \"racing\" chair.

A few hang-ups","reviewDescription":"This is a great \"starter\" chair considering the price, but I do have a couple issues with it (they are small issues overall)The instructions are a bit vague at times, such as when putting the wheels on, it simply said \"install the wheels\" without going into detail (I just shoved them in there). They do include an allen wrench and all the screws are in nice packaging so they don't get lost as easy, so that is a plus (they even included extra parts!).The main reason I picked this chair was the footrest, and while it does get the job done, it feels... off. It isn't strong, and dips at the slightest pressure so I'm scared of it breaking (BUT it hasn't yet, will update if it does). The rest of the chair is holding up well though! Another pint regarding the foot rest is I do NOT recommend it for taller people. I'm about 5ft 2 and half of my lower leg dangles off. If you're any taller then 5ft 5, I'd stick to buying a separate foot rest.Overall, chair is pretty good for a starter chair considering other gaming chairs are anywhere from 50-200$ more, and don't have the higher weight limit like this one doesTL;DR Instructions are vague at times, foot rest feels off, but a good chair for the price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1616112000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Better than Expected","reviewDescription":"I got this chair on sale for $110 (not counting shipping) which I recommend you do.Assembly: It took barely an hour to put together and could\u2019ve honestly been quicker than that had I not been multitasking. It\u2019s incredibly easy\/simple to assemble, a child (of good enough strength to tighten the screws and lift the chair) could build this. Despite it\u2019s simplistic construction is feels smooth and sturdy.Experience: initially, it felt cheap. The sides of the backing of the chair feel as though they are lined with pool noodles, which threw me off at first. I was worried the chair was going to be stiff or uncomfortable. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It\u2019s very comfortable to sit in, and the telescoping arms and foot rest are incredibly appreciated. I will say the plastic of the arms feels on the cheaper side and they already seemed a little wobbly shortly after construction. This can likely be amended by tightening the screws. The lumbar support pillow sits a little low for me, so I wish it adjusted to an even higher point, but I will say I am rather curvy so that\u2019s likely a me problem. The headrest pillow is very nice and the backrest reclines and locks well, doesn\u2019t feel wobbly or like it\u2019s going to tip backwards. The chair also sits very low which was wonderful since it fit under my bunk bed, *and* fit my legs comfortably under my desk, which is impressive since most others do not (I have thicker thighs).Summary: I think this chair is definitely one of the best on the market for the price point. It\u2019s not exactly top of the market quality but that\u2019s to be expected for only $110. I would expect slightly better quality if I were paying the full $200 for it, though. Recommended on sale, and especially for those on more of a budget.

{"reviewTitle":"Trying it now...  here's the run-down!","reviewDescription":"Just assembled it. It is quite easy if you just review the parts.My first impression is, considering its bulk or size, it is like an internet date where you expect a 160 lb person but a 110 lb person shows up. So it is a bit thin in foam and size. The width is not as wide as a normal black foamy office chair. I myself may have preferred a chair with built-in pillows rather than the little ones meant to be placed on the chair, although they do stay in place.The pillows are small, and the seat has no front bump to keep you from sliding off during intensive gaming or TV-watching sessions. The lower back pillow straps around the chair like a backpack and slides up and down somewhat. It vibrates, if you're into that type of thing, but you have to be 3 feet from a USB (large end) outlet to plug it in, and it has no on\/off switch or controller; it unplugs from an 80s-style charger port at the base of the seat. That unplug is in an okay spot and does not dangle all the way to the floor.The controls for up\/down and reclination are not easy to reach. You have to either stick your arm through the right armrest or lean way to the right and around, but they do work well and lock in place nicely. The top pillow is okay and can be moved so you can sit back and watch TV, but it does not have the comfort level for extended TV viewing. As for gaming, I am impressed. The forward position, when locked in place, keeps you at a perfect position to rest your elbows on the armrests and hold a controller in front of you while keeping your back in a much more comfortable position than most chairs, all while resting your feet on the legs of the chair above the front two casters. You can sit Indian style in any position, and tilting back allows for wider leg expansion. The leg rest is more of an accessory. If you need to stretch out your legs and rest a while, it is okay, but it is not very wide so you need to keep your legs straight. The foam comfort level is above average. The pleather vinyl indents quickly, but it is not the shiny type, so it is not too sweaty.GTPLAYER really made a great simple chair. Great for upright gaming. Okay for standard computer use. It really should only cost $20 more than a $65 office chair, so if that is what you use, stick with that. What you're getting in addition is less but tougher foam, a separately reclining backrest with arms that pivot and move, vibration, and leg rest. Although quite a bit smaller than the picture, I am satisfied.If you type this review into ChatGPT, it will give you the pros and cons; too long to paste.I will update after 30 hours of computer use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722297600000}

I think I need to oil it or something because when I pull it out and push it back it after use, there is some resistance when there should be a smooth glide. The small backrest pillow is supposed to help support your lumbar area and you can also plug it in for a small vibration to help your back.

{"reviewTitle":"Great chair for the price","reviewDescription":"I wanted to wait a week before I did my review and here are my thoughts.  For the price, this is a great chair and I'd buy it again.  I work from home 80% of the time and also play Xbox at night in the same room so I use a chair A LOT.  Previously, I had a cheap desk chair from Amazon that I got in 2020 when the world shut down and we were all working from home.  I'll just do pros and cons:Pros:1. Easy to assemble.2. VERY sturdy chair.  Metal frame and smooth wheels, height and recline adjustments are very smooth and natural3. Vibrating lumbar pillow is a plus.4. Recline is great and feels sturdy.5. Nice to have a pull out footrest.6. Very large seat cushion.  I'm a small guy and can easily sit with my foot under my leg in like a \"4\" very comfortably.7. Cushions on the arms are soft and great for sitting all day.8. Every function is very smooth and feels very sturdy.9. They give you some extra parts.  I was actually missing a couple washers needed for assembly and found what I needed in the \"extra\" parts.10. Neck\/head pillow is soft and comfortable.  It's very small but definitely standard for most of these gaming chairs.Cons:1. Seat cushion is NOT very soft.  In fact, it's a little too firm in my opinion.  I found sitting for long periods of time, my butt getting kind of uncomfortable.  I'm assuming over time it will get softer but I wish it had more of a memory foam type cushion on top of the foam.  I got a cheap memory foam cushion pad for my old chair and am actually using it on this one which does help, but then that also puts your position on the chair higher.  This in turn makes the lumbar pillow lower than it really should be.2. The leg rest comes out easy for me (saw some people having issues and you need to make sure the mounts are straight when assembling, they are adjustable as you tighten).  However, the way the leg rest flips out to use makes it very easy for it not to stay where it's supposed to be.  If you rest anything on the inside part of the leg rest, it's going to want to flip into it's storage position.  If you have your legs straight this is not an issue but I found this cumbersome at times.3. It gets kinda warm.  If you're sitting with shorts on or I would imagine if you didn't have a shirt on for some reason (don't know why you wouldn't but you do you), your skin with start to stick to it a bit.  Obviously it's not like getting into a hot car in the summer, but just something to think about.3. Being a shorter guy I wish it did go just a tiny bit lower.  My desk at home is even a little higher than some \"normal\" desks and it doesn't fit under the desk even in it's lowest position.  I can make it fit, but it scrapes the arm cushions a bit and I could see that ripping them in time.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but if you're used to storing this under your desk, this may be an issue for you as well.4. For the vibrating pillow, you must be connected via USB to a power source.  I'm guessing you could use some type of battery pack but there's also no on\/off, once you plug in you're on until you unplug.TL;DR: Great chair for the price.  Seat cushion could be softer imo but function\/style\/stability is on point.

The red one had a defective bolt in one of the arms that forced the head to strip barely half way into the chair, so we had to contact the support team.  When explaining the situation over the phone, the response was \"What do you want us to do about it?\".  I continued by saying I didn't want a refund, I just want a replacement arm and seat for the chair (as well as the bolt) and I will send the other conjoined parts back to them.  They didn't want the parts back but DID send the replacements.. in two separate packages that arrived 3 days apart.FINALLY! We could enjoy our chairs together.  A few days later I developed neck and back pains from the shape of the blue chair and the lumbar vibrating bag got so hot that I was afraid it was going to melt the interior and start a fire.  For a remedy I slid a pillow and pillowcase over the chair for the necessary support and have started looking for a much better and much needed replacement.Also, for a person who is 185, 6'0\", this chair is surprisingly too small in height to a point where the neck cushion attachment area digs into your neck making it quite uncomfortable.  If they were on the outside edges it would not have been as bad.___Update for 4\/8\/2022 --  Well, the entire right arm connection to the seat is actually stripped out.  As you can see from above, I'm not a large person and I don't use it as a crutch when moving\/readjusting in the chair or a lean-to arm rest.  Went to tighten it down one day as I routinely check for loose bolts and the arm was fully tightened but ridiculously loose.

But upon opening just the tools box, I was already noticing I was missing parts (mostly washers and screws). I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised with the massaging lumbar cushion. But once it was all but together I was sitting there falling deeper and deeper into disappointment.There is no cushion in this. I am a thick lady, (220lbs) and my ass can barely sit in it comfortable. It feels like I'll just slid off, well, to make it more accurate, it feels like my ass is not even fully on it. The chair handles are poorly placed and make it difficult to lever one of them since it is nearly flush with the bottom of the chair. The massaging cushion is not a massage, more like just a medium vibration. Trying to set this chair up in a way that is comfortable was a chore and it didn't even hold that position, any amount of pressure on the arms would move the back of the chair forward.I honestly could complain further about how there is already rust on one of the parts, or how the welding isn't done correctly. I could mention the foot rest is weak and wouldn't be able to hold anything unless you were under the height of 4'.but I digress. I will probably be buying my chairs from wayfair from now on.

I'm a writer.... which means I do spend long periods of time seated in front of a screen. My last chair has been falling apart. That's beside the fact that it was generally uncomfortable and awkward to sit in. I've had my eyes on this chair for weeks. I've added and removed and re-added it to my shopping cart, lol. Read reviews, watched videos, checked out the Q&A section, etc. Finally, I decided to bite the bullet....so far, I'm pleased!Is the chair the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in? No. It's not even the most comfortable office\/gaming chair I've sat in. BUT, for the price, I think it's a good deal. It's comfortable enough that I can see myself sitting in it for hours with no issues. It feels sturdy and the overall quality seems great for the price (though, obviously, time will tell).It was pretty easy to put together. I put it together in under an hour. I should mention that I'm not at all good with building furniture. Yes, even office chairs, lol. It's just not my thing. I've been known to give up after a frustrated rant riddled with one too many profanities. But building this chair was a pretty easy task. I still struggled with piecing together the back and seat portions of the chair (difficult when doing solo), but it was only for a couple minutes. I will say I don't have the foot rest attached, because I couldn't get mine to do so correctly, lol. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, though, as I was pretty indifferent about that feature.Overall, I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars. I took off a star for the footrest mishap. Everything is pretty good. I even like the shade of pink, which I was also worried about when ordering online.

I'm contacting the seller so I'll update if they fix this issue to let you know how customer service handles this. The footrest wobbles when pulling it out and does not slide easily, but it works fine and is comfortable to use once pulled out. I rarely use footrests anyway, but it's a nice addition for the price.

In my mind this was something my old one didn\u2019t have and I saw it as a small upgrade. When the chair got here I put it together and instantly realized I had gotten a cheap chair. The foot rest barely comes past my knees and feels so flimsy I will never use it in fear of it breaking off.

FOR $200 WITH SHIPPING YOU CAN GET SOMETHING BETTER!edit: contacted customer support and they replaced the massager pillow for me! now my main gripe is the wheels. they do NOT wheel around well at all. i went ahead and got replacement wheels from amazon, replaced them, and the chair rolls around infinitely better.for the price, i really love the chair and what it\u2019s done for me already. i love everything about it. the footrest, the armrests, the pillows for extra back support, and the massager. the recline and lift are great. most of all, I LOVE THE COLOR!assembly was easy and the instruction manual it came with was good. came with everything you need to assemble and it didn\u2019t take me long, less than an hour.my ONLY 2 complaints about this product are:the armrests are not even. 1 is lower than the other by maybe a centimeter, not extremely noticeable but you do notice it if you\u2019re just sitting with your arms on the rests. i think this is because of where the holes in the back of the chair were drilled for them to screw into. i don\u2019t really mind this though because it was important to me to have armrests that connect to the chair itself and i don\u2019t notice the difference when i\u2019m gaming.2 is that the massager, which was by far my MOST FAVORITE part of the chair, has already gone dead apparently. it no longer works when plugged into my console or when plugged into a wall outlet. extremely disappointed about that since i also specifically got this chair for the massager option. hopefully will be able to get this replaced.not as big of a thing, but as shown in the pic, the pulley for the zipper was also missing for the pillow that came with the massager.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"49 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1654473600000}

The back will barely stay upright, I had to seriously manhandle the tensioner to be able to sit something resembling upright.The faux leather is peeled off the armrests and the seat is peeling. Foam in the seat is completely worn out (and I'm under-average weight and size). Back cushion is at 50%. These deflated long ago.The massager is an obvious joke. It just vibrates.When you prop your feet up, the chair rotates.I greatly regret buying this and not saving up for a better chair.I can only imagine many of these reviews are illegitimate in some way, this chair is absolutely awful even after just a month of owning it. Unless you just need a chair for 3 months, stay away. It's cheap, really cheap. Just don't do this to yourself, I have to haul this to the dump now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1682467200000}
{"reviewTitle":"ARMS KEEP COMING LOOSE","reviewDescription":"The arms on this chair keep coming loose , i am constantly tightening them and within a couple days they are starting to loosen up again.  I personally do not find the chair comfortable , there is a gap between the seat and the back that i need to fill with a pillow to be able to use the chair for any length of time.

{"reviewTitle":"The arms keep loosening","reviewDescription":"This chair would be great but the arms keep loosening. The chair was assembled on Dec. 25 and we have had to tighten the arms SIX times since then (it\u2019s Jan 12). This seems to be a design flaw or maybe we received a faulty product. This was a gift for my son so imagine how disappointed he is with his faulty Christmas present.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1705104000000}

This chair gets a lot of use as he\u2019s a gamer and spends a lot of time on line for school. He loves the comfort of the chair, but was disappointed to see the artificial leather start peeling.

{"reviewTitle":"A lot smaller than expected :(","reviewDescription":"The seat is rather small for a gaming chair for a normal sized adult. The lumbar support moves around a lot when in use and no matter the position, always feels like it's pushing you too far forward in the chair. At least it was mostly easy to assemble but the end didn't exactly justify the means. I would try to return but these things are so big it's hard to disassemble and put back in the box and then deal with further shipping issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701388800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent","reviewDescription":"Very happy with this purchase. First off it is actually comfortable. I'm 5'8\" and 235 lbs and it fits almost perfectly. If the armrests were just maybe an inch further apart in width would be perfect but that really is nitpicking. Headrest is nice and soft, can be moved up and down or taken off completely. Really like the fact that the lumbar support is also removable. I don't use it often but is nice to have the option. Gas lift works perfect. Reclining is easy and can be locked into place which is great. Footrest slides in and out easily and when using is very nice. As far as assembling goes it took me about 45 minutes and was very easy. Instructions were very well done and easy to follow and all the hardware was included with extra parts just in case. If you are looking for a very nice chair for gaming, office, or just a great option that's comfortable and doesn't take up much space and is super easy to move around I would highly recommend this. Lastly, IMO can't be beat for the price. Would definitely buy again.
