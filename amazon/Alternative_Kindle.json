{"reviewTitle":"Big Step Up From My Last Kindle_NOT","reviewDescription":"Update 2 (May 8, 2024).With my old Kindle I could remove contents from my device without permanently deleting the items from my account.  With this new Kindle I don\u2019t have that option.  I also downloaded a magazine just out of curiosity to see how it would appear on Kindle and now I can\u2019t delete it and it appears new issues are automatically added to your homepage for you to download and be stuck with them.  I have to say, my initial enthusiasm for this new Kindle and the one feature, beside the obvious, reading, of it that I do like (the touch screen) has seriously dwindled.  I love reading on this Kindle, but I hate how completely user unfriendly it is in not allowing you to declutter your homepage without permanently deleting contents you want to keep and forcing your to keep content that you want to delete permanently and even adding the latest issue of that content to your homepage, where it stays permanently if your download it.  Another star lost.Update 2024\/02\/20I had to return and request a replacement because the entire week after delivery, I had to recharge it every night; and the night before I requested a replacement, the battery completely drained while it was in sleep mode.  The replacement\u2019s battery life is no more than 48 before I get a low battery warning.  This is a far cry from the supposed six week battery life described on the product page.  I know the battery life is dependent on frequency of use, but with my old Kindle, which is well over 10 years old, when I went on a reading binge, reading almost to 24\/7, I could go 2 weeks before the battery went down to 50%.  Everything I said in my original review still holds, but I think the front light really drains the battery life.  I could do without the front light, if it means a longer battery life and just get a reading lamp to clip to the case cover or my headboard when reading in low lighting\/at night in bed.  My original rating was 5 stars, but I had to take away 2 stars for the battery like.  Other than the battery life, I really like this Kindle and won\u2019t be returning it because it\u2019s preferable to my phone or tablet.My last Kindle was purchased over 10 years ago and during that time it developed a glitch that made it not usable, so I decided to download the app instead of buying a new one since I was just reading when the latest installment of favorite authors\/series came out. But I started reading more about three months ago when I decided to deactivate my social media accts. and decided to decrease my screen time with other apps.  Reading on my iPad was fine but was becoming cumbersome, so I decided to purchase a new Kindle.  I have to say there have been vast improvements in the over ten years since my last Kindle purchase and I have to say I love them all, especially the touch screen and front light.  Set-up was quite easy using the Kindle app and took less than 5 minutes.  This Kindle functions pretty much the way the app does.  The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is way it briefly goes from light to dark or vice versa, if you\u2019re in dark mode, when you turn the page.  I also wish it had the \u201cpage turn animation\u201d feature like the app.  I got it today and have been reading all evening on and off and I have to say I\u2019m pretty happy with it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707177600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Loved this Kindle but it \"died\" within 4 months","reviewDescription":"I've had Kindles ever since the first one came out. I don't like reading books on my iPad. I read a lot and don't like accumulating hardback books. Kindles are perfect for me. I've upgraded my devices every few years. Although it's not considered an upgrade, this model was my favorite of all:  loved the size, the weight, the screen (very easy to read), the battery life. Loved everything about it. What's bad is that it \"died\" within 4 months of getting it.I never had a problem with all my other Kindles. I hope the problem is not a design flaw and that it will last as long as my others. If it doesn't \"die\" I strongly recommend this model.It was disappointing when it \"died\" and I have explained what happened at the end of this review. It's probably too much detail but it is what it is.I was in the middle of a book when it \"died\", so first, I ordered another one just like this one (reduced from $100 to $75) because I didn't want to wait the time it would take, once I found the right person to speak with at Amazon, for them to either fix this broken one or for them to send me a new one after mailing it back to them.I called Amazons Kindle help line to get an answer to this problem. They were great to work with and are crediting the purchase, and I am mailing the broken one back. I am satisfied with how the issue was resolved. The order I placed for a new one, and paid for, will be delivered tomorrow.Exactly what went wrong:The problem started when I couldn't find it - I left it (the new blue one) on the treadmill on the 2nd floor. Because I couldn't find it, I got an old black Kindle out, charged it, downloaded the book I was reading, and was finishing the book when my husband found the blue Kindle on the treadmill. I turned the blue one on - no problem - and began scrolling to the page where I left off on the old black one. Then everything on the screen went black. The green light was still on, but when I pressed the on-off button, the green light stayed on for only 2 seconds and the screen remained black. I plugged it in thinking it needed a charge. When plugged in, after about 10 minutes, the \"sleep\" screen came on. I unplugged it, pushed the on-off button, and the screen went black. I pressed the on-off button again and the green light was on for about 2 seconds. The screen remained black. I went through this process numerous times: sleep screen came on after about 5 or 10 minutes when it was left alone or plugged in, the green light remained on during this time, when I pressed the on-off button the screen turned black again. Every time I pressed the on-off button, the green light would go off in 2 seconds. I kept going through this process numerous times and the result was the same. That's when I ordered a new one and decided to figure out how and who to contact at Amazon the next day.Again, I never had a problem with all the other Kindles. This is my favorite for the reasons I have already mentioned. I hope the problem is not a design flaw and that it will last as long as my others. If it doesn't \"die\" again, I strongly recommend this model.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676419200000}

A little upset about trying to return it when I had a chance and not being able to, then the 30 days passing as I had just opened it and set it up shortly before the 30 days since I ordered it for the sale price, but wouldn't pay $50 for it even.  This is my personal preference and may not be an issue for others or those that read occasionally.  Also rarely if ever returned an item to amazon and bought the gen 2 kindle as I thought I'd use one over all the tech books and business books I would read, but had best buy GC's to use b4 expiring and ordered it, but sat in the box after setting it up, for years then finally getting time to use it 2 years ago had the screen go partially out on it and couldn't see the bottom half to get some books and media off it or connect to the new wifi from prior ISP's settings on it, even with physical keyboard and shipped it back for a discount, which seems to have disappeared on the 15 bucks off book purchases that I had seen when looking to order a book, but saw it was preorder or something not on kindle yet, then when looking at other books to use it on, the discount wasn't ava.  might be a fine print thing or issue with the return getting to them, not sure as tracking didn't work and the model wouldn't come up as something I had even though it was registered to my account, real big pain in the ... and time to try and figure it out that the risk to my BP if it resolves nothing isn't worth it and it'll just sit around useless now, but wish some returns were easier then having to print labels when i thought trees needed saving, recall paper or plastic?  yet everywhere went petro chemicals or the old PITA spokes persons who drove luxury cars?  Before bespoke was a buzzword, last I checked the only non leather luxury car was a terrible C class mercedes that was their cheapest model\/package the rest come with friggin leather seats (cows) let along private jets for the signer that comes to mind.  Your call on if the size and design fits your suitability, but know it is also harder to highlight and such on, since you lose screen real-estate for the keyboard, buttons and other tools on the screen now as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693094400000}
{"reviewTitle":"POS","reviewDescription":"This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased on Amazon (I buy a LOT - the Amazon kids tablet was even worse, though). My grandson likes playing on my phone, so I bought this to read on while he's on the phone. First, to \"sync\" to my phone and do a quick setup, I had to upgrade the Kindle app on my phone. Which then got rid of my ability to purchase books on my phone due to \"play store rules\". Horribly inconvenient and on top of it, the sync never worked (after trying for over 30 minutes). I finally just did the setup myself.Now I can buy books on this device, so if I'm reading on my phone, I have to open this device, hope it syncs to the last page, do the buy on the kindle. BUT then if I want to continue reading on the kindle, I have to X out of that screen, go back to the last book, reopen the store, and hope it lets me read the book. It has never once just let me click the read now button and go forward.I will say most of the time opening a book on one device and then the other, it syncs to the latest page read, which is fantastic!! Sometimes it doesn't and it's a massive pain to find the right page. And the kindle will give you the option to jump forward, but then the same screen stays up and gives you the option to jump back where you were. Took me a minute to realize what was happening, but now I know!Clicking pages forward or backwards is hit or miss - sometimes it goes forward when I tap on the right, sometimes back, sometimes it skips 3 or 4 pages. Sometimes it works ok, but OMG is it a frustrating device. I was reading on a Nook in 2010 that worked better than this!!  The technology has been there for over a decade, why is this so crappy? And the nook was cheaper than this thing is!! I switched to kindle for the free book subscription.I paid the extra for the no ads, which supposedly puts the cover of the book you're reading on the lock screen. Nope, it just puts random designs, but they stay there between books and just randomly change. They are never the cover of the book I'm reading, which is absolutely fine, but don't lie about what we're buying.This is extremely light weight, almost disconcertingly so, which is a plus. I had to stop reading paper due to the pain in my hands. It doesn't fit much on a page for my aging eyes (I'm only in my 40s but losing my near sightedness). I was expecting more to a page than on my phone, but it's really about the same size just wider and shorter. Battery life is ok - I've had about 3 weeks and already had to charge it once and it's at 30% again. I read for max 2 hours a day on this device and the rest of the time on the phone.So, overall, it does what I bought it for, badly, but it does it. I do NOT recommend this product, especially for the price. I'm a little shocked at how poorly Amazon produced this product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1677801600000}
{"reviewTitle":"A buggy and poor user interface.","reviewDescription":"The most comfortable way to hold this thing is have the the larger bezel on the right, so you can hold it and turn the page with your thumb, but somehow the designers of this device didn't test for that. You can turn the text so it is sideways, but the orientation is upside down, such that the large bezel on the left side, meaning if you want to advance the page, you have to reach all the way across the screen, or use your other hand. A software update could easily add or flip the orientation, but I'm not holding my breath.The touchscreen is just not good. There are a myriad of different touches that lead to highlighting, selecting, page turning, etc., and it's not explained well anywhere.Are a couple of page-turn buttons too much to ask for? Is that what we're supposed to pay an extra $100 for? Buttons? Modern technology is overrun with bad touchscreens and in many applications, like this one, buttons would do the job much better.You can't download the dictionary or translation features for offline usage.Besides the lack of buttons, the hardware isn't bad for the price. I just wish Amazon, with its infinite resources, put time and money into user testing and thoughtful software design. Especially because it basically has a monopoly on the market for eReaders.p.s. There's a bug in the translation feature, which comes from the fact that it detects language every time. It tries to translate English to English about 30% of the time, and another 20% it just says 'Unknown...try again.' There won't be that many languages going in one book, and it makes more sense to just let the user download a language and always translate that. Or, have it remember the previous language set.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700956800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Screen control sensitivity and wake-up are problematic.","reviewDescription":"Screen control sensitivity and wake-up are problematic: I use both a Kindle 11th. Gen (2022 release) purchased 2023 and Kindle Voyage purchased 2015.  I enjoy both and appreciate the lighter weight of the Kindle 11th. Gen. There are two serious issues though. First, on both models the screen swipe control and sensitivity seem wrong somehow. They are not always responsive. Both models have the very annoying characteristic of unexpectedly jumping numerous pages ahead. Then I must swipe back (this sometimes goes forward instead of backward) until I can find where I left off reading. A second very annoying issue on both models is the inability to wake the screen by touch or pressing a button. The only way is to fully close and reopen the cover (which is a little more involved with an Origami shell cover, which I highly recommend for holding the device for long periods of reading). The side controls (page-press sensors) on the Voyage no longer function. Regarding a third issue, on each I find the power cable port on the bottom to be an interference when holding the device or using a stand (I would prefer it on the top). In comparison, except for the lighter weight, I see no real differences in screen, function, or software (i.e., meaningful improvements) in 8 years. Better touch controls and a wake button (or screen spot) would be a wonderful set of improvements to the Kindle 11th.

The design is comfortable and sleek.The problem arises when I find out I've been cheated out of $30 because the case that Amazon selects in the \"accessory\" tab isn't compatible with the device I bought. I bought an 11th gen kindle, and despite being on the page for said 11th gen kindle, the case that they list for it is for a 10th gen kindle. This means that the case does not provide a snug fit for the device, rather it's something of a large bulky shell that the kindle rattles around inside.It's actually a detriment to have the case on the device for any purpose other than security, as the kindle is far more likely to fall out. Somehow, it doesn't slide out of either crevice positioned at the top and bottom of the case, so lucky me.I don't think I can get a refund on the case without refunding the entire order (which includes the kindle), so they got me.

{"reviewTitle":"Nice hardware, bad software.","reviewDescription":"Screen feels a little too small, if it were about 20% bigger it would really be ideal, but at least the e-Ink technology is pretty cool. It feels like I'm looking at a picture in a frame rather than a powered screen, at least when the brightness is turned down. One issue is that with some documents (most PDFs) the text is a bit too small to be comfortable and if I try to zoom in the tiny bit that I need, it instead zooms in a lot in one operation so that the text is clipped off on each side, rather inconvenient.Rather inconvenient describes the whole OS experience pretty well. You need special apps or e-mail operations to load most content even when it's a type that is supported, and this process can create duplicates in your library that are rather laborious to remove. On the Kindle you have to tap to open the option for each document and choose to delete and confirm, there's no batch operation and each operation is fairly laggy. The external apps let you handle multiple documents at once, but these changes will not be reflected on the device. I added a bundle of novels I bought from another site to my device and the first time about 20% of them were duplicated in my library, the second time (after resetting my device and letting my content add itself again on its own) about 95% of the novels now have duplicate entries, so if I want my library to be tidy I need to manually tap through and remove 30 different novels.Also while it is listed as supporting jpeg and gif, going through a gallery of jpegs is very inconvenient (you have to tap to open each one, then tap twice to close out and pick the next one), and gifs only function as a single non animate image.Further, there does not appear to be any OS alternatives for this device at this time. It seems people have been sufficiently discouraged or blocked from providing any alternative operations or applications for this device, as none of these processes support firmware that is as new as my Kindle shipped with. It's unfortunate since there's a lot more one could do with this device, but as far as I can tell with this model you're really locked in with what you get, and what you get is not great.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696032000000}

And I love a recessed screen on an ereader\u2026 it seems like it\u2019s even more glare-free than the waterproof version.BUT the cons far outweighed the pros for me. This Kindle is so lightweight that it feels like it might fly out of your hand at the least movement. The back isn\u2019t grippy at all, making the problem worse. I realize now that an ereader needs to have just a *little* bit of heft to it so that it stays put in your hand.And the newly reduced bezels are now so tiny that my thumbs could never really find a comfortable spot to rest, meaning I was constantly fidgeting. I couldn\u2019t settle into reading (as I do on my older Paperwhite) because I simply couldn\u2019t get comfortable.My solution\u2026 return this Kindle, and go for an older refurbished Paperwhite.

The picture takes up space and there are only four books shown on the screen.  I called Amazon and there is no way to turn this off. The list view is now one long page instead of being multiple pages as it was before.  There's a scroll bar now to move through the list, but it doesn't really work.  The response of e-ink is slow so you can't see where you are while you're scrolling.  There's no option to go ahead one screen.  So finding a specific place or scrolling through the list without missing anything is next to impossible.  There is a search bar, but it's less convenient than old way., This interface reminds me of the first Kindles which also made having many books difficult.

A small bevel is not ideal for comfort.The swipe vs button for page changing means if you are holding it with your left hand, you have to move your right hand from resting to turn the page. It's just one of those things that a physical button makes for a more enjoyable experience.The touch only can also be a pain when wanting to use the dictionary.

I wish it were just a little more sensitive to touch. I have also noticed that sometimes if I tap the screen to turn the page, it will turn two or three pages ahead and that has happened quite a few times. I then need to go back and find my spot in the book which is a bit irritating. In some ways, I wish I had bought the oasis so that these problems could have been avoided with the buttons that kindle has. Lastly I have noticed when reading that occasionally the whole screen will change from dark mode to day mode\/vice versa quickly when I turn the page. That\u2019s a little irritating at night when I have it on dark mode and it will flash bright for a second when I don\u2019t expect it. Over all though I do like this kindle.

They made the body with a finish that is very slippery, so you are either forced to buy their case, suffer, or improvise like I did by applying several talon grip strips to the back and sides.

I had a Nook before but I believe the kindle to be superior (your page number is remembered even if you forget to put a bookmark)!My biggest complaint is that the Kindle puts itself into sleep mode sometimes before I'm even finished with the page.

I turned down the brightness and even put it into airplane mode and still I\u2019m charging it after every time I read (gets down into the low 40%s, which isn\u2019t enough for the next time I go to read since it loses power even when off). I turned the device off while in airplane mode and left it overnight and all day. This evening I turned it on and it went from 94% last night to 87% when I turned it on. I don\u2019t get that because the device was off, not asleep. Anyways, I\u2019m keeping it because of the new features, but the battery definitely does not stand even close to my first kindle.

Both of those devices are heavy and hard to read from for long periods of time, and the screens tended to give me a headache after awhile, while paper text never did. I was pursuing a device that I could still read library ebooks with less headaches (literally) and sore arms and I\u2019m happy to report Kindle serves this purpose well.The size is excellent. It\u2019s a fair bit lighter than my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and sits a couple millimeters squatter but an inch and a half wider than it. This aspect ratio is pretty ideal for text, and you can switch to landscape orientation to make it even wider. I put a photo of it next to my iPad Air 5(? i think) for a size comparison there too. I found it to be a much more manageable size and weight for longer reading than both my iPhone and iPad, for which I\u2019m pleased.I don\u2019t own any ebooks at the time i\u2019m writing this (but I might change that with the positive impressions I have of this device), so I was worried checking out Libby books would be difficult to use Kindle for, but once I linked my Amazon account, I was easily able to check books out and read them thru kindle seamlessly. Just note that if you try this, you won\u2019t be able to read the book in Libby anymore on your smart devices; you\u2019ll need to download the Kindle app to access them from anything other than your Kindle.I do think the Kindle is mostly worth the price you pay for it. I\u2019m aware some of the Fire and other android tablets cost a fair bit less, but the e-ink screen on this thing is far higher resolution than my old Fire 7 tablet and the Kindle software is far less distracting for a more immersive reading experience. I do wish the screen was a bit more fluid and responsive, but that\u2019s the tradeoff of an e-ink display rather than an actual defect with the device. I was actually quite impressed with the resolution, as pixelated text can annoy me quite a bit. None of that here!

{"reviewTitle":"Small and lightweight","reviewDescription":"I\u2019m happy with this new Kindle.  It has the adjustable front light which works well for my night reading, and has just as much space as my more expensive Paperwhites. I don\u2019t really miss the warm light setting and to be honest I wouldn\u2019t have purchased my 2nd Paperwhite if this had been available. I love my other Kindles but wanted something smaller and lighter for night reading and this has worked very well for that. I don\u2019t need to worry about a cover since it\u2019s always in the same safe place.It has the same annoyances as my other kindles, too bright a flash on the page turns when on night reading, battery not lasting nearly as long as claimed (I keep them on airplane mode to save battery), intermittent freezing of the screen where you have to flip up from the bottom and forward the page using the smaller screen in the middle. This seems to free it up most of the time but sometimes I have to restart. Also, even after all this time to adjust, I still don\u2019t like the new format after that big update and miss the simplicity of the old one. The Home section is useless to me and is cluttered and messy. The only thing I like is the ability to keep series together but even that doesn\u2019t always work.I\u2019ve posted a picture comparing my Kindle Paperwhite Signature 6.8\u201d, Paperwhite 6.8\u201d, and this new regular 6\u201d with front light, all 11th gen. All are on the same settings for font, size and brightness.

It does not offer scrolling when you're reading, which is a better way to read on an electronic reading device. You can only \"turn\" the page. And it's hard to get a foreign dictionary to work well on it. I'm trying to read books in German to help with learning that language, and have installed a German-to-English dictionary. However, when I double-click on a word, instead of popping up a simple pane that provides the German word with its meaning or meanings in English, the Kindle offers three panes. One of the panes might occasionally offer what I need, but I must read through them. And the last pane, which is the hardest to access but is supposed to offer what I need, does not draw from the downloaded dictionary. It offers a translation from any language that has the word I clicked on in its lexicon. A surprising number of times, it's the wrong word in the wrong language. This is really a frustrating and counterproductive trait in the product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1707436800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great for Bible reading but only after some work and tweaks","reviewDescription":"I got one for my grandma. Her eyesight isn't great but the font can be increased greatly. She reads it several times a day, much more than with the physical Bible which was extra large and heavy due to the larger print. Now she can read it in any position because of how lightweight and easy is to hold.Unfortunately Amazon doesn't sell a Kindle edition of the Russian Bible (Synodal translation) or a Russian New King James Version for that matter. I found a free Russian Synodal Bible online in epub format. After much trial and error I think I finally have a working solution. The best file format to convert it to is .kfx. I used Calibre x64 on Windows with Calibre plugins \"EpubSplit\" and \"kfx output\".According to other users and my own experience, Kindle readers have trouble with extremely large books (thousands of pages long), particularly the Bible. The Kindle would completely crash and reboot when opening the ebook or turning the page. I tried converting it to different formats that Kindle can read but it didn't help much. I ended up splitting the Bible into two books: Old Testament and New Testament. The New Testament is significantly shorter than the Old Testament but so far this split was sufficient to stop the Bible from crashing the Kindle. If the problem reappears I might further split the Bible into each respective book.This solution is good to keep in mind if you plan to read long books. The software and plugins I used were completely free.I recommend buying a Kindle case with a tight hand strap on the backside. It's allows you to securely and comfortably hold the Kindle with one hand. My grandma was delighted with her case.The backlight on the Kindle is difficult and inconvenient to operate, especially for older people. It requires too many swipes\/touches to perform. I recently bought a Meebook M7 Android e-ink ereader and it rocks. It has physical page turn buttons each of which can be reprogrammed with 3 functions (press, double press and long-press). My backlight is toggled by long-pressing.Amazon should bring back physical buttons and more customization options. There's more competition in the e-reader market.

{"reviewTitle":"Annoying","reviewDescription":"This is my 3rd Kindle. For the first time I am disappointed. I don't know if it's the material or that's it's so lightweight, but I can't move it around in one hand without it slipping around. A LOT.  It feels really fragile, probably a trade-off to being so lightweight. I'd rather have a bit more weight than these issues, which I didn't have with the previous versions that I didn't think were too heavy. My previous Kindle bought in 2016 had the power button on the back, top right corner. I could turn it on easily with one hand. This bottom button requires me to use two hands or brace it against my body. I don't like the thin sides. They are narrower than my thumbs, and I have small hands, so I can't comfortably grip it on the side. I also don't like the recessed screen. I miss my page turn buttons on the side, which allowed me to turn the page without moving my hand, and go to the previous page without setting it down or having to use two hands. I also don't like having to tap twice to get to the brightness screen, and then not be able to see the print when I'm changing it, to see how bright is necessary. The amount of brightness showing on a mostly blank settings page is different than with a full page of print. So I have to go back and forth to adjust it several times, holding it with two hands because if my thumb is off the side it will fall out of my hand. These things seem nitpicky, but when you're holding a baby, they matter! I don't want to be frustrated picking up my Kindle (slips out of my grip), holding it (side too small), turning it on (can't do one handed), and turning pages (no side buttons). Basically every aspect of this Kindle is annoying me. I'll use it, because it's amazingly convenient compared to an actual book, but as far as Kindles go, it's a huge disappointment. I'd give it a one star but I like the dark mode option, so I'll give it two.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675987200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Slow system","reviewDescription":"The biggest reason for finally buying an e-reader was so I could read outdoors. The kindle does that great.  It's overpriced. It's so slow when highlighting a passage or switching between books. I've got two larger books that I can't use with Kindle device. The screen goes white or restarts itself. So I still use Kindle app on my phone for those books.  I've read the suggestion of restarting the device from scratch. Erase everything and try again. The issues were there as soon as I first setup the kindle, so I don't want to waste time trying that. I never had to do that with my $60 cell phone or $90 fire tablet. But it's required on the first day of a $120 kindle? Very outdated technology as well. Any books with photos are black&white. Kindle books are not substantial savings over a hard copy and considering the bright color photos in hard copies, kindle books have less value.  The entry model kindle is great for having multiple books in less space than hard copies take up. And entry model kindle is great for carrying books around through the day.  Overall, I feel stupid that I paid $120 for a device with $35 worth of technology.  If reading outdoors is not a big deal to someone, I would suggest a tablet with Kindle app for a lot less money, a lot faster system, and better graphics for books that have them.Update:  I finally hard reset my device. I waited a couple of months. Hoping an update would come along and make it more reader friendly. Waste of time. I loaded each book one at a time. I waited until the \"busy\" icon in corner was gone until I started to download the next book into my library.  It made no difference. The same books, purchased through Amazon, that would freeze the device still do it. Or they cause device to restart itself.  Hard reset did nothing. Setting the device up from the very beginning a second time did nothing.  Still slow response when trying to highlight a passage. And still freezing with two books I cannot use with Kindle reader and only use on phone app.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1682985600000}

When I talked with them well all I can say is they were wonderful. They provided an exchange Kindle for me.In the process however of working through this with their representative. Andrew, who I thought was wonderful, I think we discovered that the problem is not in the Kindle but in the official Amazon case for it. The case is loaded with magnets. They apparently affect how the screen operates. I took the Kindle out of the case at Andrew's suggestion and the problem went away. I have now used the Kindle for several days with no problems whatsoever. I am switching to a different case, this one by Cobak, which at least initially doesn't seem to cause the problem. But I have only a few minutes experience with it so far. If I find anything out different I will add another edit.So, in summary, I think the Kindle itself is wonderful. I believe that the problem was caused by the case. I suppose that only time will tell. But my current recommendations is to avoid the official Amazon case for this Kindle.Original review:I have been using Kindles since the Kindle 2. And they were all wonderful. I wanted to come up to the latest, which I believe is Kendall 11. Of 2023. It's nice and some ways. It's a little bit lighter than the Kendall generation tens are. And it seems a lot faster.But it has a fatal flaw! Page turning is a disaster. If I tap to turn to the next page, it does so and after about a second or two it goes on to the next page after that. Sometimes two pages further. Nothing I do seems to help and the Kindle support people are essentially useless. Their suggestion was to restart it. And that does help for a variable number of page turns from one or two to 15 or 20. But it doesn't fix it. I am extremely disappointed.

I really thought I wanted the page turn and physical buttons cause I hate hate hate smudges on my screens when I\u2019m reading. Well let me say that it\u2019s a non issue with this kindle and this screen. I tried the paper white and not so much. Now the plastic on the Kindle basic is a fingerprint magnet but I can live with that. It is responsive, usb-c finally and has built in lights. Screen is much crisper than older kindles and reading at night with dark mode is awesome\u2026I personally don\u2019t miss warmth adjuster on the more expensive kindles at all but mileage may vary based on preferences. If reading is the most important thing you do this is the best option. It\u2019s light, fits in pocket, battery is great, and no smudges on the screen. And if your trading in an old kindle you can get 20% off and a gift card as well. So this drops down to $80 depending on price point. So yea don\u2019t spend more money on kindles that are not as good. Unless you like dropping your electronics in water or spilling items on your kindles\u2026then get paper white but that would be the only reason I would ever make that choice\u2026this is the perfect kindle at a perfect price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"77 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708560000000}

But I have to say, the new Kindle Paperwhite has completly won me over.The screen is a real standout feature. It\u2019s bigger than the older models, which means less page-turning and more continous reading. Plus, the backlight has this warm tone that\u2019s really easy on the eyes\u2014I\u2019ve spent countless nights reading without any strain.It\u2019s also super thin and light, which means I can throw it in my bag and not even notice it\u2019s there. And since it\u2019s waterproof, I don\u2019t have to panic if I\u2019m caught in the rain or if I want to read by the pool.But the battery life is what really blows me away. I charge it once, and it lasts for weeks. It\u2019s perfect for someone like me who\u2019s always forgeting to plug things in.And the books\u2014oh, the books! There are so many to choose from, and it\u2019s so easy to download them. I\u2019ve been branching out into genres I never would have considered before, all because they\u2019re right there at my fingertips.I have to admit, I\u2019m pretty hooked on my Kindle Paperwhite. It\u2019s just so convenient and user-friendly. I can change the font size, look up words as I read, and carry a whole library around with me. It\u2019s not just a gadget; it\u2019s a treasure trove of stories waiting to be discovered.Looking back, I can\u2019t believe I waited so long to get one.

{"reviewTitle":"A device with a single purpose: reading","reviewDescription":"Everyone has a smartphone these days, so at this point the Kindle is for one very particular audience: people who want to read a lot of books, and read them with a minimum of distractions.  With this version, Amazon has refined the Kindle to the point where it's just about ideal for this purpose.  I've owned several previous Kindles, including an early Paperwhite, and currently own a couple of iPads, an iPhone, and a MacBook.  For the purposes of long, immersive reading sessions, this Kindle is my best option.  The battery life is long enough so that even with constant reading you only have to recharge once or twice a week (you can extend that by turning off wireless).  The Kindle also has by far the best screen for immersive reading: it's sharp and clear, with many options for different lighting conditions ranging from bright sunlight (Kindles leave tablets in the dust as far as bright-sun reading is concerned) to pitch black (the dark mode format is ideal for this).  You can choose whether to read with a vertical orientation or a horizontal one -- and this option of a horizontal orientation allows you (among other things) to read poetry on a Kindle without imposing premature line breaks.  This Kindle is also extremely light and easy to hold for hours on end (my iPad mini is too heavy for that).  And as with all Kindles, you can adjust the type size and font so that reading is comfortable for you - I love paper books, I really do, but I need bigger type.In a way, though, what's best about this Kindle is what it doesn't have.  You can't read your email.  You can't go on social media.  Amazon's Kindle browser is perpetually \"experimental\" -- good!  I pick up the Kindle when I want to read books, not when I want to lose my afternoon down an internet rabbit hole.  That said, you do get just enough of the internet to assist in your reading.  From within any book you can look up unfamiliar names\/places on Wikipedia, and there's a great built-in dictionary too.  (You can download dictionaries for any language you read, and set them as your default in settings).  But apart from those features, the internet might as well be on Mars.  Fine by me. If I want to look at videos of puppies or lose my temper about politics,  I have my phone (and several other machines, unfortunately).  When I look at my Kindle, I can feel my blood pressure go down.  More to the point, I can hide my phone under a cat and read books for hours and hours.That might not be your idea of an ideal afternoon.  If it is, and you know who you are, this Kindle is pretty inexpensive and much lighter and easier to carry than tablets or physical books.  It allows you to carry thousands of books around with you and then sit and read them without distractions.  It's limited in its other functions - and that's exactly what makes it ideal.As you can probably tell from the above review, I have the patience of a gnat when it comes to content I don't want to see, and for that reason I opted for the ad-free version.  This allows me to have the lock screen be the cover of the current book I'm reading, which is extremely endearing.  That said, the version with ads does not insert ads into your books; they're not obtrusive in that way.  So you can definitely save a few bucks by getting the version with ads - it won't mess with your reading experience.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"1,091 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672012800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Maybe my favorite Kindle yet! (And I\u2019ve owned a bunch)","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve been buying Kindles ever since the second model came out way back in 2009 or so. The Kindle is a marvelous invention that got me reading again and reading 3-4 times as much as I ever did with paper books. I have no romantic notions about paper and glue anymore.I\u2019d go as far as saying the Kindle is arguably the most underrated invention of the early 21st century. But you\u2019re here for the review, so\u2026As for why I like THIS Kindle so much, well, I love the fact that all of the most important features have finally trickled down to the base model. I can afford to buy any Kindle I want and I usually buy one of the middle or high-end Kindles. This one was actually replacing an older Paperwhite, but I wanted to give the base model a try since it checked all the right boxes, aside from color temperature adjustment.The fact that all the best features are present on the base model now makes me feel better about Kindles and Amazon in general honestly. My first Kindle was $399, so I love the fact that this one is so affordable and within reach of a lot more people now.This Kindle also gets the fastest SoC (microprocessor) that the newest Kindles have. That means it\u2019s as fast, or faster than any of the Kindle models.It\u2019s finally got a generous amount of memory for anyone with anything but the biggest book collection. I\u2019ll never fill it up I\u2019m sure.It\u2019s even got the higher dpi (resolution) Paperwhite screen now, so you\u2019re no longer penalized with pixelated fonts or less contrast for buying the entry-level model and I LOVE that.One of my favorite features, though, is that it\u2019s super small and light, which I really love. It\u2019s the smallest, lightest, most pocketable Kindle there\u2019s ever been. That\u2019s a nice feature that makes you more likely to take it with you everywhere.The only things you\u2019re really giving up versus a Paperwhite that I know of are the extra LEDs (I don\u2019t miss them a bit, backlighting is more than enough) and the warmer color backlighting option (nice to have, but I can definitely live without it).This model also has a bit less battery life than the Paperwhite (maybe 15-20% less?) But it\u2019s still a Kindle, which means it will last longer than any other device you own. I doubt the battery life will be a complaint from many.The final feature it\u2019s missing is actually a PLUS to me. It\u2019s the fact that the screen is recessed. I actually prefer that (I can\u2019t be the only one). I like being able to tell by touch precisely where the screen begins. It makes it easier to avoid touching the screen accidentally and I just think it looks better to be honest.The only feature I WISH it had is PAGE TURN BUTTONS. I have no idea WHY Amazon has limited them to only the Oasis models. Other eInk book manufacturers like Kobo managed to find a way to include page turn buttons on nearly every model. Come on, Amazon.I had been planning on buying an Oasis for several years, specifically to get the page turn buttons. But I simply got tired of WAITING for Amazon to make an Oasis with USB-C charging already and update the hardware to match the newer models.I finally gave up on waiting for a USB-C Oasis after I read rave reviews of the new base model and Prime Day rolled around with a price drop on it.I\u2019m super satisfied with it though. Lack of buttons aside, I think it\u2019s my favorite Kindle yet due to the exceptional value, ultra-pocketable size and feature set.This model has everything I think most people really need and want in a Kindle at a very fair price (especially when you buy it during Prime Days like I did!).I also really appreciate the opportunity to buy a Kindle in a color other than black or white for a change. The Denim Blue is cool and different and that\u2019s a feature you cannot get in ANY other Kindle model. Amazon should consider making a few more color choices here and there. I guarantee it would juice up sales.If they just added some sturdy page turn buttons to this, a physical switch to disable the touch screen, the \u201cwarm\u201d backlighting option and gave it a bigger battery that\u2019s designed to be easily replaced, it would be the PERFECT Kindle for me.That and I wish Amazon would give us greater control over our Home Screen. I just want a simple list of folders or my collections. I don\u2019t want to see \u201csuggestions\u201d or any eye candy marketing fluff. Minor complaint though.All-in-all I think when you take price into consideration, this is the BEST KINDLE Amazon has ever made, hands down.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"462 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691193600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Basic but oh so versatile","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve had my Kindle for over a year now. It took me years to make the decision to buy a Kindle because I was worried I\u2019d hate it since I thought I would miss having a physical book in my hand, but I was SO wrong. I loved it immediately.No more were there lighting issues (shadows or not enough light from a lamp) while reading in bed or outside in the sun. No pages to have to hold back on either side of the current page you\u2019re reading and having to balance in your hand.I was running out of space for my physical books. Now I have all my books with me in a small device which fits so easily in my purse or my pocket. I bought a cover to keep my Kindle from being damaged. I find that  eBay has the best deals on Kindle covers.I love all the features the Basic Kindle provides: search, font size, brightness of screen, long battery life, time on current page, toggle between page number, minutes left in chapter, hours left in book, sort by most recent book downloaded, title, author, publication date, ascending, descending for all books or collections (that you even have the ability to create your own collections), view by grid or list. Highlight favorite passages. Take notes. Plus so much more.Google and YouTube are your friends. Search for Kindle tips and tricks to learn all the things you can do on your Kindle Basic.I love Kindle Unlimited (KU). You get a lot of bang for your buck. It\u2019s worth the money to get three months free for signing up for KU to make sure you like the subscription before committing to a subscription. I think you can get a monthly or yearly plan.I find the process of checking out a book directly from the Kindle to be a bit slow.

{"reviewTitle":"So much better than print","reviewDescription":"If you\u2019re considering this, and reading this review, you\u2019re probably considering your first foray into Kindle reading. Good choice. A few things to note about this.The ads are not pop ups. I know some dead tree fans would have you believe, right in the middle of a tense scene, an ad will interrupt the page. That\u2019s not how this works. What happens is, when you put the device in sleep mode, rather than say the cover or the portrait of a famous author, you see an ad. If you use the physical cover to turn on and off the device, you won\u2019t see much if any of the ads.  And yes, you can dog ear a page.I have no idea why memes keep popping up to say you can\u2019t. Actually, the things you can do with a print book that you can\u2019t with a Kindle book are: Donate them to the library if the library starts taking books again, give used copies to a friend, sell used copies, have a bookmark accidentally fall out, and use them for, well, kindling. Kindle can do everything else. Things you can do on a Kindle and not a print book are: read in the dark, search for text, carry dozens of books in your pocket, create notes of virtually unlimited size (you run out of room in the margin of a print book), pick up a new book nearly anywhere, anytime, and instantly convert your entire library to large print.Most library systems can send any borrowed e-book directly to your Kindle. And your place and notes are stored in case you borrow the book again or buy a copy. You don\u2019t get that with print.Amazon recently improved their send to Kindle features with a drag and drop web page that makes moving your own documents to the device extremely simple.This comes with a USB-C cable, but not a charger (aka wall wort) so if you don\u2019t have one lying around (I think the expectation is most of us do) you will need to pick one up.16 gig might not sound like a lot, but most books fall under 2K.  I\u2019ve seen public libraries (I\u2019m looking at you, Florida) with fewer books than this can hold. Audible eats the memory a bit more, but I find this to be more than enough.You don\u2019t get cellular connectivity with this, but that\u2019s only with the premium Oasis line now. Scribe even missed out on that. I find it convenient, but I understand wifi is ubiquitous enough these days it\u2019s not a big deal for most users. I have an annoying habit of finishing a book on the crosstown bus, then needing the next in the series. Yes, the cell phone tether works. No, that\u2019s not as convenient as built-in cellular.It has fewer LEDs than most, but that\u2019s not a big deal. Four lets you read in the dark. The scribe has 35. Guys, it\u2019s an e-reader, not a disco, no one needs that many separate lights on that small a device. The absence of a warm light and auto adjusting lights are a bigger issue here. The warm light makes a big difference when you\u2019re reading before bed.It doesn\u2019t have the waterproofing, which I thought was a bigger deal when that first came out, but in all the time since I\u2019ve yet to (knock wood) get a Kindle wet. It\u2019s a nice to have, not a have to have.The size can throw people at first. The screen approximates two things \u2013 an index card turned portrait and a mass market paperback page. The occasional \u201cghosting\u201d mirrors the see-through element of the cheaper mass market paperbacks, except on the device it refreshes quickly, and the ghosting goes away.There were some studies done that suggest memory is improved from reading from print rather than e-book. I want to point out a few issues and cite my own experience. First, all the studies I could find cite pop ups and other distractions as the primary issue. That is, the test is on a general-purpose tablet, not a single purpose e-reader. When they either do a study on an actual e-reader or compare with pop ups on the tablet vs someone coming over just as often and tossing brochures on their print book I\u2019ll believe it. Unless all factors are equal, the study is inherently flawed. To my experience, my ability to absorb and either use the information (if it\u2019s non-fiction) or retain it over time (if it\u2019s fiction) is nearly identical in both, with the slight advantage of the e-book being able to search back in the text for prior information. It drives me nuts when a quote resurfaces in a print book, and I can\u2019t find the prior mention again. Or when I need to find a code snippet in a shelf full of computer books rather than just search on device and have it in seconds.So, if you\u2019re comfortable with the mass market paperback format, the size, the quality, then this is a huge step up. If you want to lay your hands on information quickly, then this is a huge step up.If you want portability, then this is a huge step up. I just had to help an elderly woman move into assisted living and the loss of space cost her nearly all of her much-loved library. I find it comforting that nearly all of mine fits in my purse. No more culling the library for space, then finding you need to buy a new copy. If you delete an e-book from your Kindle, you can download it again for free. I remember, in the dark days before the Kindle was invented, being stuck on a flight from Arizona to New York with nothing to read but the most misogynistic, worst written mystery novel I\u2019d ever encountered. If I had a Kindle, I\u2019d have had at least a dozen better choices at hand, not to mention rereads.The downside here is twofold. First, Dune and The Great Gatsby look the same size on the reader, so it\u2019s hard to eyeball that one is a super-fast read and the other a meaty novel. It\u2019s also a little too easy to build up a massive TBR pile, given it takes no physical space, the device memory is ample, and Amazon keeps offering free books to Prime members every month, sometimes more than one, and a crazy number of deeply discounted books Prime or not.If you are concerned about the environment, then this is a matter of economics of scale. On the last study I checked, the magic number was 20. At 20 books the manufacture and transport impact of the e-reader ties the impact of manufacturing and transporting print books. At 21 and beyond, the e-reader has almost no further impact as compared to the printing and transporting of physical books. E-readers have boasted substantial improvements in reducing their carbon footprint since that study, but I can find no more recent information. Even at 20, the worst number, it\u2019s clear that e-readers are a pure win for the environment.It\u2019s a great device. If you want to go with this one as the entry level, you won\u2019t be disappointed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2,379 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670371200000}
{"reviewTitle":"For the avid reader, there is no better option.","reviewDescription":"At 158 grams this small Kindle is perfect for the reader who will regularly spend 2-8 hours per day reading.I own a bunch of e-ink readers. I have spent thousands of dollars on the e-reader technology over the years. When comparing all my dedicated reading devices it is the little Kindle that I prefer and it comes down to the sheer weight of the device.I found that when I read with even the slightly heavier devices such as the PaperWhite my knuckles cramp and my wrist is strained. Again, I am an avid reader, which means there are somedays where I can read almost uninterrupted for eight-hours in one sitting and with the 158g little Kindle I experience no wrist or knuckle strain. The device is really comfortable to hold for extended periods of reading.My only complaint is with the housing plastic. I have owned my little Kindle for maybe a year at this point and I take good care of it yet the plastic itself is of a such low quality, it is very easy to scratch and over time there is no way to avoid staining the (blue) plastic. Again, two or three times a week I wipe down the device. When I replace the device I will purchase a vinyl skin to wrap the entire device. That is the only way I can figure to keep the wear and tear from showing up on the little Kindle.Other than that, it is dollar for dollar the best device I have in the home.**I do have some major complaints with the Kindle store though. Their pricing for academic journals and texts is exorbitant and it is outright insulting in many examples. The Kindle Store has some essays on the store that have long been out of copyright protection and yet Amazon is sometimes charging well over $75USD for the respective text and again, that is insulting when I see it. The Kindle Store pricing model on scholarly work is one reason why I stopped buying Kindles for almost a decade.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708560000000}

{"reviewTitle":"WITH PATIENCE, YOU CAN GET A GREAT PRICE! I prefer it over the newest, largest Paperwhite.","reviewDescription":"(Editing to reflect most recent purchase)I bought 2 more of these Kindles on Prime day, paying $65 each for them. I paid $80 for the first one of this model, which was also a sale price. (When I purchased the first one, I also purchased the newest version of the Paperwhite, which I find awkwardly designed to hold with one small hand. I named that one \"Skippy\" because of its tendency to jump more than one page at a time. It's a complaint found in many reviews of that model.)I have several older Kindles which have gotten a lot of use. Over time, it seems that they don't hold a charge as long as they did when they were new. I paid extra for the formerly-free 3G capability, which is no longer supported. (I think Amazon should give people credit if they paid the extra $20 or $30 for that feature.)This Kindle and the new Paperwhite use a USB-C charging cable, which I prefer because there's no \"upside down, try again\" issue. It sounds trivial, but it's a plus, imho. Now I won't have to use 2 different cables, depending on which Kindle I'm charging.I use several Kindles at a time: One in my purse (or 2 if I'm traveling where recharging is not an option). And 3 \"scattered\" around the house so that a Kindle is always within reach. I've also purchased others which I've given to my kids, loaded with books I think they would enjoy.I'm not sure what makes this model *not* a Paperwhite. It has the features I love\/need\/use the most (adjustable fonts, adjustable light, built-in dictionary, note-taking capability, etc.). The slight difference in weight is actually noticeable--and appreciated by my arthritic hands.I always purchase a magnetic cover that allows the device to wake up automatically when it is opened. (If you purchase on ebay, you'll find covers that are a lot cheaper than identical covers sold on Amazon.)My original review:It seems as if \"they\" constantly try to convince us that our devices (cell phones, tvs, computers, watches) are outdated technology. Too small, too large, too \"flippy\". This Kindle is probably as small as I'd want to go. If I wanted a smaller screen than this Kindle, I'd just use my phone.(The latest Paperwhite is noticeably larger than this device and previous Paperwhites. My preferred technique of holding it with one hand is more awkward with a larger device. It feels unbalanced, top-heavy. The cover is larger, too, of course, which adds more weight. I have arthritis in my hands, so it probably bothers me more than others. If I'm using a Kindle easel or holding it on my lap, it doesn't matter. But for one-handed Kindling, I like this little model. It's my new \"travel Kindle\".)I miss and resent the loss of free X-G for the Kindles. I paid extra for free 3G on my previous Kindles and it's useless now. It's not a huge hardship, but I have to remember to sync my devices before I leave the house. It can be a nuisance to find my place in my \"purse Kindle\" when I'm not home. (And Amazon loses out on those impulse purchases that I used to make when I finished a book and felt an urgent need to buy the sequel or something by the same author.)In conclusion, this is my new, preferred Kindle. My Kindle collection will now consiste of 3 of these, plus the larger Paperwhite I call \"Skippy\".","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"92 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684454400000}

So this product is exactly what I needed. One gripe is that one of my books (an e-textbook) isn't compatible. I wasn't expecting that. I can only read that book on my phone or computer on the kindle app. But that's not too surprising considering that this is the simplest kindle of the product line, and overall I just LOVE the kindle's simplicity.

{"reviewTitle":"Revised review - My opinion of it is vastly improved","reviewDescription":"Now that I've had it for more than a month, I've come to like it much more. Here's why:The set up with Amazon was flawless and very fast and easy. My whole library showed up with no problems. It is super lightweight and I was able to purchase a really nice cover at a much cheaper price (<$10) than the cover for my previous Oasis. I like the Dark Mode for night time reading better than the nighttime screen on my previous Oasis. I find I don't miss the page turner button at all now. And now that I've gotten used to turning pages, there is no problem with multiple pages or skipping ahead. There are plenty of fonts to choose from. Unlike the battery life in my old Oasis, which I had to charge almost daily, this one really last for a week or more on a single charge and I read a lot every day. (I do keep the airplane mode on and the wifi off to preserve battery life, except when I'm downloading a new book.) In fact, I'll never purchase another Oasis for nearly $300 when this basic Kindle for a little over $100 is just as good. So I'm bumping my rating from a 3 to a 5.I do still think Amazon should make the battery accessible for replacement; not doing so makes their climate pledge hypocritical, and the fact that the battery on previous models was replaceable, but is not now, and they pretty much keep this a secret is typically nefarious.______________________________________________________________________________________________My original review after receiving it in Sept 2023 was \"Pretty Good - meh\" Rating: 31. The battery life is certainly much improved over previous models\/generations. I read a lot and don't have to recharge for a week or two. With my previous Oasis 10th generation, had to charge daily.2. All features are adequate.3. When turning p ages, it sometimes turns more than one page; not always.4. Amazon's \"Climate Pledge Friendly Products with trusted sustainability certification\" is a joke. All the Kindles currently available have been designed so that the back cannot be removed to replace the battery when the time comes that it can no longer hold a charge.  Earlier versions had back designed to be removed and batteries were available from 3rd party vendors to extend the life of the device. But no more. Now that would have been climate friendly. But instead, Amazon has built in obsolescence by making battery replacement impossible. No, Amazon can't even replace them, nor can a repair shop. So since the max life expectancy of a battery is up to 3 years, I will be buying the cheapest kindle available; no more Oasis models for me. It seems awful greedy of Amazon to make this change wee we will all have to purchases a new Kindle every few years rather than just replace a battery.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"71 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695254400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great Purchase","reviewDescription":"I am a die hard paper back book fan, but I can only store so many books!! Traveling is difficult with physical books if you are close to ending one book & starting another! I was hesitant but I love this kindle! It did take a little bit for me to get used to it, but I really do love it! It is smaller than I originally thought but you can change font size to make sure reading is easy. I prefer the smallest size font so the physical book page is the same length as the kindle book page. Ex: on the kindle if the font is larger, you may click through 2-4 screens until you are officially off page 140 and moving onto 141. So I make my font size smaller, just personal preference! I immediately put a case on mine due to reviews saying it scratched easily. I bought one that had automatic \u201csleep mode\u201d when it closed & it works perfect (only $10-$15).

{"reviewTitle":"Prefer my Fire HD","reviewDescription":"NOTE FOLLOW UP EDIT AFTER BELOW REVIEWI wanted to like this device after reading the reviews.  I dropped my Fire HD 8 (10th gen) and the screen cracked down the middle but it is still very readable.  It is a fairly heavy device with the kickstand cover on it, so poked around to see what I could replace it with\u2014since I really don\u2019t tap into all of its computing power and apps.  I was intrigued by a lighter device that would also be readable outdoors in the sun.  I\u2019m afraid, however, that this Kindle Basic is just too basic.  My primary source of reading material is the library. Overdrive was my download platform, and then my library switched to Libby. You cannot download either of these apps to the 11th gen Basic. In fact, you cannot download any apps, and the web browsing experience is dreadful. If latency and stuttering bother you, you will hate this.  So in order to download from the library you have to use another device and then point that device to this device to download the book. Not a huge hassle, but having all of your interactivity on a single device is where I want to be. Regarding the performance of the Basic:  the page turns are definitely not as quick and crisp as the Fire. It is slower, and there is a tad bit of latency.  If you read at night next to your significant other, the \u201cDark Mode\u201d on this device is more gray than it is black. Definitely inferior to the blacks that Fire offers.  If you enjoy seeing the the full color covers of the books you read\u2014you won\u2019t be doing that here.  Finally, the size is just too small for my liking. Why not just read on your phone if this is the size you are looking for?  Lastly, I don\u2019t trust all of the reviews boasting about battery life. Mine arrived at 53%, and by the time I was done with Amazon Kindle Support on the phone to confirm the web and app limitations the battery was down to 43% after also running a book download experiment by installing the Libby app on my phone and pointing the download at the new Basic. The Basic is now back in its shipping box with the return label attached and ready for a drop off at UPS.********Follow up:I have received my new Fire 7 (see picture above) and have achieved all of the goals I set out to accomplish.  The photo compares it to my Fire 8 HD (with a vertically cracked screen that you can\u2019t really see).  Initially I had the 8HD for traveling and downloading movies. I don\u2019t do much traveling anymore, but if I want to download content, I figured I can just use my MacBook with Retina screen for that.  And besides, all of the reviews for the Fire 7 say it is hard to tell that there is no HD since it is a small screen experience that you are only 2-3 feet away from. I don\u2019t disagree. The great news is that without HD there is not as much processing speed required, so you end up with a MUCH lighter devise. As an ebook reader the performance mirrors the 8HD: crisp precise page turns, etc.  As you can see in the photo, the white background, however, is a little warmer, which I don\u2019t mind at all. The mori\u00e9 effect on the Fire 7 pic is just a byproduct of the photo, and it does not look distorted in real life.  The weight of the Fire 7 and the cover with kickstand and hand strap that I have ordered is just over 15oz, which is just under 1 lb.\u2014the weight of the average hardback.  Perfect.  Smaller and more manageable, lighter, excellent performance, the ability to download apps, a good web browser, ability to download content up to 16GB, and MUCH CHEAPER than the Basic Kindle.  The only thing that Basic Kindle will do better is allow you to read in direct sunlight\u2014which I rarely do anyway since I am usually active when in direct sunlight.  5 stars for the Kindle Fire 7.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"74 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672704000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Avoid Kindle's at all costs!","reviewDescription":"This was not my first Kindle - so I am well acquainted with them.  I noticed with a previous Kindle that even though the charging cables are USB - if you did not use the provided plug - they would have issues charging.  I had hoped that they had fixed that issue - but apparently not only did they not fix it - but now it is worse.  This Kindle was a gift for my wife - and she has had it since Mid- September 2023 - so 6 months.  A little over a month ago she was using it and the battery died - and of course we couldn't initially find the charging cable or plug - and of the 50 other USB cables we have and dozens of USB plugs - none of them would charge it.  So I tried to contact Amazon support to find out what the problem was.  I spent over an hour trying to get to chat with someone and kept ending up at \"sorry page does not exist\" errors.  Which is when I remembered the issue I had with an old Kindle with the charger.  So we searched the house until we found the plug and cable that came with it - and of course they didn't work either.  My wife even went online trying to figure out how to get it work - and she found dozens if not hundreds of complaints about the exact same problem.  I guess you can't count on Amazon to stand behind their products anymore.  If you love to read - get a non-Amazon tablet - and just download the Kindle app and use it that way - at least you'll have a functional tablet!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711756800000}
{"reviewTitle":"THIS was $100?!?","reviewDescription":"I realize this is a bare minimum product. I knew this when I purchased it. However, when I received this kindle, it came in the usual brown box with the standard air bags for protection. Inside though, the product was in a simple flimsy box with no padding. Nothing was included except the product and a very short charge cord. Now, I remember in the past Amazon used to include a few accessories with their products (cheaply made though they were), at the very least a charging brick and cord.  Amazon also took care with their packaging. Now it is only the product and a tiny charge cord in a box that was even slightly open at the top. I understand that things aren't the same as they used to be and that change happens. But this kindle was $99. $99 is a significant amount of money, and for me this purchase caused me to be in a hard place financially. My reason for purchasing in the first place was because I wanted to be able to read without notifications, which I can't do on my phone. This purchase was made so that I had something to occupy myself that wasn't mindless social media scrolling or interrupted reading. This purchase was made to help me ultimately have better mental health (mental health is extremely valuable to me, which is why i made the purchase even at the $99 price tag) and I feel for the sacrifice I made financially I did not get my monies worth. Not only did the product come with no accessories and flimsy packaging, it updated slowly and the scrolling and button pressing lagged. Like I'd press a button and nothing would happen for 5 seconds or longer. The first time I logged into my account on the kindle it failed to even load the book covers and I had to restart it to get it to display on my carousel. I did know it didn't have color, but I feel for $99 it should have been in color. Also, WHY are we paying to have no adds on our lock screen? (I did not end up paying for this but the fact I can't have a device without adds or notifications is INSANE) it's ridiculous. You wouldn't have adds on your phone or laptop screen that you have to pay extra to take off. I understand there is some marketing reason behind the adds but....wtf happened to quality?! I have been very disappointed with Amazon lately and if at all possible, I won't be lining their pockets when I can avoid it. For those wondering, yes, I can read my books, BUT, it is very slow and laggy and since there is no color, comics are off the table as I want color in my comics. I would have been happy with my purchase if it had been $50 cheaper.

{"reviewTitle":"Exchanged twice and all 3 Kindles skipped. This is trash!","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve had a few Kindles over the years. All have been great. I love that they finally added dark mode to this new Kindle. For me, it\u2019s so much easier on my eyes. I love to read while in bed or in a dark room so the darker screen is so much better than the bright white. My 2 complaints about this Kindle are that every so often.. maybe every 5-10 page turns. It will page ahead 2 pages instead of 1. Also every so often it will for a second flash the white screen when changing pages if it\u2019s on dark mode. If these two minor flaws were fixed, I\u2019d say that this is a near perfect Kindle. The battery lasts forever! I read sometimes all day long and it barely puts a dent in the battery percentage.***** UPDATE***. Ok so I\u2019ve had to return this twice now and have gotten replacements. The first Kindle I had was skipping all the time making it impossible to read.  So they replaced it with no issue. The 2nd one started out pretty good. Was only skipping occasionally at first but then started getting worse and skipping more often to the point that in a half hour time it skipped 4 times and one of those times it skipped several pages ahead.  So I contacted customer service again and at first they said I could not replace this again or get a refund.  I told them that was unacceptable since this hasn\u2019t even been 5 months into the year warranty. So they sent me a 3rd one.  I just got it yesterday and so far, fingers crossed, it\u2019s perfect.  I read for a bit last night before going to bed and have been reading for about an hour this morning and so far not a single skip.  I charged it up before I went to bed and was shocked at how fast it charged and so far today the charge is holding.  So there shouldn\u2019t be any problems there.  The only thing tho that really makes me mad during this process of this whole Kindle situation is that the last 2 Kindles they sent me were refurbished ones and not new ones.  I originally purchased a new kindle and therefore it should be replaced with a new one.  I did not originally buy a refurbished Kindle.  But if this one keeps working as wonderfully as it has been so far, I\u2019ll be happy.Another Update**** 2nd replacement\/3rd Kindle also skips pages\u2026 I give up and I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be able to return for a refund.

It would not allow me to go to the next page of the story but defaulted to the rating page\/end of the book. It would not even go to the next chapter.  I tried rebooting the kindle and several times changed authors to make sure it wasn't a glitch in the actual book but it continued.  I started and returned over 4 books from my Kindle unlimited because I couldn't finish them.I tried returning the kindle through the normal return process and was told I must contact customer service.

The new 2022 Kindle was a gift from my husband who heard my grumbling from the adjacent seat.Today, I opened the box and powered on the Kindle 2022, only to discover some hateful interface designer thinks ENORMOUS thumbnail images are better than seeing more list items on a single page. I disagree, and will not keep this device if it prioritizes images over words, and showing more Amazon sales prompts over making reading a seamless, pleasant experience.I use my Kindle every day, and often for hours at a time. If the interface is bad, I'll carry a power bank and stick with my old Voyage if I can't find somewhere online to get a battery replacement (or a new-to-me additional Voyage in better condition.)I can't evaluate the Battery Life for this review as I don't think I'll have this device long enough to discover whether the hardware itself is any good.The touchscreen seems responsive, but I was very reluctant to give up my physical page turn buttons for this new model anyway, so I'm not the best judge for this feature.I was so excited by this gift, and now I'm utterly disappointed. My husband found people online discussing how to jailbreak the device to go back to old software. I don't want to do that. Amazon has done enough things right with the Kindle reading ecosystem that I was willing to stick with it. If they move away from e-readers as devices FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE WORDS, they will lose my e-book business.Everyone who hates the new list interface must visit customer service and report it. Hopefully someone will listen. Keep the people who love pictures designing book covers, and ask actual readers what they value in a \"List View\" of their library. I'd guess most of us prefer to see the TITLE and AUTHOR in a clear font, ideally with an adjustable size as we can do inside the book reading view.Personally, I want to view as many titles per page as possible in my chosen font size! Seeing four titles per page makes it more difficult to find what I want if I'm browsing by flicking through the list, and it doesn't even allow me to see just those volumes I'm actively reading at one time.

And there is only one line of covers for books I have bought, and multiple lines of books Amazon is trying to sell me.Further, under the old system I could remove a book from the Kindle and keep it in the cloud.  Now, if I 'delete the download' the book cover remains on the Kindle taking up space.  If I want to delete the cover I have to delete the book from the cloud which means if I ever want to go back to the book I have to buy it again.

{"reviewTitle":"Pocket Sized Portal to Other Worlds","reviewDescription":"This review is for the 6\u201d Kindle Basic from 2022. This is the first kindle\/ereader\/eink device I\u2019ve ever owned. I was skeptical at first, as I\u2019ve typically been a die hard physical book reader. Growing up in the late 80\u2019s, early 90\u2019s, physical books were all that existed, so it would stand to reason I would have gazed upon ereaders with a bit of haughtiness. Besides, I have a smartphone, and after having tried reading via the kindle app and disliking it, I had sworn off ebooks for good, or so I thought. However, after taking the plunge and gazing upon the sharp text on the grey eink screen and seeing how closely it resembles an actual paper page, my skepticism soon turned to delight.  Reading on a dedicated e-ink screen is vastly different from reading on a phone. If I\u2019d have known that sooner, I may have been an ebook convert long ago. The refresh rate of a kindle screen is far slower than that of a smartphone, pc, or tablet, with evidence potentially pointing to this, and the blue-light factor, as being a couple of reasons people get headaches after staring at these screens for awhile. The lights of the kindle screen point inward towards the text, rather than coming from behind the screen as on a smartphone, this means that, when reading at night, it\u2019s far less bright and easier on the eyes.  I\u2019m now obsessed with this device, I\u2019ve only had it a few weeks, but in that time I\u2019ve either been reading it, or loading books onto it. Kindle is a supremely apt name because this 6\u201d pocket sized portal to another world has rekindled the intense reading passion of my youth, to the point I\u2019m looking up and reading public domain classics I barely glanced at in the past. I\u2019ve now installed over 91 books onto the device, and with 16 gigs of memory, it seems I\u2019ll likely have room for more books than I could read in the rest of my lifetime.The height of the device is actually slightly shorter than that of my iPhone 11 Pro Max, but about an inch wider. This means I can easily slip the device in and out of my pocket, though it takes up basically the entire width of whatever pocket in goes in, pantswise. I\u2019ve got a flip cover case on the way in order to protect the screen, as eink screens and cells are more fragile than phone screens, and I also like the idea of waking and sleeping the screen just with the flap, rather than the annoyingly placed sleep button.  Overall, if anyone is debating on whether or not to pick up one of these, or whether you\u2019ll like it as opposed to physical books, debate no more! If you\u2019re a reader, or thinking about getting into reading, or you struggle with storing or carrying your books places, this is the device for you. Making the transition to reading on an eink screen is easier than you think, and the storage space and small form factor will leave you never wanting for any books in your collection when you travel, ever again. So just pull the trigger and get it already!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"46 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702512000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Love my new Kindle","reviewDescription":"I've had the old Kindle Touch (4th Generation) for many years.  I've used it quite a when I first got it, but over the years, started using my iPad, especially when I'm traveling so that I can carry less devices.  Recently I started reading more again and realized I should use my Kindle again to save battery on my iPad.  However, I started noticing the age of my old Kindle and decide to upgrade to the latest.I got this basic Kindle over the paperwhite because I wanted to smallest, lightest one available.  I also got the case and it was still much lighter and smaller than my old one.  The best part is that it response so much faster than the old device.  It also reminds me how much enjoyable and easier on the eyes it is to read on a Kindle vs. the iPad.So happy I upgraded.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1709510400000}

This is the one I chose and it has been great. I've read a few books and pdfs in this, and I can say it is a lot easier to use than the one I had before. I like how easy it is to highlight phrases, to look at the meaning of unknown words and to go back and forth between pages. The one thing I'm not a fan of is the paging system because I can't make easy parallels with physical books, but I understand the reasoning behind it, and it's something I'll get used to.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710547200000}

When this was on sale for October prime day, I decided to take the plunge and purchase one. Therefore, this is my first official E-reader.Things I love about the e-reader switch:My library is all loaded onto one simple, lightweight device. I tend to burn through books very quickly, and it is great to be able to do that without paying $10-$25 for a hard copy of one. I no longer am burdened with an ever-growing library of physical books that are a pain to move between apartments, and it is very travel-friendly in general. The screen doesn\u2019t hurt my eyes like I expected it to. It is far easier to hold in my hand than a physical book is. The battery life seems great. I like that there are no distractions when I read, and the interface is very user-friendly. I love the anti-glare. I far prefer reading on this unique device over reading on my iPad.Things I miss about physical books:I do miss the smell of the pages of a physical book. I miss being able to seamlessly flip through pages, or look at the entirety of two pages at once. I hate having to charge a device to read (though this is not a huge deal since the battery life is so excellent). The ads on the front are extremely annoying. It sometimes seems glitchy\/slow when flipping pages. Sometimes the book covers are hard to see.Overall, I love this device and I will certainly get a ton of use out of it. The positives outweigh the negatives. I feel no desire to upgrade to a \u201cnicer\u201d Kindle anytime soon.

Take as many books as I want wherever I go and it fits in the smallest pocket of my bag? Yes please!ConsResponse time a bit slow when scrolling through library or kindle store- recommend doing this part on your phone when possible. For me this was not a deal breaker.Battery does NOT last weeks. One full charge lasted me about 6 days, on average I use mine about 3 hours a day. This is not a big deal unless you won\u2019t be near a charger for days at a time.Device feels fragile without a case, the shell is not tacky so it\u2019s easy to drop. I thinks case is necessary. Luckily there are a lot of great cases online. Mine has a hand strap and kickstand.This kindle is a true basic e-reader. No bells and whistles, just a portable, reliable, easy to use digital library.

It will never download my whole library. When it gets too many books on it, my only choice is to do a factory reset.*The first sign of trouble is when I cannot download the book from the kindle device. Then I have to go to My Content and Devices on my Amazon account web page to send the book to kindle. At some point,  it cannot deliver a book.Then the helpful tech support people will tell you to do a factory reset. You will erase all content, of course, and then it will need to do any upgrades from 2022 (in my case) when it was first released.Note: I've never gotten 1,000 books on any kindle without this happening2. If you have a lot of books, it is not able to organize your books by series. The apps on my iPhone and iPad organize them fine, but no longer on my kindle device.What does this mean?Don't spend extra money getting more storage. I never came close to using the 32Gb on the Oasis, and I still have over 11Gb free on this kindle.

My prior experience is just reading books on my tablet. Adds are only on lockup screen. Nothing pops up while you read. Don't pay for no adds. It's unnecessary.  I like this reader, but have to say, it's really tiny. Not much bigger than my phone. If you're using this as primary reader, you might not be happy, though you would probably get used to it. I like it's portability size. Easy to tuck in purse and not heavy. A selling point for this is the long battry life. I think it said weeks. Sorry... thats not true. If youre reading all day like I do, you'll only get a couple days from the battery. The only big concerns I have is that it doesn't seem to easily download books on its own. It seems much faster if I buy book on phone or tablet and just download by clicking when new book icon appears on the reader. Things I miss compared to my tablet is that you cannot choose a color when highlighting. I  use color highlights to mean different things. Other thing I miss is that, while it will look up words (dictionary), it doesn't have a translate option for foreign words. I really miss that function.All in all, it's a great device for the price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671235200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Skeptic Turned","reviewDescription":"Okay, as a huge reader I have been a skeptic of the e-readers. Mainly because I will always prefer an actual book in my hands to another piece of technology. The issue is that books I have been waiting for are only being released on a digital format, therefore I had to join the bandwagon. This little gadget is pretty amazing. First, it's so small and so lightweight - but the screen is so very easy to read. Second, I love the dark mode that can be selected for reading at night! No more booklight! This piece of technology is so crazy to me - and I absolutely love it. I did end up buying the fabric case for it because it is super slick and I was worried about dropping it. I will always be an \"actual\" book lover but this is a pretty handy item to have when your book hasn't been released in print. Third, I would definitely take this when traveling. I researched the e-readers along with mini tablets to see which would be the best fit and this is by far the winner for me.

{"reviewTitle":"Loved Kindle 11th gen over Kindle PW 11th gen","reviewDescription":"I honestly had a hard time deciding between this Kindle basic 11th gen and the Kindle Paperwhite 11th gen (PW). I own an older PW released in 2015 which I absolutely love but I wanted to finally try the Audible so I decided to upgrade. I tested both this Kindle Basic 11th gen and the Kindle PW 11th gen for about 2 weeks, used both everyday. I'm still a little on the fence but I finally settled with Kindle (basic) 11th gen because it met my basic needs.  Here are my observations which led me to pick the basic model.The first good thing about this basic Kindle is that the screen is more matte than the new PW. I could not get past the reflections that I see on the screen of the new PW when there is a window or light behind me when I'm reading. I do not have that problem with my old PW. I also prefer the lightness and the size of the Kindle basic, although the cheap feel of the plastic build bothered me at first. It slides more easily off my hand than the PW and it scratches easily but I fixed that by putting a back cover on the Kindle basic. The build of the new PW felt a lot sturdier though.I don't mind that the Kindle basic doesn't have the warm light feature that the new PW have although I'd probably use it when reading at night IF the basic had it. The warm light only works if you have the backlight on. I don't mind that the basic is not waterproof unlike the new PW. I don't soak in the tub and I rarely get in the pool to purposely read so I'm fine with it. I also like that the Kindle basic has an actual frame around the screen unlike the flushed screen on the new PW which makes me feel like I'm reading from a tablet, imagine the glare on top of that.Both of them get the slight screen burns when I scroll up or down, not too bad so far. Both of their bluetooth function (BT) worked great for Audible, but the BT coverage on the basic actually went just a few feet farther than the PW before it started cutting out. I did notice that the battery went down faster on the basic but it's probably because I left the BT \"ON\" all the time. I did get the \"application error\" message once on each reader at some point but it didn't seem to affect anything. Neither of them became glitchy although I'm not sure why I got the error message.They both worked good in dark mode. The glitch that other people mentioned when turning the page happened on both new PW and the basic. The dark mode lights up briefly (but quickly) before displaying the next page. This can be fixed by turning off the Page Refresh from the Reading Options menu.There are other features on new PW that I don't mind NOT having only because I could not get past the glare, size, heaviness, and the flushed frame of the PW. The Kindle basic met my basic needs without the cons, \"my cons\", of the PW :)  In my opinion, the Kindle basic is easier to carry because it's super lightweight, fits in my purse or pocket in my jacket easily, and I was able to adjust to the smaller screen size in no time. Overall, I think it would just really be a matter of preference between the two.Edited: I added 2 more pics to show the back cover with popsocket on my Kindle basic! :)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"551 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667088000000}

They are perfect devices that remind you to be more productive in life and help you disconnect and read!The Amazon kindle 2022 version comes with a USB C port and it is long overdue! Now I can finally pack away my micro usb cables for good! The device charges quickly and the battery life is great.The operating system is the same from previous devices but with some new quality of life improvements including a dark mode. I never knew I needed dark mode and I love it.I think the biggest critique I have for this kindle is the screen size. I wish that Amazon would release a smaller e-Ink device that\u2019s the size of an iPhone. I love the idea of a smaller, more pocket sized kindle that can fit alongside my iPhone.I feel like Amazon is getting really close to an even better device and I hope they consider it. I truly think that a smaller e-ink screen the size of an iPhone would do great.Another suggestion I have for Amazon is to look at the PlayDate device. The playdate is an amazing device. Seriously amazing. I love how animated, and pretty the playdate is and how small it is too.Imagine if the next kindle functioned like a playdate and had more animated menus and sounds and book titles were more pretty.

I was happier with my 2016 Kindle Paperwhite but Amazon doesn't seem to support it now and it balks when I attempt to transfer my previously purchased library books to it.  Upgrades are often not an improvement in my opinion when it comes to Kindles.  The BEST part of the newer version is how lightweight it is compared to my older model. I have added an extra star for that feature alone because it is a huge issue for me with the joint arthritis and fibromyalgia pain that makes holding any book or heavier Kindles nearly impossible.  I also need the ability to enlarge the print size as my eyes blur with anything other than daylight.

But I really wanted to use it for borrowing ebooks from the local library (which uses Libby) and without the ability to even download that app, well, its usefulness to me approaches 0 ... Also the font size on the screens for requesting help with the Libby app problem is *maybe* 1 pt. type, requiring a magnifying glass to even navigate, and then there's the delay in between each letter that one must type using the virtual keyboard, only to finally be told there's a \"captcha\" issue and the request for help is then dead in the water. Yes, I'm connected to my wifi. I will ask the library staff if they know how to help, but that's really not their job.And the delay when typing letters using the virtual keyboard is truly maddening. The flashing white screen that shows up all. the. time. when trying to use commands is annoying. I may give this to my mother and see if she can master the navigation just to read books I can download from Amazon, but as the navigation is also somewhat confusing, I'm not sure that will work.Really disappointed. If they're going to add a web interface for downloading apps like Libby, and advertise that it can do that, then it should work. If they're going to have a virtual keyboard, it shouldn't have such delayed response time.

They do exactly what I want them to do, which is store hundreds of books, provide a no-glare screen with reasonable battery life at a reasonable cost, and I've been very happy with all of the devices I've had in the past. I read for at least 3-4 hours every day, so I'm rather hard on them. The main reason I've had to replace a device in the past is that the battery will no longer hold a charge. My first device from 2012 lasted for 6 years, while all the other ones last 2-3 depending on how often I use them. I usually have 2 devices I go back and forth between at any once time.That was the issue with my Kindle before this one, so I was pleased to be able to sell the device back to Amazon for a $20 gift certificate that I put toward the price of my new Kindle, plus a 20% discount on my next device, so it was almost half off. That being said, when I got my first 2022 release model, I discovered it had more issues than any of the other models I've had in the past. My main complaints are the slow speed of the built-in keyboard compared to past models, and the fact that my particular device puts itself into sleep mode at least a few times every day. It does this both when I have just touched the screen a few seconds past, or if I touched it a minute ago. I also noticed that compared to past models, there is a lot more finicky having to opt-out of all the features I don't want turned on for privacy, etc. The only thing I like about this edition of the basic Kindle more than past versions is that it is offered in blue, which makes a nice change from basic black.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692748800000}

{"reviewTitle":"LOVE IT, except...","reviewDescription":"I like this Kindle, but it has a few problems:1. It rarely turns one page at a time. It started out turning two pages ahead, then five, and now it goes backwards just as often as it goes forward, so I get pulled out of my story and have to go hunting for the last place I read with almost every page turn. It would be comical if it wasn't so frustrating, especially when I'm trying to read myself to sleep at night.2. Turning the page sometimes triggers a bright white flash, even in dark mode. It can be extremely painful when reading at night.3. It doesn't communicate well with other readers on my Kindle account. My old Paperwhite knows exactly where I left off on the new device, but the new device hasn't a clue that the old device exists. This is very frustrating when re-reading books because the new device will try to send me to the very end of the book, thinking I'm done with it. And don't get me started with trying to sync on the mobile app. I've stopped using that altogether.4. I can't find a cover that stays open while holding the Kindle at an angle, such as when laying down to read. If my grip loosens at all, the Kindle side flops down, pulls the whole cover out of my hand, and hits me in the face.5. The battery lasts about half as long as my original Kindle, so I'm frequently interrupted to recharge the device.Other than those admittedly huge issues, I still love the concept of Kindle. That said, I do hope Amazon will see this review and fix as many of these issues as they can in a software update.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684972800000}

{"reviewTitle":"12 years using a Kobo","reviewDescription":"I got this because of the price and because of the ability to trade in Kindle that was not usable I found from a yard sale.  Things I like are the ability to get books from overdrive\/libby but I wish it was easier to do on the kindle itself rather than on the computer.  I also like the fact that the Kobo has a pages left till the end of the chapter and I wish that the Kindle did the same.  Maybe when they update the software they can add the pages left feature.  The size is similar to my Kobo Touch but the Kindle is incredibly light weight and I feel like I'm going to break it.  The screen is pretty crisp and easy to read and it fits in my back pocket of my jeans.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683763200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Still Can't Remove Book Covers From Home","reviewDescription":"The Kindle is easy to read in sunlight which I like. The controls are less responsive than with a higher end product but are adequate for the price. I expected to get the same level of controls that I get with the Kindle app and that isn't what is on the device. Compared to the Kindle app options, this Kindle 11 Gen is pretty basic.Also, I get that Amazon wants to keep the Kindle 11th Gen as simple as possible for the price yet would it be that difficult to allow the user to remove the covers from books from the Home shelf? The covers are moved when a Kindle Unlimited book is returned, but when I remove the download for a book I purchased, the cover remains and messes up seeing what books are unread on the home shelf. I know that one can use the library to determine what is and isn't read. That isn't the point, the main page takes me to the Home shelf and that should be able to be cleared of covers of books that have been read. Amazon hasn't felt compelled yet to fix this problem since I've read so many other reviews remarking on this. I'm adding my voice to the complaints.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"35 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1680998400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Kindle's UI","reviewDescription":"Hello. Not so long ago I purchased my new Kindle 11th Gen and I found out something that really bothering me. It is about the Kindle's UI. When I go to my Library and when I want to change my View options I have to think a lot to find the right thing to do.Also in the head of the Library page there are lot of free space which is never used and that hit my eyes. Page just look empty and as user you don\u2019t really understand the View options are actually On and whether other options are there.If it's possible, please change that thing. Can you move View options menu to the top as I made on the concept pic? In my opinion it looks way better and you always understand which option is turned On. Also when you are in Collections mode the \u00ab+\u00bb sign seems to be more clear why is it there.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1682640000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Is this really all you need","reviewDescription":"With over 7000 reviews of this model if you find mine it may not be what you expect. I find that most reviews of this line of readers almost always come from avid users of the brand who either are excited about certain improvements or angry that it's not what it used to be. I actually had one of those original ones with the keyboard and it was dead for a long time. I had a new battery put in, knowing that I could have bought a brand new one for the same price, and it was still dead. I think eventually the e-ink simply gives up and can't make an image. It's shame because those were pretty nice units. Before I bought this one on sale on Prime Day I read an excellent article about e-readers as a category, not just Kindles, and learned some solid truths that weren't written by a press agent. Once this model was introduced the more expensive ones really don't buy you much more in dollar value and some of the so called features can really work against you. There's no escaping it - to be able to just grab your Kindle anywhere at any time this model is all you need and easily the most convenient. The quirks? Sure we all know about them and after all these years and with all of the advances in technology they are massively overpriced and under engineered. But it is a continuous profit stream for them so why mess with it? At the sixty-four bucks I got this for it is only about three times overpriced, they should be going for no more than twenty five bucks and the accessories are through the roof as well. But if you really want to tote a couple of hundred books around with you and have them fit in your pocket, there is still nothing better than this basic model.YES NO MAYBEFor the closing argument I gathered the three most often cited complaints, or negatives, about the basic Kindle and being an owner here's my opinion on them. No waterproofing (oh really, and just how many paper books have you read in the swimming pool?)  No color temperature adjustment (same question, when was the last time you read a paper book and changed the color of the page from white to orange?) And finally, raised bezel design (no really, this is among the top three complaints, I can't even come up with a comeback for that one, Virtually every TV and computer monitor screen has a bezel, why did it get to be a problem if your Kindle has one?Stop reading other people's opinions and buy one and go sit under a tree and read an interesting book.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"151 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689292800000}
