My first try on a 2 day old beard, was not what I had expected. It pulled and took a few passes to achieve a fairly close shave, but I could still feel a stubble. I then picked up my old trusty Henry\u2019s razor and finished the shave to a close and smooth finish.  I passed the razor on to my wife for shaving her legs and underarms. So far, she tried it once on her underarms and experienced a similar pulling sensation. I\u2019m waiting to hear about her legs.

{"reviewTitle":"Value but cut my head up each use","reviewDescription":"I'm bald, I've shaved my head since I was 20, I'm currently 30 so I've shaven my head for 10 years. I wanted to try a cheaper option as my preferred brand went up in price (again). I strongly dislike the buzz cut look you get at about 3 days, so I shave daily and maybe once a week after 48 hours.The issue with this is the fact my head doesn't have time to fully heal over in 24-48 hours when I need the shave again. This causes a cut of any size to keep reopening every time you shave, you can't avoid it unless you don't shave for about 5 days. These minor cuts can easily drag on for a week or two, which on a bald head really sticks out.I don't like it, needless to say I've used this razor three times now, each time it has cut me, most razors will cut you, heads really are not taken into account when it comes to manufacturing, some times the blades spacing is just enough to nick any curve on your head (which there is many).Some brands work better than others, but given the daily shaving (and the size of a head) you tend to burn through blades quickly. It adds up fast so I like to try new brands in hopes I can save some cash, it pays off every now and then sadly this was a miss for me. 3 shaves 3 good cuts I could instantly feel, for context I get cut by my preferred brand maybe once every 3 months.The shave was never smooth, felt harsh with slight tugging on hair, the heads where also pretty large which makes it hard to work with since only about 50% of the head is the blades, I couldn't get a good feel over what parts the blade shaved and it was simply the other 50% passing over.The handle while looking cheap felt nice, I kinda liked it, liked where they put the grips at, felt good in the hand and was easy enough to control shaving the back side of my head with in the shower, I simply wasn't a fan of the blades or cartridge size, it reminding me more than anything of those cheap disposable 1 use razors I bought as a teen.I can't say how they work on the face since I have a beard, but as for heads this isn't a recommendation from me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1621036800000}

In that time I dabbled using razors from other mail order companies like Harry's and Dollar Shave Club, always returning to Gillette.  I am generally a fan of generics because they are usually ~80% as good for about 50% (or less of the price) so I decided to give this a try.  [UPDATED...again]+ Price as of the original draft was Gillette Fusion blades are $2.81 \/ Count on Amazon and the Solimos are about $1.20 \/ count (Yes, it does depend on how many you buy, but the basic math works).  WINNER SOLIMO:  MUCH Cheaper+ Shave closeness-I was shocked to find the Solimo shaves closer.  I'm a 40-something white dude so I have been shaving for ~30 years  WINNER:  SOLIMO+ [UPDATE] While the blades are so cheap you can change them often.  I found you do have to change them at least once\/week.  The shape of the Solimo Baldes means you have to be super careful shaving your chin and under your nose.  I have nicked myself a few times and actually had to change my technique WINNER:  Gillette-  [UPDATE] Handle:  the Gillette handles are better, they have a better attachment mechanism and the area you grip has a better shape WINNER:  Gillette.  I really hate the SOLIMO attachment mechanism.  As often as you change the blades it should be seamless, it isn't- [UPDATE] Trimmer blade on the back of the razor blade.  Gillette is FAR superior.  I am not sure what is up with the Solimo Trimmer blade but I felt like I was using an old pocket knife.  I could feel the hair of my sideburns being pulled versus cleanly sliced.  It did get the job done, but OUCH.  The trimmer on the back of the blades seems worse every blade I try.  They do not cut hair cleanly but they sure do nick your face.  WINNER:  GilletteUPDATED BOTTOM LINE:  WINNER GILLETTE:  After using the SOLIMOs for a while said I would update.  Here is the update.  I switched back to Gillette and cancelled my subscribe\/save for Solimo.  For me the Gillette just works better as a razor.  I think everyone's face is a little different so I would encourage anyone to give the SOLIMOs as shot.  I was on the fence but based on shaving performance I prefer the Gillette and the price difference does not overcome that.ORIGINAL BOTTOM LINE:  I have 16 of these to try and about 20 Gillette still in the inventory so I'll toggle back and forth then update as necessary.

The new Amazon packaging is great and the extra cartridges are conveniently split 4 to a box which makes it great for storing.The handle- is nice. It fits well in the hand and the rubberized grip on the underside gives it a secure feeling. Not too much weight to it, but also not light. The only con about the handle, in my opinion, is the part that connects to the cartridge. It feels as though it\u2019s going to break off with every stroke you take.The razors- not so great. I\u2019m used to the SkinGuard razors which are pretty sharp straight out the package as every new razor should be. These razors straight out the package, felt like they had been used for a month before they were packaged. A lot of pulling and tugging on the initial stroke on short, post-shower facial hair. Gave it the benefit of the doubt, figured it was a dud and switched it out for another cartridge that was separately packaged and met the same result. During the shave, I even considered switching to a disposable Gillette Mens razor that I have for emergencies. I eventually finished the shave with a mediocre result.Another thing to note, the moisturizing strip doesn\u2019t seem to mix well with all shave gels. I use Aveeno Therapeutic shave gel for sensitive skin, and for some reason it made it into a gummy mess and the strip seemed to be the culprit. No biggie, I rinsed off and used Cremo original shave cream and it seemed to be a whole lot better.All in all, you get what you pay for. It\u2019s a budget razor with sub-standard results. I didn\u2019t expect too much but it also under performed.

My first shave was pretty good so I went ahead and bought some more blades for it. That is where my good experiences with this razor end.That first shave, from what I can figure, was good for 2 reasons: the blade was fresh and my stubble was short. I have incredibly thick and coarse facial hair, and it proved to be too much for these blades to handle for very long which is a huge disappointment considering I keep a beard most of the time so I only have to shave my neck and cheeks to shape the beard (I grow hair from right under my eyes down into my shirt so I have to shape my beard). Where I can get 5+ shaves with other brands before changing the blade, I have to change the blade on this razor with every shave. Even then, I found that if I wait a few extra days and my stubble is longer (not really stubble at this point), I have to go over the same area multiple times to get everything. That creates irritation, and I don't have that issue with better razors.This might work better for you. I'm a very hairy guy in his 40s with very dense facial hair.

I would have given up on Gillette years ago, except that there's nothing I hate more than an electric shaver.That's all changed now that I've gotten halfway through a box of these Solimo cartridges. The front side of the cartridge works fine for the price. I get a little more whisker pulling than I have come to expect with Gillette cartridges, but given the price differential, it's not that big a deal. It's on the back side of the cartridge, though, that Solimo really wets its pants. The single beard-trimmer blade looks enough like a razor blade, but in use it seems to have been designed to merely taunt the whiskers under my nose, yanking them painfully without actually cutting them. Although I have never actually had a Brazilian wax myself, I imagine the sensation must be pretty much the same.I threw the first cartridge away after one shave, assuming that I must've just gotten a bad cartridge. I've made it through several more now, and they all have the same useless single blade on the back. I now use two razors to shave: I'm determined to use up the rest of the Solimo cartridges, because, damn it, I've already paid for them. When it comes time to shave under my nose, though, I swear gently, set the Solimo down and use the Gillette to finish up. I don't know whether I got a bad box or whether I just have some freakish hellwhiskers under my nose, but when these Solimos are gone, I'll go back to Gillette. If someday they stop making Gillettes, maybe I'll get an electric shaver.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1640995200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Solimo 5-Blade","reviewDescription":"I am going to write an honest review. My Solimo Blade arrived yesterday. Used it for the first time this am. Before I get into my review, allow to rate the razors that I have Trialed in order of preference.~Gillette Fusion5 is hands down the best on the market~Harry\u2019s Truman is very good, but use caution. Blades very sharp, back one especially~Dollar Shave Club\u2019s Truman isn\u2019t quite as sharp, but safer. This is a great option.~Solimo 5-Blade Serves my needs. The back blade though is worthless. Don\u2019t use it.These are listed in order of cost and my preference.01 June: as I stated I used the Solimo 5-Blade for the first time. I think it shaves ok. Wasn\u2019t anything special, but for the value, I hope that I end up happy with it. The back single blade is absolutely worthless. Felt like dragging a dull rock across my face. I do have a separate razor that can do that job. So, I\u2019ll be Trialing only the front 5 blades. Leave the back blade alone. Do not use it!02 June: used it again to shave my face and everything below my nexk. Yes, that means my pits, bits, and legs. If you look at the cartridge, the blades are recessed. So, it\u2019s difficult to ascertain how sharp they are. No issues with my face shaving today, but the back blade trimming about my goatee is no bueno. I have my other shaver that can do that job. So, not an issue probably. Shaved my pits and legs with a pass or two. Nice and smooth. Just how I like it. More care with my bits obviously. Shaved my pubic area nicely, smooth as well. Happy with the overall results of these areas. No cuts, nicks, etc. Could well be worth it for this alone. Again, being as the blades are recessed, seems nearly, if not impossible draw blood.03 June: Overall, I am happy with how the Solimo 5-Blade shaves my face. It\u2019s doing a good job. I was pleased with how it shaved my pits, bits, and lags. The back razor is absolutely useless for shaving around my goatee. I do have my other shaver that can do that. So, this is not a deal breaker.Overall\u2026It\u2019s a good razor for the value, and serves my needs. Shaves my face, pits, bits, and legs well. Back blade is absolutely pointless. rough and harsh on the skin; very dull. I will use my other shaver for my goatee. I hope this helps others.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1622678400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not bad but... Get a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Instead! (Review)","reviewDescription":"50+ years of blade shaving, I've used them all, safety razors, disposables, etc. I used to be a Gillette guy, they gave the best shave: closest, very comfortable, good blade life. Unfortunately, Gillette's became more and more expensive to the point where I quit using them and looked for alternatives.For a long time, I used the Schick 5-blade cartridge razors. They worked well enough, not as good as Gillette, but adequate and far cheaper when Costco was selling them. They quit carrying them, and I found I could get cheap replacement cartridges from Amazon. Probably counterfeit, but initially, they were fine. Over several re-purchases, the cartridges got worse, where they weren't sharp to start with and dulled quickly. I started looking for alternatives.First I tried was this one, the Amazon Solimo. For shaving, about the same as the Schick before they went bad. The problem here was the trimmer. Other commenters have noticed the same thing, it just doesn't work well. Bad angle and a blade guard that makes it impossible to get close. On to the next one...Next, I tried Harry's, they're sold at Costco now. Again, about the same as the Schick used to be. Didn't care for how \"floppy\" the suspension of the blade were, but I could live with it. And I personally found the lubricant they use to be irritating, YMMV. But if the Solimo trimmer was bad, this one was worse. It should be labelled as a \"lethal weapon\". First time I used it I cut myself under my nose so bad it took 30 minutes to stop the bleeding. I never cut myself with my Schick, they have a flip-away moisturizer bar so that the full five blades can be used as a trimmer. Very comfortable and accurate. So, adios, Harry.Finally, I bit the bullet and ordered a starter pack of four blades and a handle, Gillette ProGlide. Yeah, they cost more, quite a bit more. But they're awesome. The shave is the closest and super-comfortable. No irritation from the lubricant. And the trimmer, while not as good as the Schick, is way better than the Harry's or Solimo. The correct angle and a very thin blade guard, works decently. The Gillette handle is also the best in your hand, good weighting and grip.So, don't waste your money, get Gillette. You'll pay more, but it's worth it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1635379200000}

I've tried Harry's, Gillette, and Joy, among others. Sometimes I'll buy men's razors bc they are usually less expensive per cartridge.

Anyway, I tried dollar shave club a couple years ago, and ended up canceling when I had about a year's worth (or more) of razors stocked in my cabinet (shoutout to all the other ladies out there who pretty much just shave their pits, and bikini lines in between waxings. To everyone else, if my quarterly leg-shave is too hairy for you, I invite you to stop looking at my legs). Well, after my stockpile of DSC was all used up, I tried this Amazon brand, since I've discovered that I pretty much will stick with any product if I like it enough AND it can be auto-delivered to me (seriously, who buys toilet paper in person anymore? Get that biz shipped to you and score the subscription discount, too).Immediate verdict with literally the first swipe of this razor: Inferior. It slightly pulls at my hair, and doesn't even run smoothly over just-shaved skin. Did it give me razor burn? No. Did it murder my pits or bikini line? No. Was the handle also inferior to DSC? Yes, but not in a way that I couldn't have ignored it if the razors themselves had been better. But for me, my pits & binki line are too precious to be dragging a sub-par razor over them every other(ish) day. With DSC, I could use the same razor for a month (I have fine hair, fyi), and it never pulled even after all that use.

I currently have used the \"Caveman\" razor from ShaveMOB for several years with really no complaints.  It shaves very well, has outstanding longevity (usually 3-4 weeks per blade), and great service.  The cavemen is identical to the Solimo razor as it has 5 blades and the rear precision trimmer blade.  Under normal shaving conditions, it seems that the Solimo razor takes two or three additional passes to what the ShaveMOB razor would do.  While the Solimo razor does have the \"motionsphere\" head, this basically does nothing for me and has no effect good or bad while shaving.  Where the Solimo is lacking even more is the rear precision trimming blade.  The ShaveMOB trimming blade was just as useful to me as the front side and did an outstanding job under the nose, corners or the mouth, and sideburns.  The Solimo trimming blase is basically useless.  It does not trim well as all and after multiple skin irritating tries, I give up and have stubble left in those areas.  The ultimate deal breaker was when I used a disposable 3 blade Rite Aid brand razor at work that worked better than the Solimo.  I highly recommend trying the two cartridge pack of Solimo and giving it a test run before making the mistake that I made and buying the 16 razor pack.  I will be paying just a little more and re-ordering the ShaveMOB Cavemen this week and giving the rest of my Solimo razors away as it just doesn't work well enough for me.

Yes, it does produce a good amount of lubricant to help with the shaving process, but it is excessive; making it harder to shave. In addition, either the angle of the razor is off or the thick lubricant attachment makes it harder to get an efficient smooth shave.  I had to repeatedly go over the same spot due to a design flaw. Lastly, the single blade for close shave was also hard to use around the nose, again, possibly due to the lubricant bar sitting near the blade.

The men in my family have tough and fast-growing beards. Shaving has always been a crappy job with crappy results... until I found Amazon Basics 5-Blade MotionSphere Razor in combination with Cremo Barber Grade Original Shave Cream.Stop spending a fortune on the name brand razors. These razors are superior in quality and shave and dramatically less expensive. I've been using them for a few years how and could not be happier with the closeness of the shave, how long they last, and the amazing price point compared to the rip-off that the major shaving brands are.After shaving, my face is smooth and clean, and my wife loves the results. Yours will too.I highly recommend using these with the Cremo Barber Grade Original Shave Cream. The combination of these two products has made for the best shaves I've had in 4 decades of shaving.Trust me, you will love this razor and you will love the money you still have in your pocket. It works flawlessly, lasts a long time, and is much cheaper than the name brands and works better than any of them.Pro shaving tips from 4 decades of shaving:Never shave upwards. When you do, you are pulling the hairs up and back and that causes them to invert and causes bumps. It may seem like you are getting a closer shave, but you are actually causing issues you have to deal with longer term. Just keep shaving on a downward stroke only.After you lather your face up, let it sit. The longer it is on, the more pliable\/softer your beard hairs will be and will make shaving much easier and closer.Rinse your blade constantly. Every time you stroke the blade on your face, rinse the blade. Haris are stuck between the blades and they prevent you from getting a close shave.When rinsing your blade, place the blade at the bottom of the falling water. Gravity and propulsion gives it more force to remove the hairs stuck between the blades.Rinse both sides of the blade, not just one side, so you make sure to get the hairs out from in-between.After shaving, dry the blades on your towel. Your blades will last much longer. Don't put the blades in a box or bag. Just leave it out to dry faster.Hope this helps. Happy shaving!Love,Brad","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707868800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Flabbergasted - (pics of my ugly mug for shaving illustration only)","reviewDescription":"I am stunned by all the shaving culture diatribe.  I am 47 years old and have been actively shaving for more than 3 decades.  That beautiful beard of mine is something that I maintain for about 5 months per year.  From a clean shave to 3 weeks of not shaving it is fully in, but for length.  Point is,  I grow a thick beard, fast.Now, 7 months out of the year I shave that thick, fast growing beard, along with my entire head and neck - clean.  Until a few years ago I did this every day and wore a suit as a practicing attorney (I'm now blessed with my days filled with homeschooling my kids, working heavy machinery to make pasture for a developing farm, and generally staying out of public).In ALL of these years I barely ever thought about how \"enjoyable\" my private-\"me\"-shave time was, or how special and pampering my equipment was.  Fact is, I'm a fair-skinned white guy with thick facial hair and moderately sensitive skin.  I used the regular progression of Gillette razors and marveled at how many blades were being added to my cartridges (I'm waiting for the \"Razor Washcloth\" where you wipe your entire face, etc. with  a cloth covered in 1,000 razors that spin, wiggle, gyrate and sing Elvis songs for your most enjoyable 3 minutes per morning rush).One day I heard about man-shaming, corporate-s'plaining from Gillette and assessed my shaving costs.  Here's my set up:  razor + Lever 2000 that I wash my entire ... me ... with.  That's it.  Lever is pennies per week, Gillette ...??? Why was I so heavily invested in this company, were there good alternatives I mused? Hence my introduction to all this panty-wasted shave-culture gibberish (stick with me to hear support for this conclusion).I nearly got completely freaked out by considering a new razor.  I imagined chunks of my tender flesh on the shower floor due to unknown shaving follies, calls to the fire department to please put out this unbearable burning, and aliens just saying \"ahhh, screw it, let's stop wasting time and 86 these puny life-forms; this guy's shaving mishaps have completely caused us to loose faith of any redemption for the bugs!\"Seriously, the discussion was nearly crippling. Don't get me wrong, I lived for years in  Chicago area group homes, etc.  with some black guys who really had to take care with their products or they'd get some bad ingrowns, etc. But these were the outliers, NOT the norm out of all the guys I've known in nearly half a century!Finally, I overcame internet-info-overload and picked this razor (Solimo 5 blade).  It arrived and I found myself comparing it closely to the Gillette - STILL due to the online discussions.  I'd say the docking mechanism on the Gillette seems stronger (although I don't normally engage in Fencing with my razor, no matter the make), and the back of the Gillett cartridge doesn't have the additional horizontal support that the Solimo does (which then catches some additional debris - but, I just don't take out my unsightly razor and show it off to guests anyway so ... meh).Shaving ... IT SHAVES!  Like ... a RAZOR!!! I got a few tiny pinpoint knicks by my lip the first time or 2 because it's not identical to the Gillete I was used to, but by use 4 or so, I don't notice any big difference to shaving with my Gillette. And I've been shaving my head, neck, and face with this thing (meaning the same, 1st cartridge) for over 5 weeks now.Also, I hang the thing in my shower.  I don't rub it on fancy pads.  I don't blow it out, fluff it, polish it, sing to it, or coddle it in anyway.  I grab this servile hunk of plastic, thrust it under the water and start unceremoniously scrubbing my many areas of skin with it in generally rough and crude fashion until I am slick and smooth as the day I was born and then rinse off, towel off and start putting out all the proverbial fires that my 4 young kids have started up while I dared take 5 minutes in the shower.Seriously, my process is: wash the body; rub Lever 2000 soap suds on head, neck and face; grab razor hanging on shower wall and stick under water; drag that thing unjudiciously this way and that way with and accross the hair grain on my head; finish head with reapeated little scrubbing actions (like rubbing adhesive off a table with your finger tip) against the hair grain to get the skin really smooth; repeat all of this with the face; judicious and sensible force and motion on my neck - come on now, I'm not a beast.And that's it.  And after more than 5 weeks of this I was still getting ... o.k. results with my very first Solimo cartridge. BUT, being so cheap I ended up switching out to a new one today because there's no reason not to.  The new blades didn't nick me once - so, I've adjusted my technique.  I noticed the greater efficiency with the new blade, but my gosh, seriously this has got to be number 47,953 in importance out of the top 45,000 important things in my life.So, now that I've finished my journey down this rabbit hole, my conclusion is the Solimo is fine (as are most other shaving products, likely) and the shave-culture is a panty-waisted thing.  Just one beast's opinion.Update 3\/3\/21:  It's been a couple of years now and I'm still using the same system.  This is nuts, but I believe I've only changed the head 5 or 6 times (tops) in that time.  I did add one additional \"trick\" to what I do.  I keep a spent toothbrush in the shower and give the razor head a little back and forth scrub before I shave and once during the shave (usually when I'm finished with my head and move to my neck, then face).  Otherwise, every single thing I said above remains my experience.  My wife even converted on those sweet, smooth, soft legs of hers and I'm fine with Solimo's results there too (and, let's be honest, if I'm not going into the office, or before a judge, the smoothness of her legs is FAR more important to me than that of my noggin', neck, or mug).

I have a heritage that is fairly conducive to hair growth \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 in other words I'm a hairy guy and my facial hair grows really rapidly and started growing in when I was quite young, 12 years old or so. So I've been shaving for a very very long time and I've used just about every product I have encountered.Gillette has always been my favorite in terms of comfort and durability, but the price is absolutely ridiculous. It's criminal actually.I switched to Dorco blades about a decade ago and they serve me really well. Dorco provides or at least used to provide blades for a lot of well-known brands and you could get those blades direct from Dorco for quite some time, which I did. The quality and price were unbeatable. Couple years ago that changed, I think they changed their business model and stopped offering DTC (direct to consumer) sales or at least made a very challenging to find how to order directly.Anyway that led me to try in a whole crop of new blade brands and most were failures or at least not what I was looking for. Many of them had really dramatic changes to the blade angles or the spacing and that caused all sorts of issues for me and the way I shave, so I continued on the quest to find something comfortable. I really ended up liking a few different blades the Creamo brand was one that I really liked. Harry's was decent, but it really forced me to change my shaving style too much and if I went back to muscle memory you can forget about the skin on my face I was all torn up.I haven't had a ton of success with Amazon branded products, but the price was right on these blades and they looked similar to Gillette so I thought I'd give him a try. Turns out this is my new favorite blade. I have tons and tons of other blades to get through. Probably 2 years worth, but I don't know that I'll ever get through those other blades cuz I keep replacing them with new Amazon blades.Anyway this topic might not be interesting to some, but if you do shave and you are particular about how you shave and you're looking for a disposable rather than straight razor or safety razor or something, these are definitely worth giving a try in my opinion.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699574400000}

However, when it comes to comparing it with some of the higher-end Gillette razors I've used in the past, it falls a bit short in terms of shaving performance.On the positive side, this razor offers an excellent bang for your buck. The five blades provide a close shave, and I appreciate that it comes with multiple cartridges in the package. The handle is comfortable to hold and has a solid grip, making it easy to maneuver during shaving.Where this razor doesn't quite match up to the more premium options is in the overall shave quality. While it does get the job done and leaves my skin fairly smooth, I did notice a few instances of missed hairs and the need for more than one pass in certain areas. The shave also doesn't feel as effortless and precise as some of the higher-end Gillette razors that I've tried before.If you're on a budget and looking for a practical razor that gets the job done without breaking the bank, this 5-blade razor is definitely worth considering. However, if you prioritize an exceptionally smooth and effortless shave, you might find that some of the pricier options from Gillette offer a more superior shaving experience.In conclusion, the 5-blade razor offers great value for its price, but it may not match up to the shaving prowess of some higher-end Gillette models. It's a decent option for everyday use, especially if you're looking to save some money, but keep in mind that there are trade-offs in terms of shaving performance.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"46 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692489600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good razor blades. However, they could be much better!!!","reviewDescription":"I've been using Gillette razors for more than 30 years. They the only ones that, I believe, can efficiently give me a close shave. I've tried many other brands and have been mostly disappointed.When I saw these Amazon brand of razor blades (Solimo), and given their price, I immediately wanted to give them a try. I ordered them.Unlike Harry's razor, the Solimo razor doesn't look and feel cheap. The handle is not as bulky as that of some other brands. In fact, it is only slightly larger than that of the Gillette Fusion. The blades are sharp. However, achieving a close shave with them, such as with those of the Gillette Fusion Gillette Fusion, is difficult. In my opinion, it is because of the design of the cartridge ... This can be improved as described in the following suggestions:1) The Solimo cartridge is about 3 mm larger than the Gillette Fusion's. This extra width is due to the relatively large lubricating strip on the front and the bulky \"protective\" guard strip on the back. They could be slimmed down.2) The metallic protective guards on the side of the cartridge are about 1\/3 of a mm higher from the blades on the Solimo than on the Gillette Fusion.3) The angle of vertical rotation of the handle over the cartridge is about 65 degree on the Solimo, while it's about 80 degree on the Gillette Fusion. This is, IMO, an easy fix by partly shaving off the three stoppers (two on the side and one in the middle) on the Solimo cartridge.I believe that if these three issues are taken care of as I suggest, these Solimo razor blades could come close to producing a shave as close as that of the Gillette Fusion. At this point, they deserve 3 stars.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1633392000000}

That said, I can tell immediately when the quality of a blade drops to the point of needing to be replaced, otherwise, razor burns and ingrown hairs result.As for these razor blades, they are great at first use and okay at second use, then immediately the quality of the blades are reduced to subpar  compared to DSC and Gillette.All in all, I would recommend these razor blades for only the people who do not have sensitive skin.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1682726400000}

{"reviewTitle":"By far the worst razor I've tried in a long time.  Painful and bad shave on a graying beard.","reviewDescription":"I had used a Bic Sensitive single blade for as long as I can remember.  With more and more gray in my beard, I was only getting a handful of shaves before they were butter knife contenders and the shave took forever needing to go over my face a few times.I picked up a Harry's set from the local big box, these and a Schick Hydro Skin Comfort Sensitive set from here.  I've tried all 3 with both Edge and Harry's shave creams. I've tried all 3 for several months and after a final try with the Solimo today, I threw the remaining full refill pack and shaver in the trash after the photo.These are by far the worst of the 3.  With over the weekend growth the Solimo are so grabby and painful it almost brings tears to my eyes. Overnight grown is still quite painful and the shave is the same as a dull blade with the former Bic sensitives.  The edger is absolutely abhorrent and clearly designed by someone who has no mustache growth, nicking the inside of my nose several times when using the shaver side and pulls horribly when trying to clean up the sides. The swiveling head seems like it would be good, but functionally it's pretty worthless. I've tried new blades for each side of the face as well as tried to shave with 1 blade for a week to no avail, these are absolutely horrible.Schick hydro sensitive are decent.  They are a tad grabby on a Monday morning shave, but not bad on a single day growth.  There isn't an edger which isn't a deal breaker for me.  The shave is pretty good, about the same as I was achieving with the Bic Sensitive single blade but with much less effort.  The flex mechanism is ok, but not great under my chin. The blade life if pretty good, easily getting 1 week out of them but they peter out on trying for a second. They are still a little pricey comparatively but had I only tried these and the Solimo, the Schick are absolutely superior.Finally Harry's,  I was very hesitant to try another modern multi blade but the big box store had a great price so I gave it a shot.  On a Monday morning shave they are a little bit grabby, but less than the Schick.  T-Th they don't grab at all giving me a lighting fast and painless shave.  The shave is better than I've had since I barely had peach fuzz and had to shave in the Navy.  The edger is great leaving the sideburns even without any grabbing.  They Harry's blades give a great shave for the first week and still superior to the Schick or the former Bic until about the 9th day shaving but I push through to get 2 weeks out of them.TLDR:  These are awful on a graying beard.

{"reviewTitle":"For painful knicks and cuts, subpar shaving, short lifespan.","reviewDescription":"I tried this when I was living at a hotel for training for a month. I went through two of the packs of blades, PACKS, not heads. Ten heads.To be fair to most razors, I have a brain surgery scar that wraps from the side of my head down and around the back of my ear. It's just over a year old and has some uhm, topography to it, so I'm giving it more points for that difficulty than it deserves.This is a heavy, well built handle. It has a swivel of some sort, a ball like construction that seems to only serve to make it look like it's going to work around the contours of my head and face. It does not. It can't conform to anything at all and seems more rigid than even solid headed disposables.In fact, I think that's the point here. Someone, somewhere strapped five of the lowest quality blades to the least useful grooming\/moisturizing head, put a ball like thing on it to look like it might have some swivel and passed off their schlock to Amazon, who, being in Seattle, Washington believe that beards are to be grown and never shaved.Short version, this is a multi bladed, swivel headed razor that chopped the crap out of my head and face while at the same time achieving a 50\/50 ratio of shaving to epilation. Any kind of topographical changes in the shaving motion brings swift punishment, which is amazing considering how poorly the blades cut hair, they're absolutely up to the task of cutting skin. If for some reason you've grown tired of the luxury of skipping a day or two of shaving with other multibladed, swivel razors... or perhaps just LOVE shaving every single day, AND have a flat, single surface to shave AND have body\/facial hair that is very fine, thin and yanks out as easily as it shaves off, then this is perfect for you.Otherwise, this thing feels and acts like a single bladed rigid plastic razor they'd give you while you're in observation at the psych ward. The only thing missing is a tired charge nurse watching your every move while you stand in the shower, awkward, naked, bleeding and clearly questioning whether or not you REALLY need to be worried about shaving right now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657152000000}

Below are my observations with the Amazon blades compared to the others:*  The blades are not as sharp as the others I mentioned.  They just don't cut as well.*  The gap between the first blade and the top of the razor is too large.  It makes it challenging to trim below your nose.  I kept leaving hair right below my nose because you have to push your nose up to reach.*  Part of the reason the gap is so large is because it has the extra lubricant on the blade.  It was nice, but actually a little excessive.  When I would get in the shower to shave the lubricant would be \"foaming\" off that top part.  Make it smaller and you won't need so much lubricant.*  The blades are hard to get on the handle.  The other brands are just an easy click.  I have to work hard to get the handle on these blades.I would not recommend these blades unless you are just looking to save money.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1623888000000}

I say reluctant because, let's face it, $13 is the cheapest you pay for 4 cartridges?! Ouch!! But every time I tried something cheaper I was let down, so, reluctantly, I stuck with GV. I'm happy to report I'm officially a convert!!My husband is a firefighter and he likes his head shaved down to practically below the pores. It's common to use 2-3 cartridges for his head alone. I'm what you'd call a lazy shaver - I procrastinate so long that by the time I actually do shave, you could fashion together a faux taxidermied hamster with all the hair I shave off my body. Usually one cartridge will suffice for my shaving, but needless to say that one cartridge doesn't last much longer than 2 sessions. So between my husband and I, we go through a 4 pack of cartridges every couple weeks, about $26\/month; that turns into over $300 a YEAR!!! \ud83d\ude33I've now used both the men's Solimo razor and the women's twice, one on each leg and armpit, as well as the women's on my...ahem...Nether Regions. Both times have given me super smooth shaves, zero cuts, no razor burn or irritation, and I haven't missed any spots. I've posted pictures with the Venus in the middle to compare sizes, shapes and looks, and one shows how the cartridges attach (as stated in the details, the Solimo cartridges do not attach to the Venus handles). I'll list my pros and cons for both, as follows.Women's pros:- love the handle, it's hard to lose your grip on it- LOTS of vitamin E moisturizing lubricant, versus the single strip GV has- kind to the *lady parts* with no irritation- super smooth shave- easy to replace cartridges- comes with a suction cup shower hangerWomen's cons:- the vitamin E gets super slippery at first use; after that it calms down- cartridge head is significantly larger than the GV I've been using, it will take some getting used toMen's pros:- solid handle, even feels heavy- nice smooth, clean shave- pivoting head as shown in pictures- sleek metallic look- also easy to replace cartridgesMen's cons:- handle is heavier toward the cartridge, almost makes it awkward to use- not as much lubricationAll in all I'm so pleased with both of these razors, and am looking forward to paying an entire third of what I've been paying for Gillette Venus razors.

I have a super odd kind of skin that is very hard to shave. I have tried straight razors to safety razors in the metal thing that screws into a base. I have tried super expensive kinds that only end up being worse than the cheap variations. While i do find certain razors that work, they always end up being a rip off. For example, i can buy a super expensive kind that has those disposable ends that are like half a hundred dollars for a weeks supply but the longevity of the blades never last. They may give a great initial first or second shave but end up dulling out just like any other one.Finally i can rest easy knowing i have found something that works. Amazons own brand Solimo has delivers the goods again for me with a razors set that not only can handle my skin type but comes in a hooked up pack. I forget exactly how many are in there but it think it is close to thirty. Regardless of the exact count it has bypassed anything out there in relation to value and quality.The main razor that accept the disposable ends is made sturdy and can handle being dropped on the ground and exposed to water constantly.I would of been happy with two or three blades but you get five.

{"reviewTitle":"Unfortunatly the worst razor Ive ever used..","reviewDescription":"Now before people start assuming Im some shaving elitist, Im not. I use the same canned shaving cream\/gel Ive used for years through numerous different brand razors, gillete fusion\/ dorco \/ dollar shave club\/ and even disposable cheap 3 and 2 blade ones. I was just previously on the dorco 4-blade razor but because it was missing the trimmer blade which is on the gilletes for under the nose, I was looking for a cost efficient alternative. I gave this a shot because it had a trimmer , 5 blades, and was extremely economical with a heavy duty handle and 16 blades for just around $20 in a bundle.Ill just get right into it. I just had my first shave with this at the usual interval and I was extremely disappointed. Im not someone who is a diehard perfectionist in this aspect but even the cheap disposable razors Ive used have been more efficient. This blade clogged really quickly even though it advertises \"anti clog\" features, I presume theyre talking about having spacing so water can go through it. I had just about everything stick there besides water and had to carefully declog it using my nail and hope I didnt cut myself in the process. The lubricating strip is ridiculously lubricating to the point it leaves a gel like layer that I had to wash off my face after. I could see it sticking to my face and pulling when I moved the blade away (think of when you touch glue how it tries to hang from your finger and the surface). Then for the 3rd strike, the trimmer blade is constructed and implement in the worst form possible that I was unable to get the edge of under my nose area. While attempting to use the trimmer there you get a lovely layer of gel from the strip which is too close to the trimmer blade so your basically smudging the lubricating substance on your nose constantly. Finally at the end I actually ended up with razor burn which was a first. I have not had razorburn for at least 15 years and was ultimately regretting my purchase.These are cheap and economical but I cant see these lasting long considering how bad its clogging with skin\/hair\/lubricating strip gel.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1547683200000}

I was excited to try this Solimo razor and cartridge, thinking I'd save some money on cartridges going forward. On its first use, it pulled like the blades were dull. I gave it a chance, lathered again, and it did a slightly better job. But when I'd done half my face, I became impatient, used the old Fusion and got a superior shave.I repeated this, again with reasonable expectations. I didn't expect it to be as good as the Fusion--though I hoped for that, and my mind was open to it. Again, I used that old Fusion razor to finish the job (the Fusion now had been used for four shaves before this one). It was stunning to me that this was again the result. I changed the Solimo cartridge (a second new one), repeated this process again. And again, the Fusion, on shave number five, did a better job.It would have been great, but I won't order again. I don't have a particularly coarse beard, either, so I can't blame anything but the quality and sharpness of the blades. I'd hoped for \"half as good\" and wound up with a fraction of that.

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty good razor and blades for the price","reviewDescription":"What matters in buying a razor - 1) Quality of the shave.  I haven't found a razor better than Gillette that give a close, smooth shave.  These Amazon Basic blades do a pretty good job, but I suspect that those who have a burly beard (I don't) will be disappointed in their shave.  2) Price. Gillette charges an excessive price for their blades. Not worth the cost for me.  These are very reasonably priced. 3) How long the blades stay sharp.  So far I've found these to be rather inconsistent in how long they last. But on a whole have lasted about as long as I would expect from a blade.  4) Mechanism for mounting the blades on the razor.  The blades easily mount on the Amazon Basic razor handle.  I had another off-brand razor that I tried and within a few months the mounting mechanism would break down and I'd have to buy a new razor handle.  Hopefully this one holds up.  So far, no problems.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701734400000}

The system for switching out razors via the clip system isn't intuitive and I found myself struggling to \"lock on\" so I could start a shave with a new blade.Gillette razors (Fusion 5) have a better weighted\/balanced handle, hold a sharp edge longer, blade changes are seamless and intuitive, and produce a clean shave whether you're in a hurry or are taking your time.

{"reviewTitle":"Not the best money can buy, but a lot of value for the money!","reviewDescription":"Okay, I\u2019ll be the first to admit it, I am old school when it comes to razors.  I learned to shave with a Twin Trac.  I hated shaving and grew a lot of facial hair over the years.  I tried a lot of different electric razors, then went back to the wet shave twin blades several years ago. I can get a decently comfortable and close shave with a twin blade provided I don\u2019t  get in a hurry and keep a steady technique and do everything right.  I was pretty happy with the twin blade.  I\u2019d tried the 3, 4, and 5 blade razors and thought they gave a nice shave but was unwilling to pay the price for the replacement cartridges.  Several months ago, I bought a 5 blade Bic Us razor handle with 2 cartridges for a promotional price.  I was very impressed with the ease of use and quality of shave with the razor.  The cartridges lasted a long time and did not clog up or dull.  I used one cartridge shaving every day for over 2 months.  However, when I went to buy replacement cartridges, they were $10 for 4.  Not terribly unreasonable for quality 5 blade razor cartridges but not dirt cheap either.  I had made up my mind to buy some when I saw this Amazon private label razor handle with 16 cartridges for only a couple dollars more than the 4 cartridge pack for the Bic.  The cartridges are almost identical -  5 blade, lubrication, and top trimmer blade.  The Amazon-branded Solum is about 1\/4 of the price.  Unfortunately the cartridges only work with this particular brand of razor handle.  I like the Bic a little better because the handle is heavier and has a better grip.  It seems like it shaves a little better, too.  Not 4 times better, though.  I\u2019m very happy with the Solimo.  The 16 cartridges will easily last me a year and a half to two years.  I don\u2019t know how it compares to the Harry\u2019s or Dollar Shave Club razors.  It compares favorably with the Shick Hydro 5 and the Bic Us.  I feel that it is not quite as good as the premium brands but is ver close.  I haven\u2019t seen anything of comparable quality even close to this price point.  If you are needing a quality wet shave razor and are strapped for cash or just looking for a bargain. I would recommend you give the Solimo handle and cartridge set a try.

It's that good.Solimo then. What did I love about it. The packaging. You know that kind of fully wrapped packaging where you have to cut through it with a knife, or scissors? None of that here. Just tear the paper back off. Thank You!The handle. There's a nice thickness comparable to Gillette but with extra grip near the top of the razor, at the side of the ball thingy. I don't know who holds it that high up, but it is a nice grip. Someone might use that.Then there's the bit that matters. The razor. 5 blades, dual strip. Close comfortable shave and it doesn't feel like shaving while the blade glides across your skin. Win! As close to being like Gillette as anyone can be.The slight, ever so slight down side. You know that extra blade at the top? The one you can use for trimming. Well, it doesn't have that. I don't know if you will miss it, but depending on the contours of your face, there might be some hard to get at areas. Such as right under your nose. There's a trade off here because LOOK HOW CHEAP THESE BLADES ARE!!!That's my first impression. I'm going to have to use it a while longer. The tragic downfall of Gillette is those blades don't last long at all for how much we pay. Will update this review when it starts to get scratchy.Three weeks is the answer then. That is how long it took for this to get scratchy, where I want to change the blade. My lasting impression is that I am missing that blade on the top, for trimming.

{"reviewTitle":"As Good or Better Than...","reviewDescription":"First impressions - this razor set could very well replace all the others I've used over the years. Got a good, close shave (in the shower) to remove two days worth of stubble and was pleasantly surprised. I shave in the shower to soften the stubble and use the powerful shower stream to clean the blades several times to prevent clogging - I'm a bit OCD like that. I make sure the blades are clean when finished and tell myself I'm prolonging the life of the blades just a little. Let's face it - good blades are expensive, but these appear to be a good value for the $$ compared to the more expensive name brands.I've tried them all - cheap disposable plastic razors, the pricey Gillette Fusion blades, and everything in between to include electric shavers. The handle has good heft and is ergonomic, the blades attach and detach easily. With a large supply of extra blades included with this order I can shave regularly and not worry so much about the cost per blade. For me, that's a win-win. I'll update this review after a period of time if any changes in my initial impressions are off-base, but first impressions count for something.

Entirely GROSS!3} I have a pretty tough beard, but Gillette always dealt with efficiently. The Solimo blade required much more work, much harder work, to achieve less even results, and was harsh on my skin.4) The trimmer blade on the back of the top has a comb-like cover that, along with too close a set to the blade, making it useless.5) The blades was too dull to use after 4 shaves.

I took a chance on the Solimo MotionSphere Razor and was extremely disappointed.  This is a case of you get what you pay for, and the Gillette blades cut better on curved parts of your face and under your nose.The Good: On the fairly flat, open areas of your face (cheeks, neck) these perform well.The Bad: Shaving around your mouth, chin, and upper lip is kind of terrible, requiring many passes to get most of the offending stubble.  The shaving head is larger than a Fusion, making it difficult to get into position to shave the upper lip.  It's only a few millimeters bigger in all 3 dimensions, but it really hinders the ability to get everywhere.The Ugly:  The trimmer on the back used for trimming under the nose\/sideburns is some sort of Hell-Rasp.  It completely fails to trim the hair, but somehow manages to scrape your skin raw.I'd love to try it again if they can evolve the design to deal with the above shortcomings while keeping at a similar price point.

{"reviewTitle":"Competitive with name brands, but...","reviewDescription":"Let's face it. The benchmark for all cartridges is always the two top brands costing $4-5 per cart. There is a reason for that; they perform better than the rest. I've used just about every alternative to the top brands. Saving a little money is rarely worth it, but the Solimo will save you much more, which makes these a compelling alternative. The handle is very good; as good as any other. That is unless you still prefer a power feature that is unavailable on the Solimo. I like how it feels and the movement of the head.The bottom line is always how does it shave? The cart shaves just as close as any I have ever used. The slight trade-off is that it is not quite as smooth. More directly, the shave is more on the aggressive side. Not so much so that it is uncomfortable, but I had to get used to it. I'm ok with it now.Closeness, not a problem. Shaves very close, as well as the big brands.I still haven't figured out how many shaves is optimal, but I can get at 5-7 shaves so far. I haven't pushed it further because there is no need to at this price point.Putting it all together - These are competitive, perhaps not quite as comfortable, but completely acceptable, combined with the low price point make these blades a solid contender. Of course, everyone is different. These blades are surely worth a try.I have used both 3 blade and 5 blade. I like the efficiency of the 5 blade a bit better, but they both work similarly. Pick your favorite and go.In the end, I think these blades overall are a solid #3 compared to the top two brands. Better than all of the other less expensive alternatives out there.  At 1\/4 of the price, it's pretty easy to use these blades as your number 1.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1611964800000}

Much flatter than any other razor I've used in my 40+ years of shaving. I can do my head fairly well though I have to go at a couple spots more than once but I experience that with every razor. The one spot I really have trouble with is my left cheek and neck. I've got some arthritis issues in my elbows and getting my arm to bend the right way to shave there is painful and takes some effort.I can usually get 6 or 7 head and face shaves before the blades start to dull. This says these have lubricating strips but they don't seem to dissolve or wear away like others do.

What I mean by very average is that it's not one of the closest shaves I've had but it gets the job done.If you're used to higher-end razors, you will certainly notice the difference, but what did you expect at around $1\/cartridge?My biggest gripe about these, however, is that the precision trimmer on the back of the blade is terrible. I have a full beard and use the precision trimmer extensively to clean up my cheeks and edges but on these cartridges, the blade felt as if it was extremely dull. It left my skin around the edges and my cheeks very irritated and overall did not do a good job getting close.PROS- Insanely good price for the blades- Included handle has some weight to it and feels like other top brands- Hair cleans easily from between the blades and does not clog- Provides an acceptable shave (not the closest but still a close shave)CONS- Precision trimmer is practically useless- Vitamin E strip is very \"gooey\" at the beginning- Cartridges only work with their handle (although, as mentioned above, the handle is not bad)- Cartridges are kind of large compared to the space the blades take up which makes it harder to be accurateBottom line is, these are great for the price and I would recommend them to most guys.

Hate their pricing, hate their longevity (2-3 full leg shaves if I go more than 2 days between, though last a while if I use them for face or underarm), hate the monopoly they seem to have over the razor industry. And I love what Amazon is doing, trying to disrupt that and offer an alternative at a much lower price per razor. However, for me, these just are not there yet. Their longevity is noticeably worse, and I ended up using them essentially as fancy disposables. They dulled very quickly, which really hurts on my inner\/back of thigh areas, so I had to swap almost every other shave. Really wanted to like them, but unfortunately I'll be going back to Gillette until I can try out Leaf. A last little annoyance, which I could have absolutely stomached for the price, if they lasted enough - the razor heads are much more difficult to get on the handle than other brands, and very difficult to take out on their own without the handle.

I have medium stubble, so if you have a thick stiff beard my results will be different for you. Switched between the two in all areas. Fusion was a smoother shave. Basics was good but could feel very slight pulling. Shaved area was just as smooth. No cuts or nicks just a perception that Fusion \"felt\" better. I can't remark on longevity of the Basics compared to the Fusion which lasts well for me.I am going to keep the Basics and see how they hold up. Setting my Fusion aside for awhile until I get used to the Basics so I can redo the test. Fusion is the best blades I have used, so comparing them to the Basics isn't exactly fair considering the huge price discrepancy.. Basics are good, maybe VG, blades. Fusion blades are just grossly overpriced. The width above the top blade on the Basics is annoying under the nose as others have said. Very Poor design. You can shave under your nose, just takes bit of patience and goofy facial expressions. The back trimmer blade is more of a gimmick and not worth the extra width it makes at top of the blades.If it was just a dollar or so difference in price of 5 blades, the Basics would be returned without a second thought.

{"reviewTitle":"The Price Makes Up For Some Shortcomings","reviewDescription":"I switched from an electric to a cartridge razor about two months ago.  During that period, on the cartridge razor side, I've used the Gillette Pro Fusion 5 and the Solimo.  Here are my thoughts.Trim Blade:  Gillette wins out here significantly.  They both do the job, but the Gillette does it while giving me a feeling of safety.  When I use the Solimo, I can tell that if I'm not careful it could quite easily gouge me in a major way.  Actually, it did put a 1 inch long very thin surface cut on me once.  I've since learned how to respect it and I think I can use it safely now.  But I still consider it a disadvantage of the Solimo.  This is my most significant problem with the Solimo.Blade Longevity:  No clear winner here.  Most of the time, a Solimo cartridge gives me about the same number of shaves as a Gillette cartridge on the Gillette handle.  But one of the four Solimo cartridges I've used so far seemed to be an anomaly.  It lasted only about 4 shaves.  So quality control could be beefed up here.Maneuverability;  Gillette wins out here.  The Solimo head is wider from front to back.  Its two lubrication strips, or whatever they are are both wider than the Gillette's.  With the larger cutting head, it's not quite as easy to get into the detail spots.Comfort:  No clear winner here.  They're about the same for me.Cartridge Installation:  Gillette is the clear winner here.  Their cartridges snap right into the handle with no effort on my part.  Getting the Solimo cartridge onto the Solimo handle seems to be an obstacle course.  It often takes me several tries.  But I don't consider this to be a big problem.  It takes me an extra 15 seconds once a week.Head staying on handle:  No winner here. Some have complained that the Solimo head accidentally pops off the handle during use, or when cleaning it.  I've not seen that problem at all with either razor.Price of Cartridges: Solimo wins so big here that I feel that it more than makes up for the other areas mentioned above where it falls behind the Gillette.Summary:  While the Gillette outperforms the Solimo in a number of areas,  none of the Gillette advantages are nearly as significant as the drastically lower cost of the Solimo cartridges.  If money were no object, I'd use the Gillette.  But since my income is not infinite, the price is a very important part of the equation.Final Judgement:  I continue to use the Solimo and have let my Gillette cartridges run out.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1580774400000}

I got a \"free razor\" in the mail that included a few blades.  When I went through those I went and bought some more.  Holy cow, they are expensive!  So when I had used those up, I started to look for another options.  Those drug store twin and triple blade disposable razors should be disposed of before you use them, junk.  Found a good pack someplace about 8 years ago, but don't remember where I got them, so can not get new blades.  So finally broke down and ordered these.I am happy.  Since 2020 I don't need to shave much anymore.  I am only in an office a couple days a week, and even if I have a day or two of growth, it is OK.  And by not shaving every day, it seems to be growing slower.  So I shave 2 or maybe 3 times a week.  This razor cuts off that couple day growth, no problem.  It has a moisturizer strip which for some reason seems \"stringy.\"  When I am done with most of it and just cleaning up a few missed spots, it leaves a stringy residue.  I was thinking that strip would be gone after a couple shaves, but still there after probably 10 shaves now.  I wash my face after shaving, so that strip does not matter to me.The blades stay sharp.  I am still on the first set of blades, been a couple months now.  I usually replace them when I get my first cut, or it is pulling.  Neither is happening.Are they as good as the really expensive brands (the ones that where drug stores lock up the blades), maybe not quite as good, but certainly better than a lot of inexpensive options out there.

{"reviewTitle":"Wait, what? How?","reviewDescription":"I have used nearly every brand of safety razor that has any adoption. I have used Schick, Gillette - the Mach 3, the ProGlide, the Fusion ProGlide, the Sensor3, the Quattro, the Hydro. I've used online services like Harry's and Dollar Shave Club. I've used multiple straight razors and bled - bled like a stuck pick, because while I have sensitive skin, I am also really bad at shaving with a standard razor, because I suck at being manly and tough. That's a joke, I just don't know how to use striaght razors, I considered \"only cutting myself six times\" to be a success. And yes. I did use them for six months. And man, did people think I joined a fight club. A fight club with knives.I have sensitive skin. Razor burn isn't a possibility, it's a guarantee. It's going to happen, it's just a question of \"how bad?\" I have seborrheic dermatitis, a semi-mild form, so I have to use very specific soaps on my face, and just generally have to take special care of my face. The razor burn makes me not want to shave, but taking more time between shaves also means the razor burn gets worse. It's a terribly not-too-serious case of \"ugh, ow and gross.\"I have a 14 month-old cat. He's still very kitten-y. He has manic energy, and a tendency to find new ways to make trouble. So, after my recent refill of my Harry's order of 16 cartridges, he knocked my Harry's handle on the bathroom floor, un-sealing the adhesive between the handle and the cartridge mechanism. Well, great. I can spend $15 on the handle, or i can.. not do that. I decided, \"well, crap, Amazon's home brand has a new system for about the same price for a new handle AND 16 cartridges.\"I've waited several days, to maximize the crappy discomfort of razor burn, and am.. surprised. There is burn, to be clear. There is redness. But nowhere near as severe as I'd expect. And it didn't eat through an entire cartridge - or two. Harry's cartridges are inexpensive, but flimsy in that they are easily overwhelmed if you don't shave daily. Or every other day. I work from home semi-permanently (thanks, Covid), so I don't need to shave every day. Harry's razors do not handle that well at all.I have to believe Amazon must be selling these at a loss. The cartridges are, somehow, good quality. They aren't easily overwhelmed by long stretches of not shaving (I expect you CAN, if you go weeks), they're firm but flexible, the gel strip is not decorative - it has a purpose, and it does what you expect (.. Harry's, take note). You can easily go with the grain or against the grain (with so many breaks between shaves, I like a very smooth shave) and not feel like you're risking your face (DSC, Harry's). It's surprising.I'll stick around. This was meant to just give Amazon a fair shot, but it turns out a fair shot makes me wonder why I paid nearly triple ($33 for 12) in the past for Fusion5 cartridges.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"42 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1597708800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Easily Replaces other inferior 5-Blade Razors. Excellent Razor.","reviewDescription":"I was ready to try something different by the time I ran across this Amazon Solimo Razor.I had purchased Dorco\u2019s 6-Blade razor with enough cartridges in 2015 to last until late 2019. (They were on a huge sale at the time.)Since then, I think Dorco has moved to selling on Amazon and I didn\u2019t like the prices this time around.After 4 years of using the same razor and brand, I wanted to see what else was out there.I\u2019ve done the major brands and frankly haven\u2019t been happy with the results.I usually let my facial hair grow out for a few weeks until I look scruffy and then shave.I really hate to shave. I hate it even more when the blades cut me or pull the hairs.Now that you have some background, let me give you what you came to read.The Solimo is an excellent 5-blade razor for the money. I didn\u2019t get a single cut, and I shaved when the hairs were over a 1\/4 inch long. The blades didn\u2019t clog. The open back design minimized the plastic ribbing that holds the blades in place and hold the cartridge to the handle, leaving plenty of open space to flush the hairs out with running water. Speaking of water, my sinks use a farmhouse style faucet where the water runs down a long trough and rolls off the end. Not exactly good water pressure for rinsing out a razor, and yet surprisingly, because of the great design of this cartridge, it rinsed the Solimo cartridge out completely. This was a critical pass\/fail feature for me. I had fought clogging for the past 4 years with my last razor.With my old 6-blade razor I was constantly fighting with hairs staying trapped in the cartridge between the blades and the plastic cartridge ribs. Because it stayed clogged, it took many more strokes to get all of my face and neck shaved. The cartridges usually ended up in the garbage after only one or two shaves because I couldn\u2019t get the hairs cleaned out of them.The Solimo still required multiple strokes because the hairs were so long this time when I shaved, but I could easily see it cutting more efficiently on a face with shorter hairs.I can\u2019t speak much about the razor\u2019s ability to conform to the curves of the face because of the cartridges ability to move left and right as well as up and down. However, as I said, I walked away cut-free despite making multiple strokes over the same areas.I was skeptical at buying the head with 16 cartridges, but when I considered that if it worked out, I would spend more actually buying those cartridges separately, buying the set made more sense. I mean, it wasn\u2019t a huge risk I was taking here. The blades just need to cut the hair off your face. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy to screw up a razor design.The head seems designed well. The cartridges snap into the head securely and I found the rubberized handle to be very grippy and offer good control of the wet handle. The quality of the handle is nice and the attention to details make it feel like a more expensive razor than it is.These cartridges are by far the cheapest cost I\u2019ve seen. I think it comes out to a little over a $1 each to buy them if my memory is correct.I would never go back to expensive razors again, but I don\u2019t want cheap junk either.Solimo makes a great razor in my opinion and I\u2019ll recommend them to anyone.I also enjoy their coffee as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1574467200000}

In the week I've been using the first set of blades, I've cut myself three times. All three required a bandage. Never had this problem with the Gilettes. Interesting because I switched from the pricy Fusions to these because big pharma raised the price of my Eliquis to $450. So, I have to economize somewhere else. A few bucks here and there, and I can buy one more Eliquis. But then I bleed easily, and I have to buy bandages. There's no winning.Any way, back to the blades. I have 15 of them, and I figure at this rate, I'll need a blood transfusion, too. They do a good job slicing through the thick meadow of old whiskers.
