Then when it\u2019s playing an ad it has an option to send a link to your phone for the product and I don\u2019t know why but that creeps me out even though it sounds like it should be convenient. We bought the Firestick to replace our Roku we broke during a move. It serves its purpose, it\u2019s a smart stick but I just feel like it\u2019s one big ad for Amazon. A Chromecast or a Roku would be a better option. We\u2019ll use it for now because we have it, but I can see myself going back to a Roku eventually. The only other complaint I have is there\u2019s no way to control volume from the Firestick remote, you have to control the volume with your tv remote or from your tv itself.

When the boys got up there was no tv. Tried everything. Even called Amazon. One person said there was nothing I could do but buy a new one. The next guy helped me but the only way one will work is if I connect it to my phones hotspot. I have Wifi, why would I want to burn up my phones data? And what if I'm not home? Plus, the other one won't work at all. I don't know what that update did, but I think it's pretty foul to put the devices that they sold me out of service. I would hope that this gets rectified.

We switched the plug out, unplugged it and replugged it back in and blow out any dust if there was any to see if it'll work... again nothing. So we switched back to the 4k one to watch on there even though we had the flashing and static. Mind you, it worked this morning. It turned on, but the controller stopped working. We did what the fire stick told us to do since the controller wasn't connecting. I quote from Space Balls, \"Even in the Future nothing works.\" Out of curiosity, we plugged the old Fire Stick in and it's working, but buffering.

{"reviewTitle":"A little tricky with my older Visio TV, but FAST!","reviewDescription":"Just upgraded to this from a first generation FireTV Stick that could no longer handle all of the software updates that Amazon has been pushing recently. I love the speed of the new stick, but almost wasted $300-400 on a new television set because of a weird compatibility issue with my older Visio TV. Problem is now solved and I'll summarize it below in case it helps anyone else.My new stick worked fine for almost a week. Then, in the middle of watching a show, my screen would start to dim and then ultimately fade out completely, leaving the audio still playing. At some point the video would come back, usually within ten minutes. Then after a while it would happen again. I first blamed the new stick, and tried rebooting it, powering off and rebooting, switching it from wi-fi to wired Ethernet connection - nothing worked. Then I switched over to my old Apple TV device just to make sure the problem wasn't my 10-year-old television. To my horror, I was getting video dropout on the Apple TV too.Before pulling the trigger on a new TV purchase, I decided to try one more time to find an answer through an internet search. Thank goodness I came across a forum post from 2014 in which someone had to disable their Vizio television's Backlight Control and Advanced Adaptive Luma settings because they were getting screen fadeouts when they hooked up their new Xbox. As soon as I disabled those two functions, my new FireTV Stick Lite started working again. I can't imagine why I didn't run into this problem the first week I was using it, and what changed that also affected my Apple TV. Will update this review if the situation changes.My only other annoyance is the Bluetooth audio connection. I have an Oontz Angle external speaker that was paired to my first-gen FireTV stick, and would automatically reconnect itself when I turned it on. My speaker easily paired with the new FireTV Stick Lite, but it won't reconnect when the stick goes to sleep and is then woken up. I have to manually unpair and re-pair it each time I watch TV. So far my browsing suggests this is because the new stick's Bluetooth audio setting may be \"off\" by default. If that's the case, I'd like to know how to change the default setting.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"76 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665446400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Amazing!","reviewDescription":"I bought one of the first smart tvs, and now find that much of the content on the many streaming services I pay for cannot be \u201cviewed on this device\u201d. I assumed I would have to invest in a new smart tv, which I was reluctant to do. Our electronics have become \u2018use and toss\u2019 due to constant upgrades. I\u2019d heard for years about Roku and then Fire stick, but didn\u2019t really understand what it was all about. Luckily I found an article and after reading decided to give the Firestick a try, since if it didn\u2019t work, I wouldn\u2019t be out much. I am happy to report I can now watch everything. It\u2019s truly amazing! With just this little low cost attachment, my tv is new again. I am thrilled! I even bought a Roku for my other tv to see which one works best. Each has different pluses and minuses. Regarding the Firestick, I love the remote. It is small and slim and fits in my hand and easy to use. Love the big button. I like the on screen layout as well, but strangely, it doesn\u2019t always work quite right. Now and then a show I am currently watching will not show up when I select the service. For instance, every time I want to watch an episode of \u201c1923\u201d I have to search for it, rather than it appearing under \u201cContinue Watching.\u201d Other than that, it works great. Another plus for this particular package, is it came with an HDMI extender, which is handy, since the sticks themselves can be about 3.5 inches long, if your HDMI is in a tight place you will need one. The Roku cost more and did not include an extender.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"38 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675382400000}

It has more storage, however, the (HDR)high dynamic range does not work while watching Netflix or Hulu, etc. This version seems to be a step backwards in terms of picture quality... It's disappointingthat Amazon releases these new devices with so much haste and without ensuring the quality of them. Not worth the $59.00 I paid for this firestick.

This has been happening for over three weeks channels and I tried deleting data and cache, and even totally uninstalling\/reinstalling the Pluto app without success in restoring all the channels. So six times, I called Amazon support, oh what a waste of 5+ hrs of my time. The biggest issue was finding someone that could understand English enough to craps the issue. Then my not being able to understand them. WOW.  Six calls and not one was close to being fluent in English. But one of them was very fluent in Hindi (or some Indian language) and on two occasions started speaking in it. I could deal with it if this fixed the issue, but not even close. One tier 2 support said that he was opening a support ticket with the developers and it would be fixed in 24 days. That was 9 days ago. After I called the sixth time, Amazon said that they would replace the two FireTV sticks. Got the replacements in today, and guess what? Exact  issue with the news ones. So Googled the issue and see notes from December 21, 2019 (3 years ago) with the EXACT same issue and still no respo0nce from Amazon.

It's just a pain to have to do that every time, since you have to type in one letter at a time using the remote control. It's just very klunky and annoying. Would it be possible for Prime to boost your paid subscriptions to the home screen, say at the top of the screen next to the \"Continue Watching\" list? Or just someplace obvious and super easy to find.  Thanks in advance.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1670716800000}

It had gotten so slow, I simply prefered not using my TV at all. To my regret, the new Firestick is almost as agonizingly slow, jittery, and laggy as the old one. I'm constantly tapping two or three times because I don't see a response to the first tap. The actual animations on the main page, loading screens, menus, etc lag like they're on a slow computer. When exiting an app playing a video, the sound will continue playing in the background for several seconds until it catches up.This is not an internet speed issue. My internet is fast, and once a movie is on, it plays smoothly without issue on most apps.

{"reviewTitle":"Missing a key feature","reviewDescription":"I bought a Fire TV stick Lite to replace a Sony streaming DVD player after finally getting fed up with the Sony's unreliable operation.I found the Fire stick's setup, operation, and performance to be very good, and am happy with those.  I did not plug it into my TV, but into my AV receiver, which allows me switch between audio\/video sources, and provides greater control of the audio.However, I gave the Fire TV stick 3 stars because there is no way to turn it off other than removing power.  Who wants to get up, walk over to the equipment and reach behind to pull the plug when you want to turn it off?Now the Fire TV stick may operate acceptably if plugged directly into a TV's HDMI port; I don't know, I have not tried that.  But in doing so one looses the superior sound quality of playing it through a good AV receiver.  And my particular issue with not being able to turn the Fire TV stick off is that the AV receiver continues to switch back to the HDMI port the Fire TV is plugged into whenever I select a different source, including Bluetooth.  I'll admit that this could be an issue with my particular AV receiver (a Yamaha), but I have never experienced this issue with any other source, so I'm pretty sure it is the Fire TV stick.Putting the Fire TV stick \"to sleep\" does not help this issue, BTW.  So Amazon, if you're listening, add a power button to future models of Fire TV sticks.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646438400000}

{"reviewTitle":"I hate it","reviewDescription":"I was forced to get a new fire stick since my old one just kept loading over and over without ever filling turning on, and my back up just kept updating Netflix and never opened it. The \"discount\" I got for having to get a new one was $3 and entirely not work the pain of contacting customer support. I have to contact them a third time to get it applied since the first person didn't do it correctly and the second couldn't fix it. All this and I now don't have volume control like my old remote. I refuse to spend ten extra dollars for the volume buttons when I didn't want a new fire stick to begin with. It's bs we have to pay to replace one when it's clearing a malfunction caused by Amazon.Update: this is trash. Don't get it. It doesn't have room to add even two apps and you can't delete the 20 Amazon apps to make more space to update apps.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675900800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Bought for projector","reviewDescription":"We have Apple TVs in our household, and it was cumbersome unplugging one of them any time we wanted to use our projector. This fire stick is super handy and convenient for the price. Black Friday brought the price to $18, so definitely worth it.

{"reviewTitle":"Makes any TV smart.  HDMI & WiFi required","reviewDescription":"I purchased this basic Fire TV model 6 months ago.  Set up was very easy, within 10 minutes I had access to all of my streaming content via the TV.  My flatscreen is about 11 years old bottom on the line, but I had no problems at all with using the fire stick.Customization of the Home Screen was easy, and I am impressed by the range of streaming media sources you can add.  Of course a subscription service streaming still requires that you have the subscription.It is alexa enabled and you can also use a remote interface on your smartphone.  I opted not to get that fancy though and just use the basic remote.As long as you have WiFi and a television with a HDMI port, you can use the fire stick to make it smart and top of the line.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703635200000}
