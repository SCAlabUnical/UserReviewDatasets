{"reviewTitle":"It was great--for about an hour","reviewDescription":"Got this vac to replace a 20-year-old Dirt Devil that I use upstairs so I don't have to drag my big, heavy vac up and down the stairs.  It came over the weekend and I didn't have a chance to try it out until today. I have a greyhound and four cats, two of which are long haired.  It is quite maneuverable, relatively light weight--just what I need.  I was very impressed with its ability to pick up the animal hair.  My bedroom rug now looks terrific.  But as I moved into the hall to vacuum, I noticed it was no longer picking up the fur.  On closer examination I realized the brush bar was no longer turning...the belt has apparently snapped.  My rugs are not high pile and I had had no trouble pushing the vac.  I put the box out with the trash this morning, so I no longer have the box in which to return it.  I guess I'll order a new belt and see if I can put it in myself.  Meanwhile, other rooms upstairs continue to accumulate pet hair until I can get this thing back in working order.

{"reviewTitle":"VERY cheap, NOT worth it.","reviewDescription":"I needed a replacement vacuum so badly (ours had been broken for more than week, and we have dogs), so I was so excited to get this new one after reading many positive reviews.  It was easy to assemble and the suction was good enough upon using it the first time - but unfortunately we found that if the very small container gets even 1\/4 full, large clumps of hair get caught and wrapped around the filter mechanism at the top, and there is absolutely no way to empty the cannister without having to reach inside and pry all of the dirt and hair out.  It's dirty, messy, and the dust is literally making me sick from being all over me each every time I need to clean\/vacuum.  I can't finish even half of a room without having to empty it 3 or 4 times - just to be sure I can dump the dirt out without touching it.  Hair gets wound around the brush very easily as well (although this I had expected), and after each use we have to cut\/pull it from the brush mechanism.  I absolutely dread vacuuming now - when in the past it was one of my favorite chores.  For such a great price and with so many good reviews I had a lot of hope for this one, but it is most definitely very low quality and not a good buy.

I am a seasoned vacuum belt replacer, and I was worried that using a leverage tool to help get the roller brush back in place would damage the belt pin.

{"reviewTitle":"This Vacuum Really Sucks!","reviewDescription":"We had a 20-yearold Eureka bagless that broke, and this was the nearest we found. Glad we did! It's a little larger than the broken one, but a bit less large, heavy and cumbersome than our old Hoover upright. And a lot lighter in weight! This one (somehow) came with the extra pet-hair mini roller brush, but I had to go look up the Bissell version on line to find out how to take it apart for cleaning the mini roller. Works the same, and the device is REALLY useful for getting into small places. We have a long-hair cat.With 8 amps, this thing really pulls up dirt! Seriously pulls up dirt! I set it to the low \"Carpet\" level, for an old shag carpet in the trailer house. I'm living here, but the owner's been here for a long time. I've been cleaning with that old Eureka, and it's (I thought) been pretty clean. I was getting a lot of fuzz, cat hair, and some fine dirt, but all in all, okay. Then I used this guy! Holy Cow!!The first pass after setting it up, there was almost an entire \"bucket\" container of something greyish-brown. Plus a lot of fuzz and a lot of cat hair. I asked the owner, who told me that many years ago, she'd had a flea problem and sprinkled diatomaceous earth all over. Fixed the fleas, but she never cleaned the carpets.Suddenly, I'm using this new Eureka and it's pulling EVERYthing out of the carpet! After only two times using it (back in April; it's now September), almost all that \"dust\" was gone. Now, I'm getting general dirt, cat hair, dust and carpet fuzz. Normal.1. After the first-time use, with the massive amount of \"newly discovered\" dirt, the roller bar was almost entirely clear! No wrapped hair or anything gunked up in the brush bristles. Amazing!2. Disassembling for cleaning, I found that the main vacuum body was almost entirely clean! No outer dust anywhere on the plastic. The only dust was at the connection hole between the body and the container bucket -- easy to clean with a swipe of a sponge or rag.3. Cleaning the container and filter was pretty simple, but a little bit of time involved.Cleaning:A push-button on the top handle releases the catch bin as a complete unit unto itself. There's another button near the bottom of that basin, which then releases a gravity-operated \"lid.\" BE SURE TO KEEP THE BOTTOM OF THE BUCKET WELL BELOW THE UPPER EDGE OF YOUR TRASH CONTAINER!By pushing the release button to open the bottom of the bucket, you're simply dropping out ALL the crud you've picked up in the catch basin! It comes flying out, dust-cloud and all! Still, there's some remaining junk clinging to the clear plastic bucket walls.I like \"BANG!\" cleaner spray, which is cheap (Dollar Tree), and works very well. I also have a spray attachment on the kitchen sink, which makes it very easy to get water inside the bucket \"tube.\" There's a plastic \"clasp\" or catch you pull on, to open the top of the overall basin. I'd imagine that catch will eventually break, but who knows.....none of the plastic on the 20-yearold ever broke.With the bottom open and the top hinged back, you can clean the entire catch basin. It's large enough (easily) that you can get your hand in there with a sponge. The BANG! makes it easier, and water rinses it all out.The entire filter section comes apart, which is why I bought this. You lift out the filter assembly (the instruction manual shows how), and there are several parts. The filter itself is foam with some sort of paper on top. It's there to prevent dust from blowing into the motor, and both the bottom (foam) and top (paper) got totally covered with dust. Being gentle with it, I was easily able to clean it under running water.I couldn't find these round filters anywhere in stores, so ordered a 6-pack of replacements on Amazon. Not all that expensive. I've used and cleaned this vacuum now probably 8 times (since April, it's now September), and the filter is still pretty together. I can see it's going to degrade, but if it lasts four months (or more), then I only need to replace it three times a year. Very cost effective. And this place has all the old micro dust along with the cat hair, so the filter has to get cleaned after each use. For \"normal people\" and their homes, I think you could use the cleaner several times without cleaning every single time.The attachments are all there, easily stored on the body of the machine. The hose attaches to the roller base during upright use, and comes loose to attach to the handle for portable use. DO follow the instruction manual! The places for the attachments, and how to connect the different hose operations aren't immediately obvious.Some people complain that the roller bar always turns. The old Eureka had a 2-way switch for upright (with roller bar), and portable (for smooth floors and portable use). This power switch only is On\/Off. I don't care. You can raise the level of the roller for \"wood floors,\" if it really makes you anxious.All in all, having sold vacuum cleaners in the past, I'd have to say this is one of the most powerful machines I've ever seen for its size, weight, and price! Yes, it's all plastic, to keep the weight around 8-10lbs or so, but today's plastics are pretty rugged. I'm thinking it'll last long enough to be a good investment.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"483 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663286400000}

I need something that will take care of pet hair (dog and a cat) and be simple to use and  empty, and not require replaceable filters.A lot of reviewers showed  how much hair the vac got up after using their old vacuum first.  They were not kidding!  I ran the Eureka over a short nap carpet about 15 x 15 feet, and the dust bin was nearly full of hair and dirt.  it had only been a couple of days since I vacuumed with my old Rainbow.  I am amazed!  This thing is light and easy to maneuver, gets under the toe space and under the edges of furniture easily.  It cleans right to the edge.  Unlike any vacuum I ever had before, this is NOT noisy.  I always wore hearing protectors with the old ones, and don't even need them with this  Not loud or obnoxious at all.The ease of dumping the dust bin is a big thing for me.  I hesitated to use the Rainbow because you have to fill it with water, then find a place to dump the water\/dirt\/hair sludge.  Then rinse and clean the cannister.  My old Filter Queen used paper filters that need to be changed, and it was a nasty dusty mess to empty.  Also very heavy.  Also expensive:  I paid something like $450 for that think way back in 1972!The new Eureka Was $78.  Both the Filter Queen and Rainbow were getting problems, but still worked.  I also have a Dirt Devil I bought years ago and used about twice and hated.  (Want them?  Come and get 'em for FREE.)I can't find anything negative about the Eureka.  I am looking forward to vacuuming the rest of the house and picking up a bushel of pet hair.Some notes on things previous reviewers complained about:Some folks talked about the hole in the end of the handle, and that the hose was too short.  They must not have gotten the instructions with theirs.  The handle doubles as a wand that extends the hose so you can reach furniture, drapes, etc.  The Owner's Use Manual that came with mine is great.  Well Illustrated,  thorough, and easy to understand.  Another plus.Several people said the height adjustment did not work, and it either was too low and burned the carpet, or too high and wouldn't clean.  I checked min before  using it, and the height adjustment wheels were indeed stuck and would not  lower when you turned the knob.  I called Customer Service right away.  Got a person quickly who was very helpful.  While she was taking my information, I kept fiddling with the height rollers, and it started working!  I am not mechanically illiterate, but do not know why it unstuck or what was holding it to begin with.  So, it works fine.  I did find that Customer Service was very responsive.I will update this review if anything changes or problems arise.Maybe it is kind of sad that at this stage in life I get excited about a new vacuum (smile) but it is a real treat to find a great product at a great price that really works!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"280 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711152000000}

My upstairs is entirely carpeted and I have a few rugs downstairs, so keep that in mind. It ain't like my entire house is carpeted.

First I visited the Hoover website hoping to find this model or something close. Wrong! They\u2019re all making the same cheap plastic versions now.Like most things made today they no longer make them to last. They purposely design their offerings to wear out in a couple of years forcing you to buy a new one. Oh well \u2026 so it goes.The task of finding one like mine was daunting. I didn\u2019t.\ud83d\ude29So the next best thing was to find something close that wasn\u2019t too expensive and had reasonably good reviews on Amazon.This Eureka fit the bill nicely. My price was only $89.00, and as you can see in the pictures, it looks very similar to my old work horse.It functions very much like my Hoover upright but sadly without the automatic cord rewind. No biggie.It is much lighter than the Hoover and it glides around the floor with only a gentle push required. Nice.The operating noise level is comparable to the Hoover. About what you\u2019d expect. Not that horrible.The performance was stellar and it was a pleasure to use without a learning curve coming from my Hoover upright.I also like the way everything easily snapped together upon assembly without any issues, except one.At first I thought there was something wrong with the height adjustment. It was locked in place. But then I discovered it works perfectly once you release the handle from its upright position.So far so good.I also appreciate the foot controls that release the handle and turn on the power.

I was amazed at all the dust and debris it captured in just a couple of passes (see photo).For the price this thing rocks. You can spend extra to get a few more bells and whistles but why would you want to? Other models seem to have the same motor and dust collecting systems.

{"reviewTitle":"(Update - 8 months later and brush motor dead) Pretty good for a cheaper ($$) vacuum","reviewDescription":"UPDATE:  So, I want to preface with, this was still a decent vacuum for the price and although I expected it last a bit longer than 8 months, it still was not a bad overall vacuum for someone on a budget.*** HOWEVER:  the motor that spins the brush in the vacuum head (part that is over the carpet when vacuuming) has stopped working.  I was using one of the handheld attachments one day and suddenly noticed what smelled like small electric motor burning (I think we all know that cliche smell lol).  And looked over at the vacuum and the actual brush motor was smoking.  I immediately unplugged the vacuum, no fire or anything like that.  I let the vacuum sit overnight.  Plugged her back in and turned it on, vacuum still \u201cworks,\u201d but the motor for the brush head died, so I can only use the handheld attachments now.*** Be aware, if you are using handheld attachments, the brush head in the actual like vacuum is still spinning. So, what looks like happened to me is that it was spinning and sat idle in one spot too long, started pulling up some of the fiber from the carpet which cause strain on the brush and motor, ultimately causing it to burn out.  I hope that makes sense. *** Again, not a bad vacuum, just be aware of some of the little caveats.  Previous, bit more \u201chigh end\u201d vacuums I have owned, the brush in \u201cvacuum head\u201d (part that pushes over the carpet as you vacuum) would still spinning if you were using the handheld attachments.(Original review) I was skeptical buying a cheaper dollar amount vacuum, but this one is definitely worth it.  I downsized to a smaller apartment with only half carpet, didn\u2019t need anything super expensive but wanted to get the job done.  This vacuum definitely accomplishes that goal.  Lightweight.  Good auction.  Decent onboard tools, long cord.Overall, if you\u2019re looking at this vacuum because of the price point, definitely worth it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663113600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Dont buy for the attachments!!","reviewDescription":"The attachments suck no pun intended!!The entire vacuum falls over every time you use attachments. Its hit me in head several times and nearly broken a glass end table.  The hose is way too short and because it attaches at the middle of the vacuum not at the base it cause vacuum to rotate and fall.  This is a terrible design flaw and safety issue.The hose also does not have the typical hose extenders that allow you to reach further away.  Between the short hose and no extension it only allows you to use attachments within a foot of vaccum. Then because the main vaccum doesnt turn off when you use attachments it blows lots of air around and all the dust and dirt you are trying to reach winds up in your eyes and face not the vaccum.The pet hair attachment works okay but because hose is so short you cant actually use it for entire sofa....It works pretty good if you are using it to do floors up right and canister empties and reattaches easily.I had a similar eureka vaccum for last 13 years I loved.

{"reviewTitle":"Short, inconvenient hose","reviewDescription":"I didn't even try vacuuming with this machine once I put it together. Put it together in spite of the poorly written instructions, , I should mention. I used to teach college tech writing. I know poorly written instructions. This one gets a red pen. No, the reason I'm returning isn't because of the instructions, although the company is too cheap to hire a professional tech writer, they also seem to be too cheap to hire a designer who actually uses a vacuum cleaner. Maybe I'm just too accustomed to my Dyson, but I'm not going to have anything to do with this short, inconvenient hose. People say size matters, let's be specific: length matters. This hose has nothing to extend it to the appropriate reach for cleaning anything lower than my knees. That little crevice tool? Ha! A few inches won't reach the floor, the baseboards, the tops of the windows where the spiders like to spin their webs, behind the dresser, under the bed .... It's a hose that's about four feet long. In order to use it, you have to bend over and disconnect it from the bottom of the vacuum and either use it as a round hose end or attach one of the three tools. The reason the Amazon listing doesn't show a standing adult using the hose is because an adult has to bend way over to vacuum anything that isn't waist high. When I vacuum, I pull the hose on my Dyson out several times and use it all kinds of places: under the couch, along the kitchen cabinets, around the baseboards, on the stairs. No way this thing can do those jobs unless I crawl on my hands and knees. And I won't get on my hands and knees for a too-short hose. For all I know, it sucks just fine, but I didn't even plug it in once I saw how poorly designed it is. I'm not sure why anybody gave it a 5-star rating, but obviously a lot of people are willing to settle for a short, inconvenient hose. I'm too old for that. I bought this so I'd have a second vacuum when I didn't feel like lugging my Dyson down the stairs. I'd rather lug my Dyson than try to get the job done with this cheap vacuum.

It is placed low so it gets stuck and you keep running over it. Also it doesn\u2019t swivel so I can only seem to vacuum my rugs in one direction or I literally can\u2019t seem to push the vacuum in the opposite direction on the rug, which is annoying. Good news- was missing a piece so it does have a location for the cord to wrap. Overall I\u2019d spend a little more and get a shark or other vacuum.I only received this vacuum yesterday and used it for the first time. I\u2019ll update here as time goes on. I had an Oreck vacuum for 14 years. It was a powerhouse, and if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going from you may be somewhat disappointed. This Eureka vacuum doesn\u2019t have the swivel head, there is no place to roll up the cord and the place it somewhere , the cord is extremely short (that has been mentioned in many reviews) so if you don\u2019t have many outlets this isn\u2019t a vacuum for you, also the hose that you can detach to clean is very short so you\u2019ll have to lift high above you if you\u2019re looking to work on curtains, blinds, skylights, etc. The pros are that it has great suction & there is no bag needed. It\u2019s exceptional suction for this price. I have a ton of plants and it\u2019s useful as in it blows the air up and sucks the stuff up, so if you have loose leaves it will get them off the plant and suction- you won\u2019t have to repeat the vacuuming once you\u2019re done in that area. I have lots of kids and a dog so was excited to try something without bags. I\u2019ll keep you posted with how this holds up. Another few reviews said this vacuum is quiet- I have mostly hardwood floors and highly disagree. It is an average loud, but definitely nothing quiet about it. Must know: no place to food up cord, cord is located low so if you don\u2019t wrap it between the handle you will keep vacuuming over it and it drives you insane, need many outlets because cord is short - amazing suction on a budget, no bags required, easy assembly and operation.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713657600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Dust","reviewDescription":"If you live in an area that's very dusty, like you clean and within a day there's already enough dust that it's noticeable and by the end of the week it looks like you haven't cleaned in a month, you'll probably want to go with a bagged vacuum unless you've got some tricks.I went to empty out the container for the first time and nearly died at all the dust and the fine particle dirt cloud that filled the air. In retrospect, this much should have been obvious. In addition, the top of the tank is still filled with all the dust particles that wouldn't come out even after emptying it.Still, I'm apparently too lazy to return this so I guess I'll have to figure something out. It's certainly better than the old vacuum we were using. Powerful suction, great attachments, the cat tree finally looks clean and the carpet just feels and looks cleaner than it has since we shampooed it.People complain about it being light but the whole point was for it to be light to make it easier to carry around and up stairs and whatnot, it's literally in the description. It works exactly as described.And despite the amazingly strong suction that got even the deep rooted hairs out of the cat tree and practically sucked the fine dust off the floor underneath the carpet, I don't have a problem with the suction of the hose knocking the vacuum around like many others complained of. Then again, maybe I just know how use vacuums so as to not run into such issues. Lord knows I used to have that issue even with the heaviest of older vacuums when I was younger so I learned how to position the vacuum so that it didn't happen and now I don't have the problem even with super light vacuums. You CAN work around this, you CAN'T have the best of both worlds. Well, maybe someday we'll be able to click a rotator selection wheel to adjust the weight of an object, make it super light to carry around or super heavy to ensure it sits in one place, but that day is not yet upon us.Addressing other concerns I noted in the reviews: could the hose be longer and less stiff?

{"reviewTitle":"Overall Great Vacuum, Great Suction and Excellent for Pet Hair","reviewDescription":"Got this vacuum and tried it out on a 10X11 foot room.  I had been using a Bissell prior which basically started to malfunction (damaged motor bearings) after only 9 months.  Set up this Eureka (very easy) and on the first vacuum the dirt container was FULL.  It picked up that much hair the Bissell had left behind!! The suction is strong and will easily swallow a curtain if it gets caught in it.  It vacuumed up cat hair easily and thoroughly.  It is sturdy and a great vacuum especially for the price.  The filter is washable.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because 1) the hose should be longer however that is an issue with all vacuums.  This one is what you would expect and works fine, but with stairs you need a LONG hose.  A hose extension should be an attachment for stairs.  2) I wish it would go flatter to move it all the way under the bed.  It outperforms Bissell no question and a comparable Hoover I purchased before that.  Its a keeper and I am now relieved to actually have the built up hair and dirt suctioned up! Summary good overall, very good suction, great at getting up pet hair and a sturdy vacuum well worth the money.  Outperforms other comparable vacuums of other brands.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"70 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719532800000}

The pet upholstery tool works well but when there\u2019s suction the little brush stops spinning so I feel like it could be doing better. The hose is technically long but doesn\u2019t stretch out easily so you usually end up tipping the base over. The canister is very large and holds a lot of dust but when you empty it it gets all over the outside and makes the vacuum always dirty. There is a puff of air that shoots out the top of the vacuum while you\u2019re running it that blows papers off of coffee tables, which is a little annoying.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721347200000}

{"reviewTitle":"pretty great for the price","reviewDescription":"I bought this little Eureka vacuum because I was tired of carrying my Kirby down the stairs hence I haven't swept as much as i should. And I have allergies and CATS.So, this vacuum was easy to put together right out of the box. I consulted the assembly instructions on the first page of the manual but didn't really need that because it was pretty self explanatory. It was all assembled and ready to roll in about five minutes.I was impressed by the amount of grime that came up right away. There is a setting for low pile carpet , a setting for high pile carpet and a setting for bare floor.I used both the bare floor setting and the low pile carpet for my area.The one drawback I found is the cord is only twenty five feet long. My room is not even that big but I found I had to change to another outlet to finish the other side of the room.The outside of the unit is equipped with mostly hard plastic pieces for power button and handle release, so time will tell if those will hold out.It had been about two weeks since I had vacuumed downstairs previously. The amount of dust, cat hair, and filth that I got up was amazing. It pretty much filled half of the canister. Maybe more. Unfortunately some of that stuck up in the top of the canister and it empties from the bottom so I had to stick my hand up there to get it the rest of it out.The unit is lightweight and easy to push.It blew hot air from the unit and that was powerful enough to knock some papers off of my desk three feet away. So that is a little annoying because I know it's blowing dirt all over as well. Luckily it picks up dirt really well also! I think this eureka model is going to be exactly what I intended it to be and save my poor back!I used the crevice tool attachment to get in behind my desk. Unfortunately the hose is a little short, but I stretched it out and made it work.For the price it's exactly what I needed.Minus one star for cord length and the amount of pressured air it blows out.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"29 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718236800000}

It does often get stuck and stops rotating during vacuuming and I would need to either shake it or manually move the brush so it'll start rotating again.Other than that the main base works so well. It is a little heavy especially when you're doing the stairs but worth it to get all the dirt off. The power is great and assembly took 5 mins.

So I wanted to try a different brand. Honestly, the only improvement over the Bissell are the extra attachments with longer wand. It cleans carpets well, and solid floors okay. The suction is about the same, the noise is about the same and the cord is about the same length as the cheaper Bissell. Hopefully this one lasts a bit longer. My guess is, you need to step up to a $200+ model to get better performance. Bottom line, the final star rating will depend on the longevity.

Unlike most vacuum cleaners.I bought the pet version because I have three dogs and they shed well. When your vacuuming the exhaust comes out the front. So as you're vacuuming up the hair, it's blowing the hair away from the vacuum up into the air so that doesn't make sense to me either.As far as the canister that catches the hair and the dirt, it doesn't make sense because there's a mini container at the top of a canister. So as the hair comes in it feels that little cup blocks the opening so nothing else can come in. And basically you still have 90% of the canister empty but you're emptying it because the top part is blockedI just don't think this was meant for animals","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1681430400000}

By the time this vacuum stopped working and I was raking out imbedded hair, it became pretty obvious how little dirt and hair it was actually picking up, despite frequent vacuuming and carpet cleanings. The tank is small and holds less than other vacuums I've had in the past and other than it being light weight, there is nothing special about this vacuum to warrant the price.Unfortunately, this is the one product I apparently didn't get a warranty on, so it's going straight into the trash and I will purchase something that does a better job and actually picks up pet hair.Of all the many vacuums I've had to purchase over the last 7 years, I'm the least impressed with this one considering what I paid for it.

I live in a small house, but still had to change outlets from one end of my livingroom to the other to be able to vacuum the whole room. Make sure you have an easy to access outlet in every room, or a handy extension cord.The hose is also way too short and extremely stiff. There are no hose 'extension tubes' to give it more length, so above the head cleaning is impossible unless you want to lift the entire unit in the air. Same with stairs--be prepared to lift the whole unit every 2-3 steps.The crevice tool is too short and too fat to be of much use other than in-between furniture cushions or easy to access baseboards and the like. It can't fit more than 3 inches under or between any appliances, unless you move the entire appliance. I expect it won't reach very far under\/between car seats either.If a long hose and useful tools aren't important to you, this may be ok for you, as the suction capabilities are good.

There is a strange hole in the back of the handle, and a sticker that states that the hole is intentionally there, but I\u2019m not sure why! The design of the canister does not allow the vacuum to lay flat and get under the dining room table, as it is rather bulky.It did remove the very fine dirt from the area rug in the living room and overall, it seemed to get the job done, but I am not confident that it will last more than a year.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695600000000}

Once the cannister is about 1\/3 of the way full, the fur stops being pulled down into the cannister. It just sits up around the filter and collects.  You have to completely dismantle the cannister to get to the filter, which means that you have to stick your hand in there with all the dirt,  fur, and whatever else you just vacuumed up.

The amount of dirt picked up by this new Eureka Blue PowerSpeed NEU280 with Washable Filter is at least a third less than our old Eureka (motor finally wore out after several decades of use).  The power cord is much shorter and requires us to jockey between electrical outlets twice as much.

I\u2019m can\u2019t believe we have been living with that! Just a few points.1\/ Took me a while to locate the power on. I know, I should have just run downstairs and looked at the manual but I though it should have been obvious. You really have to look closely for the symbol but it is in a good place for a foot operated on switch. It would have helped if the symbol was colored as well as embossed.2\/ the attachments kept falling off the vacuum so I\u2019d have to stop and pick them up.3\/ I pulled the hose to attach the brush attachment and a bunch of dust flew out onto the floor, which, thankfully I have a good vacuum to clean up. This happened each time I went to use the hose.4\/ the machine is so light it falls over easily. I hope it doesn\u2019t break5\/ the release for the dust container is super easy but when I went to empty it I had to dig my hand up in there to get all the yuck out! It did not just fall effortlessly into the trash can. Now I few like I need a shower. Probably got stuck due to my long hair getting wrapped around the center cylinder. If you have short hair you will likely be fine.So overall, it is lightweight, has great suction and easy to use, but has those annoying little quirks that you probably get with most corded vacuums.

Easy to push around and switching between types of flooring is easy. I've had this since January 2023 and use it regularly for the entire 1000 square foot house. So efficient that you're done before you know it: 25 minutes and my floors are clean as a whistle.WHY 4 STARS AND NOT 5: Well, it is powerful (which is good) and so the machine is a bit noisier than I like. Put on your ear phones and play some early Miles or Beethoven. The only other irritation is that it's hard to unwrap and rewrap the conveniently long extension cord. Other reviewers have also pointed out the bottom notch to wind the cord around is behind the loop of the suction tube. Difficult to wrap or unwrap the extension cord.

I've tried other upright vacuums for hardwood floors, and they didn't work as well as they did on my carpets, but THIS one works phenomenal on my hardwood floors! The powerful suction is absolutely amazing! Way better than stick and canisters!! I have 4 cats and 2 dogs, and the hair that this Eureka Pet Turbo picks up is beyond amazing! I do clean it out after every use to make sure that nasty stuff doesn't stay in the cup, but that is super easy to do! Just hold it over my trash can and release! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the vacuum is not very sturdy when using the hose\/attachments. It tends to fall over very easily, but with a little maneuvering to keep it sturdy, the suction makes up for that. I vacuum my floors pretty much every day, but I also put on the brush attachment and do my dusting too! The Eureka Pet Turbo is a must have if you have pets!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"36 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691884800000}

It has the no bag system so you unclick the chamber open it up and dump everything out. This vacuum cleaner has tremendous suction. It has a great front end brush. They're really cool feature about this vacuum cleaner is the handle comes off and you have an extended hand vacuum cleaner and you can slap on the attachments as well. As I'm vacuuming I can pull the handle and vacuum the hair off the couch suck up the dust in the corners and grab a few cobwebs on the wall. As a sidebar I wish to note that although I use this vacuum cleaner a lot my house is clean and it's not as dirty as I'm making it out to be but but I am pointing out that this little unit was very affordable less than a hundred bucks and it works better than some of the other fancy more expensive vacuums that cost a fortune.In closing I also want to add that you can easily take this thing apart and clean the inside the brushes to the point that it's working at a new level again.Highly recommend this vacuum cleaner and I was not compensated or rewarded for saying nice things.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713916800000}

The suction does not cyclone enough in the container and everything gathers up top.

This is advertised as a pet vacuum but it struggles to move the hair into the container  2. The hose to use the attachments doesn't come with an extender tube - that means it's so short that the vacuum constantly tips over if you try to use the hose.  3. One of the attachments already broke.  4. At the lowest floor setting lots of reverb goes out the back of it so you have to look behind you and go back and vacuum what shoots out the back.

Yes, it lightweight (easy to carry up the stairs) but if you are using the attachment tools don't expect it to stay upright. The stretch hose is too short so when you pull on it the least little bit, the vacuum tips over. Forget trying to vacuum your stairs with this thing. The electrical cord is SO SHORT. No going from 1 room to another without changing outlets. And the canister is too small especially if you have pets that shed.If you live in a very small apartment or house, and cost is a factor, then this may be for you. But if not, I suggest you look for a better model.  Sometimes being cheaper is too cheap. This one is going to the garage and I'll find a better one (more pros than cons) for my upstairs vacuum.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706140800000}

It does feel extremely cheap compared to my last one.  Probably cheaper feeling than any vacuum I ever owned.I am not sure how I like the feel of it either when you are vacuuming carpet.  It doesn't seem to suction going forward, only when you pull it back towards you.  BUT I will say it vacuumed up more than my other vacuum ever did.  After I saw in the container how much it actually swept up I realized my other vacuum really didn't get much off the floor, even though it felt like it was.I am going to keep it, only because it was pretty inexpensive and seems to get the job done.The one thing I don't like is how you attach the hose when you need to use that.  It just seems backwards to me and I also don't like the main piece that you use to sweep.  I feel like it needs to be longer (without having to use attachments)Overall it will be fine and I like that you can just empty the container easily when it gets full.UPDATE:Now that I have had some time to use it, it is my least favorite vacuum I've owned.  The cord is too short and I find I have to keep switching plugs for it to reach.  I really don't like the hose feature that you use around baseboards, etc.  When you plug it in is is extremely loud, the vacuum is VERY loud in general.  I finished vacuuming the other day and my husband said, \"why is that thing soooo loud??\"I also realized it blows air out of the front of it!  I go to vacuum something and it starts blowing all over so I can't even get it.  So annoying.  I would recommend looking for a different vacuum!UPDATE #2I wish I would have returned it!  It gets worse and worse every time I use it.  The upper clip broke off that holds the cord when not in use, I swear it gets louder every time I use it, its obnoxious!  It also isn't picking things up as well anymore with the hose attachment.  I will need to buy a new vacuum soon, I can't deal with this one anymore!

To be honest I was heavily disappointed because even though I read all the reviews I could no one mentioned what I'm about to mention.PROS- Has great suction power.- Comes with a lot of accessories that can be attached to the vacuum (no pieces laying around or getting lost).CONS- Not light weight. My arm ends up tired from carrying it and moving it around. Out of curiosity I put it on a scale and it weighs 12.5 lb, not 10 like advertised.- Too bulky. Doesn't fit into semi-narrow spaces or under most furniture. I end up brooming the room and collecting all the hair and dust in one place to then vacuum it (which defeats the purpose of having a vacuum).- The electricity cord is placed in a way that makes it harder to keep out of the way. The vaccum is always either rolling over or sucking it.- Comes with a hose that is too rigid and not flexible enough. Every time I use it I end up holding the hose with one hand and the vacuum with the other one so it doesn't fall to the floor.- That same hose, gets detached pretty easily. So I find myself holding the vacuum from the hose's attachment to help it from falling and from detaching.- It doesn't have any headlights (I find this particularly helpful since I have a golden retriever who sheds blond hair that is difficult to see and a light helps me identify what spots I've missed).- It has so much power that the air that comes out of it through the vent makes all the dirt and hair fly around when you're getting close to it (so you actually end up chasing it).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710633600000}

You can't tell me that you have never sucked something up in a vacuum before..a sock, blanket, rug, etc. Luckily, the Amazon customer service person stepped in and asked them twice \"are you saying you are not covering the warranty on the vacuum\" in which, the Eureka person stated \"we will not as it was her fault\"!

At first I thought it was grease, but when I felt it the edges were crispy like they were burnt. I looked at the bottom of the vacuum and didn't see anything, but my husband looked at it again and the roller brushes at one end were hard and burnt. Turns out the roller brush, which is supposed to stop when you use the hose, does not stop and heated up and burnt the carpet. We also realized that the brushes are still turning on the bare floor setting as well...so this vacuum is clearly defective and we are past our return window. Found another spot on my hall carpet where it happened as well, but thankfully that spot is almost unnoticeable because the carpet is darker.

{"reviewTitle":"Terrible for hardwood floors","reviewDescription":"This is an embarrassing product for Eureka. After using this vacuum for 15 minutes in my living room and bathroom, I immediately repackaged it and an sending it back. Thin plastic wheels, weak suction, and a short extension hose are just a few of the strikes against this vacuum. The adjustment knob that has 5 settings from a high pile carpet down to a bare floor is a joke.  On its bare floor setting the front end drops to the floor leaving no room to roll over debris to suck it up, but instead just pushes debris like a snow plow because the front is touching the ground. And because it's touching the ground and because it's made entirely out of plastic with no rubber anywhere, dropped down to the bare floor setting just scratches the floor. The wheels have no rubber treads so it's just hard plastic scraping against the varnish on the floor. I tried raising the adjustment height one notch up so the vacuum has enough height to roll over debris but the suction power is so weak that it can't suck anything up and misses even the tiniest debris. Now while the vacuum itself is lightweight, this poses an issue when trying to use the extension hose. With the extension hose being short and the vacuum being lightweight, as soon as you pull the hose to get those \"hard to reach places\", the vacuum topples over because they're isn't enough weight to keep it upright. Terrible choice for hardwood floors, but thankfully Amazon allows returns.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1642896000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Broken within 3 months","reviewDescription":"At first I really liked this vacuum. When I first used it, it seemed to have a lot of sucking power. But unfortunately within just a couple of months the vacuum power significantly weakened and I could not figure out why. Nothing was clogged, filters clean. And now it just completely does not work at all. And I only purchased it in January. Just a complete waste of money. Do yourself a favor and just spend 50$ more dollars to get yourself a vacuum that will actually last.

{"reviewTitle":"No good","reviewDescription":"It arrived broken.  The nozzle of the handle would not stay in the base.  It would lock in place when the vacuum was in the upright position but would slide out when  inclined, making it impossible vacuum.  I contacted Eureka and went through several phone calls and did everything they asked.  They ended up telling me they did not have the part.  They suggested contacting Amazon for a replacement or return.  I wanted a replacement because it is lightweight and the suction seemed good, but Amazon did not have any in stock.  I am frustrated and very disappointed in Eureka!  The name used to insure quality.Update on 11\/13\/23:  Because of the runaround with Eukeka and a trip out of the country, I missed my return window.  Now I am stuck with a brand new vacuum that the handle won\u2019t stay in.  I had to duct tape it to try to get the handle stay.  I would advise against this purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691539200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Save your money","reviewDescription":"I have had a Dyson for the past 10 years. I knew there would be a quality difference but man I poured over these reviews and saw so much positivity on this vacuum I was encouraged I felt like it might actually be a good one. It seems very popular that solid surfaces are what most people have. However, I needed a good vacuum for carpet. Didn\u2019t want to spend a whole lot of money and I totally got what I paid for in this situation. This vacuum is awful, the hose doesn\u2019t work when you turn the vacuum off debris comes out of the hose because there\u2019s not enough suction to get it into the canister. There is a specific attachment that seems like would be so great. It looks like a little mini handheld vacuum that you put to your hose that does not work at all not at all again because there\u2019s not enough suction. This vacuum is for pure novelty.

Then the drive belt slipped off and the brush\u2019s stopped working. What a bust of a product.I also found that the carpet attachment is driven by the flow of air instead of a motor. So it stalls on any carpet that is even remotely \u201cshaggy\u201d. With the hose wanting to fight me the entire time to return to its resting position.Save your money.

Nothing helped. I called the Eureka help line. They were totally worthless. Also the hard floor and carpet adjustments suck. On hard floor the brushes hit the floor. To vacuum any rugs you have to change it to the highest setting or it will eat the rug. The adjustment knob is very inconveniently placed. You have to stop vacuuming, put it in the standing position,  bend over and turn it. Should be a foot pedal.My ears are ringing after using it for a little while.
