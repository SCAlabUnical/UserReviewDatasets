{"reviewTitle":"Caution at 15 feet","reviewDescription":"A word of caution for these cables.When I need new HDMI cables I don't even blink - I just order them from Amazon. In a general upgrade, I got a new 4K UHD HDR television, Apple TV 4K, a UHD Blu-Ray player, a brand new Denon Receiver, and the new Comcast Xfinity XG1v4-a box that does 4k60.I ordered all new cables because I knew I needed the the 18Gbs speed and wasn't entirely sure some of the 6yo+ cables I had could do that so no big deal. I also need about a 12' run and so I just went with these 15' cables. My first reaction on opening is that they are huge. Massive cables and I figured this had to do with RF shielding. After running all the cables I sat down ready for some glorious HD.All sources were ran to my Denon AVR-S540BT and then my Samsung Q7.To my dismay, these 15' cables resulted in troubles including:-Apple TV running in 4k60 with Chroma 4:0:0 (screen went blank at 4:2:2); 4k60HDR flickered.-Xfinity Box at 4k60 and 4k30 resulted in no picture, needed to set it at 1080p-I didn't really mess with the blu-ray player because I knew I had a problem anyway.I did a shoddy run with a 6' cable and everything worked so I knew it was cable length. So long story short, these 15' cables may not work for your purposes.For those of you interested in what I did, I did research on AV forums and discovered things called Active Cables and I purchased 15' DynamicView from Monoprice. I was able to get 4k60HDR at 4:4:4 on the Apple TV immediately. Oddly enough it only allowed me to see 4k30 on the Xfinity box and I replaced that with a BestBuy Insignia 12' cable and got that up to 4k60.So just be aware that depending on the oomph of your source, these cables may not deliver as promised.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1528675200000}

I was setting up a new TV (Sony X900E) and Receiver (Yamaha A1070) and was using one of these cables to connect the receiver and television.  I used the 10 foot cable.  I got ARC working and could hear the TV audio through the receiver, also the receiver could show its OSD on the TV.  So both audio and video were working.Then I tried to hook up my PS4 Pro and my Chromecast Ultra (the TV has built-in chromecast but there are issues with Netflix) to the receiver.  The receiver detected them and I could hear audio (from the receiver) but the TV said \"no signal\".  After going through settings for over an hour with no luck I decided to try a different cable.  That was it, everything worked fine with the new cable and that's the first time I've ever had a bad HDMI cable.  What was the new cable?  The 15 foot version also sold on this page.  That's the only reason I'm giving these 2 stars -- one of them worked.Very frustrating to have it work for (some) audio\/video but not the higher resolution content (which is why I bought these \"high speed\" cables).

There are only 3 possible outcomes with any given HDMI cable:1. Does not work2. Works with artifacts (random white dots)3. WorksIf your outcome is 1 or 2, your equipment does not like the cable, or you need an active cable for a long run.  If your outcome is 3, you are good to go.  There is no higher quality level than \"works,\"  considering the error-corrected digital nature of how HDMI signals are transmitted.That is a long-winded explanation of why this cable is unnecessarily thick.  Thicker absolutely does not mean more \"premium\" -- just more difficult to use.

The 4 star rating is because the cable works as advertised with Ultra Blu-ray movies with HDR being output from the Xbox One S at the same run length. It's also a great 4K cable in general as I use it with plenty other devices that don't require as much bandwidth.

{"reviewTitle":"Cable works fine, but the plastic grip at the ends of the cable is thicker than most","reviewDescription":"The cable itself seems to work fine. But the cable casing is thicker than I expected, and the plastic grip at the ends, from which the HDMI connectors protrude, is thicker than my other HDMI cables: this one is 1\/2\" from top to bottom instead of 3\/8\". I mention this because I'm using the cable to connect a laptop to a 5-year-old Samsung TV whose HDMI ports are flat against the rear of the TV, so that the cables lie flat against the TV where they plug into the HDMI ports. That is, the cables don't stick out perpendicular to the rear of the TV. In order for the TV to have that slim look that some people want, the manufacturer doesn't provide a lot of clearance between the TV's HDMI ports and the rear of the TV. There's plenty of room for my other HDMI cables (the ones whose plastic grips are 3\/8\" thick), but it's a very tight fit for the plastic grip at the end of this particular HDMI cable. I can imagine that TVs that are newer and more high-end than mine, and that are going for a thin, sleek look, might have even less clearance for the plastic grip of an HDMI cable, in which case you wouldn't be able to plug this cable in directly; you'd have to use an adapter.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1455753600000}

The cable that this one is replacing (due to a pet chewing it) was much thinner and I had it tucked between the carpet and base board. Not this beast. It also puts a lot of stress on HDMI ports due to the weight. I had to route it differently and zip tie it because I was worried about damaging ports. I suspect this length is rated to be installed inside of building walls. That would explain the extra thickness and shielding but I do not see it in the listing anywhere. The cable lengths below 15 feet appear to be \"normal\" cable in the pictures.TL;DRIf you want a sturdy HDMI cable that a semi could run over and not interrupt your movie this is for you.

Bought this new cable to interface it with my new Yamaha Receiver. Live TV was perfect, but DVR playback was plagued with intermittent drop-outs of AUDIO ONLY. I assumed it was the used eBay Channel Master CM7500+ OTA DVR for quite sometime since is was only audio and only playback; never live TV. . I recently had spare time on my hands recovering from surgery and started more in depth troubleshooting. Reseated the HDMI cable several times on BOTH ends (cause is was driving me crazy with all of the TV I had to watch during recovery); no change at all. Noticed the DVR+ had a mini optical audio out port. Bought a new fiber optic cable and replacement HDMI cable as well since I was jumping in. Verdict: NO MORE Audio dropouts regardless of whether I used the new fiber-optic OR the new HDMI cable. THIS cable was ONLY 3' long; what the hell? The new cable is 3x-4x the cost of THIS one and designed to work with 8k signals - which this is not.

{"reviewTitle":"I'm not happy.","reviewDescription":"I'm big into the latest and greatest technology but I don't always understand it. I'll tell you in my laymen's terms that these are garbage. I researched and figured we were saving money and that these were the latest and greatest. We just bought a 4K OLED tv and realized our current cables weren't high speed so I needed new ones. I bought these and hooked them up. I think we've had them a month and we were playing with our son on the PS4 and accused him of sitting on the tv remote because in the middle of a game the screen just went blank and acted like nothing was hooked up to the HDMI. This happened 3 more times in the same day and finally my husband switched out the HDMI cable after we realized no one was sitting on the remote. Obviously these are basically worthless if they only work for month. Getting returned and not sure what to buy now because I hate having to research things. I was really hopeful with the great price and reviews though.Update: I completely forgot to return these hunks of trash and they got shoved into a box of cables. Totally forgot about them. Fast forward a few years and we got a new Apple TV 4K. Hooked it all up and it worked fine for one day. Second day the screen flickered once in a while. Then it got more and more steady. VERY annoying, thought maybe it was the Apple TV, troubleshooted, still had the issue. After about 20 minutes the screen started straight up flickering black and gray and there was no picture at all. Reset everything, unplugged and replugged in everything and it was fine. 20 minutes later same crap again. Figured maybe it was the HDMI cable and swapped it out for a different brand. NO issues. Came on here to review and saw that I already had. I\u2019ve had these just sitting in a box for like 4 years. They are complete garbage. I deeply regret not returning them.

Right off the bat the HDMI connectors are flimsy and very short so there is a lot of pressure of the connectors if you connect them at right angles. Second issue and a deal breaker for me is that although it says this is the latest standard which I assumed is HDMI 2.0a this cable does not work with the PS4 pro and the Xbox one S. Both my gaming systems would not display HDR, whenever I tried to view something with HDR my TV would lose signal(I have the LG Oled E6 65inch). My PS4 pro would not even display anything after powering up with this cable, my Xbox one S would display at 4K but when playing HDR my TV would lose signal.On a side note if you do have a PS4 pro and a LG Oled E6 65inch TV and you have problems getting HDR to work or you do not get a signal when you power on your PS4 pro system try this it worked for me:1. Connect the PS4 pro with the HDMI cable which came with it to HDMI 1 on your TV ( I have 4 HDMI inputs and for some reason PS4 Pro only worked on HDMI 1 for me.2. Make sure deep color is enabled for HDMI 1 ( I enabled it for all my HDMI inputs)For now avoid this cable and just use the cable that came with your gaming consoles, I will be returning this cable and trying out the media bridge cables.

Although they list this as the latest standard, let me save you the hassle.  This will not do 4k @ 60 Hz. I've seen the Amazon cheerleader with the screenshots saying this cable works with 4k and HDR. My cable did not.  I should've taken some screenshots with my Xbox one X error list (but I didn't).  I freaked out when I hooked this up to my Xbox one X and the system reported it would not do full 4k but only upscale to 4k for games. I added a compatibility option which then said it would do 4k and HDR for movies, but would still not do games in Native 4k with HDR. First problem was my Sony TV was not set to Enhanced HDMI mode.  When I corrected that, the screen had red snow all over the background.  I freaked out thinking my Xbox was broken or my TV was not working properly.  After a couple hours of troubleshooting, I traced it down to the new \"latest standard\" HDMI cable I bought from Amazon.  I also noticed that other people have run into the same issue specifically with the 10 ft cable (see the Q&A section). Amazon refunded my money without question and I was able to purchase a functional cable from another seller on Amazon.

I exchanged my TV for another one to make sure it wasn't the TV (TV also came with a blemish and the google play credit had already been redeemed which made me question whether or not my TV was new) and the same effect persisted in my replacement TV. It happened all throughout the 4K\/HDR hard disc version of Wonder Woman being played through an Xbox One S to where we had to change out of movie mode (which uses darker colors,etc). I decided to try some rocketfish cables from Best Buy since they were on sale and considered \"certified\". The issue went away immediately in Wonder Woman, color and contrast was vivid and normal.  I tried a Netflix show through a Roku Ultra and the effect was partially there but not as bad, it then went away and I could not replicate again which makes be think its a bandwidth issue. I changed my Netflix settings to display the highest resolution picture and haven't noticed the issue since with the new rocketfish cables from best buy.  The biggest difference was in Wonder Woman disk, playing through an Xbox One S, issue was completely gone and this movie was not being streamed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1511654400000}

It will work for most applications and some will work for 4K 60Hz but some won't (which is why some of the reviews here seem to contradict each other).  The problem is that HDMI standards are kind of sketchy these days.  The current \"high speed\" HDMI spec requires 10.2 Gbps testing but companies are allowed to sort of cheat and extrapolate to say it should work for 18 Gbps.  The only way to know if a cable has actually been tested for 18 Gbps is if the cable is premium certified, which these aren't.  Monoprice sells premium certified cables for about the same price as these and blue jeans cables sells higher quality premium certified cables at reasonable prices.  I'd recommend BJC if you want to make sure you don't have issues between your high end 4K equipment or Monoprice if you want the lowest cost premium certified cables.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1488240000000}

It is a quite long 15-foot cable, and it has been really nice to have in the arsenal of entertainment equipment for the house. First off, the build quality on this cable is very great. The cable itself feels solid and well-made, with good connectors that make nice fits into my devices.

Well, I tested it on my 4K TV with a variety of streamer boxes, and the picture quality is brilliant. Video flows clearly and smoothly at HD color with sharpness from 18 Gbps bandwidth and a 60 Hz refresh rate. I mean, the experience of playing movies, games, or series, it's just great. It also works great on my devices; I've used it in conjunction with a Blu-ray player, game console, and streaming box, and it works great every time. Being compatible with 4K Ultra HD, HDR, and 3D makes this device really versatile for the modern setup.

{"reviewTitle":"There is no need to buy more expensive HDMI cables","reviewDescription":"Please do not waste your hard earned money on overpriced HDMI cables in the name of picture or sound improvements. I currently am using these AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cables to connect our Yamaha v379 AV receiver to other HDMI enabled devices that link back to our 4K Samsung Smart TV and these have performed flawlessly.HDMI cables come in four types: Standard-speed --> Standard-speed with Ethernet --> High-speed --> High-speed with Ethernet. Since High-speed cables are so cheap (e.g these AmazonBasics cables), there really isn't any point of getting Standard-speed anymore. On the other hand, as most HDMI devices today can't receive Ethernet over HDMI, High-speed HDMI cables are really all you need.** Some numbers **Standard-speed HDMI cables are rated up to 1080i (\"i\" stands for interlaced). In order for a HDMI cable to have a \"High-speed\" moniker, it must be capable of showing resolutions up to 4K --> 3840 x 2160 at 30fps (or 4,096 x 2160 at 24fps). And as the highest resolution any 4K TV currently on the market can produce is 3840 x 2160 at 30fps, even if you found a $100 cable at your local BestBuy that claims it can transmit much more than that, it doesn't matter as you are limited by your source (i.e your cable box, Xbox, PS4 e.t.c) and your TV's hardware capabilities.Also HDMI cables can either produce an image\/sound or nothing at all. There is NO in between. Therefore, a HDMI cable will either work or won't work (it may show a flashing image but this means it's a bad cable). But a more expensive HDMI cable will NOT show darker blacks and sharper colors than a less expensive HDMI cable. You either get 100% of the signal or no signal at all. Now if you intend on running your HDMI cable for more than 50ft, then you might want to invest in a HDMI cable that has \"active\" chips that help maintain the signal quality over a longer distance (but does NOT make the image\/sound any better than the source).** What about HDMI 1.4 or 2.0 or HDCP 2.2? **This is another common misconception due to manufacturer marketing. HDMI 1.4, 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 are all hardware changes that do NOT require a cable change! Although there is a difference between them (you can google that yourself), there is no such thing as a HDMI 1.4 or 2.0 or HDCP 2.2 cable! The version numbers refer to the devices that the HDMI cable connects into & NOT the cable itself. The cable simply is a pipeline linking the two. Hence, if you do happen to own a TV and another device that both have HDMI 2.0 ports, any AmazonBasics High-speed rated cable will work perfectly fine with it.** Conclusion **At this price point, there is very little reason to spend more money on more expensive HDMI cables over these AmazonBasics High-speed cables. If you have a 3D, 4K, HDCP 2.2 or HDMI-ARC compatible device, these High-speed cables will work perfectly fine for you.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2,959 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1453161600000}

Is Amazon basics  HDMI cable... and I can say that it is the best quick option for a nice HDMI cable at any length you could need!Let me clear the air on some HDMI misconceptions real quick - HDMI cables have nothing to do with whatever version of HDMI your tv has be it HDMI 1.4 , 2.0 , 2.1 or 2.2 as that is the PHYSICAL port on the tv, soundbar, GPU or what have you - the cable is merely the transporter from one thing to the other and either work or doesn't. There is no need for a higher 'grade' of cable as there is nothing you can do to the cable to make it transmit data better. I am sure that Bestbuy would love to sell you on 1000 reasons their $150 cable makes your colors better, but that is all marketing. This is exactly like charging your phone, the cable doesn't charge your phone faster as it is all in the block plugged into the wall - this is the same principle as the cable is merely passing the data.The non-braided cable and endpiece are really well-constructed out of generic rubber-ish material, they are ever so slightly stiff, but are otherwise perfect for any need you could have! There is no issue slotting them next to each other either as the head of the plug maintains a slim profile.I recommend this HDMI cable to anyone in need of one! The price is unbeatable for an HDMI cable, and you will be wasting your money on anything more expensive as this is about as good as it gets(unless you HAVE TO HAVE a braided cable). Once again another reason to have high expectations from an amazon brand as this is another example of a great Amazon Essentials product!REMEMBER!!

Since then we\u2019ve had intermittent \u201cHDMI connection not permitted\u201d errors for no reason, requiring a reset to clear.  We also had picture dropouts any time a static electricity charge was grounded anywhere in the room.  Turning on the gas fireplace would cause a dropout.  Electrical storms in the area would cause a dropout.  We decided to isolate the entire setup with a UPS, which helped quite a bit, but never quite solved the HDMI error.  Research indicated the problem might be the cables and further research indicated the Amazon Basics cables tested well and were highly recommended.It\u2019s the cables, dummy.

I replaced the 25' cable with an Audioquest Pearl cable (I know, expensive) and the dark scene I couldn't see before was perfectly clear and visible even in the bright room.When researching on-line, many articles say cables need to achieve a speed of 18 Gbps.  The Amazon basics cables claim a speed of \"up to\" 18 Gbps even for the 25' cable.  I don't think they're getting there.  The Audioquest cables say \"exceeds\" 18 Gbps.

{"reviewTitle":"Thick & stiff (in 25' length), but this one actually works!","reviewDescription":"After trying a couple of other cheap 25' HDMI cables with poor results (one failing to work at all, the other only at low resolutions like 480p), I looked for the thickest reasonably-priced cable I could find, using the HDMI connector as a scale reference in photos.  The body of this cable is about 4 times thicker than my others. It pushes perfect video & audio from my HTPC to a television in another room, even with an HDMI \"splitter\" (distribution amp) on the source end, and a 3-to-1 source switch on the receiving end, both of which weaken the signal somewhat.  I'm only using it at 1080p\/60Hz, though, the limit of that remote TV, which is less demanding than the specified 4k resolution.  Its thickness makes this cable more difficult to run, but at these lengths that's a necessary trade-off when pushing distance limits, just based on the physics of signal transmission. A thinner cable of equal performance would need to use fiber optics, or active in-line amplification, either of which will increase the cost, and add additional powered electronics that could fail in the future.The 25' version of this cable is marked 24AWG, meaning its individual wires inside are equal in thickness to those of a typical Cat5e or Cat6 cable.  I cut open & stripped my off-brand, non-working-even-at-480p 25' cable to compare, and estimate the width of its individual conductors (within one of the 4 twisted-pairs) to be 30 AWG at best, possibly even thinner.  (Larger AWG = American Wire Gauge numbers mean thinner wires... it's one of those weird upside-down scales).  Size matters!  Shorter cables in this listing do appear to be thinner, which is fine at those lengths, so long as you don't try to chain several of them together.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705104000000}

Comments such as Oliver T. \"And as the highest resolution any 4K TV currently on the market can produce is 3840 x 2160 at 30fps\" are inaccurate so watch out - this experience has demonstrated that there is indeed a need to buy more expensive HDMI cables if you want to run at 60fps (60Hz).Trying these ones next - hoping they perform better","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1491091200000}

This is one workaround i discovered.  Then I tested an old HDMI cable i bought from Monoprice 8 years ago for the heck of it.  Turns out this old cable works reliably in 4k UHD HDR mode.  The old cable from Monoprice looks more like an old VGA cable with feritte cores on each ends of the cable.  So days of all generic high speed  hdmi cable being equal are over with 4k HDR.

{"reviewTitle":"WiFi devices Showed No Inter-Connection with Wired Ethernet Receiver after Using These Cables","reviewDescription":"I Exchanged these cables for my \"non-ethernet\" HDMI cables attached to my LG OLED TV and Comcast Box, along with Apple TV, Samsung Blu-ray 4k player, and Xbox X. attached to my Yamaha AV Receiver.  I have only one ethernet cable attached to my AV receiver and these cables were advertised to extend to other devices without needing an ethernet cable on each one.  Well, I got only static on my Blu-ray player and my Apple TV which was working perfectly the night before the exchange suddenly stopped working no matter what I plugged into it (which may be a coincidence, but...who knows?).  And as for ethernet connectivity, well, the devices attached to my AV receiver (which is wired) still only recognized connection via my WiFi network.  In summary, the cables did nothing for network speed or connection, and in at least one case (the Samsung Player) would not even work as a typical HDMI cable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1531180800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Does NOT support 4K HDR10.","reviewDescription":"After reading reviews here to confirm that these cables are 4K HDR10 capable, I ordered a set of three to run in the wall between various devices and a new LG 4K tv.  They work fine with regular HD devices, but connected to an Xbox watching 4K Netflix, they fail within a few seconds every time.  It'll show a few seconds of the video, flicker to static for a second, or show noise patterns, then go blank.  Switching back to the HDMI cable that came with the Xbox works flawlessly.  All three cables exhibit this problem, so this doesn't seem to be a one-off issue.The Xbox renders all its menus and other output at 4K all the time, but the only time the cables fail is when Netflix enables HDR10 (the tv shows a little HDR badge in the corner when this happens), so I'm assuming the incompatibility is with HDR10.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"162 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1503878400000}
{"reviewTitle":"I bought 2 of these and had the same problem ...","reviewDescription":"I bought 2 of these and had the same problem with both. You either get no picture or a very red striped or pixelated picture not clear enough to make-out or watch. It isn't enough of a connection to provide a signal so it goes in and out. We used one in our bedroom and kept having problems with the connection. We thought it was the Roku or the power supply and replaced both. We eventually quit using the Roku thinking it just wasn't going to work. We used the other in our game room to attach an extra gaming system to the TV. Apparently it has never worked - I just thought my kids preferred the other games. When I realized their's hadn't worked either I tried a cable from our cable box and both my Roku and their gaming system worked perfectly. Since they were both used on \"extra\" electronics, I didn't realize they weren't working in time to return them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1492214400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Beware of the Fine Print (False Advertisement)!!","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ll start by stating that I LOVE AMAZON!!! However, I\u2019m disappointed in this product. Amazon needs a spanking for this one! Amazon Basics describes this product as a \u201cHigh-Speed 4K HDMI 10ft Cable.\u201d Well, they got the attributes right, except for the part about 4K. All quality HDMI cables will have fine print written on their exteriors. This \u201cfine print\u201d usually lists all the cable\u2019s specs, informing the consumer of what the product is and what it isn\u2019t. This particular cable is no exception. Its fine print is VERY detailed and makes absolutely NO MENTION of 4K! It\u2019s a high quality cable, but it isn\u2019t 4K (it\u2019s just a standard cable). If it matters to you (like me) that the cable be 4K, this isn\u2019t your product! However, if 4K doesn\u2019t matter to you, then I\u2019d recommend it.

{"reviewTitle":"Not compatible with AppleTV 4k running a 4K, 60Hz signal","reviewDescription":"Unfortunately, this cable does not function properly with the AppleTV 4k running at 4K, 60Hz with Dolby Vision connected to an LG C7P TV. Other cables from other manufacturers do work. Apple recommends the Belkin Ultra High Speed HDMI cable, which is not sold in lengths longer than 2 meters.Initially, this cable did pass the cable-check feature of the Apple TV, but then the picture would intermittently be lost while watching shows using various apps like Hulu and YouTube. The behavior exhibited when the signal was lost is similar to what you see when you use a cable that you know not to work (I know because that is where I started).  Substituting a shorter modern HDMI cable (one that shipped with the HTC Vive VR set) worked fine.I don't know whether any 10 feet cable will work using a 4k signal from the Apple TV. I have instead purchased Apple's recommended cable (2x the price for 1\/2 the length) and plan to mount the Apple TV behind the TV set. The AppleTV is pretty small - that will work.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1507161600000}

{"reviewTitle":"These don't last","reviewDescription":"Purchased a bundle of 3 in early 2018. They look well made but do not seem to last. Two of them been plugged to a TV, Nintendo Switch and nVidia Shield TV. Both of the cables stopped displaying any signal after about 2 years.Pinpointing the issue the first time was frustrating, the one on the Switch failed first and a couple of hours were spent fiddling with the dock, the TV, the switch and a computer monitor to rule things out. The cable is pretty much the last thing you would expect to fail out of the blue. Once it failed with the Shield TV it was quicker to figure out the culprit after the previous experience.As for the third cable, it mostly sits in a drawer but it still works. At this point I would suggest getting something more robust and avoiding the potential time spent troubleshooting and replacing cables down the line.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1592092800000}
