{"reviewTitle":"My favorite charging cords","reviewDescription":"I've been using these cords for years and through multiple phones now. They work great with the power block that comes with Samsung galaxys. I'm rough on my main charger. I travel a good bit with it, and even worse, I use it while it's charging a LOT. As most of you know, that leads to the inevitable fraying near the end. These cords handle it super well and typically last me about a year each, even with me having absolutely no regard for the poor thing's well-being.When used with the stock usb-c samsung power block that came with my galaxy s20 ultra, they charge faster than any other charger, hands down (including the cords that come with the phones)....and I'm talking 1% to 100 in less than an hour if you're not using it, and probably less than an hour and a half, even if you're on it the whole time, scrolling through videos and such. I can't speak on other power blocks because my old Samsung one is the only usb-c to usb-c I've ever owned, but I can assure you that any slower charging certainly wouldn't be the fault of the cord. I just reordered a new set last month due to my last cord from a previous order getting the fray of doom, and they are definitely still being made just as well as they were when I got my first round. 10\/10 recommend these over any other cord.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704067200000}
{"reviewTitle":"It\u2019s great","reviewDescription":"I recently purchased the INIU USB C to USB C Cable, and I have been thoroughly impressed with its performance and quality. This cable offers fast charging capabilities and a reliable connection for my devices.The 100W power delivery (PD) feature of this cable is a standout attribute. It allows for high-speed charging, ensuring that my devices are quickly and efficiently powered up. Whether I\u2019m charging my Samsung S22, Note 20, iPad Pro, MacBook, or other compatible devices, this cable delivers the charging speed I need.The 6.6ft length of the cable provides ample reach and flexibility. It gives me the freedom to comfortably use my devices while they\u2019re connected to a power source without feeling restricted. The extra length is especially convenient when I\u2019m charging my device from a wall outlet that may not be in close proximity.The nylon braided construction of the cable enhances its durability and longevity. It feels sturdy and well-made, capable of withstanding daily use and potential tangles. The braided design also adds a touch of style to the cable, making it visually appealing.The USB C to USB C connection ensures a secure and reliable transfer of power and data. The cable fits snugly into the ports of my devices, and I haven\u2019t experienced any connectivity issues. I appreciate that I can confidently rely on this cable for a stable and uninterrupted charging experience.Another feature that I find useful is the inclusion of two cables in the pack. This provides a backup option or allows me to have one cable in multiple locations, such as home and office. It\u2019s a convenient bonus that adds value to the purchase.Overall, the INIU USB C to USB C Cable is a high-quality charging cable that delivers on its promises. Its fast charging capabilities, sturdy construction, and convenient length make it a reliable companion for my devices.

{"reviewTitle":"Durable from a reliable company, Iniu","reviewDescription":"HOW I SELECTED THIS POWER CABLE AMONGST A BILLION OUT THEREThere are so many cables out there, it's hard to know who to trust. Because I bought half a dozen Iniu battery banks over the past few years for myself and as gifts, I was confident in their product. Quality materials, well built and when my battery bank did have a glitch, INIU took care of me with a replacement very quickly. INIU isn't a company you buy from and never hear from again. They'll take care of you.WHICH INIU CABLE THOUGH?INIU does make a few cables so it may be hard to pick. I knew I wanted a 100w one for charging my Macbook Pro M3 base and to be able to use it to charge my wife's Air M2 as well. I purchased two pairs of these exact cables for trips out of the house and to also connect my computer to a docking station I have in my home office.FEATURESThe braided cord makes it so that the cord moves where you want it rather than all crumpled up like those vinyl ones. Black offers a clean look too. Any cord 100w or higher needs to have a special chip in it to make it work and this one has a lit up LED so you know it's working. I also like that the cord has a rubber structured piece between the actual USBC and the cord itself to keep its longevity. The weak point was addressed. Despite the affordable price, INIU did include a quality rubber wrap to keep the cord tucked away when not in use or when traveling.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1702598400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazon\u2019s newest problem child\u2026..it tanks in every respect.","reviewDescription":"I am writing this review as a personal, honest account of the company Iniu and what has been a nightmare of an experience which will never happen again. Cause I will never ever purchase another Iniu product as long as I am alive. This is what I wrote the company and my personal account of what transpired. Amazon was contacted and issued a refund as the norm. That was perfectly fine, but I wanted the company itself to know what I thought of them and below is what happened.More specifically the company customer service itself, the website and the primarily the product under the description of \u201cUSB C Cable, INIU 100W [2-Pack 6.6ft] PD 5A QC Fast Charging USB C to USB C Cable, Nylon Braided Type C Data Cord.\u201d only sold on Amazon, and their customer service, and horrible experience I had with them. They don\u2019t care what you the consumer thinks or says. So be forewarned.First off, I purchased this item on May 4, 2022 and the cables are as described. That isn\u2019t the issue. It goes down from there. They have a non-functioning website. I couldn\u2019t even ask for help or submit my request for help on their website and \u201ccontact us.\u201d I had to send it via email which I found on their website. The support site is non- working.Yes, great hi-definition pictures all over your website are awesome. But if you don\u2019t have an excellent the working\/functioning website, great customer support, and a product that actually does what you say\/works; what do you really have? The answer is nothing. They will continue to upset more and more customers\/consumers as time goes on.What they do indeed have is a non-functioning website. They do have a horrible product (2 different cables that both died within 3 weeks of one another) They do have the worst customer service I\u2019ve ever experienced anywhere, (from all 52 countries, 157 websites, 26 magazines and counting) and last of all items on the checklist being they do have the inability of the customer to ever speak with anyone other then one employee named Lina. Even after requesting it 3 different times. Read below for more. Yes, it gets worse.So I had to copy and paste the email I wrote for support and send it to them manually where I got a auto-reply response from the beginning. I specifically stated to them in my initial email \u201cI suggest you contact me ASAP and do a little more then state \u201cwe will send you 2 replacements at no charge.\u201dI told them from the start \u201cIf your email just says that then you can disregard this email completely and see what happens.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what their auto-reply stated. And unfortunately for them I review electronics for a living and freelance writing goes in magazines\/websites all over the world. Not just Amazon. To prevent anyone from having the same experience I had. Keep reading.Secondly, after I looked up the company they only are logistically partnered on Amazon. The distribution company isn\u2019t Iniu. Second red flag. If I had to guess, these are primarily made in a Chinese sweat shop somewhere and cost is low which should be another flag. Never, ever purchase a deeply discounted product for your expensive electronic items. Especially iPhones and iPads.Yes, they have 11k reviews on Amazon. Don\u2019t be fooled. The company\/customer service is as bad as the product turned out to be. A product that will break in less then 3 weeks. Soon to be a company known for their broken products and terrible customer service.Yes they have this so-called 3 year warranty. But do you really want to keep contacting them 10 times in a year to keep getting replacements? Or spend an extra $10 once and be completely satisfied for 5 years or more.They were not getting the reason why I wanted to speak with a manager. I tried and tried again to get them to understand. He\/she\/ the bot refused to let me speak with anyone (all by email of course) above them.BOTH OF MY CABLES DIED WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF ONE ANOTHER!!! I NOTICED SOME CHARGING VARIATIONS FROM CABLES I SINCERELY TRUST LIKE uGREEN AND MOPHIE, AND EVEN AMAZON BRANDED ELECTRONICS COMING INTO THE GAME.WITH THESE CABLES SOMETIMES MY IPAD CHARGED IN 45 MINUTES, OTHER TIMES IT TOOK 3 HOURS ON BOTH CABLES. BOTH AT THE SAME BATTERY LIFE. THIS IS A DO-NOT-EVEN LOOK-AT-PRODUCT AND COMPANY. THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE BOT\/LINA\/YOU MAY NOT SPEAK WITH ANYONE ELSE BUT LINA. WHO RESPONDS FROM SOMEONE WHO DOESN\u2019T WRITE FROM THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.THEY REFUSE TO LET YOU SPEAK WITH A MANAGER AFTER YOU REQUEST TO OVER AND OVER, AND ALL THEY CAN SAY FOR THEMSELVES AFTER A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, IS \u201cLINA A CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER,\u201d WE WILL ARRANGE TO SEND OUT 2 NEW CABLES IMMEDIATELY.\u201dNo we will not. I would not trust another item from this company Iniu as long as I am alive and beyond editorial reviews. Simply stated if you want a product you can trust with your $1300 iPhone and $1400 iPad DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Go spend the extra $10 and get a cable(s) from a trusted, reputable company where you can count on the product support as much as the product itself.

I bought this cable for use with a MacBook ProPro for work, and it does not deliver the advertised charging speeds.

This is worthy of a 1 star review.I tested the Apple cables and I was able to reach the full 100 watts of charging speed. Meanwhile, these cables only hit 60w, regardless of the battery level of my MacBook Pro. I tested both cables, and both cables in the box capped out at 60w. I am forced to believe that these cables are lying about what they are.Otherwise, these are good cables. The ends are a bit long and rigid, so they wouldn't bend into tight spaces, but that's the only complaint I can think of.

Sometimes they are written in anger by someone who got burned. Sometimes they are written by a direct competitor trying to pad their own position. These are reasons why my experience with this product did not receive a one star rating.  My wife can be reckless with her things. Her Macbook Pro however has withstood years of abuse being on the road in suitcases and day-bags and just about any other parcel that you can imagine.  Recently she said to me that (after several years of use) her original white charging cord had finally given up and cashed it in. She asked if I would get her a replacement. Oh course I would, why wouldn\u2019t I?  Off to Amazon I go. Do a quick search and a quick scroll and happen upon this set of cords. Reviews are good, price is right, they look nice, let\u2019s effin goooo!!!  I buy the cords, they ship as expected and I receive them in a timely manner. Take them out of the package, they look nice, feel durable, appear to be well made. I give them to the wife, she thanks me, and everything is as it should be with the world.  Jump ahead a couple of days, wife says that the cord that I bought for her isn\u2019t working and hasn\u2019t worked at all since she initially tried it out. That\u2019s odd, I think.  So I grab the cord in question and give it a quick once  over. Check out one end, seems fine. Examine the length of the braided jacketing, it checks out. But when I get to the other end to check the jack it seems a little bit wiggly.  well wouldn\u2019t you know that the end just popped right out at the solder joints. This can happen. Rapid manufacturer et. al. mistakes can happen that are difficult to see in QC.  No big deal. I tell her to just grab the other cord and use it. She says that she already had taken it and it too does not work. I figure that is very unlikely and just anomalous. So i take the 2nd cord, inspect it to make sure that everything is intact (which is the case) and decide to try it out on my own Macbook Pro.  So I plug one end into my power supply and the other into the Macbook Pro aaaand it simply does not charge it.  I know that Macs can be picky, especially as it pertains to oem peripherals but honestly, current will flow when a proper connection is made and will not flow when a proper connection is not made. ezpz physics. For whatever reason, with these cords the proper connections were not made and in the end neither cord could be used to charge either Macbook Pro.  Was it just bad luck or did I buy and get sent garbage? I dunno. I do know that I can not recommend purchasing these cords unless you have a very very strong urge to throw something away and you hate your money so much that you will spend it on anything at all just to get rid of it. Though that seems pretty uncommon.At least it didn\u2019t get a 1 star review, right?

The quality is good: The connectors are good, the length is good and the size of the connector works on every device I have tried them on so far - with and without cases. They put up with plenty of abuse from my daughter resting the full weight of her iPad on the cable for hours at a time. I like the LED indicating when the cable is providing power to a device. The only thing that I do NOT like is that the E-Marker (internal chip that is required for cables that support the 100W rating for these cables) report that these cables are USB 3.2 Gen 2 cables. Which they are not. They are missing the Rx and Tx pins that make these any type of USB 3 cable. So while they work great for charging, the E-Marker data should be corrected to properly reflect the cable specification. The cables are properly advertised on Amazon as having USB 2.0 data speeds, so I am still giving them a 5-star rating.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702857600000}

I liked how fast it charged and the LED let me know it was charging.  I mostly used it with an Apple USB-C 20W power adapter, but I also used it with a Hyphen-X 100W power adapter.I ordered this on November 29, 2021 and by July, 2022, it had stopped working.  The LED lights up for a bit, but then turns off.  Sometimes the LED would go on and off intermittently.  I tried cleaning each end a few times with an electronic duster or canned air.  This did not help.  The iPad, when it sees it as plugged in, says it is \"not charging\".  It goes from \"not charging\" to not even recognizing that it is plugged in.  When plugged into the Hyphen-X 100W power adapter, it disrupts power to other devices plugged into the other ports of the same adapter.  I have tried 2 Apple USB-C power adaptors and it does not work with either of them.  I have verified that each power adapter does work fine with another USB-C cable.Update:  3-Year warranty fulfilled!  After posting the above review in early August 2022, I was contacted by someone from INIU service via email (iniu.shop) with an offer to send me a replacement at no cost to me and with no requirement to return the faulty cord.  There is a 3-year warranty on these cables, as they mentioned.  I received a replacement in a few days after I provided my shipping address.  The box contained 2 cables like the original order.

Despite being fairly careful with the cords, they both have stopped working in about 4-6 months.The first cord started having issues (charging light wouldn\u2019t light up, charging would go in and out while plugged in and not moving, only charging if cord was at a VERY specific angle, etc.) after about 4-5 months.I gave up trying to fix it\/get it to work, so I moved on to the 2nd cord. That one also worked for about 5 months as well, before having issues that were similar to the previous cord.Just as I was about to look into getting some replacement cords, I found one angle of the cord that would work, so I taped it in place to my desk and squeezed out another month or so of using it haha. I guess it finally gave out today though as no amount of my finagling with it gets it to work again :(Nothing appears to be wrong or broken looking from the outside, so I\u2019m not sure what the problem is!I really want to be able to recommend these for the length and performance, but if the cords don\u2019t last any longer than the apple brand ones, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it :\/","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1655769600000}

It will not work the other way around, regardless of which end is at the power supply. This tells me the connector internally is cheap and compromised such that the weight of the cable itself allows it to make contact\/connection when used the opposite way that it HAD been used for a month.These look nice. The braid is stiff and seems durable. The LED light is an excellent little plus.But if they're cheap, they're cheap. Will not re-purchase from this brand ever....

I tried it on my macbook pro 16inch with a usb-c tester. With the original apple cable, I was able to get ~100W charging speed, which are confirmed by both the usb-c tester and \"System Report\" tool in MacOS. However, with this cable, it would only reach to 60W, and my 100W charger was recognized as a 60W charger in MacOS too.Regret that I bought this one and missed the return window.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661644800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Probably Good Quality, Definitely Too Stiff","reviewDescription":"Pros:- Excellent connectors- Green LED connection indicator is useful- Built like a tankCons:- Very stiff which makes them hard to coil and awkward to use unless you have a straight line into your device\u2019s USB C port. If the cable isn't lined up straight, then there is no way that there won\u2019t be excessive strain on the port. Having to replace a thinner, more flexible cable is a lot less expensive than having a damaged phone, tablet or laptop.Update:I\u2019ve updated my review from three to four stars. While I still think the cable is a little too stiff to coil small enough for travel, it is working well as a \u201cstraight shot\u201c cable for my new laptop. Also, the company has provided outstanding customer service, which is very important to me. They reached out to me to help resolve my concerns, and seemed to actually care that I\u2019d be satisfied with their products. They certainly succeeded, and I have now purchased from them various chargers and cables.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683504000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Oneplus buyers be aware...  This cables are for PD charging, NOT WARP Charging","reviewDescription":"Warp charging protocols requires 6 Amps to work and this cable \"provided\" up to 5 Amps.My intention with this purchase was to provide my wife's Oneplus 8T with a sturdy and durable 6ft cable so that she keep her phone charged while streaming (she tent to do that when the phone almost out of power). When I tested this INIU cable with her Warp65 charger block and connected to her phone and my Oneplus 7T, two things I noticed: 1 - the phones charging indicator didn't turn on and detected as if I connected an usb-c  headphone device; 2 - The INIU cable led power indicator didn't turn on. So after this test I proceeded to test with a PD65 charger I have for a laptop dock station and the INIU cable worked there in the PD65 charger (it both charged and and turned on the led indicator). The ironical part the I found on this test and cable swapping is that the cable that came with the PD65 charger worked with the Warp65 charger with both Warp65 protocol on the 8T and Warp30 protocol on the 7T. So Oneplus user, if you are looking for a cable that does work with Warp charging protocol (65 and\/or 30) then keep looking elsewhere or buy the OG (read your Warp65 block output capabilities and you will be fine) .For other non-Oneplus users, at least it works as intended on a PD charger, will update later if I encounter any problems. I like the firmness and sturdiness of the cable and the led indicator. But for those who like to play landscape game, I would recommend that you get the ones with the 90 degree angle (INIU sells them too)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1652832000000}

{"reviewTitle":"2nd pack of cables I've ordered in 2 years","reviewDescription":"This order came today after the original 2 pack I bought a few years back had reached the end of their life. If I am being honest, only one needed to be replaced, as it was worn down more buy my own doing. The two originals I bought both are still working perfectly fine. One was frayed buy a puppy, yet still carries a charge. The fact that the originals have lasted this long, despite occasional puppy teeth should speak volumes!Speaking directly about the cables and what I've found (or havent found, so to speak) I haven't found the common breakage or shorting near the cable heads where it meets the cable itself. I haven't found the USB-C tips to become loose or only charge if you position it a certain way. I'll even go as far to say I haven't found myself stumbling around in the dark looking for the end so I can plug my phone in without turning lights on, nor have I found myself grabbing handfuls of air when my alarm goes off at 4am for shift, thanks to the light the charging head of the cable emits, allowing me to reach for my phone. The light itself is not blinding, nor is it too dim to be seen. It is absolutely perfect as is and has not missed a day since I bought them.The cables are able to effectively handly my Samsung 65w charging block, as well as the 45w and lower. They have always been able to deliver safe and effective charging to my phone and Galaxy Book3 Pro 360, thanks to the long length of both cables. It is also because of their generous length that long road trips are that much less of a worry, when one cable plugged in beneath the radio has enough length to reach the back seat comfortably.Overall, 10\/10 product and can't think of any negatives. It will be a sad day if these aren't available 2-3 years down the road because finding a replacement will be next to impossible. Best charging cables I've ever owned and should be essential for anyone using Samsung devices or have the latest iPhone with the USB-C ports.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696636800000}
