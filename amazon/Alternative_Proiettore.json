{"reviewTitle":"Great little projector!","reviewDescription":"The projector is very small and compact.  Easy to transport from room to room or back yard parties.  Very user-friendly operation and on-screen menu to select type of input.  The room needs to be very dark for best picture and the sound on the projector Is adequate but can be greatly enhanced by adding a bluetooth or wired speaker using a 3mm connection.  HDMI provides best picture but can also use pictures and video from a USB or TF camera card.  Very good projector for the money, especially with current price reduction.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724544000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Absolutely Fantastic Portable Projector for the price","reviewDescription":"\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Absolutely Fantastic Portable Projector!I recently purchased the TMY Mini Projector, and I couldn't be more thrilled with my decision! The quality of this projector is outstanding, especially considering its compact size. The 1080P Full HD resolution delivers crisp and clear images, whether I'm watching movies indoors or hosting an outdoor movie night. The upgraded Bluetooth feature is a game-changer, allowing seamless connectivity with my smartphone and other devices.Setup was a breeze, and I appreciate the variety of connection options available, including HDMI and USB, which makes it versatile for all my needs. The included screen is a nice bonus, and it really enhances the overall viewing experience. Despite its small size, this projector packs a punch and is easily portable, making it perfect for travel or moving between rooms.Overall, this projector exceeded my expectations in every way. If you're in the market for a reliable, high-quality projector for both indoor and outdoor use, I highly recommend the TMY Mini Projector. It's worth every penny!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724544000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Turned out better than I thought!","reviewDescription":"Ok so when I got this I was thinking it was going to be used strictly inside my garage office as a 4th computer monitor and it wasn\u2019t going to be good for much else. I quickly realized this projector is much better than I thought and decided to set it up as an outdoor backyard patio movie projector! If you see my video ive posted I show you how easy and portable it is. Because it is lightweight and compact and works with a basic camera\/light tripod it means you don\u2019t need to purchase a separate stand. The 1\/4\u201d thread\/screw at the bottom works with most camera tripods. For under $100 you\u2019re getting great value, great picture quality, and easy setup. The Bluetooth feature is very nice as well and I was able to connect my two Sonos Roam speakers and use it as a pair of surround speakers. Also the fact that I am using an Amazon fire stick with it makes watching movies and shows very convenient. It is a simple and sleek design that goes great with our white\/modern house setup. I am very happy with this purchase and feel it offers great entertainment value. My final thoughts is if you have a controlled environment where you\u2019re able to keep the area dark, you\u2019re going to get a very good picture quality experience. Bright rooms will not do as well regardless if your have a good screen or not. Overall 5 stars for being affordable yet producing a quality video\/picture!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724630400000}
{"reviewTitle":"You will be happy if you have the right expectations","reviewDescription":"This projector is excellent for the price. I paid $99. (A $20 coupon was available for some reason which brought it down to $99 from $119)For night-time viewing with no grand expectations you will be pleased.It got a genuine \"wow\" from the wife and kids. They've watched a few hours on it so far with delight.We have an Apple TV plugged into it.NOTEIf you are the kind of person that will fret over non-premium features then you may need to step up to something at least 6x the price (but ideally >20x the price) to avoid triggering your nerves. This is a fantastic budget buy... don't buy it with the wrong expectations.SOUND:Like other reviewers I expected garbage sound quality from the internal speaker and was therefore surprised that it was similar to a half-decent little portable USB speaker. I plan to use external speakers but the internal one didn't get any negative comments from the initial audience (of undiscerning family members) which is a pleasant bonus. Great to just be able to throw up a movie with almost zero setup.FOCUS & KEYSTONE:It has a mechanical keystone. You shift a roller and it presumably tilts one of the lenses inside (probably all-plastic internal components made with the kind of manufacturing tolerances you'd expect at this price point). On the plus side, this mechanical keystone means you can quickly straighten up the image on the wall +\/- 15 degrees. However, you will discover that the image cannot be uniformly focused when keystone is being used. If you use keystone you will have to focus the center of the image and tolerate some focus imperfection at the top and bottom of the frame.The focus is also a mechanical roller. Even at a perfectly level projection angle (i.e. no keystone, where the bottom of the projected image is precisely in line with the lens of the projector) you may need to tolerate some minor focus imperfections. I don't use any keystone on mine and the extremities are less crisp than the rest of the image. I can notice it when projecting text (e.g. the text at the top-right of the Netflix interface) but it is minor and doesn't impair the experience watching tv\/movies. When I pointed it out to my wife she didn't care. Nobody cares.If you buy this expecting optics developed in a Swiss engineering lab with professional grade tolerances you should probably take another look at the price... it's not than kind of product.THROW SIZE:There is no mechanical zoom. We have it mounted on a wall in a room that is 11 feet to the opposite wall (i.e. the *back* of the projector is 11 feet from the projection wall). At this distance our image has a diagonal of ~106 inches.There is a digital \"zoom\" function in the menus that let you reduce the picture size... probably at the cost of some fidelity. Good to have that feature in a pinch but we aren't using it.BRIGHTNESS:At 11 feet out the brightness is decent for watching at night. That is all that we want it for. Again, the wife and kids were stoked.You will probably not want to use it with the lights on (washes it out) and certainly not in any daylight, so don't buy it to replace an all-purpose TV. Also, don't try to make side-by-side comparisons with your LCD\/LED\/OLED TV... contrast in dark scenes will be far inferior and brightness in general will be far less uniform. If you project an entirely \"black\" screen you will see a range of slightly lighter and darker areas. Again, nobody in my house noticed or cared and I was happy to count the money I saved. To get a projector that will work with lots of ambient light and produce a very uniform brightness you really need to jump a long way up the price ladder. What you get out of this projector is very solid for the money.MANUAL & ACCESSORIES:I haven't tried out the included basic projection screen. It's a soft fabric with eight metal eyelets around it (one in each corner and one half-way along each side). They ship it with 8 plastic hooks and 8 tabs of double-sided tape so you can mount it on a wall without drilling. It has a black outer border. Seems fine. Nice touch including it... adds to the crazy good value of this product.The remote is fine (uses 2x AAA).They include all the cables you need: VGA, HDMI, power (US style). They all work.The included manual is clear and covers most of what you might want to know. TMY invites you to contact them by email for support. I haven't needed to do that yet so I can't say how responsive they are.OTHER COMMENTSFan noise is comparable to other projectors of this size (in my experience) and so is no cause for special praise or complaint. We're happy with it.I can't comment on the color fidelity etc. because I'm somewhat color blind. All I can say is, you see vibrant colors, there is some image configurability in the menus and nobody had anything bad to say about the colors. I'm sure if you started testing it's color space you'd find all kinds of limitations but... again... nobody cares.I've asked my teenage son what he thought of the color just now and his answer was \"I don't think any of us have any problem with the projector dad. It's great.\"TMY *are* incentivizing reviews on Amazon by offering a gift. There is a little insert card in the box along with the manual. It says \"Happy with this purchase: 1. Share your experience by leaving an honest Review\" and then it shows a picture of five stars. So I guess they are not specifically asking people to leave a five star review to get a reward but they are hinting at it pretty strongly. They also say \"Not happy with this purchase: 1. Please give us a chance before you leave a 1-3 star review on Amazon or return the product\" and then they ask you to please contact them directly to get a solution\/replacement\/refund etc. I think it's kind'a fair enough? Not much different to what hotels do to try getting their online reviews up. I'd decided to leave a review before I saw this card... I mention it in case people reading the reviews would like to know of potential influence.I have only had the projector a couple of days so I can't comment on longevity. They do claim to offer a 3 year warranty. I will update my review if it bombs out though.SUMMARYIt works and it's mind-bending value. How can you produce something like this profitably for $99 let alone ship it and let Amazon take their cut? Taking the family out for dinner and movie (back when that was allowed) would easily consume that amount of cash. I just hope it lasts. Very happy so far.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"1,223 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1599955200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Success! Solved my problem!","reviewDescription":"I was so close to returning this. I bought it, because my place has a lot of wonderful windows and art, but leaves no room for a TV. Also, when I sit at my art table, I have to keep my laptop way across the room on my bed to get the best wifi signal, so it is very hard to see. So a friend suggested getting a projector! I could also put it away when not using it which was ideal for a small space. Anyway  I bought this because it said I could use it with my laptop and the hdmi cord it comes with. Unfortunately, I am not a tech guru, and realized uoon its arrival that my computer is old and only has a VGA slot. (My IT brother told me that. Should have asked him first.) Anyway, he valiently tried to help me order two cords that adapted the VGA to HDMI and he spent an hour trying to make my computer accept this decade old tech difference, to no avail. Then I realized the product had said it accepts things like a Roku stick and I happened to have a coupon for that, so I bought one. For anyone who does this, learn from my trial and error: at some point the Roku setup requires you to pair your remote's volume capabilities \"to the TV\". BUT as previously stated, I do not have one. So after calling Roku and searching online to no avail, out of desperation, I continued with the pairing process by pretending I had a Samsung TV I was trying to pair it with. It finally gave up and asked me if I wanted to skip this step for now. (Yes, PLEASE) So it finally let me get to the main Roku page. I also downloaded the app and use the remote in that instead. The projector's remote works very well for the volume too. Anyway, I was able to hang the projector screen\/cloth it gave me on my fireplace mantle and the projector works great! I did art for 3 hours. The sound is great, the image good (During the day with my window blinds open while doing art is kind of hard to see, but better than my previous tiny laptop view). At night, the experience is like being at the movies in my own studio! Now I can have friends over too and we won't have to squeeze on my twin bed trying to watch a movie on my laptop. This projector has solved so many of my show\/movie watching issues now that I figured out how to use it with Roku. It was an uphill battle for me as an unlikely tech person, but I refused to give up. I told my brother he is helping me move beyond 1995 tech knowledge. But the biggest issue for me was that 1. my laptop was too old and didn't have hdmi and 2. the Roku set up sent me in circles trying to pair the remote until I pretended to pair it with a fake TV. Then getting the app remote up. So, those are tips for any other non-techie people out there. The projector itself is very easy to use and works great!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"31 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722816000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very pleased 1 day after purchase","reviewDescription":"Overall i am very pleased with it especially as an iphone user. I usually prop my phone on a remote to watch youtube when trying to sleep, i thought of this projector as a cool solution.Pros & Cons:-Pro: very good image quality-possible Con: I only tested it from a distance of behind my bed which i would approximate as maybe 2.5-3 meters and in a dark room, im not sure the projected light is strong enough if i use it outside in the moonlit sky but the weather is terrible so i am yet to try that or the sheet to project on thats included with it.-Pro & Con: the power cable is a Type A which i dont use in the middle east and which i despise as the slightest bit of tension would pull it out making it an electric hazard BUT the power cable is detachable (it can be removed), i was able to buy another cable (Type G) from a phones and electronics shop which is what i hope is available as an option when buying products from oversees so that is a big Pro for me.-Con: Audio; the speaker is strong but at high volume is not very clear which is expected for a projector at this price but if you\u2019re sitting in a quiet room and casually watching a video on youtube or something or on netflix that doesnt require epic level audio then its really good when you lower the volune a bit and adjust the Bass level in the settings using the remote, otherwise you can connect speakers through the AUX port or with bluetooth which means you\u2019ll get that epic audio if you want.Tip for Iphone connection: you will need a \u201cLightning to HDMI adapter\u201d, i bought a cheap one which didnt work so you have to buy the original because apple products will detect fake products when you plug them in\u2026 OR you can buy what i did, i didnt know it existed till today (i will include the pic), its a wireless connector \u201cwireless display dongle\u201d, i plug it in and press the button on it and it will show up in my wifi settings like its an option as a wifi router without having to plug into the phone which i think is what makes it work.Anyways, story of my life written here \ud83d\ude02Overall very happy with it and would recommend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724716800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Almost a great product.","reviewDescription":"The TMY Mini Projector comes across as a budget-friendly option with a few pros and cons that could make or break your experience, depending on your needs.Setup & Usability: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2606The setup process was refreshingly simple. Navigating the menu was straightforward, and the HDMI port made connecting my Roku stick a breeze. It\u2019s a plug-and-play kind of device, which is always appreciated. The included screen was nothing to write home about, and the adhesive for the hooks was dried out and unusable. This was a disappointing aspect, as it added an unnecessary hassle to the setup process.Image Quality: \u2b50\u2b50\u2606\u2606\u2606This projector offers a native 720p resolution at 60Hz, with the ability to upscale to 1080p. In dark environments, the image quality is adequate for casual viewing. However, any ambient light in the room quickly washes out the picture, making it difficult to see clearly. This limitation makes it less versatile for use in different lighting conditions.Sound Quality: \u2b50\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606Unfortunately, sound is where the TMY Mini Projector really struggles. The built-in speakers are quiet, and the audio becomes significantly distorted once you pass 50% volume. The non-linear volume scale is also problematic, with noticeable loudness only kicking in around 80%, but by then, the distortion is unbearable. Bluetooth audio didn\u2019t fare any better; it was equally distorted at higher volumes. I had to resort to using the Roku app connected to a soundbar to achieve acceptable audio quality.Portability: \u2b50\u2b50\u2606\u2606\u2606One of the highlights of this projector is its portability. It\u2019s lightweight and compact, making it easy to move around. However, this portability comes at a cost\u2014the lack of adjustability. Manual focus and manual up-and-down keystone adjustments are available, but there\u2019s no way to correct for left-right off-center alignment, making it challenging to get the picture level without some finagling.Fan Noise: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50On the plus side, the fan noise is quiet and unobtrusive. It\u2019s not audible over the show you\u2019re watching, which is a welcome relief in a budget projector.Features: \u2b50\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606There are no standout features to speak of, which is expected at this price point. The projector\u2019s manual focus and keystone adjustments are basic, and there are no advanced options for correcting off-center alignment.Value for Money:\u2b50\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606The value of the TMY Mini Projector depends heavily on what you\u2019re looking for. If your kids are clamoring for a projector to use for fun movie nights, this could be a great entry-level option. However, if you\u2019re in the market for a TV replacement or a serious home theater setup, this projector falls short in several key areas, including brightness, audio quality, and adjustability.Final Thoughts:This projector has its share of issues, from distorted Bluetooth audio and a scratched lens right out of the box to disappointing brightness that struggles even in moderately lit rooms. While it\u2019s an affordable and portable option, I can\u2019t recommend it as a replacement for a TV or as a serious entertainment device. For casual, dark-room use, especially by kids, it might serve its purpose. But for anything more, you\u2019ll likely be left wanting more.Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2606\u2606\u2606 (2\/5)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723507200000}

It's a toy.","reviewDescription":"This was to be used alongside an Epson EX5210 projector (rated at 2800 lumens, a ~$600 unit) for backdrops to musical performance. Despite being rated at \"9500 lumens\", this projector at max brightness struggled to compare to the Epson set as low as it can go. (There's a great review by Hermetia illucens that talks about \"ANSI Lumens\" that explains why this is. Color rendering is pretty terrible too. The keystone correction is really limited, so that if you try to ceiling mount at 8' and project on a wall, you won't be able to get the top and bottom in focus with the center of the image. There is no skew correction to speak of, so it has to be dead-on straight as well. The image quality and brightness is fine I guess for home movies in absolute darkness, but you can forget about using this alongside any kind of other lights, in a business setting, or any use case that requires off-axis adjustment.I should have known better given the price, but we had a limited budget and had to give it a shot. I had low expectations and was still disappointed.Pros:- cheap- lightweight- low power- \"simple\" aka almost no configuration optionsCons:- dim- feels flimsy- bad color rendering, washed out- almost no configuration options- no skew correction- very limited keystone correction- lots of slop in the focus ring, hard to focus, easily goes out of focus with any jostle- fan is kinda loudDidn't bother to test sound or bluetooth.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1708387200000}

It looks well built, doesn't feel flimsy, but it's compact, which I like. It is very easy to use, comes with a clear manual, HDMI cable, a remote control, power cable, and a simple screen. The screen is very transparent, and honestly, the picture is way better on my white wall.The picture is clear enough, it is visibly blurred at the edges, though. I do recommend using a tripod, because any movement of the device changes the clarity, so you have to adjust it again.The strength of the lumens is not so high, so one should be in a completely dark room to see well, but for the price this is satisfying. Do not imagine super bright image as one on a TV. Actually, it does give a little bit of cinematic feeling over, because if the lightly darkened colours.It connected very easy with my MacBook Air wia HDMI, but I couldn't connect any of the three Android phones at home (maybe one should use a Chromecast). I had no problem with connecting external speaker via Bluetooth. The sound of the projector itself is not strong enough.The ventilator makes an audible sound, but it does the cooling job well enough. Again, as a budget solution, I would recommend this projector.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721174400000}

I almost returned this, but it was a great price and the concept was so fun.  We ended up purchasing an additional fire stick to use with it and that worked very well.

But we did have to order a tall tripod because otherwise we\u2019re stacking insane amounts of books up to put the projector high enough to avoid the blurring problem.Biggest con, really, is needing extra equipment to make this decent. Besides a tripod, we also had to replace the included screen, which is a joke and did not work at all, no matter what we did. It\u2019s thinner than a bedsheet and distorts the image unless you put it flat against a light-colored wall\u2026and then why do you need a screen at all? We ended up springing for a retractable tripod screen that cost more than the projector itself did. MUCH better.Anyway, overall we\u2019re happy with this. Even with the added cost of screen and tripod, it was a much lower cost than other options.

The quality of the build was quite good for the price (when I received it, it was on sale for under 70 USD total) and I was impressed with the picture quality, which was bright and clear.For my use case, I need the image to spread out across the wall with a short focal length, and I was happy that it will be able to do so. (For those of you who want to know, at 8 ft the image spreads out to roughly 80 inches, which is plenty for what I need it for).My only issue with the product is that the edges can be blurry, especially when spread across a wall.

I'd seen them all over Tiktok and the like, but they never struck me as anything I'd want or use. Until I was hearing about this one from my friend. So with my first paycheck of my first job, I decided to try it.Now I'm not here to sound like it changed my way of thinking and made me contemplate sweet existence, but having the ability to have a screen, that doesn't have 3 Dimensional space, that can be either very large on a room wall, very small display somewhere, or even being a monitor positioned directly upward above my bed, this has to be the neatest thing I've had in a bit. It's lightweight, meaning you can throw it and a power cord in a bag easy, it's smooth at 60Hz, not 30, and being 1080p means that it's visible from close or objectively far away distances.As pictured, it's still bright in full room light conditions, and blacked out lights off, where it's more vivid, great versatility.I personally love this projector.

{"reviewTitle":"Good projector for the price","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve been using this projector for about 1 month now, find it to be very useful as I don\u2019t want to mount a TV to the wall of the bedroom. I have the projector sitting level on a wall mounted shelf right above my bed. It shoot out and projects a 100in screen right in front of me. I watch tv at night and the light from actual tvs is very bright so having the projector throw the light onto the wall instead of my eyes helps with sleeping too if I wanna leave a show on and sleep. The sound it makes is a pretty quiet whir, I can\u2019t sleep without a fan making noise so it adds another hum to your room to fall asleep to and if you\u2019re watching in the daytime it also isn\u2019t too loud. I\u2019ll say you really can\u2019t watch this in the daytime, it\u2019s not bright enough for it unless you have blackout curtains. It works best at night or a closed room. The quality is wonky like sometimes the top and bottom will be fuzzy but the middle is clear. It\u2019s not the greatest video quality but it\u2019s doable and I enjoy watching shows\/movies on this. Speakers will fray the sound if you raise the volume too loud, I keep it at 18 and it sounds really good. You\u2019re best friend is going to be a google chromecast tv dongle and remote. The chromecast remote will let you avoid using the projector remote as you can program the Google chromecast remote to turn off\/on, change volume, and select HDMI as input with it.

{"reviewTitle":"Not what they described","reviewDescription":"The old 8 MM movie projectors with 25 to 50 watt halogen lamps gave a tolerable image on a silver screen about five feet wide. We got used to it, as 16 MM film was expensive for home use.For a toy home VIDEO projector this one is OK and significantly better than an 8 MM film projector in a number of ways, but there is a problem with the brightness of the output as described.This explanation may get a little geeky, but in the end you will see why the ratings given to projectors are useless. The consumer is led to believe that the brightness of a projector output is rated by a standard measure of \"lumens.\" There is some deception in that. A real \"lumen,\" as described in my ancient high school physics book is \"The amount of visible light flux which falling normally on one square foot of area will produce an illuminance of one foot-candle.\" Translated, light a common candle made of whale fat, hold a sheet of paper that is one foot in height and one foot in width exactly one foot away from that candle, and the light falling on the paper is (Ta-Da!) a foot-candle and a lumen. Two candles - twice as much light. Simple.Look at the box a light bulb comes in. Somewhere on it will be a lumen rating. As an easy example, an old 60 watt screw-in incandescent light bulb puts out about 600 lumens. So since this projector claims to have 7500 lumens it should be super-bright, right? It is in fact no where near capable of outputting that many lumens.I mentioned that I had purchased three video projectors. My main one is a solid BenQ projector with a halogen lamp similar to one you might see used in an art gallery to illuminate a painting. That projector has a rated output of 3,000 lumens. It projects onto my 14' diagonal screen with a brightness that is easily equal to what I was used to in movie theatres. I have been more than satisfied with its performance.My second projector purchase was a little Crenova I bought to play around with. It is an LED projector (meaning the light bulb in it is a long lasting and forgiving LED) and has a rating of 1200 lumens. I would put that rating as inflated, but would not be surprised if it in fact put out 800 real ANSI lumens. I knew it wasn't going to be great shakes.Now we come to the projector in this review. It is rated at 7500 lumens. To compare the three projectors, I just now projected the same movie from the same source onto my 14' diagonal screen, using each of the three projectors. The BenQ, at 3,000 lumens filled the entire screen with gorgeous brilliant images, even with ambient light.The little Crenova, at 1200 lumens made a barely acceptable image on about half the screen (8' diagonal)This TMY projector, brand new, put out an image that was about twice as bright as the Crenova, but less than a third the brightness of the BenQ with a six year old halogen lamp in it.So what is going on? The definition of \"lumen\" is the problem. The BenQ, I suspect, used the original definition of lumen in an honest measurement environment. The little LED projectors use a different lumen called an \"ANSI lumen.\" The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) decreed a different lumen measurement to be used in evaluating projectors. Unfortunately, rather than calling the new measurement \"SquintHard\" or something other than lumen, they co-opted the name, and stuck an \"ANSI\" in front of it. Carton designers have no reason to know a lumen is different than an ANSI lumen, and \"lumen\" gets stuck on the box and in advertising today.So what is an ANSI lumen? - apparently whatever you want. Supposedly it is the noticeable difference between a 100% white, a 95% white, and a 90% white that a projector puts on a screen in nine different locations, where the differences are just noticeable, with the screen size taken into account via a formula. Try to get the actual IT7.215 ANSI spec sheet and you run into a paywall. Gee, how consumer friendly...I can't say that a 7500 (ANSI) lumen rating is a lie, but I can say that some people in product testing are troglodytes, eat lots of carrots and can see in the dark, while most of us slog along as average folks with developing cataracts and other issues.Bottom line - do NOT believe the ANSI lumen ratings of any of the LED projectors as a meaningful method of comparison. My BenQ projector uses almost 300 watts in operation, with the bulk of that going to power the lamp and cooling. If you want light out, you have to put power in. If you want bright, understand that you may need to trade off and accept some bulk and heat. OTOH, if you want an inexpensive toy for kids or to use on a back porch while you swat madly at mosquitoes until giving up and going inside, the LED projectors may work for you.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"138 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665360000000}

{"reviewTitle":"My Boyfriend and I love this set!","reviewDescription":"The projector and screen both work very very well for turning your room\/living room into an In home theater. The projector itself does have a decent speaker. The sound quality is pretty good and does get super loud. if you\u2019re looking for more of the theater experience, I would definitely recommend connecting via Bluetooth to either a sound bar or speaker. The picture quality is definitely not 4k, but more along the lines of your average priced TV. It looks great on both our wall and the screen included. I wasn\u2019t looking for anything fancy, so if that\u2019s you, this is definitely a must buy!  With coupons and a sale, I only payed $56 (originally listed for $99.99). Definitely super affordable and a great enhancement to movie night.

{"reviewTitle":"New review","reviewDescription":"**Updated reviewI definitely have to change my review somewhat on here.After I posted my first review,  the company reached out to me,  and offered a newer, updated version of their projector.  It has bluetooth capabilites, etc.Now, while this projector was a little more difficult to set up, due to everything being in Chinese,  and requires mirroring on your phone,  I managed to set it up. Picture was good.However,  if you use your phone,  plan on not being able to use it, if you're having movie night,  as it will (obviously) mirror what you're looking at, seeing, etc.I did not love trying to set this up and get it going.  It may be easier for someone else that is tech savvy.BUT,  I did reach out to the company with my new review,  told them my issues, and they gladly refunded my money.  The customer service was phenomenal, and they were patient with me,  as it took me a few days to try to use the new one (due to work and trying to move).  With all this being said,  I would Not hesitate to try to buy from them again!! They kept in touch too see how things were going,  and when I told them my issues,  they were on it!!Again,  maybe I'm just not technically inclined,  and may work easier for someone who is.  Regardless,  thumbs way up for their awesome service!!I honestly thought I was buying a projector with Bluetooth in it. Somehow after researching and reading reviews..I missed that it did not. Swore I read that it did. So that's on me.  I have not taken it out of the box until last night,  after purchasing it Months ago.... to realize it's not what I wanted.  I had to take my firestick out of the TV and hook it up to projector, etc.  Its not super loud,  but I'm sure you could connect to a speaker to make it louder, especially if you're gonna use it outside. Picture is just OK.  I would've returned it, had I set it up immediately and used it. Again, on me.  So I will just try to sell it,  and look for a different projector with Bluetooth, etc.  The reviews were good, and trust me,  read a lot, on a lot of different projectors, and decided this was would be good.  This was is not for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1678492800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Nice entry level projector","reviewDescription":"This is a good little projector for what it is.  Don't expect movie theater brightness, and definitely don't expect high quality sound, but if you want to send an image up on a 10 foot screen in a nearly completely dark room, youve got a fun night ahead of you!I've played with numerous \"low cost\" projos over the years, many of them claim to offer all the bells and whistles, some say they can connect to your wi-fi and allow you to stream from your media server (nope, still haven't found one that does that), but this one looked like it was going to be focused on projection instead of all the other gimmicks.The brightness is better than most of the low cost models.  I did the basic setup in a daylit dining room and was able to see the entire viewing area without terrible washout.  Darkness and use of the provided screen looks generally adds to the experience.  The video quality from a 720p source video projected onto a roughly 8 foot viewing area was on par with \"movie theater\" at a viewing distance of about 20 feet.Somewhat disappointing is the inability for the projector to pass AC3 sound, which almost ALL videos online have now (depending on where you get your online videos).  If you are using a USB drive for your source video, there's no way to change the audio source.  If using something like a firestick, change the output sound to PCM so you can pass the audio.  I honestly do not like \"non Dolby\" audio, so I developed a work around by using a rasp Pi media controller to send the video to the projector and the audio to an external surround sound controller.  This would be a more than exceptional setup if this was a permanent mounted projector, but honestly, this isn't that sort of rig.For the casual user, this may work out.  if you can get an OTG cable for your phone and send your screen to the projector, maybe..  if you want an affordable setup for yard movie nights for the kids, this is a good deal.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710115200000}

I'll take this for the price I paid all day long. The pic is with some daylight peeking in too, so guessing night will be great.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the Bluetooth to external audio connects\/pairs ok, but no sound is generated. In fact it's silent because the projector volume turns off because it's connected to the Bluetooth device, but no sound.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694304000000}

But the customer service team was good enough to reach out and send me the upgraded version of this projector, which comes with wifi, Bluetooth, a quieter fan, and brighter picture. Customer service is pretty great from this company.The fan is loud. There is an option to update the software, but no instructions on how. No where can I find a website to download software for this projector. I also can't find a list of supported file types to play from USB or TF. It seems to support some mp4 videos but not others. The speakers are very quiet. You will absolutely need external speakers. Also don't be fooled by the 1080p support. It seems to only be native 720p. The upgraded version with Bluetooth and wifi might be better but this the one I got. You will also need something like a fire stick to stream Netflix, etc. There's no built in wifi in this version. The remote works but it seems to be IR instead of RF so you gotta be pointed at the right spot to use it. But it does work ok if you aren't expecting a lot. Also the price jumped up by like $15 right after I ordered it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1662422400000}

EXTERNAL SPEAKERS WOULD ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM almost completely4. RemoteWhile the remote is flimsy it works and unless you chew it or throw it it not an issue. IT MESSED UP MY LED LIGHTS.

{"reviewTitle":"Bought primarily for RV use","reviewDescription":"This projector is a great price with the discount coupon and performs as expected. Keep in mind it's an inexpensive piece of equipment, so you're not going to get amazing. I gave 4 stars simply to reflect that fact. We bought this to use with our RV and outside on the garage. We've only tested it thus far and the test went well. The black contrast is lacking, but that's not surprising as it's a budget item. The sound is ok, but can be made great with an external speaker. We recommend the external speaker. We successfully wire connected the projector to an Android tablet watching a movie over wifi. We had zero issues with lag and the Android device recognized the projector without issue. We have not attempted to use with an Apple device as we don't have the proper cable for USB to lightning. For now, we plan to use this with the Android devices in our home.Our primary use for this system will be with our RV. We opted to forgo a tv in the RV since it goes against our intentions behind why we have the RV and everyone already has a tablet they can download a show to before we leave home for those times the weather forces us inside. The screen that comes with is rather transparent, so we recommend using it on a solid surface to prevent bleed through of the design behind. We plan to attach it with suction cups to the exterior wall of the RV. We can also use it inside the RV in a similar manner.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1619222400000}

The bottom right corner is never in focus, but it\u2019s not enough to take away from the experience. The built in speaker buzzes and crackles during most speaking parts and therefore we have to use CC subtitles. Currently in the market to buy speakers with a compatible headphone attachment so that we can actually hear the words clearly. The screen that it came with is nice. Only used it twice, as our walls are plaster, and the double sided tape for the hooks fall off the wall, and take pieces of the wall with it. We lost the remote shortly after using it the first couple of times, so it\u2019s nice that there are buttons in the actual projector. We love that we can plug our Amazon Fire Stick into it. Overall, not a bad purchase for the price.**Update: After creating a review, customer service, seeing I mentioned we lost our remote, contacted me and shipped me a new remote, free of charge.

I was not able to connect my cell phone to the projector.  I need a different cable for that.  But I used the HDMI cable to connect my laptop to the projector in just a few minutes.  I wanted an inexpensive projector as I just did not want my cats pawing at my TV screen.  The field of flowers in the second photo IS muted (the bee is a better representation of the color).  The color was really a lot better than I expected.  I have it set about as small as it can go.  I have not set up the screen yet.It is nice that the bee's buzzing sound is sent to the projector.  I can turn the volume way down to avoid being driven insane.  The fan on the projector is relatively loud, though.  It would have to be tuned out if you were watching a movie.The remote does not have batteries, which works for me as I use rechargeable batteries and am glad to spare the land fill two AAAs.For what I paid, I'm impressed so far.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701302400000}

Comes with thin screen, would be great if used against a solid color wall. Has eyelet holes to tack into place. I used with a tripod backdrop stand and it worked well outsideThe only reason for not a full rating is the fact that I was not able to set up Bluetooth video as the instructions indicate (Apple phone), I could just be doing it incorrectly.

I don't want to get black out curtains so I just watch TV in the living room during the day. The remote works fine. My projector did not come with a lens cover and the first one I ordered from this company. Also did not come with a lens cover. I will say I connect mine with a Roku and when I do the screen projecting through Apple Mirroring the sound is delayed, so I just do it through Roku.

{"reviewTitle":"This projector does exactly what it says, and looks great!","reviewDescription":"I have wanted a projector for years, but the price for these products seemed stuck at $600 for a decade.Finally though the technology is at a point where there is a lot of healthy competitors and it\u2019s leading to great budget projectors with good features at the right price.I purchased this projector on prime day. My expectations were low as I did not think something so low in price would be capable of a decent picture. I was wrong. Very wrongThis projector looks great for sports. Track, baseball, soccer football etc all look good on this. I even held a fight night party outside for my friends on this and it looked great. Picture quality wise, it falls somewhere between 720p and 1080 and honestly I\u2019m fine with that. I use this with an 84 inch screen so when you think about it your getting a device capable of displaying an hd image up to 200 inches screen size for less than $100.00 usd. WoW!There are 2 downsides though for this price. No Bluetooth. While it does have hdmi and usb inputs, Bluetooth really is missed once you start hooking things up.When you first get this projector, the dark backgrounds of some movies are way to dark and the whites (like a boxing ring white) were way to bright. Luckily, you can customize the picture settings with the remote that comes with this to balance it out.Some reviews said the projector is loud but honestly once your show or movie starts you don\u2019t notice it.Other reviews stated the built in audio on the projector is not good which I disagree with. If your using this indoors it gets the job done. Outdoors I would recommend cheap $10-20.00 usb bookshelf speakers.  Leta be honest, the audio on $800 4k TVs these days is awful and it\u2019s almost mandatory you get a sound bar. The fact this can outdo those sets for 10% of the price says a lot.Finally, this comes with a real manual. It\u2019s in English and the manual actually is useful. It\u2019s short, 4 pages in length and is refreshing. I bought a tv for my parents last year and after hooking it up we spent 30ish minutes downloading updates and creating accounts just to use it. With this projector, you turn it on, plug it in, adjust the lens as needed and enjoy your show!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"83 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1659830400000}

However, when I connected the provided HDMI cable to my laptop, it showed \"No source detected.\" I tried multiple devices and different cables, but nothing worked.Believing the unit might be defective, I returned it and requested a replacement, but I am still hopeful. The replacement arrived quickly, and I was impressed by the excellent customer service. With high expectations, I set up the new projector and connected it to my devices. This time, everything worked perfectly!The picture quality is fantastic, and I'm thrilled with the performance of the replacement unit. The brightness and clarity exceeded my expectations, making movie nights a joy. The projector is easy to use, and the connectivity issues I initially faced are now entirely resolved.Overall, I'm beyond satisfied with my purchase and the excellent customer service I received. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to request a replacement, as the company stands by its products and ensures customer satisfaction. Highly recommended!Original Review:Saw this projector with many positive reviews. So, I had high hopes from the start. It was also the deal of the day (or whatever Amazon calls it). Came in within 2-days. I ensured I had all the proper cables I would use to connect to this amazing high-review projector. I plugged it right up, started purring and working great. I connected the provided HMDI cable to my laptop. \"No source detected.\" Hmmm...maybe the cable isn't of good quality, so I grabbed one I used to connect my laptop to my home hub...still \"No source detected.\" Let's try the USB-C to HMDI cable for my Samsung Tablet. Nope! Samsung Phone Nope. Okay, Google Chromebook. NOPE!!!Nothing I plugged into it worked. I went through five devices and three input sources, and still, \"No source detected.\" Okay, this one may be defective; send this one back and receive the new one unboxed (with high expectations still). Plug everything up, \"No source detected.\" I even ordered a new HDMI and USB-C to HMDI cable and nothing. Please do yourself a favor and go with another brand; nothing worked for my connections and what I was trying to connect (tablet, Chromebook, laptop, cell phone).The picture was nice, but that's where it stopped.

{"reviewTitle":"Pleasantly surprised","reviewDescription":"So my first mess up was forgetting I was ordering from Amazon us.. bring in the UK I completely overlooked the plug. But my dad had a little kettle type plug that does the trick.When I straightened the image up from the awkward angle I put it to just test it then used the other focus wheel I noticed it was blurry towards the edges shifting the position wheel again to slightly off angle it cleared this right up. This is a quick clip from YouTube just to see if it came on, on a old stripped wall that's waiting to be decorated. I can only assume it will improve more with the actual screen sheet which comes with it! Bonus!I have 2 light sources in the room a small lamp and the back lighting from the TV and my curtains are open it's not \"dark\" out or inside and still gave this image which only got better when I did close the curtains.I was not expecting cinema quality and had already dug out my speaker to attach but it doesn't even need them, you can change treble and bass and it gets very loud I had it at 20% volume here in this clip.You get the hanging pegs and sheet... Having never owned or been around a projector the fan sound did not bother me..it added to the charm, wasn't loud but was at an expected volume for a little mighty machine putting out some serious work!I got this for my garden for movie nights, to play music videos along with music or watch my fave shows on while I chill out. I am more than happy with it and it far exceeds my expectations. Remote works well and my fire stick works well I will have to have a play and see if I can get music through speakers while streaming but for the price! I live in the UK as I said and this was around 11\/12 pounds shipping from the US! That would be 13\/14 dollars for that alone then the Ultra low price it was worth the gamble and for me it's paid for itself.Sure all the projector buffs who are comparing this to a 2k state of the art machine will be choking on it's perceived faults... But this is a tiny projector that can be pretty much packed up and taken anywhere, with decent sound and image and a vast array of options for which they even provide you the cords to connect! They are essentially comparing a cinema screen to a off brand 32in telly.

{"reviewTitle":"Beware of lumen ratings","reviewDescription":"This is the third video projector I have purchased in the past few years, and having worked in movie theatres for years I am well aware of what light output is required for acceptable presentations.  An indoor auditorium of average size (40' diagonal screen) usually used a 2000 watt xenon short arc as a light source when projecting 35 MM film.  Drive-ins used to have carbon arcs that were far more powerful than that for the 100 foot wide screens that were often used.  Fast forward to home projectors.The old 8 MM movie projectors with 25 to 50 watt halogen lamps gave a tolerable image on a silver screen about five feet wide.  We got used to it, as 16 MM film was expensive for home use.For a toy home VIDEO projector this one is OK and significantly better than an 8 MM film projector in a number of ways, but there is a problem with the brightness of the output as described.This explanation may get a little geeky, but in the end you will see why the ratings given to projectors are useless.  The consumer is led to believe that the brightness of a projector output is rated by a standard measure of \"lumens.\"  There is some deception in that.  A real \"lumen,\"  as described in my ancient high school physics book is \"The amount of visible light flux which falling normally on one square foot of area will produce an illuminance of one foot-candle.\"  Translated, light a common candle made of whale fat, hold a sheet of paper that is one foot in height and one foot in width exactly one foot away from that candle, and the light falling on the paper is (Ta-Da!) a foot-candle and a lumen.  Two candles - twice as much light.  Simple.Look at the box a light bulb comes in.  Somewhere on it will be a lumen rating.  As an easy example, an old 60 watt screw-in incandescent light bulb puts out about 600 lumens.  So since this projector claims to  have 7500 lumens it should be super-bright, right?  It is in fact no where near capable of outputting that many lumens.I mentioned that I had purchased three video projectors.  My main one is a solid BenQ projector with a halogen lamp similar to one you might see used in an art gallery to illuminate a painting.  That projector has a rated output of 3,000 lumens.  It projects onto my 14' diagonal screen with a brightness that is easily equal to what I was used to in movie theatres.  I have been more than satisfied with its performance.My second projector purchase was a little Crenova I bought to play around with.  It is an LED projector (meaning the light bulb in it is a long lasting and forgiving LED) and has a rating of 1200 lumens.  I would put that rating as inflated, but would not be surprised if it in fact put out 800 real ANSI lumens.  I knew it wasn't going to be great shakes.Now we come to the projector in this review.  It is rated at 7500 lumens.  To compare the three projectors, I just now projected the same movie from the same source onto my 14' diagonal screen, using each of the three projectors.  The BenQ, at 3,000 lumens filled the entire screen with gorgeous brilliant images, even with ambient light.The little Crenova, at 1200 lumens made a barely acceptable image on about half the screen (8' diagonal)This TMY projector, brand new, put out an image that was about twice as bright as the Crenova, but less than a third the brightness of the BenQ with a six year old halogen lamp in it.So what is going on?  The definition of \"lumen\" is the problem.  The BenQ, I suspect, used the original definition of lumen in an honest measurement environment.  The little LED projectors use a different lumen called an \"ANSI lumen.\"  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) decreed a different lumen measurement to be used in evaluating projectors.  Unfortunately, rather than calling the new measurement \"SquintHard\" or something other than lumen, they co-opted the name, and stuck an \"ANSI\" in front of it.  Carton designers have no reason to know a lumen is different than an ANSI lumen, and \"lumen\" gets stuck on the box and in advertising today.So what is an ANSI lumen? - apparently whatever you want.  Supposedly it is the noticeable difference between a 100% white, a 95% white, and a 90% white that a projector puts on a screen in nine different locations, where the differences are just noticeable, with the screen size taken into account via a formula.  Try to get the actual IT7.215 ANSI spec sheet and you run into a paywall.  Gee, how consumer friendly...I can't say that a 7500 (ANSI) lumen rating is a lie, but I can say that some people in product testing are troglodytes, eat lots of carrots and can see in the dark, while most of us slog along as average folks with developing cataracts and other issues.Bottom line - do NOT believe the ANSI lumen ratings of any of the LED projectors as a meaningful method of comparison.  My BenQ projector uses almost 300 watts in operation, with the bulk of that going to power the lamp and cooling.  If you want light out, you have to put power in.  If you want bright, understand that you may need to trade off and accept some bulk and heat.  OTOH, if you want an inexpensive toy for kids or to use on a back porch while you swat madly at mosquitoes until giving up and going inside, the LED projectors may work for you.I'll keep this one because of A: the low price, B: A slightly easier menu system than the Crenova, and C: for jokes, like projecting ghosts on Halloween.  I won't be using it to project \"Lawrence of Arabia\" or start a drive-in.  I am deeply disappointed in the lack of brightness compared to what was advertised, but not overly surprised.  If chocolate bars and cereal boxes can shrink in size for the consumer, why can't light?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"921 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1655424000000}

{"reviewTitle":"GREAT value, not the best but VERY good for the price :)","reviewDescription":"GREAT value, not the best but VERY good for the price :)My biggest complaint would have to be that it has a strange sort of blocky picture. hard to describe really. Its like the picture quality is actually pretty impressive, but then there is sort of a grid of sharp, shadowlike, squares on top of the quality image it projects. you can see it inside the bulb when its on if you look at the bulb from the side while its projecting. Very strange and i dont understand why it's there. If you are picky about image quality this would probably bother you quite a bit. But for me, it is easily overlooked once you get into whatever it is your watching or projecting. For me it is not as noticeable or bothersome during playback while things are in motion and its easy to forget its there after a few minutes but i have owned another projector around this price range for about 4-5 years which was actually a lower native resolution than this one is (480p i believe). With that projector, the image was noticeably washed out from the start, but there was no such \"shadow grid overlay\" at all. this one is much better quality image overall, and WOULD be exceptional IMO if it werent for the grid thing.things i love about it though make the grid easily tolerable.1. It REALLY is a very small and portable size for the quality and size of the image it projects. VERY lightweight and something i see myself ACTUALLY taking places with me on occasions.2. Love the fact that it comes with a foldable easy to carry screen that is convenient enough to pin up almost anywhere3. has great customer support at a great price :)4. has all the features youd expect from a projector like the ability to flip the screen in any direction with the remote.5. Runs VERY quietly, ive got it hooked up to an HDMI cord that runs to a Monoprice HDX-401TA box which has 4 additional hdmi ports so you can switch between inputs on the box and it will display through the projector. it also has a port for optical audio out which i then hook into a surround sound\/blu-ray player so that anything that is dispayed on the projector plays the audio through the surround sound. while using that setup at moderate to low volume i literally dont hear any fan sound whatsoever coming from the projector.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1610928000000}

The pale objects and pale people in shows appear washed out. It is therefore too distracting to watch most shows using this projector. Despite using the available image settings, it does not seem possible to make the projector's results match the coloring of shows as I see them on a laptop or TV. Faces appear either white or orange...Similarly, the speaker is okay if the room is otherwise silent (e.g. air conditioner is off).

However, I'm glad it's my first! It's great for the price and the fact that it was on sale ($100 --> $80). It comes with a short HDMI cable, a remote (buy batteries duh), another pair of wires (which i would assume is for external speakers ?), a projector screen, and sticky hooks that don't damage your walls\/paint. Also, I had to buy an HDMI adapter (HDMI --> USB C) in order to connect it to my MacBook Air.If you're looking for a projector with top notch quality, then you'd probably have to look for something more expensive. The picture quality isn't terrible to the point where you can see pixels, but it's still decent & definitely works for me since I'm not picky. It doesn't have a zoom (to increase or decrease the screen) if you were expecting that, but it does allow you to change the vertical of the screen (like the editing option in the Apple Photos app) & the focus.It projects really well on both the screen provided and a plain dry wall. People said that they can only watch when it's completely dark in their room, but I can see fairly well during the daytime when my blinds are closed (Picture 1) & when my bright lamp is on during the night (Picture 2).As for sound, I just listen through my laptop while it projects onto my screen since I don't have speakers, which I genuinely don't mind. The noise from the projector when it's on is a little loud, but that doesn't bother me either. Overall, like another person said, if you have the right expectations for this pretty cheaply priced projector, then I think you'd enjoy it!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661040000000}

There is also not a zoom feature to adjust for how far away you install it. You have to install the projector the correct distance back to fill your screen area, not in the convenient place you THINK you are going to install it. The lens focus is functional, but it will look blurry no matter how much you focus it because the native 720p resolution makes you feel like its the year 1999 again!Pros:Cheap, lightweight, easy to install, speakers are slightly louder than the fan.Cons:Dim, low resolution, has to be manually placed at a distance appropriate to the size you want (no lens zoom), LOUD.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673827200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Don't try to mount it","reviewDescription":"Tried to thread it onto my tripod and the female part that I was screwing the tripod into cracked in half and came crumbling apart. Definitely cheaply made. If you want to cast anything from your phone, this doesn't have bluetooth so you'll need a chromecast to wirelessly play things, it doesn't just plug and play from a hard drive either, so nothing can be done without some extra wires the old school way. Also the picture doesn't fully come into clarity so you have to decide if you want the left or right side of your picture to be clearer. Other than that, you pretty much get what you pay for.UPDATE:Got an email from the company that makes these and their customer service, initially they asked to replace the original which I agreed to. They replaced it with an upgraded model which works wonderfully, I'd say buy the more expensive model and skip this one. Next, I asked if I'd have to return the original to which they said that the new projector was a gift and I'd still get a refund, super nice, totally favorable. I hadn't gotten a chance to come back and update the review here just yet but I guess they're now refunding me fully even without returning the initial product, though I will be doing so as I now have a better version and wasn't asked to edit the review until after receiving the new and updated model of this product, starting the refund, and needing to return the first one anyhow since it is broken and malfunctioning. So customer service here is 5\/5, this product is a 3\/5 and the new model is 5\/5 overall. Just a heads up to anyone looking at this product specifically.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1649980800000}

I adjusted the picture settings and got it looking pretty good but not perfect. It's still lacking in the color department. The main problem is that the picture goes blank but you can still hear the sound. I have to turn it off and back on again to get it to work. This only started happening when I turned up the thermostat to 72\u00b0F. I normally have my room at 68\u00b0F and at that temperature the picture doesn't go blank. I believe it is just overheating but it doesn't worn you it just go's blank. I opened it up to see why it might be overheating and noticed it has two fans to keep the power supply and LED backlight cool but no way to cool the main board (That is the brain of the projector) and thay put the board directly above the hottest part of the projector (The LED backlight). So the board is just getting baked by the backlight causing it to stop working. I don't know how many times it will be able to handle that before it fails completely. Oh and the keystone adjustment is terrible it barely does enything. So don't get this projector unless you like to live in the cold. After I posted my review a sales manager from TMY reached out wanting to send me an upgraded replacement projector for free and was very helpful and nice.

While I had a struggle with getting it propped up, it's definitely a 'you pay what you get!'It was a good \"First time projector\". Better if you are in total darkness, but if you aren't picky, sometimes I crack the window a bit. EDIT: It's very good quality, and honestly you'd have to be very meticulous or dramatic to say that the image is poor if you're not watching a film in dim light like you should. Projectors aren't meant to be used in a well lit room.That being said, I greatly enjoyed this projector.Either way, suddenly it started to fan really loud. Upon investigation, I rotated the projector and it began to growl really loudly. I was worried the machine was offing itself and turned it off immediately. It slowly would get louder every time I turned it on, to the point I'd have to have the volume up pretty loud to be able to hear my shows. The quality of the film was the same otherwise.Nothing was jammed or in the fan at all.I have no idea how go fix it, or how it even happened. I've never dropped it, and the fan is clear as far as I can tell. I'm very disappointed because it was so good!UPDATE - The company reached out to me via email! At first, I had recalled reading an email saying that someone got a scammy email asking for personal information, and at first I was on guard. However, they sent a screenshot of my purchase that showed a screen only the seller would have access to, confirming their legitimacy. All they asked for was my address because they didn't have access to my shipping address (the system deletes it after the initial sale is made) and they sent me not just a replacement, but an upgrade. It's so nice and quiet, and I can comfortably hear my shows again!I wasn't required to return or send back the old projector, which I'm thankful for! The communication between the seller and I was smooth and it didn't raise any red flags.

They have a newer model projector (V58) that improves many of the issues noted earlier.- The brightness is improved.- The higher resolution allows for a larger viewing area, text is much more legible.- Provides bluetooth for connecting a bluetooth speaker.- Allows wireless casting from mobile device.If you're going to get a TMY projector I would suggest the V58 over this and other models, it's at least useable and what you would expect from a budget projector in this price range.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658448000000}

Currently I own a 3300 lumen Benq projector that works well, but isn't bright enough when there is any daylight.

Also, I thought I was going crazy with the focus. I'd focus the center, but then the edges were blurry. Then I'd focus the edges and the center was blurry. That's what the other 2 pictures are.  Between the lack of brightness, the focus issues and the dirty spots, I'm better off sticking with what I have.I did give 2 stars, because it's cheap and it does project an image. This would probably be good if you're looking to watch cartoon movies in your backyard with kids. But nothing more than that.Edit Oct 28 2022:. Customer service reached out to me and sent a new projector. It's a little brighter, but not by much. Adding one more star because I was impressed with their customer service.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665360000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Decent first projector","reviewDescription":"I don\u2019t know much about projectors I just wanted to set up one in my bedroom for the occasional movie. I got this for the price point and while it definitely does the job some things to consider: it doesn\u2019t haven\u2019t any kind of shut off sleep timer you can set so it will continuously run and the fan starts off pretty loud and after a couple years of not that much use the fan is so loud that I almost don\u2019t want to use it anymore. It\u2019s also already started having some connectivity issues where the picture will flicker on and off or the screen will go black. That being said the first year I had it it definitely did the job.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709769600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Updated Review","reviewDescription":"Update:While I stand by my original review that the projector is not high quality and you get what you pay for, I will say the customer service is five-star. They quickly addressed the issue in a manner that was acceptable. The product is apparently not suitable for academic presentations, which I was unaware of at the time I ordered this. It is really designed for in-home theater use. I am not really sure what the difference is. A projector is a projector. It should not really matter what setting it is used for. Because Customer service addressed the issue in a very quick, professional, and appropriate manner, I have increased my original rating of one star to three stars. I do not feel I can remove the review, however, because I think it is important for people to know that this is not s suitable product for academic or commercial presentations. My hope is that by leaving this review it will prevent others from making the same mistake I made.Original Review:This is an inexpensive projector that I bought for emergency use in my classroom. Being that I had to provide the projector instead of the school, I opted for the most economical one. You get what you pay for.  Even after making the necessary adjustments, the picture quality was very poor. I suspect it was because the projector was too far away from the wall that I was projecting onto, but I was limited in where I could place the projector because of the outlet locations.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1651708800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great Picture Quality but Minor Issues","reviewDescription":"This is definitely a get what you pay for item. I will say the quality of the picture is great along with the sound, but the fan is incredibly loud and not ideal for a bedroom. Also, the size of the picture cannot change without changing the location of the projector, meaning if I want to project a specific size without changing the location of the physical projector then tough luck. Still good quality, but there are a few too many little things that I dislike about it (quality of the remote is cheap, loud fan, screen size, and definitely puts off some heat after running for a few hours).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1660521600000}
{"reviewTitle":"It is a basic unit, lower your expectations","reviewDescription":"There is limited range with this projector, in a small space like I have, it is hard to find a spot or distance to enlarge the picture \/ video.The clarity\/ quality of the picture is also limited and can be blurry at times. Not very bright, the room must be almost completely dark to get a good picture.Overall, it works but don't expect high grade quality, it is a basic unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1680220800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not compatible without adapters","reviewDescription":"This is not such a great bargain because you can't play from a Chromebook with the HDMI.  I have a different brand that plays my Chromebook and smartphone just fine.  This one does not so I would say spend a little more and get a model that is more compatible without having to spend more money on additional adapters just to make it compatible.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1681516800000}
{"reviewTitle":"It\u2019s ok for the price, I guess.","reviewDescription":"Image quality is 720p, the image looks way better in the laptop than projected.  It is mostly blurry at more than 6-7 feet from wall. A bit too bright, even with brightness down to 0.  The fan is noticeably loud. I\u2019ve also noticed the manual keystone corrector moves on its own a bit with time.The added screen is a cloth, image goes right through it and looks blurry. Not very useful.Would\u2019t buy again at more than $50.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1667520000000}
