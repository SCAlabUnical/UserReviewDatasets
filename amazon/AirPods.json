{"reviewTitle":"100% honest review","reviewDescription":"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS\/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's \"universal\" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better\/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk\/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk\/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects\/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and\/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired\/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair\/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair\/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find \"AirPods\" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple\/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called \"AirPopUp\". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain\/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple\/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping\/pausing\/resetting songs, answer\/decline\/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical\/liquid\/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black\/white\/silver\/yellow\/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled \"Galaxy Wearable\". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer\/decline\/hang up phone calls, pause\/skip\/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"773 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1578355200000}
{"reviewTitle":"A Solid Pair of Wireless Earbuds","reviewDescription":"The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a popular choice for wireless earbuds, and they come with a Lightning charging case that offers a convenient way to charge and store them. Here's a detailed review based on my experience:Sound Quality (4\/5):The sound quality of these earbuds is generally good. They deliver clear and well-balanced audio, making them suitable for a wide range of music genres and audio content. However, some audiophiles may find that they lack the depth and richness found in higher-end headphones.Wireless Connectivity (5\/5):Apple has always excelled in creating seamless wireless connections, and the AirPods are no exception. The pairing process is incredibly easy, and they seamlessly connect to your Apple devices via Bluetooth. The connection remains stable, and you can switch between devices effortlessly.Comfort and Fit (4\/5):The AirPods are designed to be comfortable for extended use. They're lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. However, some users might find them a bit loose during intense physical activities or while running.Battery Life (4\/5):The included Lightning charging case offers an additional 24 hours of battery life, making it easy to keep the earbuds powered up throughout the day. While this is a decent battery life, there are other models on the market that offer even longer playtime.Charging (4\/5):The Lightning connector is both a pro and a con. It's convenient if you already own Apple devices, but it's limiting if you use other devices with different charging ports. It would be great to have USB-C compatibility for broader appeal.Voice Assistant Integration (5\/5):The AirPods have excellent voice assistant integration with Siri, making it effortless to control your music, check the weather, or send messages with just your voice.Price (3\/5):The AirPods are on the higher end of the price range for wireless earbuds. While they offer a great experience, some users might find more affordable options with similar features from other brands.Overall (4\/5):The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) are a solid choice for those in the Apple ecosystem who want reliable wireless earbuds with seamless connectivity and good sound quality. They are comfortable for daily use and come with a convenient charging case. However, the price may deter budget-conscious shoppers, and the Lightning connector might be inconvenient for non-Apple users. If you're willing to invest in quality wireless earbuds and enjoy the Apple ecosystem, these are a great pick.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"34 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697328000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Extremely Disappointed: Apple Product Fails After Just 40 Days","reviewDescription":"I am writing this review with great disappointment and frustration regarding my recent experience with an Apple product that stopped working after 40 days of use. I had high expectations for the brand's renowned quality and reliability, but sadly, those expectations were shattered.I purchased this Apple product excitedly and eagerly, believing I was investing in a device that would enhance my productivity and seamlessly integrate into my daily life. However, my hopes were quickly dashed when the product suddenly malfunctioned, rendering it completely inoperable. I followed all recommended usage guidelines, handled the product carefully, and treated it as the valuable investment it was meant to be. So, it is highly concerning that such a reputable brand's device would fail quickly and abruptly.Recognizing the gravity of the situation, I promptly reached out to Apple's customer support, expecting a swift resolution. However, I encountered further disappointment when I met with a lackluster response from their support team. Despite providing all necessary information and evidence of the product's abrupt failure, I was met with delayed responses, unhelpful suggestions, and an overall lack of urgency to rectify the situation.As a consumer who values quality and reliability, this experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth. Not only did the product fail prematurely, but the subsequent customer service experience has added insult to injury. The lack of concern, accountability, and willingness to assist in replacing the faulty product is profoundly disheartening.When investing in a premium brand like Apple, one should expect a higher caliber of quality and customer service. Unfortunately, this experience has exposed a significant gap between expectations and reality. Instead of enjoying a dependable device, I am embroiled in a frustrating and time-consuming process to receive a functional product or suitable resolution.I sincerely hope that Apple takes note of this review and genuinely addresses the concerns of its customers. A 40-day lifespan for a device that should have provided years of reliable service is unacceptable. I implore Apple to uphold its reputation for excellence by rectifying this situation promptly and providing a satisfactory resolution, be it through an immediate replacement or equivalent compensation for the subpar product I received.In conclusion, I am highly disappointed in the Apple product that stopped functioning after 40 days. The failure of the device, coupled with the unsatisfactory customer service experience, has tarnished my perception of the brand.

{"reviewTitle":"Apple AirPod failure realities","reviewDescription":"I have bought two pairs of these AirPods, and both have a failure of the microphone after roughly a year or less, and then it no longer works, in other words, nobody can hear you on the other end of a call or meeting, you can only hear them, you cannot talk to them. I have had two pairs of these replaced under warranty after painstaking troubleshooting with Apple support, and the so called \u201cgeniuses\u201d at the Apple Store, the \u201cgeniuses\u201d will tell you \"I've never heard of this problem before\" - don\u2019t you love that, yet it\u2019s on forums. I actually talked with an Apple support agent with my last AirPod warranty replacement, I asked if the support person used iPhone and she said yes, she buys a new one whenever it comes out (trendy Apple folk), so I asked if she had issues with her AirPods, she said she had AirPod2, and AirPod Pro so if she has an issue where one pair is not connecting or the microphone fails, she will switch to the other pair (back and forth) but she inadvertently admitted both have the same issue as my latest 4th pair of pods which the microphone audio quit, nobody can hear me anymore, did the same bs troubleshooting on my own, then call Apple support again, and they make you go into the store and deal with those stupid geniuses; disconnected, reconnected, reset, updated, etc. etc. (time wasted is adding up, time is money). They even suggested to reset my phone, dude!!! Really!?!?My my latest pair is now useless for calls or meetings, they are done, AGAIN, just like the last three pairs. And this is the second issue that starts in less than a year of using them, when you pull them out of the case, only one air pod connects half the time, then you have to take the stupid engineering marvel out of your ear, place it back in the case, pull it out again, and maybe it connected, you might have to do that again until it connects; this happened like clockwork with all four pairs of Apple AirPods. many times when one AirPods fails to connect, I feel like smashing them both and be done with Apple all around, its like malware to drive you nuts. Lastly, do you remember the Keynote advertisement years back for these when they show the guy upside down, and Apple basically stating, these are staying in your ears no matter what, HAHAHHAHA. LIES!!!!!! PURE APPLE LIES!!!!! I have refused to buy anything Apple after all their BS marketing, and product failure realities (I won\u2019t mention any details about the 2022 MacStudio defects or Studio Display issues).

{"reviewTitle":"Apple on Amazon has been ridiculously useless for getting help with defective Airpods","reviewDescription":"I purchase a pair of 2nd Gen Airpods from this listing on July 11th, 2023.  I paid $106 after taxes.  They were a gift for my 22 yo daughter since her Airpods she's had for years had finally started giving her trouble and they were outside of the year warranty.When we received them.  She attached them to her iPhone XR, the same phone she used with her old pair of Airpods and the right Airpod died after minutes of use.  She put both the left and right Airpods, in the case, plugged the case in the wall, let them charge for a few hours, tried them again and again the right one died after minutes of use.I told her to try to charge the right one in her old case, she did, her phone showed it was fully charged and it died minutes later.  I told my daughter to contact Apple Support.  We can surmise that since the Airpod had the same issue using the other case that the issue was the Airpod and not the right part of the new charging case.She sent her Airpods in for repair, she sent them in with the box they came in, the white Apple box with the picture of the Airpods on them and they returned them in a generic brown box with a clear cellophane window.  The documentation they included in the package said they could not recreate the issue so she tried them again, charged them in the case using the wall plug and they still would not hold a charge longer than a few minutes.I contacted Apple Support and they told me that I could send them back in for repair and I was like, \"Can you please just replace them, they're brand new and we sent them in before and they didn't fix them.\"  Unbeknownst to me, the Apple warranty only covers repairs even if they are BRAND NEW.  So I returned them to Amazon and bought her a new pair from Walmart since they too were doing the $99 Airpods.The ones I got from Walmart work great, no complaints.  I sent the broken pair back to Amazon and now I'm being told its going to take upwards of 60 days for a refund.  That is freaking ridiculous.  Brian, from the Amazon chat said that was so they could compare serial numbers and blah blah blah.  This wait, is ridiculous, Amazon and Apple.  I am disgusted by this wait time.

While I had enjoyed the convenience and audio quality of these wireless earbuds, a problem arose where only the left AirPod would connect, leaving the right one unresponsive. I still have a warranty left.This issue occurred suddenly and without warning. Despite multiple attempts to reset the AirPods, disconnect and reconnect them, and even update the firmware, the right AirPod remained stubbornly disconnected.This situation is incredibly frustrating, as it severely impacts the overall listening experience. The stereo effect is lost, and the functionality of the AirPods is essentially halved.

{"reviewTitle":"Reoccurring issues that I never experienced with the older version.","reviewDescription":"As I lost my previous pair of EarPods (MMEF2AM\/A, ordered in Jul-2018) in the plane, it was an easy choice to purchase a new pair, as I was very happy with my previous version. So, I purchased a new pair early Oct-2019. However, after using the Apple EarPods for almost 2 months, I notice that I am so very disappointed with the quality of the newer model, that I decided to write a review.Notes:-Although I am unhappy with the product itself and not with Amazon, the Amazon Helpdesk advised me to leave a Product Review.-I could find that my previous version is the MMEF2AM\/A, while I cannot find a version number with the latest purchase. The Order title was \"latest model\", so I assume this is a different model.-I never dropped or damaged my EarPods and I use a protective cover over the charger case.-WIth regards to my third point below: I generally put the ears back in the charger case, but occasionally (perhaps once every 50 times I use the ears) put the ears in my side pocket).Main differences with the old version:-It sometimes takes much longer for the ears to connect to my phone (which is the same phone that I used with my previous version). I'd say that 1 out of 10 times I put the ears in, the connection takes about 10 seconds. As I use my EarPods for work-calls, I sometimes miss calls while waiting for the ears to connect. The old EarPods always connected quickly and without problems.-If I put the left ear in earlier than the right ear, the right ear sometimes does not connect (while it is fully charge). I can take the ears out and put them back in, but this doesn't help. The only way to \"reset\" the ears, is to put the ears back into the charger case, before I put them in my ears. This never happened with the older version.-If I don't put the ears back in the charger case but put them in a pocket, my phone somehow still thinks the ears are connected (probably because they don't move much relatively from each other), which drains both my ears AND my phone. The previous version did not give me this issue whatsoever.-Possibly partly because of the above point, but also in general (at least to my feeling), the ears battery life is much lower. The charger case has no problems, but I honestly have the feeling that my new ears have about half the life of the previous version.Asides of the above, the EarPods work well and have high quality sound, hence I suspect that the item itself is not broken in any way. Instead, I suspect design and\/or software flaws.I am very disappointed with this, as none of the above issues ever occurred with my previous version. Initially, I hoped it was both a one-time thing (which it wasn't) and that the flaws came with being \"a newer version\" and were possibly fixable by software updates, but after using the ears for almost 2 months and seeing the issues reoccur, I wanted to give back this feedback.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1574985600000}

They would not stay in my ears, it didn\u2019t matter if I was sitting completely still, walking slowly down the stairs or down the block, every time I moved my head the slightest bit they came out. So, I read every article I could find to fix this problem. Tried almost all of them. Even the ones that Apple recommended not to try. Nothing helped. Today I had a great experience with them.  I went on a long slow walk and they, of course, fell out immediately. I kept putting them back in.  Then, when the left pod fell out it tumbled down into a sewer drain. I continued my walk without any music and really enjoyed myself.  I realized that as a society, we have forgotten the difference between inside and outside. From people talking on their phones while pushing a baby carriage in the middle of a crowded parking lot, talking or reading texts while crossing the street, to my favorite, talking loudly in an elevator, we all seem to want\/expect the same experiences both inside and outside.

{"reviewTitle":"NOT for Gym or Isolated sound","reviewDescription":"Airpods 2 (2nd Gen) do NOT block ANY external noise. put them on in public and you'll still clearly hear every outside conversation, noise and ambient music, such as at the Gym...my primary use for earbuds is to ISOLATED what im listening to, to block out terrible 'workout music' and other people talking....these do none of that and i dont really understand all the raving reviews....many mention how 'in ear fitted' buds are uncomfortable and the sound on these is so much better...sure the music sounds great if you're in a quiet place but my $30 knockoff in-ears sound fine while isolating what i WANT to hear - easy choice !hoping for a win on the apple aesthetic upgrade i thought maybe id keep these for calls and the esteemed \"easy connectivity\" but again, as a person who mostly talks in the car or on speaker i dont really see the need. might have to buck up another $60 for the upgrade that everyone says isnt better....these will likely be returnedPros: i will say the sound quality (if youre listening in a quiet controlled environment) is noticeably better than average. its bright, clear and dynamic...i even tested (outside) an 80s metal tune with an otherwise dull one dimensional mix and these somehow brought out depth and separation to the instruments...on other songs i immediately heard sounds i hadnt before, so i guess this is the Spatial Audio aspect and well, good job there !","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708041600000}

There should be no reason that this is happening yet again. I mostly love apple products but as far as these airpods go i\u2019ll never buy them again after seeing I\u2019ve purchased six pairs in 3 years.

{"reviewTitle":"Sorry","reviewDescription":"Let me start out by saying I am a big Apple fan and treasure their products. Unfortunately, due to some defects I would not buy these again.The goodI found the sound quality far superior to a five year old beats product. The battery life is acceptable and I am a heavy user.The case is a delight as the case serves as a portable charging station. You charge the case which is portable and the ear buds charge from the case.Could be betterThe charging light is on the inside of the case so you have to open the case to see the light. Apple fixed this problem on the generation three version.Value for moneyFor me the value for money was a good proposition. Part of the reason for that comes from the bad point below. I also didn\u2019t see a shattering difference between gen 3 which I also have and these but the gen 3 is way more expensive. I would choose gen three over gen two if they were the same price.The badI can\u2019t keep these in my ear. Because they fall out so easily and you don\u2019t know they are out, i know I will lose the product wearing them around. As a result, I don\u2019t take these phones out of the house. Since you are likely to be replacing them frequently due to loss, it is logical to choose the lesser expensive option.ConclusionIf you are going to buy this product the second generation is a great investment because overall they are a quality product but you will be replacing them frequently.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703289600000}
{"reviewTitle":"They fall out so easily.","reviewDescription":"I bought these a few years ago. From the onset I couldn\u2019t figure how people kept them in their ears without them falling out.Yes, my ears can\u2019t hold them for long. I place them in my ears as directed, then they\u2019ll slowly fall out.I could be in bed, not moving, and they slowly fall out.Every time. Every single time.  It gets old.I don\u2019t understand how people get them to stay, especially runners, and walkers. If I walk around my home, listening to tunes, one will slowly drop out; I\u2019m constantly adjusting their fit so they\u2019ll stay in place.I bought one of those accessory kits where you can add an over the ear holder. It helps, but you can\u2019t charge them with those wings on them. Taking them off to charge, and putting them on to listen gets old. It also wears out the hole that holds the ear wing in place.I can\u2019t wear these anywhere for fear of losing one or both. I wear them only while listening to music in bed.  That\u2019s right in bed, no where else.  But even in bed they can still fall out.The sound is good, great quality, as long as it stays in my ear canal. Then as they slowly disengage with my ear canal, the sound slowly deteriorates. If they both come loose they can disconnect from Bluetooth, when that occurs, the device starts playing the sound, waking up my spouse.They\u2019re also difficult to clean. As I wear them, wax can build up on the ear bud\u2019s speaker. It\u2019s very difficult to remove completely. Cotton swabs can\u2019t clean, can\u2019t pick up all the wax. I\u2019ve tried plastic dental cleaners, plastic picks, and even an unbent paper clip. The paper clip actually worked best.So, three stars overall.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701648000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Can the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 compete with the Apple AirPods 2 at $40 less?","reviewDescription":"Although the 2nd generation AirPods came out in March 2019, improvements are merely incremental. At the $100 price point, can the recently released Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 compete? Read on to learn how the more expensive latest $140 Apple AirPods stack up versus Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro:QUICK SPOILER ANSWER ANKER VS. APPLE AIRPODS:Yes indeed. At $40 less, the Anker boasts equal sounds and noise cancellation not offered by Apple unless upgrading to the $250 Pro model. The Apple AirPod 2 is the perennial best seller in this price range. You won\u2019t be disappointed unless you need the awesome feature of noise cancellation. The $100 Anker is very well spent and does includes noise cancellation and an equalizer to balance the sound to your taste.SOUND QUALITYI specialize in tech reviews and place the far highest priority on listening quality. If it\u2019s better mic quality you are after, or have hearing difficulty, the AirPods are a bit better, capturing more-subtle voice tones. But for music, the Anker equals Apple\u2019s impressive sound. Once you nail the fit, both will impress all but audiophiles in all aspects of sound quality: accuracy, tonal range, non-fatiguing, and punchy (but not annoying) bass.Speaking of bass, Anker does punch it up. The highs are slightly rounded off, the midrange is fairly flat, and the low end is boosted.NOISE CANCELLATION: Apple vs. AnkerThis Apple model has none unless you spring for the newest $250 Pro version. For a lower price, the Anker\u2019s have it, and do a worthy job. This feature alone lets Anker win the race vs. the lastest Apple AirPod. If you haven\u2019t experienced noise cancellation in headphones, or earbuds, you\u2019ll likely be as blown away as I was. I got my first noise cancelation Bose headphones six years ago when they were the only game in town. Life changing, truly. A must for any noisy environment and a godsend for rest on long airplane trips.The Anker\u2019s were my second noise cancelling earbuds, and while not spectacular like the class leading $250 Sony\u2019s, the result is satisfying. I urge you to audition this feature. When making, phone calls, you may prefer it off.CONTROLLING THE SOUND: APPLE VS. THE ANKER EQUALIZER APP:With the Apple AirPods, open Settings, Tap Music, and then EQ under the Playback tab. Although the Soundcore Liberty 2 boosts the bass, some of us prefer a more nuanced and balanced sound. With either of the new Anker\u2019s the app is a terrific add on. You can get the sound balanced to your tastes easily.ADDITIONAL EARBUD REVIEWS COMPARISONS:If tempted to spend another $100 for the Apple AirPods Pro, have a look at my detailed review of the awesome Sony\u2019s compared with the Apple AirPod:https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R3CQKVFI571CDE\/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T81554HSHOULD YOU SPEND MORE? VALUE AND OVERALL BEST CHOICE:Although only released in December 2016, the \u201cage\u201d of the AirPod technology is showing. If you can spend more, in late 2019 Apple released it\u2019s latest Airpods Pro. At nearly double the price these hit a \u201cwhole \u2018nuther level\u201d for Apple to compare closely with the extraordinary high end Sony WF-1000XM3 at a similar $250+ price.If you can spend $200+ Sony the new Sheriff in town and in my opinion beats even the newest $250 Apple AirPods. However, at $100, the Anker\u2019s impress and are better than the basic Apple AirPods with one great advantage: noise cancellation. If you don\u2019t like the black color, go with the sleek and now classic $150 Apple model.Thanks for slogging through this long review.

{"reviewTitle":"Very practical","reviewDescription":"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS\/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's \"universal\" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better\/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk\/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk\/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects\/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and\/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired\/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair\/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair\/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find \"AirPods\" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple\/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called \"AirPopUp\". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain\/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple\/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping\/pausing\/resetting songs, answer\/decline\/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical\/liquid\/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black\/white\/silver\/yellow\/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled \"Galaxy Wearable\". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer\/decline\/hang up phone calls, pause\/skip\/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"108 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697673600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Perhaps not the best option for serious runners","reviewDescription":"I only use them for running but while doing so there's a few features that I like to have by the quick press of the button\/ear bud instead of fumbling for my phone: skip forward, skip back, pause\/play, adjust volume and a nice bonus that is rarely used is calling up siri. While you can customize each of the ear buds to perform one of these actions, you can only pick two, and volume adjust is not an option which is a huge problem for me while running at times (i.e. going into and out of traffic areas). The sound quality and battery life is excellent as you'd expect for an apply product but w\/o these other capabilities I'm considering returning them because they just won't be used that much and I feel as though the lack of controls will make them annoying. It is nice that they pause automatically when you take them out but sometimes I want a quick tap instead. They also aren't super sensitive so sometimes I double tap and it doesn't do the desired function, then I'm tapping again a little harder. I can't figure out if I'm not hitting it hard enough, quick enough, or the wrong spot. When you're running you really don't want to mess with this too much, it needs to be quick and responsive. I realize this is an earlier generation but not sure why they didn't at least incorporate a single tap and double tap option to provide more features.I was replacing some much cheaper Mifa X17 buds that only lasted about a year before I started having problems and a few months later they might be totally dead for good (at least one of the two buds). But for the price, I could get 3-4 of those for the same price as these, still have pretty good quality sound and all the features I need for running plus it has wireless charging. I mean that's like 3-5 yr of earbuds for the same price with much more features... I'm not sure I can ignore that.

{"reviewTitle":"Ok?","reviewDescription":"The Apple AirPods have received a lot of hype and attention since their release, but unfortunately, they do not live up to the high expectations. One of the most significant issues with the AirPods is their battery life. While Apple claims that the AirPods can last up to five hours on a single charge, many users have reported that they do not even last that long.Furthermore, the charging case that comes with the AirPods only provides an additional 24 hours of battery life, which is not enough for many people who use their AirPods on a regular basis. The charging case is also quite bulky and can be inconvenient to carry around.Another issue with the AirPods is their fit. While some users find them comfortable, others have reported that they fall out of their ears easily or do not fit properly, making them uncomfortable to wear for long periods.Additionally, the sound quality of the AirPods is not as impressive as some other wireless earbuds on the market. Many users have reported that the sound is not as clear or powerful as they would like, and there is no noise-cancellation feature.Overall, while the AirPods may be convenient and stylish, they are not worth the high price tag for many users due to their subpar battery life, fit issues, and mediocre sound quality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679097600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Definitely worth every penny and then some","reviewDescription":"I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn\u2019t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they\u2019ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I\u2019ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don\u2019t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I\u2019ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I\u2019m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can\u2019t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I\u2019m sure that they don\u2019t I can\u2019t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it\u2019s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I\u2019ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they\u2019ve connected if I\u2019m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it\u2019s from if they\u2019re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I\u2019ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"37 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1601596800000}

So I took them back, where apple told me that that both airpods connect and that they can't do anything unless they fail to connect.

{"reviewTitle":"Beware - 1year Mfr Warranty from Apple will not apply!","reviewDescription":"The case for these AirPods stopped charging after only having them for 6 months. (Barely even used since Bluetooth headphones have not been proven safe).Apple products are supposed to have a \u201climited one year warranty\u201d regardless if you purchase the additional Apple Care coverage.But apparently, Apple only honors the 1 year from date of purchase IF you purchase through Apple. If you purchase through Amazon, they start the 1 year warranty on the date Amazon makes the purchase from them! So if amazon has an Apple product for a year (or more) before you buy it\u2026you will not have ANY warranty on that item.Also, according to Apple, these particular AirPods were USED - showing a purchase date 2 years before my purchase date. So of course, Apple stated the item was out of warranty and refused to repair\/replace the AirPods.There is NO explanation of this warranty issue on Amazon\u2019s Apple listings.So, until Amazon & Apple correct this warranty FAILURE, please consider purchasing your Apple products through Apple Store only. Or make sure the warranty date is valid, or purchase the extended coverage.*** Apple products have an uncanny ability to stop working just days after the warranties are up\u2026.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670976000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Both sets died in 1.5 years","reviewDescription":"Let me start by saying our family buys lots of Apple products. Add that with the fact that having wireless earbuds are so convenient and Apple appears to makes a slick product. The airpods fit fine for me and my spouse. The case is also very small, but the earbuds could have smaller stems. The sound quality is good, but not excellent. However, both sets we purchased had one earbud die within 1.5 years. I talked with a friend and they said the same thing happened to them. Combine that with some negatives such as the high price, average battery life, the fact that these aren\u2019t noise canceling, the annoyance that having a family sharing apple account combines all earbuds into everyones devices causing a lot of accidental switching of airplay, and you have a very expensive recurring cost per year per person. I thought about how a warranty might help, but you still have to pay for warranty plus the replacement parts and can only replace 2 parts. Buying a new pair would have ended up being the same cost for us or even cheaper with the airpods on sale. Maybe the gen 3\u2019s will be more reliable but I\u2019m not paying almost $200 to find out. My advice for most people, buy the off brands that come with an 18 month warranty and more features like double the battery life and controls. They will run as low as $30 and will probably be good enough. You can reward yourself with a music subscription using the money you\u2019ll save.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1651017600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Sound = 10, Battery = 10, Comfort = 2","reviewDescription":"It has been quite a while since I've bought a set of Apple earbuds to use as my primary form of listen-wear. I truly miss the design of the Apple earbuds from the pre-2010 iPod days. I used the heck out of them as a kid, and thought the 2nd generation AirPods would hopefully be the closest thing to that. For me, they aren't...Sound quality is as good as I always thought the Apple headphones were, nothing really lost there.Battery life is fantastic, though admittedly, I haven't really charged them since I initially charged them when I first got them and it's been several days (not continuous use)...so...take that for what it's worth...Comfort is the absolute biggest miss here. You have to shove these things down into your ear to get optimal hearing and my ears are not a fan of that. If you look up the external parts of the ear, the \"Helix Crus\" part of my outer ear is so irritated that once I take the AirPods out, there's no way they are going back in. (So just leave them in then)....well...that's not always possible, and because they hurt so much, I find myself trying to adjust to make them more comfortable, and that just doesn't work.(So get some earbud cushions....) Got 'em...I got a whole pack of 20 or so from Amazon that people were adamant would make the AirPods more comfortable based on their own experience......didn't work. You could say in some regard that they helped to some degree, but they definitely didn't take away the uncomfortability of the  AirPods, and if it doesn't eliminate the comfort issue completely, they might as well not even be there...(Could it just be your ears....?) YES, it absolutely could just be MY ears. Ears come in all different sizes and some may not even notice these things are in their ears - that's what I was hoping for...but sadly didn't achieve. Perhaps if there was a smaller pair, the discomfort may not be such a problem, but obviously that's illogical.I also had an issue with getting the sound to play on them from my phone. Bluetooth was enabled, Airpods were showing as \"Connected\", but the sound wouldn't switch from my phone speaker to the AirPods. I can't remember what all I had to do in order to finagle that....but it took some doing, and no other non-Apple product that I've ever used has had this issue...and if you research it, it sounds like it's a common issue with no real straight-forward resolution.It's truly a shame. I could have done with lesser quality sound and even poorer battery life in exchange for greater comfort. Apple hits the mark on just about everything here except that one VERY important aspect, so buy at your own risk.

{"reviewTitle":"Love Hate Relationship","reviewDescription":"I'm fully in the Apple Ecosystem: iPhone, iPad, Mac. It was time to replace my wireless headphones and heard so much about the Airpods and so many friends love them, decided to stay Apple.  Indeed Airpods work great with Apple products. If that's all you're going to use them for, don't hesitate. I've bought and returned 3 other airbud products. Primary issue was the device staying in the ear, then sound quality.  Airpods stay in your ears and the sound is very good for the price point.HOWEVER........I'm primarily interested in wireless help with hearing especially my TVs.  I do not have Apple TV. One TV is a smart Samsung with Bluetooth and the other is Panasonic that I've added a Bluetooth transmitter.  Anything that's not Apple has no issue pairing with the TVs.  When it comes to pairing the Airpods, my blood pressure rises each time. Sometimes they pair, sometimes not.  But that's not the real issue.  The Airpods do not have independent sound control. If you're using an Apple device, you control the sound through the device like phone, watch etc.  However, my TVs (two major brands) do not have volume control for output. Very few TVs do.  So if the volume is too high or too low, I need to disconnect from the TV, pair with an Apple device, get the volume where I think I want it, then disconnect, then re-pair with the TV and hope the volume is somewhere near where I like it.I spoke with Apple about this and their response is buy an Apple TV device. That way the Airpod will pair and sound can be controlled. In my case, I would need to buy 2 Apple TV devices.  The low priced airbuds come with volume control, apparently there isn't any technology magic required.  Apple is choosing to not include.I'm still undecided about returning the Airpods. The fit, comfort and sound are well worth the price. The volume annoyance is a reminder each time I use these things that Apple is not the customer focused\/design company we think they are.  Before I bought the Airpods, I spoke with 3 friends who use and highly recommend.  Each one told me I would be able to control the volume with my iPhone or iPad. After talking with Apple, that is not the case.While on that subject, since my last Apple purchase this is the first time in about 18 months that I've needed to talk with Apple support.  What has happened over there?  Four calls in two weeks; each time I feel like I'm speaking with someone that is just reading a script and doesn't really understand the issue.  The solution to most any issue seems to be, buy something else Apple.  As a long time shareholder who's gone through a lot of stock splits, I appreciate the focus on Apple products but come on, there's more solutions to improving an Apple product than buying another Apple product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1590969600000}

At that point, the right earbud microphone started to malfunction and would no longer detect sound until he yelled. I phoned Apple customer service and went over all of the possible remedies, such as upgrading to the most recent iOS and checking that the AirPods were running the most recent firmware. When customer service was unable to remedy the issue, they advised me to send the AirPods in for repair. I received a FedEx shipment box and label and made them an offer for repair. The AirPods were returned to me approximately three days later, along with a message from the technicians claiming that there was nothing wrong with them.I then tested them on my phone and my wife's phone, and the right microphone on both phones would only detect sound at a very high volume, but the sound was still garbled. I phoned Apple's customer service department once more. The representative advised that I take the AirPods to the local Apple Store and explain the problem to a professional there. Unfortunately, the nearest Apple Store was an hour away from my house, however the agent did not appear to find this to be an issue.I expressed my unhappiness with having to drive 2 hours round trip to fix a $130 equipment, and I inquired as to why I couldn't send them back for repair while determining the specific problem. The agent agreed to send another shipping box and note that the problem was with the right microphone on the repair ticket. I got another package, sent the AirPods in for repair a second time, and waited. They gave them back to me and said there was nothing wrong with them. And, once again, the right microphone isn't working properly.At this point, I'm left wondering why the \"World's Most Valuable Company\" would consider it appropriate to force a client to spend 3 hours of my time repairing Apple's product rather than just shipping a new pair and keeping the consumer satisfied.

Sound quality is standard and pretty much the same as the wired earbuds. The battery life is really good and you could listen for the entire day relatively uninterrupted if you use one AirPod and swap when the battery runs low. Even when I don\u2019t use them for several days, the battery doesn\u2019t drain so they can last a long while if you leave them around. However, there\u2019s a frustrating issue that I\u2019ve encountered more times than should be acceptable for rather highly priced earbuds. This is mostly relevant if you tend to only use one earbud at a time though; it\u2019s not a major issue if you normally use both at the same time.The first pair I ordered came brand new and sealed, but within a few hours, they had already stopped working properly. The right AirPod would not connect unless the left was also in use. Troubleshooting guides suggested resetting the AirPods, reconnecting, testing on other devices, and etc., but nothing fixed the issue, and it was consistent throughout multiple devices (iPhone, iPad, PC). I ended up returning these and requesting a replacement.The second pair I received, which is the one I currently own, worked fine for the first couple weeks. However, the issue from the previous pair started occurring with these as well. I decided to keep these despite the problem because unlike the first set, these seemed to function properly at least sometimes, so they weren\u2019t consistently dysfunctional. Resetting the AirPods also temporarily resolves the issue, but this isn\u2019t the most convenient thing to do when it 1. happens rather frequently (pretty much daily) and 2. I have a case, and you need to hold onto the button on the back of the charging case to reset\/reconnect. Also, weirdly enough, this pair had the connection issues with both AirPods. Sometimes the right wouldn\u2019t work without the left, and other times the left wouldn\u2019t work without the right. It\u2019s probably a weird coincidence, but it always seems like the one I want to use at any given moment is the earbud that doesn\u2019t want to connect without the other.Anyway, I kept the second pair because they were functioning well enough, and I had purchased them for $99 which I guess isn\u2019t too awful for brand new and legitimate Apple AirPods. But if the price was higher and I knew about this connectivity issue, which seems to be rather common judging from all the troubleshooting forums I found, I probably wouldn\u2019t make the purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1613952000000}

The bass is at the right level and doesn\u2019t sound distorted at all like some earbuds. Where they really shine as some reviewers have pointed out is in their seamless integration with Apple products. Say you are using your iPhone and decide to do something on the iPad. By just picking up your iPad the AirPods will connect to it. All of this happens without you having to do anything besides picking up your device. It\u2019s also easy to keep track of battery life. Opening the case displays a 3D image of pods and case with the battery status of each on your iPhone\u2019s screen. If you happen to misplace your AirPods you can use the Find My app to locate them. You can play a sound on each pod if they\u2019re outside the case but it isn\u2019t that loud so I\u2019m not sure how useful this would be in practice. One of things I like is that I can still hear my surroundings when they\u2019re in. With the volume at the right level it\u2019s possible to hold a conversation and listen to music too. So these aren\u2019t noise cancelling. They\u2019re a deal at $99.

{"reviewTitle":"The Best","reviewDescription":"The AirPods are incredibly easy to use and come with a charging case that talk about up to 24 hours of battery life. And I love the ability to use Siri hands-free, the AirPods make using your phone more convenient than ever before.One of the most impressive features of the AirPods that I also liked is their seamless integration with Apple devices. Once you've paired your AirPods with your iPhone, they'll automatically connect to any of your other Apple devices that are signed in to iCloud. This means you can listen to music on your MacBook, take a call on your iPad, and then return to your iPhone without ever having to manually switch your AirPods between devices.Another great thing about the AirPods is their sound quality. The AirPods deliver a clear and crisp audio experience, and the noise-canceling feature ensures you can enjoy your music or phone call without any outside interference. And with the new spatial audio feature, the AirPods provide a surround-sound experience that truly immerses you in your content.The design of the AirPods is sleek and modern, and they're incredibly comfortable to wear. The earbuds fit snugly in your ears and won't fall out, even during strenuous exercise. And because they're so small and lightweight, you'll hardly even notice you're wearing them.One of the few downsides to the AirPods is their price. They're not the cheapest wireless earbuds on the market, but the quality and convenience they offer make them well worth the investment. And because they're made by Apple, you can trust that they're built to last.Overall, the Apple AirPods are a fantastic product that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a high-quality wireless earbud experience. They're incredibly easy to use, offer great sound quality and noise-canceling capabilities, and have a comfortable and modern design. If you're an Apple user looking for a great pair of wireless earbuds, the AirPods are definitely worth considering.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"49 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686096000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Almost seamless integration","reviewDescription":"I'm cheap. This was in large part why I resisted shelling out the money for these. Consequently, I tried several other Bluetooth earbuds, several on the decidedly cheap end of the scale. One of the problems I experience is finding earbuds that fit my ears. I have very small ear canals, so the earbuds that have the cone shape tip that fits into the ear canal either just won't fit, or are extremely painful after a short time. The only shape I've found that actually works for me are these, which I discovered with the first pair of wired Apple earbuds that came with a new iPhone several versions back.I included this picture, which shows the Airpods on the left and the much cheaper knock-off I tried. I thought I'd be okay with the shape of the cheap ones, but as you can see, they are actually much larger than the Airpods, so they were frequently falling out of my ears, especially when I was doing any physical activity.So, I bit the bullet and shelled out for the OGs. Here's my take:Pros:-Integration with other Apple products. I have an iPhone, iPad and Apple watch and these work quite seamlessly unlike any others I've tried. I put \"almost\" in the title because I'm sure it will be improved on in further versions, I'm just not sure how. Oh, and I've never used \"Hey Siri\" as much as I do with these. I love being able to adjust the volume (among other commands) hands free. True story: Yesterday I was riding a scooter home from work, and not wanting to remove either hand from the handlebars, I wanted to use Siri to increase the volume. There was enough ambient downtown noise that Siri was having trouble hearing me, so as I was tootling down the busy city street I was saying \"Hey Siri\" repeatedly at increasing volume, until I was shouting it. Not one of my finer moments...-The fit (see above)-Quick charging. I will have something to say about the battery life in Cons, but one saving grace is that they charge remarkably fast. I do a lot of work from my computer (like a lot of others during the time of COVID), so I appreciate being able to get a quick charge on them between meetings.-Sound quality. I am not an audiophile, so my opinion here is very pedestrian, but they seem to have a good dynamic range. I've been blown away by the bass response coming out of such a small thing.Cons:-They still are not very secure in my ears. I suppose that could be more my issue than the Airpods, but I did have to buy an aftermarket accessory kit that included the silicone tips with wings and a silicone lanyard. Sometimes I commute to work on an electric scooter, and if it weren't for those (particularly the lanyard) I would have dropped one of them in the street multiple times. Sometimes I walk over a grate in the street and have a brief moment of fear that one will pop out of my ear and through the grate. With my luck, it isn't so much an issue of \"if\", but \"when\". (Side Note: if Apple doesn't sell replacements individually, they should)-Battery life. I figure I get about 2 hours of active use, which is fine and I think what they advertise. The curious thing is that the two discharge at very different rates. I'm trying to keep track so I can take them into our local Apple store and ask about it, but it is odd, and I have seen other reviews that also noted that issue.Overall, I give them 2 thumbs up!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1599696000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Some Great Features","reviewDescription":"Ever since I switched from Android and PC, I've become Apple-centric. Since Apple products like Apple products, I decided to buy some Air Pods. Amazon's Prime Day price of $114 finally brought them down to what I considered a little bit better price, so I bought them.Pros:1. They connect very quickly with all my Apple devices.2. The sound quality is a few steps above some of the other ear buds I've had. The stereo is good, and while they don't have enough bass for me, they don't sound tinny either.3. They fit fairly comfortably in my ears, although the right pod fits better that the left one does. Maybe I have an oddly-shaped left ear!4. So far, neither pod has fallen out of my ears. However, I've worn them mainly in the house, so I don't know how it would be if I was running. That, I'll never know because I don't run anywhere.5. The case opens very easily, and the pods are fairly easy to remove. I really appreciate this because my Jabra case is so hard to open that I would often have to get my husband to do it for me.6. I love, love, love the fact that I can say \"Hey Siri,\" and get so many things done. I was watching an Amazon Prime show on my iPad Pro the other day, and I told Siri to mute the volume, and she did it! However, when I said to un mute, that didn't happen. Maybe I need to figure out some other terminology for that. When I said to rewind a couple of seconds, it did that, too. This is a really great feature.Cons:1. Other than the price, the one thing that kept me from buying these was how silly they look with that long white stem protruding out the ear. One person said they look like a hair dryer, and they do. I have noticed that the Air Pods Pro have a much shorter stem, and thus they look more normal. I guess when the get down low enough in price, I'll probably buy them and give these to a friend or relative.2. They don't have noise cancellation, which I would really love to have. I guess I'll have to wait for the Pros for that.3. I didn't realize that they had wired and wireless charging versions, and I ended up with the wired ones. However, I bought a wireless charging case for less than $10 from Amazon Warehouse, so I'm going to see if that works.Overall, other than some of the cons I mentioned, I really do like these. They connect quickly, have a pretty good sound, and the hands-free Siri feature is great. However, I would say that if you can afford them, you should get the Air Pods Pro because they look better, and they have more features. If you can't, these would be a great stop-gap measure until the Pros go down in price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1604102400000}

They\u2019re just earbuds so I don\u2019t expect audiophile levels of sound quality or any noise cancellation. But for an apple product, these things have far too many bugs for their price.These things are terrible outdoors or in very large spaces. They will cutout and disconnect, because I\u2019m assuming the signal is too weak and doesn\u2019t have anything to bounce off of. That makes them basically useless for the outdoors or in wide open spaces, like large atriums or gyms. I can really only expect to use these in the home or office, which meant I had to buy another pair of headphones that worked outdoors. It\u2019s a bit ridiculous.Speaking of home and office use, the mic does not work well at all, and is unusable for phone calls, video\/zoom calls, etc. So again, I have to switch to a headset or my other pair of headphones for that, since people cannot hear me if I attempt to use these.On top of that, they also have issues with ear detection and randomly disconnecting from my iPhone. I\u2019ll be wearing them, listening to whatever, and suddenly they just drop the connection, as if I took them out of my ear. The only way to get it working again is to place it back into the case and take them out again and place them back in your ear. It\u2019s very annoying and happens almost every time I use them.I\u2019ve used two pairs since 2018, and both have had these issues. I\u2019ve only used them with other apple products, multiple iPhones and an iPad, so I know it\u2019s not a device compatibility or Bluetooth issue.My oldest pair has almost no battery life left, and is only useable for less than an hour at a time, so don\u2019t expect these things to last more than a few years either.In conclusion, these have always felt like a step backward from a classic pair of wired earbuds. Sure, they\u2019re wireless, but it just feels so much less usable in so many different ways, while being 10 times the cost. Apple needs to seriously step up their wireless earbuds game if they insist on moving away from wired connections and forcing us to use the garbage pods.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657670400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Still not up to the level of quality one would expect from a $140 pair of earbuds.","reviewDescription":"I am comparing these to my ~$40 SoundPEATs Q29 model i bought 2-3 years ago.  Its almost as the the pros and cons for these two competing earbuds are reversed.Apple AirPod PROS:Battery Life: ~5 hrs listening time. And the case holds charge for, i don't even know how many charges. I haven't counted but its significantly higher than the SoundPEATS.Ease of Charging: SO SIMPLE. The magnet inside secures the airpods to the charging electrodes. The soundpeats lose their connection to the electrodes constantly so it never fully charges either earbud. I would have to constantly twerk and manipulate the buds in the case to make them charge.Ease of Connecting: The chip helps them connect without any problems.Audio Latency while watching video: NONE!!Custimization: Really like that you can customize the controls for either right or left AirPod. However, would like, more gestures I'd like to customize. Like, instead of just a 2 tap, also have a 3-tap. That way you can customize 4 controls. I'd really like to be able to repeat a song, or turn up and down the volume.Apple AirPod MEHS:Audio Quality: Just a little better than the SoundPEATs... not much but it is noticeable.Apple AirPod CONS:Connectivity: Because of the Apple's forced upgrading, we can't use these on devices running anything before iOS10. That means I can't connect to my First Gen iPad. (the thing is still chugging along and great for streaming NetFlix, Hulu, and Videos.Comfort: The SoundPEATs were super comfortable and fit snuggly in the ear. The shape of the AirPods bothers my earholes. I even purchased some vinyl condoms with earplugs to cover it up. It makes it more comfortable, but its still noticeably more uncomfortable. Also, those vinyl covers don't allow the AirPods to fit in the case, so I have to remove them all the time.... which isn't too bad since I ended having to do that with the SoundPEATS because I couldn't get them to charge properly with the earbud cushion? on.Look\/Style: The AirPods look dumb as hell. The SoundPEATs are small and round and fit right in the ear and don't have a white wang hanging down over your earlobe.Dropped Connection\/Choppy Audio: Ok. Here I was thinking that the AirPods would correct this issue with the SoundPEATs. When I'm oustide working in the yard, audio was choppy regardless if the phone was 10 feet away or in my pocket. Nothing I did seemed to correct it. It was like this with the SoundPEATS. I THOUGHT that the chip in the AirPods would keep this from happening. NOPE. SAME PROBLEM PERSISTED and was made worse by the fact that they were 3.5x more expensive!!!!!  Work fine in doors and while I'm at work in the lab. Must be some sort of interference outside. But really, Come on. Its 2019. GET IT TOGETHER.Exterior Audio: UGH The AirPods fail spectacularly here. Not only do they get choppy while I'm out doing yard work, but because they don't have a rubber tip that seals up the ear canal like the SoundPEATs, that means I get to hear the FULL sound of my lawnmower and weedwacker and it drowns out my jams. And also my nagging boss at work and rando plebians i come across in my travels. Also this means they will be practically useless on an airplane. The SoundPEATs helped block out the engine drone and crying and shouting babies, children, and MAGA douchenozzles.Overall, I like them enough to keep using them for regular use but I will need to go back to my SoundPeats for airplane travel and yardwork.

These things don't seem to last that long at all.Noise cancelling does not exist.  I was under the impression that these had some noise cancelling ability and, even in the review, it asked me about the noise cancelling.  You have to get the AirPod Pros for noise cancelling.  My fault, I guess, but if i would have known that, I would have purchased the Soundcore by Anker instead.I got these on Prime day for $90.

{"reviewTitle":"Great when you need to listen music and your environment","reviewDescription":"Let's first start off with noise cancellation: It's non-existent. You WILL hear everything going on around you, with turning the volume up just damaging your ears. This is due to the AirPod kind of laying inside your ear, which doesn't create a seal as in earbuds with silicone tips. This not only kills any noise cancellation, but will cause sound to bleed to the outside when loud enough (say around 50%).The issues above are also benefits in environments like offices or schools. This is thanks to the lack of noise cancellation. With music playing, talking to someone sounds just the same as without them. In addition, without a seal being created in your ear, they have to be louder than usual, which they certainly are (Not by a huge margin, but a noticeable one). Now for the stem of the AirPods, they aren't just for show. The microphones in the stem help make calls sound clear and usable.The shape of the AirPods are a hit-or-miss. They'll either fit you or they won't. The best way you could test this is by trying on some EarPods, as they are pretty much AirPods with wires (design-wise). For me, they fit my ears, but start to slip off on their own. They don't fall, but they give me the sensation that they will. You can fix this with some rubber hooks that go on the AirPods to hold them in place inside your ears (You'll need to remove them when putting them back in their case though).The battery life is...fine. It's not abysmal and will last you a good while, but it's not anything to write home about. At least the pop-up when opening the case will remind you of charging them (On an iPhone, I don't think it'll do this on Android). It charges via lightning, but there is a version available with a wireless charging case if you'd like.Sound quality is good, but not perfect. Bass is not it's strong point, and some instruments do get muffled out on some tracks. Vocals can be heard well (which helps out on calls) though. Disclaimer: I'm not an audiophile, just a guy that listens to music for hours.Initial pairing is relatively simple on an iPhone\/Mac, just open them while being close to your intended device. The AirPods connect nearly instant when taking them out of the case. While I can't speak for Android or Windows devices, I would assume that they would pair the same way as any other devices, but don't take my word for it.Also, there is no official water\/sweat resistance to them. I haven't used them in these environments, but have heard stories of them surviving washing machines (Which I will not be testing). Take that with a grain of salt though.Overall, they are great earphones for me, but make sure you know what you need of your earphones first. If you make a lot of calls and want to hear everything around you, these are the ones to go for.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"219 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690761600000}

{"reviewTitle":"I love these.","reviewDescription":"I like the fact that they fit perfect in my ear without me having to keep pushing them in. I bought the AirPod 3 first and they was hurting me so bad I had to keep jamming them in my ear to even hear. Gave them to my daughter. I got these, the 2s and these are great. I\u2019ve had them in all day and have been dancing around and playing with the kids and they are still in my ear. I had forgot that they were which is scary bc I can easily lose them. When I purchased these they arrived half charged and the charging cord and case didn\u2019t work at all so I had to send back and wait two days for the replacement pair. When I got the second pair, the cord didn\u2019t work again however I had a few around the house to use. I couldn\u2019t tell if the case was charging bc this model has no charging indicator unless it\u2019s the light when you open the case. Anyhow, the only way that I was able to see if the case was charging was either one or both of the pods have to be inside the case. If both are in my ear I wouldn\u2019t be able to see if it was charging so I would think that the case was broke and defective. I finally put both pods back in and the case showed up on my phone indicating that it was charging. I took one pod out and was still able to see it charging. When I took both buds out I could not tell if the case was even charging at all until I waited about 30 minutes put both pods back in then the indicator showed back up on my phone on full percent almost. That\u2019s going to be annoying. So far so good on the battery life. I just got them today and have had them in since like 1:00. And they are not dead although I just had them in my ear while doing homework. Not listening to anything. The sound quality kind of sucks which I needed the noise cancellation due to me working at Amazon where it is very loud. It\u2019s clear and good for anywhere besides a loud environment. I have not tried them at work yet but I had a knockoff brand that were louder than these so I know I\u2019ll still have issues with the sound on these. I\u2019ll get the pros for better sound later and give these ones to my son. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied and I\u2019m happy that I have these. Hopefully they perform well and lasts a while. I\u2019ve heard others having there\u2019s for more than three years. I recommend these if you have issues with ear comfort with other ones. These are comfortable. Love themUpdate\u2026 I did not like them after a couple days. They did start falling out with my oily ears. They wouldn\u2019t stay in. I ordered the 2 generation pros and I\u2019m Inlove and boy are they loud. Spend a few extra dollars and get the pros for better ear support and comfort. I\u2019m never going back to anything else.

{"reviewTitle":"LOVED IT!!","reviewDescription":"I recently got my hands on the AirPods 1, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every possible way. From the moment I opened the sleek white charging case, I knew I was in for a treat. These truly wireless earbuds have become an indispensable part of my daily routine, and here's why they deserve a solid 5-star rating.First and foremost, the sound quality of the AirPods 1 is exceptional. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced across the entire frequency range. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or engaging in video calls, the AirPods deliver an immersive and satisfying listening experience. The bass response is surprisingly punchy, and the vocals are rendered with impressive clarity.Pairing the AirPods with my devices is an absolute breeze. The seamless integration with my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook is something to marvel at. The moment I open the case, they automatically connect to my device, allowing me to dive straight into my audio without any hassle. The connection is stable and reliable, ensuring uninterrupted playback even when I'm on the move.The design of the AirPods 1 is both elegant and practical. The sleek, minimalistic earbuds fit snugly in my ears, providing a comfortable and secure fit. I can wear them for hours without experiencing any discomfort. The lack of wires is liberating, allowing me to move freely without any tangles or restrictions. Additionally, the charging case is compact and pocket-friendly, making it convenient to carry the AirPods wherever I go.One of the standout features of the AirPods 1 is their battery life. The earbuds themselves can last for hours on a single charge, and the charging case provides multiple charges, extending the total usage time. This means I can enjoy my favorite music or podcasts throughout the day without worrying about running out of battery. When it's time to recharge, the Lightning connector ensures a quick and efficient charging experience.Lastly, the convenience of the AirPods 1 cannot be overstated. The built-in microphones allow for clear and hands-free calling, and the touch controls on the earbuds make it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and activate Siri without reaching for my phone. The smart sensors also automatically pause playback when I remove an earbud, which is a thoughtful feature that saves both battery life and playback progress.In conclusion, the AirPods 1 have proved to be a remarkable companion for my audio needs. With exceptional sound quality, effortless pairing, comfortable fit, and long-lasting battery life, they have truly earned their 5-star rating. If you're in search of a truly wireless listening experience that combines convenience, style, and superb audio quality, look no further than the AirPods 1.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"123 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684886400000}

So I plugged them in and instantly they tried to connect to my phone and said something along the lines of if these are not your airpods do not connect and they were already titled 'AIRPODS DE KEVIN'.

They're supposed to be effortlessly convenient to pair and use for all your Apple devices while sounding and looking good. But they're not....they're none of that. Let me explain:Sound - it's ok, really. No seal so you hear all the ambient noise around you which is good and bad depending on the situation. Not much for bass extension, treble is flat but clear. Adequate all things considered. If you've used the old design earpods, these are nearly the same sound profile. On a plus, the microphones are very good.Features - very little to say here. They're Bluetooth (5.0) so they pair quickly and have long range, when they work (more on that later).Battery Life - very good, a couple hours at high-ish volume on the pods and half a dozen charges per case charge. More than I need for most situations.Functionality - 100% atrocious and I've had 3 sets of these (shame on me). The case and charging system is so faulty it leads to numerous other problems with pairing and connecting both AirPods at the same time. The contact points in the case and on the pods where they charge easily loses connection, dirties, and later corrodes. Using them for fitness around any sweat or moisture will speed up their inevitable failure. Once this happens, one pod will refuse to charge or stay connected when put back in the case, draining it's battery or trying to reconnect to different devices when in the case. Even if they didn't suffer constant bugs, the pairing with multiple devices is equally buggy, frequently losing connection or trying to connect to other devices in the house for no apparent reason.As far as I can tell, AirPods Pro share the same charging design, so I will listen to my own advice and stay far away from these until the design is fixed.

The only plus sides are how quickly they connect to Apple products and battery seem to be decent.I ended up returning mine and had a horrible experience with Amazon that made me rethink about buying high value items on Amazon. I utilized the Amazon pickup service, UPS picked it up and delivered the package to Amazon. A week went by it still shows that the package has not been picked up. I contacted Amazon and Customer Service confirmed the package has been received and a refund will be issued in 48 hours. A month went by still no refund. I reached out to Amazon again, this time they said the returns team said the wrong item was returned, they discarded the package and will not be issuing a refund. I personally handed the package to UPS so I know the right item is enclosed. There apparently is no way for customers to dispute or request an investigation, we just had to take their words for it. I spent thousands of dollars on Amazon. If I want to \"pull a fast one\" I would've done it on something much more expensive...Anyway, the moral of the story is to think twice about buying anything expensive with Amazon if there's a chance you might return them.

Then I use the Airpods and within 15 mins they make a noise as if they're almost out of battery. It's so frustrating. My only option now is to take them to an Apple store and see if their technical people can solve the problem. I bought these brand new last summer, and the problems started within 30 days.

Long story short, purchase from Apple or target or maybe even Walmart.As for the pods themselves, I would recommend getting the pro.

I can listen to my music and podcasts, but can still hear if an alarm goes off or if someone starts talking to me.For me it has great battery life. I have yet to have the earbuds die while I'm using them -- the charging case is quite convenient.I started with the 3rd generation airpods (but I lost them at the airport), which has a more dynamic touch sensor (tap once to play\/pause, tap twice to either skip backward or forward). These second generation headphones do not have a single touch option, so I have to click twice on the left ear to play\/pause and twice on the right ear to skip forward. Meaning, you can only have two commands through the airpods, one for each ear, but you are able to set what you would like those to be. It makes no sense to me why an airpod can detect a double tap, but not a single tap?If you can afford it, I would get the 3rd generation airpods, which also have a surround sound feature. Since I need the lower price, these airpods work for me.They also have worked great for me while talking on the phone. I have difficulty when there are heavy winds (I live in the city and spend a lot of time walking outside), but otherwise the input and output quality is great on phone calls.They are compatible with most Bluetooth devices, so I use them with both my iPhone and my PC.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"48 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1681344000000}

But I purchased these on Amazon for ninety nine bucks and the apple site sells these for one hundred twenty-nine bucks.I checked to see if the serial number checks out on the apple support site. It did identify as 2nd gen airpods but stated it could not validate my purchase date. That doesn't prove much.The airpods seem to pass the sniff test on my bluetooth settings.My box states that it was assembled in Vietnam. I checked online and it states that it should say \"Assembled in China\" for some and other sources state that \"Assembled in Vietnam\" is fine.When I connect the airpods to my iphone, it does offer me 6 months of apple music. If they were fake, I don't think offer would be available to me.I do notice fast battery life. The moment I take them off the charger and begin using them, I notice them turning to 99% full in about 5 minutes without any use - just wearing them in my. ears. The sound is not what I would expect from Apple - some crackling noises but maybe I'm just nitpicking. The sound on music is pretty good. When I'm cranking the volume all the way and listening to music, people can hear it from 3 feet away in a quiet room. When using bluetooth on calls, I'm told that my voice is coming crystal clear.Everything I checked seems to check out and these are real 2nd gen airpods but my skeptical mind tells me these are really really good fakes.In any case, these were a hundred bucks and work pretty good.

{"reviewTitle":"Terrible product support with unrealistic expectations of customers","reviewDescription":"My wife purchased these for me as a gift in August 2020 and they worked great up until about a month ago.  At that time, the right ear bud microphone began to fail and would no longer detect sound unless I was yelling.  I contacted customer support at Apple and worked through all of the potential resolutions such as updating to the newest iOS (14.6) and confirming that the AirPods were running the most recent firmware.  When customer support was not able to resolve the issue they suggested that I send the AirPods in for repair.  I received a shipping box and label for FedEx and sent them offer for repair.  The AirPods arrived back at my home about 3 days later with a note from the technicians stating that there was nothing wrong with them.  I then tested them again on my phone and my wife's phone, and with both phones the right microphone would only detect sound at a loud volume (i.e. yelling) and yet still garbled.  Again I contacted customer support at Apple.  This time the agent suggested that the next step would be to take the AirPods to the nearest Apple Store so that I could demonstrate the issue for a technician there.  Unfortunately the nearest Apple Store is 2.5 hours from my home, though this did not seem to be an inconvenience in the eyes of the agent.  At this point, I stated that it did not make sense to drive 5 hours round-trip to repair a $130 device, and I questioned why I could not send them back for repair while identifying the exact issue.  The agent agreed to send another shipping box and to include on the repair \"ticket\" that the issue was with the right microphone.  So... (can you guess where this is going?) I received another box, sent the AirPods a 2nd time for repair, and waited.  Again, they returned them to me and stated that nothing was wrong with them.  And again, the right microphone still does not function correctly.  At this point I am left wondering why the \"World's Most Valuable Company\" would find it acceptable to ask a customer to take 5 hours of his\/her time to fix Apple's product, instead of simply sending a replacement pair and keeping the customer happy.  Apple's product support has ruined what could be a great product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1625184000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Doesn't fit for everyone and gets lost easily","reviewDescription":"When i bought this product i was sure i found the best possible Bluetooth headset.Now after having it for few months already (or rather say not having it for few month) i can voice my opinion clearly.These peered well with my phone, and You can hear well in it too. But here comes the downside of this:A-It doesn't fit well in my ear. Gets my ear itchy with the feeling of my ear needs to breath :). I need to take it off in middle of a call for a few minutes because of comfort.How can a one shaped earbud fit universally into everyone's ear??????? It doesn't have the soft pieces in the end which makes it flexible fit in the ear customized to your ear shape.As a side note, I purchased clips to hold these around my ear. They helped somewhat.B-It is so small which looks cool on the ear but gets lost so fast. Only if you have the apple phone or device with it you can have the app which locates it in case it gets lost.This is the other downside of it.C-It doesn't cancel out noise well. When washing dishes I would rather use a cheap round the ear headset because with these the other person on the other side of the line would hear the water running and I would come in very not clear.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1667347200000}

Also go inside of warehouses never loose connection. They turn on as soon as they touch your ear. you can hear the beep. Talk time is around 3 hours on full charge. they also beep when they are down to 10 percent of battery left. Very easy to charge just put them back into case after a few minutes they are up to 75 % charged. To charge the case just use your I phone charger. You have to charge the case about every 3 pod charges. My wife uses hers for walking and around the house. They don't fall out will walking outside or the treadmill. She charges hers about twice a week. (the case that is). The price is great on these. You can even get them on sale sometimes. You can also use 1 pod or both. Easy to connect to I phone. Just turn them on the Bluetooth will find them. you can also be about 100 feet away from phone and they are still connected.

I truly appreciate the convenience of Airpods, as they eliminate the hassle of tangled wires, but given their price point of $100, my expectations for their durability are much higher. I expect these to last at the very least a year, not a couple months.The recurring issue I've encountered is a drop in sound quality in one of the Airpods, rendering one fully functional while the other falls short. It's important to note that replacing a single Airpod costs almost as much as buying a brand new pair. This has become more than just a minor inconvenience. Not to mention, unless you have Apple Care, Amazon is very strict on not giving out replacements so I essentially wasted over $300 spent on Airpods that stopped working within just a couple months!!Apple, please improve the longevity and reliability of your products.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697414400000}
