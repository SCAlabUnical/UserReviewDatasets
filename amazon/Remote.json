When I first got it I immediately thought it felt cheap and light, and it had to pointed DIRECTLY at a very specific spot on the TV. Even slightly off that spot and it wouldn't work. It's also not responsive. I would have to hit buttons multiple times - to the point that I thought something was wrong with my TV due to the lag. This remote is also missing the little \"bumps\" on certain buttons which make it easy to know which buttons you're touching without having to look at the remote.  Within just a few moths the battery cover would no longer stay on, despite no visible damage. I finally decided it wasn't worth the trouble and looked for another replacement. I found an actual Samsung replacement on Amazon for just $1 more than this cheap one. As soon as I took the new Samsung made remote out of the packaging it felt DIFFERENT, heavier, more solid and substantial. The new remote weighed more than this one without even having batteries in it while the this one had them. This is cheap, flimsy, does not work well and quickly fell apart. And most importantly, you can get a MUCH better one on here fro practically the same price. This one is going into the trash now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670544000000}

No number buttons or the typical option buttons etc., so I purchased this Samsung Universal remote to replace it.  It was perfect!  I kind of freaked out when I first received it because there were no instructions included.  But I had read a previous review on this remote that said it worked right out of the box, so I put in a couple batteries (not included) and gave it a try.  First I turned on my TV with the original remote. I expected some kind of \"new device\" notice or set-up screen to come up but there wasn't any, so I decided to just try the buttons on the new one. I adjusted the volume, changed the channel, used the previous button etc.  They all worked!  Even the Guide button brought up the program guide!  I don't connect my smart TV to the internet.  I use an HD antenna, and I didn't even need to reset the Source.  It detected all the settings on my new TV without me having to do anything except turn it on and go. In the attached picture, the original remote that came with my TV is on the left.  My new remote on the right.  This is the easiest remote to use, I am soooooo glad I got this new remote!

This was the best 10 dollars I've spent this year. This remote works just like the original Samsung remote I had misplaced years ago. I didn't even have to set it up. I literally put in the batteries and it automatically connected to my TV, then setting up the antenna was done in a flash. I am impressed. I have saved quite a bit of money by switching from cable network and using my antenna. I get LOTS (and I mean LOTS) of channels (even local stations) by using it. This remote helped me get there.

I got up to answer the door, and BAM! Power button gone! Now I know what you're thinking, \"Maybe he's teethin.g\" Nope! He has all his teeth in. He is just an evil little jerk.We have also kept the old remotes for him to gnaw on, but he doesn't want those.
