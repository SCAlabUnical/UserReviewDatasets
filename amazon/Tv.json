{"reviewTitle":"Great Monitor for My PC!","reviewDescription":"I bought this as a computer monitor for my Windows 10 PC and the image is excellent!  However, here is a longer-than-necessary note about a BIG negative experience I initially had, thinking (mistakenly) that it was the fault of this TV.  Several days ago I was shocked to discover that whenever a typical alert happened on the computer such as \"printer out of paper,\" etc., there wasn't just a little chime that emanated from the TV, but an ear-splitting blast of sound!  I've never experienced this before.  My ears actually hurt from the sound blast.  Looking for a solution online, my search brought up the \"best\" suggestion which was to go to Settings > Sound > Expert Settings > Sound Feedback > OFF.  But... that did NOT shut it off.  Then, when I hit the MUTE button to temporarily eliminate the problem, there was an annoying SPEAKER SLASH icon that continual flashed on the screen.  Now, here comes my confession of folly, my big \"duh moment.\"  I finally checked the settings on my faithful PC and realized that, for some reason, my PC's audio setting had jumped to 100%.  I'm so glad I checked this because it had never been a problem with my previous monitor -- a 70\" Vizio that had to be replaced because of dying pixels that were creating large dark shadows.  SO... after adjusting the PC's audio settings, all is now PERFECT.  It's odd because I never tampered with the PC's audio settings.  Therefore, if you have this same problem of ear-splitting noise explosions erupting from your Samsung TV, maybe this story will provide your solution.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"46 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663891200000}

This option is a joke. Also in the advertisements when I purchase the TV, it advertised that I can speak commands into my remote to do things such as change channel, volume, etc. B*******!

The Audio is clean also, I use a sound bar, but it is nice to have decent audio within a TV this small. If not for the imposition of Samsung to force the \"smart\" features upon me, I would have given it another star.My biggest complaint about this TV is getting through the setup.  I don't want yet another smart phone app nor do I want the packaged SAMSUNG bloatware.  I use the TV with a ROKU, I wanted to hook it up to HDMI and be done with it.  I don't want yet another interface or any of the SAMSUNG Apps and I wasted 30 minutes figuring out how to bypass all that.It comes with Smart Hub defaulted to on but it is not obvious.  So every time you start it it asks you to agree to terms and conditions even if you disable the network by skipping past that.  It really tries to get you to connect to the internet.  Seems to be pretty \"smart\" when it makes business sense but not so much for the user.  A TV should first be a TV, if people want the \"smart\" features, they should be given a choice to setup that way.I do like that the remote has a source selection button.  Once you get past all the setup inconvenience and you disable smart hub from starting each time, you can use it as a TV and quickly switch between input sources .  Newer versions of SAMSUNG and other TVs make you go to the menu to select your source which takes too much time.I don't know why SAMSUNG (and others) offer an abundance of streaming channels with poor content.  I don't see this as profitable nor useful.  As a user I want to quickly find quality content.  I think manufacturers should package ROKU or Fire Stick and standardize content management vs. inventing their own.  I believe it would save on overall cost and simplify navigation for users.  Numerous content managers is adding too much complexity and I think this is a case where open competition is adding to overall cost and decreasing efficiency.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"33 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671148800000}

I think they're giving up space for useless app buttons that would be much better served with a sleep button. Downgraded rating to a 3 because of this one thing. The sleep function is buried waaay into the menu, and when you're drowsy and want to re-set it, you'd have to wake fully in order to get through the menu. Very, very bad design. Sadly, it seems that most of the manufacturers of 43\" TVs (I don't know about larger ones) have abandoned the sleep button, so I haven't been able to find any alternatives. Fortunately, I saved the remote from my old Samsung TV which DID have a sleep button, and it works--not as nicely as it did with the older TV--but it does at least get you down to the sleep function of the TV without having to drill down through the menu. The Samsung Store on Amazon has a universal Samsung remote that's supposed to have a sleep button on it (the picture doesn't show one). So I ordered it and we'll see if it has the sleep button and if it works with this new TV. Very disappointed that this one item could downgrade an otherwise great TV.-----------------------------------We purchased a swivel table mount for this TV, and the VESA screw holes are really big--so much so that the table mount didn't come with screws that large. Picked some up from the hardware store, but couldn't use any washers because no washer will go around the screw and still fit in the hole on the back of the TV. It's not a deal-breaker, but I'd have preferred to put the washers as well.As far as performance, I've been buying Samsung TVs for years and have always been pleased.

{"reviewTitle":"A Solid, Simple Telly","reviewDescription":"I need to mention the first time we got it, I can only assume some clown tried to steal the new TV we ordered and gave us a completely broken, used, different (smaller) sized TV in a box advertising what we ordered. But the box even looked worn. And even the parts, like the legs you have to screw on were all different.Thankfully we have good experiences with Amazon customer service. So aside from that experience and upon receiving the true Samsung 40 in, I *really* like it. I have always been a 100% LGTV buyer. And maybe all brands have this feature now, and I\u2019m behind, but they have this Samsung TV Plus feature and it\u2019s like free built-in cable. But it\u2019s not regular cable, which to me is the worst. It\u2019s very nuanced channels, like one channel seems to just play old Baywatch episodes. There\u2019s a Bob Ross channel. They have 3-5 crime channels, and they play the best of true crime from 80s- early 2000s, such as Forensic Files, the original Unsolved Mysteries, The New Detectives. The commercials are quick or there is just silence with a \u201cwe\u2019ll be right back\u201d image. This is so up my alley. I hope it always has this feature.Also it\u2019s easy to connect to all your other streaming accounts","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1627430400000}

They're made of flimsy plastic and poorly designed so that every time you so much as breath near the TV it pitches forward. Solution: For a temporary fix we duct taped the feet down to the console table until we can order a stand for it.If you're going to buy one of these, order a stand and the sound bar or speakers at the same time.

The manufacturer must surely know that this size TV is generally too small for modern living rooms, where digital-input audio equipment is most likely to be found. In our home, this TV is wall-mounted in the kitchen where there is no room for a digital-to-analog converter.I just never imagined that a TV without \"speakers\" connectors would be sold, so I didn't check for that before buying it.

Seems like a pretty dumb design flaw especially considering that the optical cable is included with the TV. The HDMI cables are still accessible with the mounting product I used and would be with most others. The Antenna\/Coax is also still accessible, and I'm only connecting those two cables. If you wanted to connect more items and use a mount it might not work well. Otherwise it's a good TV with a great picture and easy to use functions.

In order to use the features I bought this tv for (to use the apps and spectrum service) you must download the terms of service.  I connected my internet just fine, yet when I attempted to download the terms of service it said my internet connection wasn\u2019t stable and it quit.  My connection is 200 mbps.  I went through 4 wifi routers.  I went to the neighbors.  I tried a wifi hotspot.  6 total internet connections and none of them are good enough for this television.  All of my devices run just fine on my internet, yet this TV is so advanced that it can\u2019t?  So I called Samsung customer service.  They wanted the error message and when I told them they said nothing is wrong with the tv, and that my internet doesn\u2019t work.  Can you imagine?  To make a tv that is the only electronic device I\u2019ve come across in decades which I can\u2019t get to work with my internet?  Yet it isn\u2019t their fault.  So I\u2019m returning it and will never, ever purchase a Samsung anything ever again.EDIT:I've changed the review from a 1 star to 3 stars as I figured out the issue.  Samsung customer service was no help, and I took to the internet to see if others had similar issues.  There was no shortage of people who had the same issues I did, however I couldn't find a solution.  After a few hours of searching and reading, I came across a post which stated that the reason for the internet issue is because the TV was originally set up in another country, and the TV won't connect to Samsung if a different country than the original is detected.  To get around this, one must 'reset' the TV, which is an option deep into the settings menu.  I did this and was able to successfully set up the TV.  This should be an easy fix for Samsung, and certainly a troubleshooting step, however it's not.  Their answer is simply \"your internet doesn't work, get a better internet connection.\"  Unacceptable they have this flaw, unacceptable they don't acknowledge it, unacceptable I have to go deep into internet research to fix it, and unacceptable you can't use basic functions of the television because they gate keep it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1650931200000}

I'm not sure if that's Netflix or the TV. Love the use of apps. Comes preloaded with Netflix and Prime Video. Yay. Perfect size for an RV bedroom. One thing I noticed, which is not the TV's fault, is that if you are using a jetpack for internet (due to being in an RV,) you cannot use Prime Video most of the time due to the streaming being too high a quality for (Verizon) streaming. I would recommend getting a 720p, as adjusting the quality of the streaming in Prime on this TV appears to be impossible. Also, who makes a remote without back lit buttons in this day and age?

I already had a Sennheiser RF transmission headphone system that accepted analog audio input from an older Samsung TV. This model TV, like most, no longer provides analog audio output. So I purchased an analog-to-digital converter, also from Amazon, made by Techole. Here is what I had to do to get it all working: (1) As other have written, notice that there are almost invisible flexible protective coverings on both ends of the optical cable provided with the Techole adapter; you will need to scrape these off using your finger nail. This then plugs into the optical audio out port in the TV and the in port in the converter. (2) You will need to locate in Samsung settings, under Audio and then Expert Settings the two entries related to HDMI and switch them to the PCM option. (3) I used the red and black (importantly, not yellow, which is video) RCA input jacks in the hard-wired cable to my Sennheiser to connect to the output of my Techole adapter; other means of connecting (e.g., using a headphone jack) should also work. (4) With this done, I could hear audio through my Sennheise headphones whether or not the TV was in mute mode and whether I was using conventional TV input from my Verizon box or separate input from my Samsung BluRay\/DVD plalyer. The problem was that I could not hear through the headphones if I had selected an alternate source (Netflix, Amazon, etc) from the TV itself. After an extensive chat session with Samsung support, we finally found that if I disconnected the TV power from the wall and disconnected all connected cables and then reconnected and powered up the TV, all worked fine. Good luck.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620086400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Very Happy With This TV","reviewDescription":"I am very happy and impressed with this TV.  We have been using ours for a few months in the kitchen area, and it has performed flawlessly.The picture quality is great!  It is sharp, bright, and very natural looking.  I think the 1080P feature helps too, and is worth the slightly higher cost of this TV over comparable models.  But a great picture requires a little extra initial work.  When setting up any TV, you'll find that there are many picture adjustment options; some are on\/off, some are selections, and some are ranges.  Yes, it's a little tedious, but take the time to go through each option and set it to what looks good for you.  The effort is totally worth the enhanced enjoyment of your TV viewing.The sound quality of this TV is also excellent for its size.  Conversations are crisp, music is pleasant, and the volume can go up much higher than I would ever want.  Remember that you are listening to the built-in speakers of a relatively small television, so don't expect the same sound quality as you get from your Dolby 5.1 surround-sound entertainment system!Other reviewers have complained about WiFi connectivity problems (connections lost), but we have not had this problem.  Perhaps it's a function of signal strength or modem brand?We are very happy with our purchase of this TV, and I recommend it highly.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"38 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661644800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great TV Complicated Remote","reviewDescription":"Love the TV, don't like the remote! Smart features are nice, but don't like the fact that you can't turn on the TV without it automatically accessing Samsung TV Plus. I'm using YouTube TV and although the TV does have a setting to access the app you were using when you turn off the TV it only works with just a few of the preloaded apps. So, you have to select the app you want each time from the Smart Hub. Not a huge deal, but it is more cumbersome than I'd like. Will probably load my Roku device at some point and just use that.Many have stated that this TV doesn't have the ability to mount on the wall or from a TV mount. That is not correct. It has 4 screw holes in the back to mount a standard 100x100 mount. Was very easy to mount in minutes. Just remove the screws from the TV that are there when you unbox and use the supplied screws from your mount.***01-06-23 - Update to review. Sending TV back, the picture in a dark room is very washed out and attempts to make picture changes didn't improve the picture. Not sure if it's just this TV or inherent in this model. Will continue my search for an acceptable model for our bedroom.

I bought it as a back up for the identical model from 2018, in case it goes bad.  I bought it at Costco and it still works.  There were some issues with picture quality.  When you turned it on it looked pretty good and in a few minutes the overallscreen just kind of became darker and stayed that way.  I got used to it.  I just watched it through a component and that made it a little brighter.  This new one is very bright and it stays that way.  I think they've added some improvements to this particular model.  I kind of freaked out trying to start it up, I'm not too technically inclined. The picture and sound options are a little different than the 2018 model.Those are the only ones I've messed with.  But I got the picture to my liking, so I'm happy with it.So if you're one of those people who like watching a 32 inch tv screen, this is a pretty good tv.  And I don'teven watch HD channels.  The back panel is the same as the 2018 version.  I'm not sure I'm going to usethe smart features so, I didn't rate them.

The rest is top-notch.I have this TV for couple weeks and love the picture quality, the size of TV, and the price. Being Samsung TV, it has tons of Samsung TV channels, plus I use smart TV apps, and a few local TV channels I receive with a small indoors antenna (I have no cable TV subscription).It took to time to set it up, Wi-Fi connection did not work and I use ethernet, but I guess it is caused by the router being in another room.I am close to illiterate in tech gadgets and I am not paid to promote other Amazon products.I like to use headphones, but this TV has no bluetooth in it. If you go to TV settings - sound, it says something like HDMI-ARC. After googling all these mysterious words and reading answers about this TV, I bought \"HDMI ARC Adapter Audio Converter\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0791CFGY1\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1I already had (also bought on  Amazon) bluetooth transmitter receiver, and bluetooth headphones.https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B09DD33SDD\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B09JGF23V3\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I paired these headphones with bluetooth a few days ago (they said \"paired\" but had no sound).I connected the converter to the HDMI ARC in TV via HDMI cable, and also to USB in the TV as power supply. Then I connected the converter to the bluetooth transmitter via audio cable (red and white cables), and got a great sound in my headphones.I had the TV connected to a soundbar via optical cable. Now I can use only soundbar (ot TV speakers without the soundbar), only bluetooth headphones, or both at the same time.The sound quality is very good. If you are looking for the best listening experience (bass, various music etc.), I can't answer because I was looking for a good quality sound via headphones and I got it.Overall, I highly recommend this TV.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1645401600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good for a spare room or bedroom, built in speakers audio quality could be better.","reviewDescription":"Good choice for use in a spare room or bedroom. built in speakers audio quality could be better. If you don't opt in on the Smart TV features and data collection you are constantly annoyed with a pop up on power on or exiting from different programming options encouraging you to turn on the Smart features. Why would you not want to turn on Smart features? Perhaps like me you do not want to share your TV usage data with Samsung and 3rd party affiliates.  Even with Smart features disabled when you have connected to your home network via Ethernet cable or WiFi you can access shared hard drives on devices attached to your home network. I did not have to enter the userid and password Windows 10 usually requires to access these shared devices between Windows computers. Was able to access the external drive attached to my home router without entering a userid and password, not sure how this magic is happening. May be a security concern for some. The dismal audio quality from the built in speakers reminds me of what I heard watching my parents 1964 vintage Zenith 19 inch black & white TV. Audio quality might improve if you use a soundbar. Was hoping to test it with a pair of good quality amplified computer speakers however the only audio output options are an optical cable or HDMI ARC connection. No Bluetooth. HDMI cable not included with TV. Only cable included is the power cable. Remote control is easy to use and includes numerics making it easy to select off the air channels. Was able to easily configure the remote for my DIRECTV Satellite receiver to control TV power on\/off and volume. When turned off a RED LED is illuminated on the bottom right of the TV bezel which may be annoying to some insomniacs.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646956800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Quality smart tv","reviewDescription":"I returned a popular smart tv that had a problem with audio synch that could not be fixed by calling the manufacturer. I carefully repacked in the original box. Amazon return policy is excellent. I then ordered thisi Samsung model and saved $40. This Samsung has a much better picture quality and overall much better than the brand I returned to Amazon. Before setup, have your wifi password available. Setup is a little tricky. Carefully go thru the steps. Don\u2019t rush. During the setup you can add apps to the preloaded lineup. You can select Hulu, Utube, travel and others to the standard lineup that are listed when you push the home button on remote. During setup you have to setup a Samsung account which I found annoying. They strongly encourage you to get an app for your phone that cost me $20 and found it to be of little use since my iphone mirroring feature did more. Do not get it,  its a waste of money. Somewhere on the main menu look for a sub menu that has apple play option and switch to on so your iphone mirroring will work. Also there is a smartcast setting that may work with android phones. Phones must be using same wifi as tv. I had a problem programming the xfinity cable box remote for tv volume\/power control. I moved the cable box from blocking the lower right corner of the tv and it worked. The Samsung remote has large number keys prominently displayed at top of remote that you rarely use while some of the often used keys are smaller and not well placed. There are a,b,c,d colored buttons that seem to have no function.  In settings for picture and audio control there are a few choices for preset settings. You cannot select individual color, brightness, bass, treble etc. I was ok with the picture selections but would like to add more bass to the sound but cannot. Overall, its a very good smart tv at a great price. Update. After almost 2 years still a great tv. Recommend getting a Roku streaming device with TV controls ($40) for easier and faster use than the Samsung remote.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"58 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1626393600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good quality in a smaller TV","reviewDescription":"I wanted a TV to wall-mount in my bedroom where I have limited space. I was a little surprised to learn that it's actually getting difficult to find a top-quality TV in a smaller size these days - this Samsung was about the best we could find in a 32\" model. Still, despite it's small size, it does have all the essential features, as well as a very good picture quality.The TV itself is very light weight and was easy to wall mount. I used an articulating arm mount that lets me tilt and position the TV any way I want, and the light weight helped make this easy. The TV remote is the same as other recent Samsung TV's use, so if you're used to the layout, it will seem very comfortable to you.This is a \"smart\" TV, meaning that it has apps for things like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and many others available. With a fast internet connection, you should have no trouble watching whatever you like through the TV, even if you're a cord-cutter. It's probably a small thing to most people, but I also appreciate that the power draw - especially when the TV is off - is very low.I'd rate the picture quality as very good overall, with a nice bright picture that's sharp and contrasty with most content. Black levels are good, and about the only thing I notice is a certain \"harshness\" that's common to lots of TV's these days. I admit, I was a plasma holdout, and now my main TV is a 75\" OLED just to avoid this issue, so I may be a little more sensitive than most.Overall, if you need a good quality smaller Smart TV that's still capable of putting a nice quality image in front of you, then this Samsung is definitely worth a try.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"690 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1530921600000}

I have a couple of serious issues and a lot of ticky-tack fouls, but I have only had it working for three hours maybe something will change. If you hit a non-letter key while entering your username, you start over. The paper user guide that comes with it is worthless: there are no instructions on using the tv in it. I know it seems obvious, but the start-up manual does not tell you to plug the tv into power. The tv rejected my attempt to register it during set-up then refused to recognize my wireless internet. Customer service was fantastic, spent a hour helping me get through the mess. The menu is about 11 icons on the bottom of the screen. Most of them are subscriptions. Could not find a way to either delete them or to more the channels I want to the left so I don't have to click umpteen times to get past the ones I will never buy (Netflix, Disney, etc). When setting up, the skip button does not work; you have to click the next step number. Privacy Settings are ridiculously complicated; I gave up trying to figure out how to change them. Manual is useless in that regard (and just about every other regard as well). Adding a channel does not add it to the menu; you have to do that manually. Channels are considered apps; use the app button to add one. But after you add one, when you click the add button to add another, it takes you to the channel you just added, NOT to the add apps screen. Powering off and on worked sometimes to get back to the add apps screen but not often. Screens time out way too fast. Frequently the Home button doesn't, and you are left trying to figure out how to get out of a submenu on your own. With some items on the menu bar (like Disney), it is difficult to tell which icon is selected; you have to move the selection to figure it out. The on-screen keyboard is really screwy. Click a letter and a checkmark covers the letter to the left. If that is the letter that you want, you have to move left twice: once to the letter, which clears the check mark, and once to select the letter. Frequently the letter that is selected changes to a different letter when you move the selection, then changes back when you move the selection again. Frequently when you click the Setting button, the Settings screen does not open leaving you wondering what to do; actually the first couple times it happens, you don't know that anything is wrong, so the instructions, if you found any, appear to be wrong. I didn't find any info on the remote control, like what the PRE-CH and A, B, C, and D buttons do. That's enough; you get the idea. OK, I hate it so bad that I have to continue. The user interface is aweful. They are so busy trying to get you to watch the channels they want you to watch it becomes a chore trying to watch your channels. I have the Newsmax channel on in the background 4 to 6 hours a day. Every day I have to search for it. When I find it, they offer me Newsmax on Haystack. When I select Newsmax, one more time they offer Haystack. When you move the selection, I mentioned it above, it is hard to tell where you moved it to. While you are trying to find it, the thing times out, takes you somewhere you don't want to go, and you have to start all over. If I could afford it, I would toss the thing; I'm 74 years old and on a limited budge.

I love that it has more antenna channels than my old TV could find and the awesome bonus Samsung TV plus channels makes me feel like I have cable! LOVE IT!! After 2 weeks I came home and turned it on and the sound was very muffled so I called customer service and all I had to do was unplug it for 30 seconds and plug it back in. I am happy with it! I just hope there's no more issues with the audio because I saw a lot of reviewers talking about that. The remote is smaller than my other ones which is kind of a pain in the butt and I have small hands. So I use my older remote for certain things. Otherwise very pleased and thrilled that it has all the apps (even hulu!) except the CBS app and regular Paramount so have to use my roku on my other TV for that.Update oct 2023 so like many were saying about the audio it occasionally  BLASTS a muffled hot mess until you unplug it for a few. I ended up getting a soundbar which definitely helps me hear the TV better without blowing out the speakers. I dropped it down to a 5 star to a 3 because of the audio, the closed captioning and the auto smart hub feature. Every time I set up closed captioning it disappears again.. plus the smart hub auto runs even though that is always turned off.. I should not have to unplug my tv every single day or multiple times a day to get the closed captioning to stay on and auto hub to not pop up. I read that it's some kind of a bug in the code or something all I know is it's annoying. Even with the Soundbar I still like to be able to read what is being said so I don't have to rewind on an app or so I don't miss something on live tv because sometimes I don't understand what people are saying.

This time I unplugged it, waited 30 seconds and plugged it in again. It worked. I called Sam Sung and spoke to an agent and told him everything.

Also, it is one of the better TVs of this size, and it is very easy to mount in a small space. However, there a few things to consider before buying it. First, it appears to be overpriced. For $40 more you can buy a 50-inch Samsung smart TV, 6-series, which is much better then this one in every possible way. Second, the speakers are relatively loud, but the sound is a little distorted - somewhat metallic and unpleasant. Third, the picture is very bright, but the colors and contrast are not quite realistic. Perhaps the greatest disappointment is a not so smart (and somewhat irritating) \"smart\" component. Whereas the TV comes with preloaded applications, the setup is not user friendly, and Samsung does allow for any meaningful customization. Moving from one application to the next, changing channels and viewing guides is much more difficult compared with streaming devices, such as Roku. Also, there are almost no additional applications, which can be downloaded from the Samsung store. I have another (older) Samsung TV, which works much better for streaming Internet content than this one (with a Roku streaming stick, which can be purchased for $30-45).

The smart functions on this TV are terrible.  The OS seems to be an older version and will not update.  The apps are also older versions than what I have on the 55\" TV and, likewise, cannot update them.  The basic set up for the TV's system refuses to work.  Every time I start the TV, it prompts me to run the set up.

I ended up having to go in and change my Wi-Fi password so that I could type it in with no capitals. And then, it still wouldn't connect. At this point, rather disgruntled and just wanting to have some features for the night, I tried to hook up my fire stick to it, and that's not working.

{"reviewTitle":"Samsung Horrible return policy","reviewDescription":"Product arrived with fracture screen. Samsung wouldn't replace but sold me larger tv, which also arrived with fractured screen.

{"reviewTitle":"Don't waste your time or money","reviewDescription":"We were looking for an affordable, somewhat basic HD TV and this fit the bill. Less than one month past the 12 month warranty the TV stopped responding to the remote. I spent two hours with support trying to trouble shoot it only for them to say it's needs to be repaired. The repair was quoted to cost the same amount as the TV. Unsatisfactory customer service, I'm never buying a Samsung product again. I'm not sure who they work with on repairs but the person who called me was quite terrible and unhelpful.I suppose that's what we get for buying a cheaper TV, but I expected more from Samsung.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1649289600000}
{"reviewTitle":"THIS IS THE WORST TV THAT I EVER OWNED\ud83d\ude21","reviewDescription":"The TV has a mind of it\u2019s own!  It shuts off or turns on by itself. (That\u2019s if it goes on at all). After months of frustration, I finally believe that there is something wrong with the  \u201cSmart TV\u201d, which I never use, Sometimes the Smart apps come up with a blue screen. NO PICTURE or SOUND. Other times nothing happens at all. If I unplug the TV (which is very difficult for me, I have nerve damage in my back), then wait a minute, and plug it back in it comes on. Then the cycle starts over again the next time I try to put it on. \ud83d\ude21 Many reviewers have the same problems.Many more issues, sound, picture & changes channels. Turns on in the middle of the night. I wanted to return it, but my son-in-law threw the box out when he set it up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1566432000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Lying description","reviewDescription":"It leads you to believe you have smart tv. All the apps are on the tv but you have to download the samsung app where you have to give it permission to read all your info on the tv and your phone to use any smart features and even then the app is glitchy and you have to go through several steps to use specific  smart features. Instead of a menu in the tv. Deceptive and over reaching. Not only that but the Alexa capability was never on there.  When the arrives it says it's only for higher end models.  Nowhere on the description does it say that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1649030400000}
{"reviewTitle":"TV does not connect to Alexa as advertised","reviewDescription":"The quality of the Samsung TV is fine. The problem is connectivity with Alexa. Although the Amazon description and the information on the Samsung Box clearly say that the TV is compatible with Alexa, it is NOT !!After spending more than an hour with Samsung support, where they took remote control of the TV, and told me that they were transferring me to another department to install the necessary app, I was cut-off. When I re-called Samsung they told me that the TV would not work with Alexa because I had the wrong model of Samsung Smartphone. I'm disappointed with both Amazon and Samsung for not specifying that Alexa compatibility was dependent on the type of phone that is used.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1640908800000}
