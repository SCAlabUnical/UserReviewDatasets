{"reviewTitle":"At this price, we couldn't resist. We are well pleased.","reviewDescription":"Who can resist upgrading at this low price? This is a great value on a beautiful smart TV. My wife and I are in our 70's. We had difficulty reading captions on or old 24\" TV. Problem solved! I completed the install with a little help from our caregivers. We purchased a mounting kit with an extension arm for our bedroom. This enables us to fold the TV against the wall when not in use, and easily extend the set for viewing. I plugged in our Amazon Fire Stick with no problems. The numerous streaming services included with this TV will expand our viewing options. We plugged in a new DVD player and our DVD library has been revived with a 40\" picture. We are thoroughly delighted! Although... We have several remote-controlled accent lamps in the bedroom. The remotes for the lamps interfere with the TV remote. Ho hum. We are still exploring lighting solutions. Meanwhile... Pink Floyd rocks in 40\" splendor!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711324800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Best size, Best price TV!","reviewDescription":"Didn\u2019t want a ginormous TV, no space for it.  Searched for long time at Best Buy, Costco and Amazon for a 40\u201d TV that would fit on my etagere shelf.  Not all TV measurements are the same, you have to consider height with the stand.  This Vizio 40\u201d with the stand fit perfectly into my shelf space width wise, about 2\u201d to spare in width and height, and 2\u201d was just enough to allow for angle adjustments.  My other existing and prior TV\u2019s are all Vizio and I am quite happy with the Sony brand. I am using a Roku device and everything works great!  Very happy with it so far.  I\u2019ll update my review later if there\u2019s any problem.  I also purchased the extended warranty just in case. In my decision process, other criteria that I factored in is that Amazon would deliver to my doorstep, therefore I would not have to drive anywhere, look for or wait for assistance, or ask for help at home to carry or drag it in from my SUV.  That was a big plus!  I only wish I had bought it sooner.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710115200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Exceeded My Expectations in Every Way","reviewDescription":"Purchased this TV during the 2023 holiday season on sale. With the cost saving I included the 2 year warranty as I am not someone who enjoys replacing things constantly beyond the original manufacturer\u2019s warranty. We also have a competitor\u2019s tv in OLED and a larger format in our home. I prefaced these detail in my review because I went into purchasing this item as a bedroom tv with the expectation that the image quality and the tv\u2019s operating system would be disappointing compared to our competitors brand OLED television; boy was I wrong. If the image quality of this tv was the only thing I could shared positive reviews about I would be doing an injustice to the really well engineered user experience this television accomplishes. As someone who has worked in the field of IT that supports knowledge and learning end-user experiences, I can say first hand that Vizio did their homework to give this SmartTV its Smarts with intuitive and intelligent software features in the TV and the App that works seamless together. Now about the image quality. It is clear from the initial setup, the demo and ultimately the software update of the tv\u2019s user interface that this tv\u2019s processor, for the cost, does an exceptional job at image reproduction. The 1080p Full Array LED is balanced,  clear without appearing overly saturated and glossy which differs from OLED.  I think for people who prefer a more balanced image reproduction that feels a bit more natural and not as \u201cprocessed\u201d, this Vizio\u2019s full HD engineering provides an experience that delivers on this description. I have not yet fully tested my Switch experience on this television beyond toggling  a few games back and forth in the Switch UI and playing a few YouTube videos and some Hulu programming. So far, again, I am impressed. Having purchased this tv only based on the holiday sale price and reading a few reviews of other shoppers for this price, this television far exceeded everything I expected in a SmartTV at this price point. If you are shopping for a value driven over achieving SmartTV that isn\u2019t 4K or OLED, this is the one I would recommend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"53 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706659200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Finally, a decent review","reviewDescription":"To begin with, this review is for the Vizio D24f-J09.  Amazon reviews can be very helpful...to a point.  Unfortunately, they often include models other than the one you're viewing, so you have to be careful when relying on them.  In this instance, reviews go as far back as 2018, which means they are for TV's other than this one.I tried two other 24\" TV's (LG and Insignia) and the pictures were very mediocre (although some reviewers thought they were fine).  I had a Samsung 24\" before with a beautiful picture, so I had something to compare them to.  The picture on this TV is not as good, but it is pretty good, once adjusted properly (I'll speak to that in a moment).  It is the most recent 24\" TV from Vizio (as of March 2022).  There is one other 24\" model in their recent lineup, the D24f4-j01 which has a bezel-less design.Of interest to almost everyone getting a 24\" TV is the sound.  Out of the box, the sound is OK, but not as loud as many would prefer.  However, there is a way to correct this, which I'll get to shortly.As to reliability, I've had this since November 2021, so it's too soon to tell.  So far, so good, although Vizio has a bad track record in that regard.It comes with lots of apps built in, probably all that most people would want.  I don't see a way to add more.  I can't tell you how well they work on the TV itself, as I use Amazon's Fire TV stick.  With that, you can add tons of apps.  That works very well.There are two HDMI inputs on the back.  It should be noted that this is not the traditional ultra-thin TV.  It is 2 1\/4\" thick, which allow for better (not great) speakers.OK, the settings you will need to get the best picture.  This is the results of weeks of fine-tuning that seemed the best to me.  You may need to make minor adjustments for your eye, but I suggest you try these for a few days before making any changes to allow yourself to get used to them.Go to settings (the black and white \"sun\" button below the Pluto button on the upper left)\/picture.

{"reviewTitle":"A great, compact 1080p flatscreen at a great price with a few issues.","reviewDescription":"We purchased this a couple of months ago (with our own money, no communication with or compensation from the company) as our old 43\" 720p flatscreen was starting to give out and have problems with the picture.  We wanted to downsize a bit given the space in our living room, and didn't want to spend a lot of money for a TV with a ton of features that we weren't going to use.  We did our research and settled on this 32\" Vizio as it had integrated Chromecasting (which we use every day) and a sharper picture than our old set without taking up a lot of room.After using it for a while now, we've got a pretty good idea of the ins and outs of this TV and how it works for our viewing habits.  Some pros and cons:PROS:Sharp screen\/picture quality - granted, it's not 4K\/8K\/etc., but it's quite a step up from the 720p screen we were used to.  Even though it's much smaller size-wise, shows and movies are noticeably better.  It does take some adjusting through the settings to find your ideal viewing settings; there are a few different settings for different use cases like gaming, and turning off the motion setting improved things for us as well, but make sure you play around with them to find what looks best to your eyes.Size and weight - it's featherweight compared to our old TV, very easy to mount and adjust and get where you want it without a lot of strain or stress.Inputs - you've got two HDMIs (one with ARC for using a soundbar), a USB port for powering something like a Roku, an antenna input and some various audio ins\/outs.  Unless you're looking for a plethora of input\/outputs, this will do the job for the average person out there.  Especially given the price, it would make a great secondary TV for a kids' playroom or similar location where you want to have one available but don't want to sink a lot of money into extraneous features.Built-in Chromecasting - this is a great included feature, and frees up one of the HDMI inputs that we were using on our old set for a 2nd Gen Chromecast.  We ran into a problem with this initially that I'll talk about below, but it seems to have smoothed itself out somehow.The Vizio TV app - we have Android phones and I really like the Vizio app for controlling the TV (switching inputs, scrolling through Netflix\/Hulu, etc.).  We have a cable box that can also scroll through inputs but not other settings, but for cord cutters or people who don't want to bother with a few different remotes the app connects quickly and reliably to allow you to control things.WatchFree - I just started scrolling through the included free movies and shows last night, and there's a good selection to watch.  Granted, if you're using other streaming services then you might either run into duplicates or option overload, but it's nice that Vizio gives you some extra choices for viewing when you purchase their TVs with this feature.Streaming apps - we use our phones and Chromecasting to watch Netflix\/Hulu\/etc., but you have a bunch of apps that you can load onto the TV itself and use in place of your phone if you so choose.  Better to have more options in this respect than fewer, I figure.CONS:The speakers - they're not great, our old TV was more powerful but we've gotten used to them at this point.  We thought about getting a cheap soundbar but decided against it.  Just know that for the price, you're not getting an audio powerhouse.  You can link a soundbar up multiple ways (look at the user manual online for instructions) if you require sharper sound.  It can get plenty loud, it's just that the quality overall isn't fantastic.  We don't watch a lot of stuff where we'd need super-high-def sound, so it works fine for us.  They're down-firing rather than forward-firing, which may have something to do with it.Chromecasting - I haven't had any problems at all, but my wife's phone wouldn't connect reliably for a while.  We plugged in our old Chromecast for her to connect to, and now she hasn't had any problems with either the built-in or external Chromecast.  I'm not sure what did the trick, but I'm not going to question a miracle.  She found online that other have had problems with reliable built-in Chromecasting, but given our experience YMMV.  I made sure that the TV connected to our WiFi with a static address to isolate that variable, but the only thing that seemed to work was the solution above.The picture settings - there are a few different default settings for things like gaming, motion enhancement, etc.  It can be a bit to go through in order to find your perfect setting(s), but if it's not looking great at first just try playing around with those settings.  I thought I was going to have to return it because the picture was a little dark around the edges and the motion enhancement was driving me nuts, but luckily I decided to play around with things and voila - I haven't messed around with the picture settings since the first week we got it.  It'd just be nice to have it start with a more common 'default' setting rather than one that's supposed to give you a great picture but in reality is just full of supposed enhancements in color, motion, contrast, etc.All in all, I think it's a great TV for the price.  It's got enough extras to cover the bases for most people and use cases if you're looking for a TV at this size and price range, without a bunch of stuff you'll never use.  It sets up quickly in terms of getting it out of the box, upright, and plugged in in order to use without having to go through a phonebook-sized manual (anyone remember phonebooks?) to figure it out.  The phone app is also very helpful and easy to set up, and I'd recommend this TV to others looking for the same thing we were.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"67 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705881600000}

I rescanned the channels twice (using \"find channels\" and \"find more channels\"), to no avail. So I started over with the system (after trying \"restart\" and unplug\/plug back in\"). Tried the channel again, still \"not available\". So I rescanned the channels twice, and it finally showed the channel 7.2 I was looking for. It took me an hour to get it to work. Very annoying!! It's a brand new tv, two weeks old. I WAS happy with it.....now I'm not sure. Now I find myself going back to that channel all the time, making sure it still works. If it does it again, (return time limit permitting), I'll have to exchange it for another tv. So I just wanted to let people know, in case they encounter the same problem. Very weird!UPDATE: 4\/4\/2024: After I posted this review, I lost the 7.2 and all channels in the \"7\" range on all of my tv's. I contacted the broadcaster, who informed me they are having technical problems with the affiliates in Phoenix. So apparently this had nothing to do with my TV! I can't explain why my other TV's were showing the channel(s) and not my newest Vizio earlier. But right now, none of the TV's are receiving the \"7\" channels.

{"reviewTitle":"Good Quality TV","reviewDescription":"I've purchased several Vizio TVs over the years and I've never experienced any problems with any of them. They are good quality TVs. The picture, sound, and the different settings options are great. The Vizio 40\" D-Series is also a good purchase for anyone wanting a quality TV at an affordable price. One thing to be aware of is that it doesn't have an ethernet port. If you're looking to plug an ethernet cable directly into your TV then this is not the TV to buy. I thought that it had an ethernet port and only realized it didn't when I went to plug in the cable. Never assume, always read the specifications before you purchase.

{"reviewTitle":"Worst TV I have ever purchased","reviewDescription":"I have had this TV for less than a year and I HATE IT!  Every time someone wants to watch this TV, they have to start fooling around with it 20 minutes before the show they want to watch.  Every time we turn it on we get the death spiral for a few minutes before we get the notice that it can\u2019t connect to the internet.  Then we have to try to uninstall the WiFi and reinstall it.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.  If we are lucky enough that it does work after that, you can bet that at least 4 times between 8 and 11 pm, we will lose the signal and have to restart the TV and go through the install process again.I thought it might be my router, so I bought a new, more powerful router but that hasn\u2019t helped at all.  The internet provider was out and couldn\u2019t find any problem with their equipment either.If we do get this thing to work, it is difficult to navigate a streaming movie.  There are no fast forward or fast rewind buttons.  Instead you have to click on the circle around the ok button to go forward or back, but it is difficult (with my big thumbs) to do that without going to a menu below and eliminating all the rewinding already done.We have a small TV in the kitchen and an older TV in the master bedroom and we never have any issue with either of those.  They turn on immediately and have access to the internet.  No uninstalling and reinstalling every time.I will never waste my money on another Vizio product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1708387200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Connectivity issues","reviewDescription":"Over the years we have owned several Vizio smart TVs. Our experience has been that the larger, more expensive sets function beautifully. Although they do require a soundbar, they have a bright screen and function quite well for our needs.However, we have found that the smaller ones such as this are quite temperamental. Each one eventually has one problem after another and away they go to be recycled.I have this exact TV in my den. It's been fine, but glitches quite often. It's an ongoing joke in our house. The other set we had of this size died within a year.Forever an optimist, I decided to give Vizio one last shot with this set. Maybe we'd get lucky?Unfortunately, we have found ourselves in the same boat as prior.I purchased this TV for our workout room to exclusively play exercise DVD's. Plugged in the DVD player and the screen came right up, they play perfectly. We installed a soundbar and this also functions properly.The issue is connectivity. We are a large household with a myriad of devices, a strong internet connection and several boosters throughout the house. My password for my router works for all of our devices.Not so with this TV. After several attempts we finally gave up and have relegated this set to purely workout DVD's. Thats fine for our needs, but the set should connect regardless.At this point it's far past time for our family to move on to another brand.  We gave it our best shot.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1711238400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not suitable for watching over the air (OTA) TV","reviewDescription":"Pro: full HD (1080p) screen resolution.Cons: everything else! Especially OTA TV support and [the total lack of] Visio technical support.We bought this TV to use in the small bedroom on our RV where anything larger would be too big. We wanted a Smart TV for occasional streaming, but most importantly, we require solid support for OTA channels so we can watch local weather and other travel critical information.Well, while this TV technically supports an OTA antenna, Visio seems to have gone to great lengths to make sure it isn't suitable for OTA channel watching.The setup process was unnecessarily convoluted, and after finally getting thru it, the TV did an update that made OTA surfing, to say the least, difficult and frustrating.Normally, when using the up\/down channel buttons, an OTA TV will show you what channel you are on. Nope, not on this set. That requires the annoying need to constantly reference the guide (loaded with disruptive advertising) to figure out where you are and find where you want to go.Visio has this \"Watchfree\" operating system that definitely does not favor OTA watching. If you don't care about OTA this may not be a problem for you, but overall I was completely underwhelmed and downright annoyed compared to other more mainstream TV operating systems.Another major flaw IMO, is this set only supports 2.4ghz Wi-Fi. Really?To top it off, a request to Visio service via Amazon went totally ignored. I for one will never consider purchasing another Visio product based on that fact alone.We ended up instead buying a Westinghouse 24\" Roku TV set that is incredibly more user friendly and very nicely supports OTA. When surfing OTA channels, you get not only the channel numbers displayed, but signal strength, resolution, the time, and even basic programming info. And it supports BOTH 2.4ghz and 5ghz Wi-Fi. The Westinghouse Roku set also acts as a DVR (pause live TV) if you plug in a USB stick. Even better, the Westinghouse Roku set was 30% less expensive than the Visio! A much better choice IMO.On the downside, the Westinghouse Roku set was only 720p, but on this small size screen the picture clarity difference is not really noticeable to ordinary humans.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698192000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Cheap TV that's fine when it works.","reviewDescription":"Knew going into the purchase that at under $200 this was not going to be an amazing TV. Initial thought when I mounted it was that it felt cheap and plastic-ee - but also, who handles your TV, so not a big deal since it looks like a very regular TV with a normal if not slightly thick frame. But I just intended to use it in my office, so again, didn't need anything flashy. The biggest problem is the software and the connectivity.We get our content through wifi on apps like Hulu, Netflix, etc. To navigate to an app, you have to sit through and click through several options where Vizio tries to sell you stuff or get you to use their apps. I haven't had this issue on any of my other branded TVs - mostly Samsung. So it's annoying to turn the TV on and have to navigate for a comparatively lengthy amount of time just to get to the app that has the content you want to search through. The software is also slow but recently updated and is slightly faster. The second biggest issue is that almost 30% of the time, it doesn't want to connect to your wifi. Sometimes it can't find your network. Sometimes it just doesn't like your password. Sometimes it doesn't want to respond to inputs on the remote. If this were my main TV, I'd be unbelievably angry and I should probably rate this TV 1 star. But because it's an office TV, and don't rely on it, I'm not weighting the connectivity issues as severely.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703548800000}

I just purchased another Roku stick for this latest Vizio and Roku reception is \"excellent\" per the device.

The bulk of the weight should be at the bottom of the remote and not at the top.

Instead, the weighted top of the remote falls off your fingers (who's the brilliant architect who designed this?). Backlighting would help a lot.I will never purchase another Vizio simply because I cannot re-arrange the user interface. In its current form it is loud, abrasive, in-your-face advertisements. I wanted an interface more like Roku that shows my apps in big tiles with easy access. In Vizio, my apps appear as tiny little tiles to which I have to scroll.Using the apps feature allows me to remove unwanted apps, but I can do nothing about the tile size or placement, and I cannot rearrange or remove any other sections like Trending and Recommendations (which never align with my tastes)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703808000000}

At one point, after having the tv for almost 2 months, the bottom half of the remote, from the \u201cHome Screen\u201d button down, stopped working.  It took over 20 minutes and a few taps on the side of my couch (literally) to get the remote to pair back to the tv.Literally, at this point, it\u2019s doing the bare minimum job of what I need it to do, I got it for half its worth on sale so I\u2019m just rolling with the punches ha ha.  But if you\u2019re looking for a good quality television, even for a smaller size, I would pass on this one.Update: just today as I write this review the remote once again has stopped working from the home button down so I\u2019m not able to turn the volume up or down Baha!

It never was successful in getting my account set up even though I tried multiple times via the computer and mobil phone & app.  Guess it's not that important but I'm not sure since it was not successful.I hate the internal speakers they are terrible and I'm just using the TV in my bedroom.  Kind of hate using this TV because if I turn it on I have to listen to it's internal speakers and I often can't understand what words are being said.  I used audio settings to try to get the loudest\/best sound I could based on others recommendations and my experimenting still audio is no good.  I had to order a sound bar which cost close to the price of the TV but now I have to wait for it to arrive and hope that works out.There is no Spectrum App in the installed apps and I could not download it into the Vizio control center, so I have to use a current Apple TV box.  Since you have to use a Roku, Apple TV, etc to add apps you have to use one HDMI port for that and the other for sound then you're out of HDMI ports.  The Apple TV with the Apple\/Spectrum remote that Spectrum sent me works much better than the Vizio control center of apps and having to use the Vizio remote the Apple\/Spectrum remote is far superior and it is lighted.  The DVR through the Apple TV does buffer, pause and shows freeze, I think it might be because this Vizio TV does not support 5G connectivity, kind of a turn off for a new TV purchased in 2023.The TV seems to turn on all by itself which is annoying and distracts me when I'm trying to work or concentrate on something important.There is an annoying light that lights up real bright at times and then blinks for several minutes.  When it's pitch dark in my bedroom at night and these lights come on it is not good, it is also distracting and annoying.  When I turn off all my bedroom lights for bed it's suppose to be a peaceful time.The picture quality seems pretty good but not as good as my 2008 Samsung 32\" 1080p TV which recently started malfunctioning.  But the sound of the Samsung was way, way better than this Vizio.  Others have said that the sound is so bad because of the very thin screen.

It's tinny and even with adjustments it's OK at best.  I bought an external sound bar that helps (thankfully).  Also, if you are an Xfinity customer, you cannot use the Xfinity app directly.  :O  You have to use an external streaming device such as a FireStick or Roku Stick and download the Xfinity app via the other device and use it from there (so stupid!).  Oh, and if you go the FireStick route, you need to have a FireStick running Fire OS 6 or higher, or it still won't work (learned that the hard way).  So be prepared to spend $160 on the TV itself... but possibly more if you like decent sound and are an Xfinity customer with an older FireStick.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1711411200000}

I wouldn't purchase this again due to the darkened spots that appear every so often, and the fact that it sometimes just shuts off.If you are on the lower side of income and are looking for something decent, I'd recommend this for you, but I definitely want something more reliable at some point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707696000000}

True to its claims, the TV delivers nicely on picture quality, making my cooking shows and morning news much more enjoyable with clear, vibrant visuals.However, calling it a \"Smart TV\" feels a bit misleading due to its restricted app ecosystem. The main downside is the limited selection of apps available. Unlike other smart TVs that offer a wide range of applications, this VIZIO model limits you to a handful of pre-approved apps, which feels like a way to nudge you towards their subscription services. This was a bit of a letdown for me, as I expected the flexibility to download and use any app I wanted.I found myself purchasing an Apple TV to bypass this limitation and access the apps I needed.

{"reviewTitle":"Alright for the price, but does crazy stuff on its own","reviewDescription":"This TV isn't bad as far as picture or volume quality, for a bedroom, as far as I can tell, at least. I did originally rate it at 5 stars, because when it first arrived we of course took it out of the box and plugged it in and everything to make sure everything on it worked, which it did, so it went back in the box for a little while until we got moved into our new place, which is why we bought it to begin with, but after setting it up in the new place finally, now it keeps randomly turning itself on, somehow. At first we thought maybe one of the cats stepped on the remote that was on the bedside stand or something like that, so we finally decided to put the remote in our dresser drawer to make sure it didn't get \"accidently\" turned on again, but it is still randomly turning on, which we realized is the actual TV itself turning itself on, somehow, and nothing to do with the cats or anything else, since the remote is in the dresser drawer now, and the dresser\/chest it's sitting on is to tall for the cats to jump on and get anywhere near the TV, so at least once a day we end up having to shut the TV off, after it turning itself on. I'm not sure what could cause such a crazy issue with it, but just make sure to keep an eye on it and don't think you're crazy if it happens to you, because you most definitely are not! I wish we would've tested it out a little better during the 30 day return window, even though we weren't going to be using it during that time period, I just like to plan ahead, so I probably bought it much sooner than I should have, but anyway, the moral of the story is to just make sure to properly test it over a few days time period, and don't make the same mistake we did. Other than it doing that crazy stuff, the TV itself seems nice (would definitely be a lot nicer if it didn't randomly turn on by itself, but what can you do, lol). That's the only reason I changed my rating to 3 stars now, from 5 stars previously, though.

{"reviewTitle":"Good value","reviewDescription":"I bought this for my wife to use in her study as a replacement for an old 20 inch. The High Def picture was a big upgrade as well as a slightly larger screen. Also, it was very light weight and I was able to turn it upside down on my thighs to screw in the support feet. The whole thing weighs just a little over 6 pounds. On the negative side, Vizio tries to get you to use all kinds of video services so I had to decline a lot. All I wanted was to link up with our cable provider which was also easy to do. The instructions were not top notch but I watched a couple of you tube videos which made the set up quick and easy. Recommend the 24 inch a good second TV.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"39 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692748800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Very good quality TV with a nice price.","reviewDescription":"This TV has a very good picture quality and is packed with a lot of nice features. The reason for 4 stars is because during use of remote control there\u2019s a slight delay in the signal transmission of the buttons pressed. So it takes a special talent to operate it.  However, I would like to offer some advice:  if you are purchasing a TV for an elderly person in the beginning stages of dementia, don\u2019t purchase a different brand than what the elderly person has previously used because they will find it very challenging.  I purchased this TV for my elderly mom and the best she can do is turn it on\/off, I have search and select the channels for her.

Also it is almost impossible to stream my phone to the TV without it glitching and trying the same with Youtube is a pile of hot garbage.

I use Chromecast to stream and the built in Chromecast in this TV worked perfectly and was more than easy to set up. In fact as soon as I went through the initial set up process the TV already knes I had chromecast and the TV responded as soon as I used my phone to start streaming. I was a little concerned about sound quality from other reviews but in my set up its really very good. Remote is fairly simple and intuitive. Its a very lightweight TV and worked really well with the TV wall mount I also bought. Only negative is I wish the power cord had been a little longer. But overall very happy!Update - after using it for a few weeks I\u2019ve noticed the built in Chromecast device is not the same as a \u201cregular\u201d chrome cast. On many channels it does not download video and audio at the same rate, so the video lags noticeably behind the audio, and it gets worse the longer you watch. I\u2019m talking several seconds after watching 2 minutes. I plugged in my separate Chromecast  into one of the hdmi ports and now the problem is gone. Still like the tv but it\u2019s disappointing I need to have another device plugged in to make it work properly.

Now, 15 years later, it seems they have not continued to innovate or even keep up with the times as this TV (just like a larger one of theirs I had a couple years ago) desperately needs a faster processor.  This TV struggles to simply scroll thru its own menu.  Way too much lag!B.  The speakers on this TV are just way too weak!  When sitting 4 feet from the screen I (and my kids) need to turn it up to a minimum of 50\/100 to be able to hear it okay.  If i have my fan running to keep cool in Hawaii, then its gotta be up to at least 75\/100.  I've got a $30 Bluetooth speaker that gets way louder.

{"reviewTitle":"Make sure to avoid the confusion","reviewDescription":"The term 1080p refer to the resolution transmission standard of TVs. not the visual resolution.  It means the device is capable of receiving signals of 1080 lines of picture in a \"progressive scan\" mode (rather than \"interlaced\" mode). But it does not guarantee that it can display it as 1920 dots per line and 1080 lines on the screen, which is the display resolution. That means that the display will be not as sharp as one specified as 1920x1080 display. This TV says \"Full HD 1080p\" but does not give the screen resolution, a yellow flag.Further, the display technology can be LCD (Liquid Chrystal Display) or LED (Light Emitting Diode). There are advantages and disadvantages to either, beyond the scope of this review.  This device advertises as LED but then proceeds to state that it is backlit by LED (a feature of LCD displays), raising questions as to which it really is.

The TV is incredibly light, even with its size I can hold it with one hand. Should be very easy to mount. I find that there are times when I turn the TV on, Vizio's media streaming center (main menu) does not want to load up. I don't know if its an issue with the TV or the internet signal, but I can press a media button like Netflix, then back out of Netflix, and then the main streaming center comes up.The sound is not so good. Sounds like cheap speakers, but expected for a budget unit. Picture quality isn't terrible, but when watching football, the image gets a little blurry during high speed camera movements.This unit would be perfect for the user who wants to have something to watch while working, or for background noise.

I was counting on that when I chose to order this particular TV.  They are not on the side as shown.  They are on the back.  I purchased a super flush wall mount and the jack locations created an issue for me.  I had to buy a 90-degree antenna jack adapter, a 90-degree HDMI adapter, and a two-way HDMI switch to make this work.  One of the HDMI ports was not available to me because my mounting plate covered it.  This was not supposed to be the case because the ports shown here on Amazon are on the side, not the back.Next up is the built-in Chromecast.  Turns out this feature only works if the TV is connected to the Internet.  Since my install is in my travel trailer, this is not the case.  Thus, Chromecast won't work for me at all.  I had to buy an HDMI to mini-USB cable to hardwire my phone to the TV in order to show downloaded Netflix content.All these adapters etc cost me a lot more $$ and still left me lacking in functionality that I thought I would have.With the above drawbacks noted, the TV otherwise worked well in my trailer.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1677024000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Updated: 3 stars to 1 star","reviewDescription":"I had recently moved my belongings from long-term storage and my old TV screen unfortunately cracked in the moving process. I needed to buy a new one, but was unable to spring for something super-expensive. I was drawn to this for the size and price point, and I was happy with my old VZIO model. I liked how I had the option to pay for the TV in installments, which increased the affordability for me.Setting it up was typical for new electronics \u2014 rather tedious \u2014 but once I got it set up, it was easy to log into my streaming apps. I do not have cable or play video games so I can\u2019t speak to that, but it does seem capable.I use the TV in my bedroom and don\u2019t need to keep the volume loud, but the sound does distort a little if I put it over 25. External speakers might fix the issue, but I don\u2019t have any. Since I bought it in January, there have been two times in which the sound cuts off completely out of nowhere. This was annoying, but the old trick of turning it off, unplugging the power cord from the outlet, waiting a few mins, plugging the cord back in and turning the TV on worked each time. Just an inconvenience to consider.Sometimes I do have issues with the HBO app specifically, even after making sure everything is updated. I\u2019m unsure as to why that happens.Overall, I wouldn\u2019t use this TV in the living or family room, somewhere where it\u2019d get a lot of constant use. But as an extra TV for the bedroom or office, it\u2019s a good size. You get what you pay for.UPDATE 9\/2022: Please don\u2019t buy this TV! Don\u2019t be roped in by the low price because you\u2019ll end up paying more in the end by buying this. The return window is a joke (less than 1 month) and I can\u2019t in good conscience try to sell this to some sorry soul on FB Marketplace or Craigslist.ALL streaming apps are super laggy, despite a strong connection to the fastest WiFi. The SmartCast Home Screen consistently has issues loading which, you know, is kind of important if you wish to use this TV for streaming (as most customers do). The remote has buttons for Disney Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pluto TV, iHeart Radio, Tubi, and Vizio\u2019s WatchFree Plus app, which is convenient \u2014 but only when they work! Even when the Home Screen is down, those controls only decide to function 25% of the time.Don\u2019t settle like I did - use your money elsewhere and invest in a TV that is reliable and that will work as advertised for longer than a few months. I now realize that TVs are a major investment.

{"reviewTitle":"Useless and Amazon customer service is terrible","reviewDescription":"I bought this TV for my daughter's birthday on May 2. Her birthday wasn't until June 1st, so yea, my fault for buying so early. However, we were going on a couple vacations and I was trying to be ahead of the game. Anyway, we didn't actually use the TV until June 23 and I registered it with Vizio. Upon the 2nd day if using it, it disconnected from the network. I tried for an hour to get it back up and running. It wouldn't even recognize the wifi. I factory reset it, powered it down, messed with settings. Etc...  nothing. I reset the router and nothing. A few days later, reset it again and it worked.  Then 2 days after that, it disconnected again and I went through the same routine. I see that Amazon gives you a 90 day warranty. So I chatted and was told to contact the manufacturer.. seriously!? What kind of 90 day support is that? So I tried the TV again. Nothing works to get this TV to go on the network. $165 wasted. So I contact Amazon again.  I'm told that the 90 days is support.. ok I said, so if I still get support and it doesn't work, I should be able to return it. Right? Nope!! Call Vizio, I'm told again. Vizio put a ticket to help but I've heard nothing again about it. I just want to return the TV and buy my daughter a different brand TV that will cost more.. Amazon would make out on this deal, but they want to be difficult and not help a customer out. I understand the 30 day return policy but this TV is faulty and I should at least be able to return or replace.. Amazon is going down the tube and as much money as I spend .. an exception wouldn't hurt them, but it would mean a whole lot to me and a little girl who just wants to use her birthday present. Shame on Amazon for selling a faulty tv and not standing behind the product or having good customer service...

{"reviewTitle":"Very disappointed with this tv","reviewDescription":"I recently purchased a Vizio TV and have been thoroughly disappointed with my experience. First and foremost, the picture quality is subpar. Despite claims of high definition, the images are often fuzzy and lack clarity, making it difficult to enjoy my favorite shows and movies.Additionally, the sound quality leaves much to be desired. Even with the volume turned up, the sound is muffled and lacks depth, resulting in a less immersive viewing experience.Furthermore, the build quality of the TV is questionable. It feels flimsy and cheaply made, and I worry about its durability over time. The remote control is also poorly designed and often unresponsive, making navigation a frustrating ordeal.On top of the numerous disappointments with my Vizio TV, one of the most frustrating aspects is its inability to properly run streaming apps. Despite having a strong internet connection, none of the apps I wanted to use for watching movies and videos would load reliably. Whether it's Netflix, Hulu, or any other streaming service, I constantly encountered buffering issues and error messages, rendering the TV virtually useless for its primary purpose. It's incredibly frustrating to invest in a television only to be met with constant frustration and disappointment when trying to access basic entertainment services.Overall, I regret purchasing this Vizio TV and would not recommend it to others. Save yourself the disappointment and invest in a higher-quality television from a more reputable brand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708214400000}

Older Vizio models on the same WiFi network have worked well for me, but model d24f-j09 is slow, and there\u2019s a few bugs in the software.It takes on average 5 seconds for the channel guide to display, another 1.5 seconds for each channel to be highlighted as you channel surf. Up to 9 seconds before the channel selected displays.Apple AirPlay will work, but\u2026 Vizio will freeze and display a black screen if you select a different iPhone video to stream via airplay. The tv is non responsive and requires the power to be momentarily disconnected. There\u2019s other software quirks I\u2019ve noticed but didn\u2019t write them down.Sound quality isn\u2019t the best, it\u2019s mostly fine but not for movies. I thought the Vizio soundbar SB2020n-j6 would improve sound but is all base, you\u2019ll have to tweak the tv sound settings as there\u2019s no presets I can find for vocal, music, or movies.The remote that comes with the tv is like most other remotes and poorly thought out with the button layout. Most people use tv remotes with one hand, this is awkward to do with the curved bottom and the numbers at the bottom of the remote. For single handed use you can\u2019t easily press numbers with your thumb without dropping the remote. It\u2019s a two handed remote for most people.This tv might be perfect for anyone wanting a small inexpensive tv that\u2019s not too concerned with the issues I listed. The picture quality ain\u2019t bad, the tv is just kinda of meh \ud83e\udee4.Update: Sept 2023This Visio TV sucks. On a daily basis it locks up and stops working. It must be physically unplugged to reset it. It looses all the input options, network settings, everything\u2026. Would rather go old school and use an analog tv.Update: March 2024Dark colors are heavily pixelated\u2026 Any movie scenes where the background is black or dark, the tv displays a heavily pixelated background.If a movie scene is filmed where the audience should see something emerging from the dark, you won\u2019t see it on this tv. When the dragons eyes are seeing you from within the cave, you won\u2019t know it until it breathes fire and illuminates a heavenly pixelated screen.\ud83e\udee4FYI - Walmart now owns Vizio.

It will tell me it can\u2019t find the network even though it shows that it\u2019s connected. I periodically have to turn it off and then back on to restart it when it jams. It\u2019s iffy about casting, sometimes it works, sometimes it jams up. I told customer service about this, it was a refurbished Amazon deal, and though I told them I\u2019d already factory reset it several times. So they told me to factory reset it, so very helpful. I just gave up. I\u2019d already thrown out the packaging by the time it started glitching so shipping it back was going to be hard anyway.

If you\u2019re very patient with this special needs tv, its fine but I don\u2019t recommend it. You can\u2019t switch between screens very quickly, the processor is obviously junk.

We want a TV that allows for watching broadcast TV using an antenna, but every time you go to the input for \"Antenna\", your antenna channels are sort of available  but nearly impossible to directly access chanels, and there's all this \"watch free\" stuff mixed in.  Tons of other channels from the internet mixed in with the antenna channels making simple viewing of standard broadcast channels a difficult task.  Why (WHY!) can't the input source labled ANTENNA just have the antenna stations!?We also watch YouTubeTV, another pain in the butt with this Vizio.  The platform they give for the YTTV App is also a total pain to navigate.

{"reviewTitle":"Vizio watch free+ and over the air channels is a \u201cbust\u201d!","reviewDescription":"Overall I thought this tv was going to be a good tv.  I wanted to watch over the air free tv channels and one of the latest updates now merges over the air channels in with Vizio Watchfree+ app and makes it difficult to watch JUST the over the air channels, because they are part of the WatchFree+, so when you choose the input of antenna it defaults to the Vizio WatchFree+ which means if you have internet connection it is using data for this app.  According to what other people said, this is not how it used to be, as you used to be able to choose Input of antenna and watch JUST over the air channels without having the Zivio WatchFree+ load as well.  This is cumbersome and not user friendly and freezes at times, especially if you are in an area of poor or no internet because then it just spins onscreen trying to connect.  If Vizio doesn\u2019t address this, it makes this tv kind of useless for over the air, which is one main reason I bought it to use while camping in areas where there is little to no internet but access to over the air channels.  I do like the built in Air Play and have added a Roku stick to it which seems to work.  Picture quality is just ok unless it is a good HD channel.  Sound is tinny at best when you go higher in volume.  If it wasn\u2019t for this debacle watching local channels I would be somewhat satisfied, but right now I wish I spent the extra money and bought a Samsung or other brand without this app issue.

However, to be a great tv all of those things need to function. We\u2019ve had issues since the second day we received this tv. The Vizio SmartTV platform is absolutely terrible. Certain applications (HBO Max for one) would cause the TV to freeze, volume couldn\u2019t be adjusted, and we\u2019d have to restart the tv by unplugging it. We decided, because the picture quality was so good, to opt to purchase an Amazon Firestick instead of using the Smartcast feature that comes on the TV. This seemed like a viable solution but unfortunately did not solve the issues. Because the tv defaults to Smartcast when you turn it on (despite the menu allowing you to select a different turn on input - it never saves, always reverts back to Smartcast) we still experience freezing. This happens just about every time the tv is turned off or if you try to change the input. Because we wanted to try the Firestick we missed the return window and when I spoke with Vizio\u2019s customer service\/tech support they simply couldn\u2019t help me. They went through the same \u201cresolution\u201d steps over and over and over despite me telling them I was getting the same result each time.

It also has limits on the apps you can install, meaning that I have to rely on the Chromecast to stream certain content, and the user interface is a mess - it's constantly advertising and autoplaying trailers for movies and TV shows that are on streaming platforms I don't have, but won't even let me add all of MY streaming services to the tiny ribbon of apps at the bottom of the home screen.I would probably get a Roku or something if I had it to do over again, but it's not so bad that I'm looking to get rid of it and buy something else.
