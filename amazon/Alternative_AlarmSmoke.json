{"reviewTitle":"Excellent reinvention of a mundane item","reviewDescription":"So, I've bought the first gen and second gen of this, wired and battery for both (I have 6 in my house).  The second gen is better in every way, except one that I'll get to below.So, for the positives for this are very easy to install, looks, and being able to use the app and nest integration.  Installing this is as easy as any other smoke detector and most of mine are on walls or short ceilings, so I didn't need to get on the step ladder.  You do need to set up the alarm before hanging it (unless you want to go up and take it down to set it up after).  The one area where the new isn't as good as the old - the original protect in the batter version came with a mounting bracket more like the wired of the new - many more holes to try and mount or use existing mounting holes.  This was a bit of a nuisance as once of my old alarms I thought was wired, actually wasn't, so I put one of the battery ones there and trying to use the 4 holes to align with the original anchors was futile and I just drilled 4 new ones.  The old mounting plate did not have these problems.One other install problem on this or the old protect is the fact is is a rectangle and that means you need to align it well with walls.  If it's on the wall and not the ceiling I've found this easier to do.  If it's high up and farther away from the walls in a bedroom on the ceiling, it's not as bad either.  If it's in the hallway, as I have 2 in my 2 hallways, those are low and the walls are close.  It took many adjustments and my wife giving the 'OK' to ensure it was aligned properly.  A minor issue, but I think older smoke detectors being round is a better deal - no need to align a circle.Also, I am happy to have a couple of these wired ones at the least, because knowing if the power was cut is nice.  Not only for safety, but general curiosity as I've come home and wondered if power was reset or not by some items indicating as such, but others didn't (I never knew if just the 1 item failed and reset or there was a power outage).The app and history it shows and integrating with the Nest family are great.  I have the thermostat and am awaiting on my camera to come in so I can't speak to that yet.  The history is great as it shows when it self-checked, alarms, power outage (wired only).  It also allegedly helps my nest thermostat learn when I'm home better, I'll trust it's helping.  My thermostat, in all fairness, is located in the most busy and walked by corridor in my house so unless everyone is sitting quietly in their bedrooms for a while, it wouldn't think we were away.  But, hey more sensors to be more accurate is always good.Now, the best part of this is the path light feature.  You can set low, med. high brightness when you walk by when it is dark.  It's very useful and the newer model seems to have a better sensory and is quicker to respond.  I love it and the app also shows how many times you activated the path light.  It's especially helpful in an area that I don't know if it's lit or not and has no outside windows such as my entryway.  It's ample light to not stub your toe, but you won't go blind nor wake the house with it.  I've set all mine to high brightness and nobody has complained, but you can turn it down if you want and I imagine on the battery operated ones, it would save some juice.Also, these use photoelectric sensors which detect slow burning fires better than the radioactive detectors but are slower at detecting fast burning fires (which the radioactive detectors are better for).  The thing most don't talk about with this though, is photoelectric will still detect a fast burning fire and it will detect it a lot faster than the other type will a slow burning.  So, I'll take the technology with the lower average.  Yes,  dual sensor ones exist in other brands but not ones with these features.Overall, I think Nest has done it again with a reinvented product that was pretty mundane in the home.  I'm giving it 4 stars due to regressive bracket on the newer models and the price does play into this.  $100 MSRP (although I got mine through other sellers for less) is steep and I try to keep price out of my reviews as best I can, but it can't be 100% ignored.  A basic detector is $15 or so.  My house had 4 areas ready for detectors already and I've decided to add one in each regular bedroom (why they weren't in there and only the master bedroom I'll never know).  So, I've got 6 detectors and that's a chunk of change at this price.  So, you could get cheapy ones for the price of about 1 of these, for a normal house.  If you want a CO detector too and ones that are connected (even wired interconnect ones cost more) then I see no reason to not spend a few dollars more for this very well designed product. Also, others have said you need to replace these in 10 years - so what?  It's a safety device and you're going to need to replace them regardless.  You're going to be 'wasting' the sensors and plastic and shipping and manufacturing anyway - I'm ok to add a bit for safety in this world.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1459728000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Installing 8 Nest Protect 2 - Wired version ... in about 90 minutes.","reviewDescription":"I have been eyeing the Nest Protect now since it came out about 2 years ago.  Like most I simply hate my smoke detectors.  Random low-battery chirping, ear piercing function test... getting up on a ladder at least twice a year to change batteries wether they need it or not... you get the idea.  My smoke detectors were approaching the 10 year threshold which is the \"end of life\" for a smoke detector and I knew I would need to be replacing all of them.Fortunately I held off on buying the 1st generation Nest Protect... I've learned to be cautious about these things.  After seeing some of the negative reviews around random alarm problems I intentionally delayed purchase until a 2nd generation product was available.With the new Protect 2 out and getting almost universally positive reviews, I went ahead and took the plunge following a 4 year old First Alert CO combination unit dying with 3 chirps every minute at 3:00AM.  Good times.My house, like many newer homes, has an insane number of detectors.  At the time the home was built there was a requirement for at least one detector on each level of the home, one detector OUTSIDE in the hallway of any bedrooms as well as a detector in every bedroom.  For my house that is eight detectors (4 upstairs bedrooms, 2 in upstairs hallway, 1 on main level, 1 in basement).  A few years ago it also became code that all of these need to be CO detectors.Cost on the Nest is slightly crazy.  I rationalized it with them being rated for 10 years (vs 7 years for the competition) as well as the extra \"smart\" features being worth the extra cost.  In particular the lack of things like low battery chirps, random chirps for errors, etc, was worth an almost 100% premium for me over getting more cheap detectors.  Another big advantage we perceived with the Protect was getting an alert if we are out of town or away from our home.  I'm also cautiously optimistic more features could be added later to the existing hardware... as Nest already has a track record of doing this with other products (Nest Thermostat added air wave which is a fantastic feature).Quality of these units is impressive.  It's hard to believe the box contains a smoke detector when you pick it up as it is so heavy.  The unit itself has a very nicely finished case, beautiful lighting and a great big button that can be used for self-tests as well as silencing nuisance alarms (you can also silence alarms from your phone).  There is also a nice very solid mounting plate with mounting holes for probably every international junction box imaginable as well as some sheetrock screws if you are installing it in bare sheetrock and a few extra wire-nuts if you need those.The units come with batteries pre-installed... and my understanding is those batteries are good for at least a year or two at which time Nest will warn you that you need to replace them... and it won't do it at 4 in the morning!Do NOT remove the battery activation tab until you are ready to program the Nest Protects!  The Protects get programmed BEFORE you install them on the ceiling.  This is probably a common source of confusion for home owners since there are numerous little warning tabs\/paper trying to warn you against physically installing it before activating it!Here's how I installed my 8 units in a relatively short amount of time (90 minutes total) with some tips that might help you out.Step 1. Take the wrapping off ALL of your Protects boxes.  Label each box with a pen for what room\/location it is going in.  Stack them all up on your left.  Sit in a nice clean area (a large table works well).  Your not-yet-programmed Protects are on your left, your workspace and mobile device is in the middle and your already programmed protects are on your right... make sure you know your wifi network name & password as well as your mobile having a good solid charge (you're going to be at this for a while).Step 2.  Fire up the Nest app, create an account if needed (I already had one for my thermostat).Step 3.  Choose \"add product\" and then choose add Protect.Step 4.  Using the mobile app (you need to have a smart phone made in the last 3-4 years or use a PC and type codes in) you scan the QR code on the back of the protect.  Don't pull the tab to turn on the protect until instructed!  After scanning the QR code, turning on the protect, setting language to English, the app will walk you through the next steps including putting in wi-fi password, setting a location for the device, etc.  This all takes at least a couple of minutes, if it sits there for 90 seconds don't give up, it's still working and everything should be fine.  The app will want to do a self test of this 1st Protect... this is LOUD so you might want to walk it outside while it is counting down from 10 to start the self test.  The app will tell you when setup is done and the Nest Protect will flash to let you know it's programmed.  If it is the wired version it will also alert you that it is on battery.Step 5.  Keep this 1st Protect out of the box, it will be used to speed up install of the rest of your units.Step 6.  If adding additional Protect devices it is important to choose \"add another Protect\" as this will save you valuable time.Step 7.  You will be instructed to scan the QR code of the next Protect and then push the button on the 1st protect to wake it up.  Don't pull the tab to turn on the 2nd protect until the app is connected or connecting to the 1st device... you can cheat a bit and pull the tab and choose English language about 30 seconds before the app says to do this and install will go fine... if doing many Protects this saves a bit of time.  The Protects don't need Wi-fi to communicate with each other which is why this works... they will use their own wireless to talk to each other and the 1st one you set up can give settings and account info to the other ones.Step 8.  Put this 2nd Protect back in its labeled box, move it to the right and go on to your next device.  Keep repeating Step 6-7 for each additional Protect you have until all of them are programmed.  Once done with all programming move on to physical activation by choosing not to add any more Protects from the app.Important!!  Keep the plastic dust cover on your Protects until just before you physically connect it!  This will prevent dust\/debris from the ceiling from getting into the detector and possibly causing some kind of problem while you are in the process of mucking around at the ceiling doing the wiring.Step 9.  Turn off AC breaker to your wired detectors (if your house is newer they are probably all on a single circuit breaker)... remove the old protector and mounting plate and disconnect its wiring harness.  Cap the red\/signal wire, the Protect doesn't need it.  Connect the white\/black lead to the Nest wiring harness.  Install the new mounting plate.... this is a bit tricky because there are no labels on the plate and its not clear which holes line up with US electrical boxes (pro tip, it's the second most mounting holes from the outside of the plate... use opposing corners of mounting holes for a proper fit).  Push all wiring other than the new connector back into the box.Step 10.  Connect the newly installed connector to the Nest for that location.  Tap the button one time to verify that the detector you are installing is the correct one for that location (you labeled your boxes right?)Step 11.  Line up the plastic ring on the mounting plate with the round detent on the Protect.  Push slightly as you rotate it and it will lock into place... you are only allowed about 90 degrees to turn the Nest so you might not be able to get the Nest \"label\" on the button of the protector oriented exactly as you like... it would be nice if Nest let this part rotate freely so that OCD types (me) could get it aligned as they'd like with less effort.Step 12.  Repeat above for all detectors and once ALL of them are installed turn your breaker back on.Step 13.  Go get a beer.  It will take a full minute or two for the Protect 2s to recognize power is connected.... you will notice that a tiny green light comes on when it has AC power for a solid minute or two.Step 14.  Tap the test button on any one of the Protects and tap it again to initiate a self-test.  This is the cool part as all detectors will now test in sequence without you having to run around with a broom testing each one of them individually.Step 15.  You should also now see that the Protects are showing up green on your mobile app.That's my detailed write-up of installation.  If it seems too hard (it's not, assuming you can turn a screwdriver, stand on a ladder and understand electrical basics) you can hire a pro... Nest provides info on how to get in touch with one on a flyer in the box.So why 4 stars?  A couple of minor things.  First off these detectors cost over double what other decent detectors cost.  Personally I think a more reasonable price for these would be $79.  Certainly Nest should offer a smoke only detector at a slightly lower cost for locations that can't\/don't require CO detectors.  There are other minor things I think could be improved.... the square design is a pain in the neck to get aligned properly so that it doesn't look crooked on a ceiling... while this won't bother everyone it will annoy enough of us that we will keep mentioning it.Currently Nest does not offer the ability to customize the Protect settings on individual devices.  Want the audio test sounds in all rooms other than the room the baby sleeps in?  Too bad.  Want some way of individualizing Bedroom #1 and Bedroom #2 in the software so you know which one has a problem?  Tough.  Nest should step up here as they surely know that many homes are going to need a pile of these things and they aren't exactly cheap.My final reason at this time for knocking a star is that a lot of Nest Protect gen 1 owners are left in a lurch... Nest is not offering them discounted Protect 2s and the Protect 1 is prone to false alarms and failures.  While I was confident enough in the design of the Protect 2 to spend a whopping $794 on eight of them Nest has left a bad taste in many peoples mouths by not addressing 1st gen problems.  If similar problems were to occur several years down the road with the Protect 2 I similarly don't expect much from Nest in the way of a real resolution... even though Nest has been acquired by Google they are the new kid on the block.... they should be really stepping up for their customers instead of responding to negative comments about Protect 1 with \"contact customer support\".All in all I think that this is a great product that is pricey for what it is.  Definitely though it has numerous advantages over traditional smoke\/CO detectors and if you think those advantages outweigh the added cost I can certainly recommend it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2,173 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1440633600000}

Particularly of the seller \"alwayz-on-sale\", although I've read that this is an issue with these across many sellers. The manufactured date on the smoke alarm we received is listed as December 10, 2017, meaning this device is almost 7 years old. Seeing as it's a smart smoke detector, the manual clearly states that it will expire and cease working 10 years after its manufacture date...meaning December 2027, just three years and a few months after I bought it. Truly ridiculous. Checking with Google, they claim its warranty is *already expired*, so I doubt it is brand new even though it was sold as such. The shrinkwrap on the box did seem to be re-done and there was extra tape on the box. Unacceptable. I will be returning it.

{"reviewTitle":"Intuitive and advanced but could present some technical challenges","reviewDescription":"As noted by others my detector was much older than I would have preferred.  This simply means the Protect has lost some of its useful life already.  The documentation states up to 10 years of life but you would need to be standing\/waiting at the end of the production line to achieve that.However the Nest Protect is not entirely alone in that regard.  Many others are also \"aged\" by the time of purchase.  One big difference is that the Google Nest Protect will cease to operate, stop functioning at the 10 year mark from the manufacture date.So depending on your luck or detective work you may not get the full 10 years.  If you order online then it's a gamble on how old it will be.  Even large online retailers, including Google, can have older inventory.  If you can find one that you physically can get your hands on then you can always Google how to interpret the date code on the outside of the box.  This may gain you a few months, maybe even several months of 'newerness'.Given the age uncertainty you are still getting many years of exceptional operation with advanced features.  I have yet to have a false alarm after several years.  Yes the batteries are likely to need replaced but that is usually all that needs to be done outside of some minor TLC etc...  I appreciate several of the features from the Protect's routine self checks to the path light.  The device's interconnection communication and mobile notifications are critical in my opinion.  We may still be missing Google Home integration but the Nest app works to get the job done for now.  And  from what I have been able to deduce is that the information circulating about Nest Secure going away and causing Protects to stop working in April will have no impact on the Nest app Nest Protect operation.As with many advanced internet and intra connected smart devices there will always be tech challenges that can come up.  These Nest Protects can span the gamut from minor tech annoyances to hair pulling throw it in the trash challenges.  It does not mean it will happen to everyone but some unique circumstances can be frustrating.  Tip-if during any app connection\/installation processes something will just not work try an alternative approach by using an iOS device if an Android device fails or vice versa.  Not everyone can do that of course but worth a try if you can.Although a more expensive initial investment these Protects do offer a step up level of performance.  No one can ever go wrong installing detection regardless of cost.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709510400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great device with ONE PROBLEM","reviewDescription":"These smoke \/ CO detectors cost a lot more than others.  For example, current Amazon prices show one device costing $99 and a 6-pack from a competitor costing $170; or a 6 pack of smoke detectors (no CO function) costing $50.  So these are a premium choice.Are they worth it?  I think \"Yes\", given what they do.  They set up a private \/ secret network in your home to interconnect.  They have an automated daily test to ensure they're OK, with results from the last 10 days available to view on your Nest app any time you want to see it. They have bigger (more complete) test every month to make sure the sensors are working.  Compared to the \"set & forget\" smoke detectors that you only know about when there *is* smoke -- and hope they operate properly so they can save your life -- these Nest devices provide significant peace of mind.  They seem to be well made, ie the quality of manufacture seems to be good.  Overall I'm happy and think it's a case of getting what you pay for.However, I've seen one downside.  They're made with a 10 year lifespan.  That's not a Nest thing, it seems to be an overall industry thing.  A quick search tells me that 10 years is a standard lifespan and some devices only have 5 years.  The manufacture and End Of Life (EOL) dates are printed on the label.  THAT'S not my issue.  My issue is that their price makes them not a very popular item which affects the EOL date.  I bought 4 of these in 2023 and the EOL date for each of them is 2026, 2028, 2029 & 2032.  2026 -- really??  That means one was made in 2016 and sitting in a warehouse for 7 years before it was sold and its shelf life expires in just 3 years.  All of them except the 2032 are outrageous, but the 2026 one is really poor.  I assume they made lots of these expecting high demand, but due to the high price they haven't sold like hotcakes.  Now I'm paying the price for that.  Would this cut it in the smartphone world?  Would a phone manufactured in 2016 be an acceptable product to sell in 2023?  I should point out that all the items I bought were sold as \"New\" not \"Refurbished\" so this is a big disappointment.The products weren't activated until the battery protection was removed in 2023, so maybe they'll last for 10 years from that date but if the devices report they can't work in 2026, 2028 & maybe 2029 I'll end up disappointed because the replacement cost is quite high.I'd happily give this a 5 star review.  The possible EOL issue brings it down to 4 stars and if I have to replace one in just 3 years time I guess I'd drop it to a 1 or 2 star review.  It's a shame that such an excellent product is affected by poor demand (but that's probably due to the relatively high price).  My other fear is Google is known to end support for products &\/or withdraw them from the market without warning.  If that happened then I expect the devices will still operate to protect the lives of me and my family but a quick software update would rapidly remove the app-driven reporting functions, which would be disappointing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"168 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684108800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Pain to setup","reviewDescription":"I'm very tech savvy. Been using varies google product for some time. Always simple to setup. Nest Thermistat was very simple as well. I bought a total of 8 of these Nest Protects. The 1st one was okay. Had to scan the code a couple times. The rest would scan QR code and then try to use another unit to assist with setup but fail andthen attempt to setup the new unit direct only it failed multiple times and start over by having me scan the QR again. One of them took roughly 12 attempts and each time its a 5 minute process. I was nearly pulling my hair out of my head but finally it took. Then that same unit when I turned the fuse on had a green light but the app would not update and said power was disconnected on it even after 24 hours and pressing the button.The mount for these are very weak. I broke like 4 of them just trying to tighten the screw. I had the drill set to 1lb which is lowest it goes to try to be safe and on slow. I really tried to go slow. The plastic is roughly 2mm thick.Also they were shipped in a white bag. 8 units each $110 and they tossed it into a white plastic bag. Driver just tossed it onto my front steps. Bag was beat.They shipped me 3 battery units even though my order was for 8 wired units. Had to return those and order 3 wired. And on return.. Since they didnt give me a box.. I needed to buy my own box so I could properly package them for return trip.All 8 units are now up but still disappointing. They seem to want to save power by not staying connected to the network. They connect to my WiFi I guess once every 24 hours unles you wake them up by pressing the button. I was expecting more as these are wired there is power concern. Was expecting maybe some interesting sensor reading like the Nest Thermistat. Maybe read the detected carbon levels, wired voltage, battery voltage, signal strengths on wireless, Wireless strength between units on their propertary weave wireless they use to communicate with one another without wifi and whatever else these engineers can dream up withing the scope of being a smart fire alarm.There were some other annoyances. Like it has a short list of room names. Lot of those will have you pick another room name to say because its inability to say a lot of the pre-listed or any custom room name.The night light to light up the path when it detects someone walking under is very dim and not something you can set brightness on. You can only either turn it off, have it on always, or have it automatically turn on when it senses someone. And it only works when the room is pitch black. Its also not consistent. Sometimes its senses you approaching just a couple feet away and others I'll be waving my hands directly under it with no luck.I've installed these things and dont want to return them as that would mean dismounting and unwiring all my work just to do it over with a different brand.I'd say if you're planning upgrading all your firealarms, might want to think twice on this one. If you really want to try it anyway, just get a couple and try them out.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710547200000}
{"reviewTitle":"DO NOT BUY ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE HIGH CEILINGS","reviewDescription":"First I would like to say that I purchased them because I have 15 ft ceilings and I could  hush alarms and test with the app . Due to the height I was required to hire a handyman for installation. Afterwards I had changed my internet and had to reset the devices only to find out I needed the QR code on the back of the device!!! This required me to again pay a handyman to come and reset the devices. I then took a photo of the QR codes and printed them out for the future. Why on earth would a tech company like Google not include the QR code along with WARNINGS for future use on the invoice!! Or at the very least a huge warning on the box stating recording of the QR code is absolutely essential prior to installationSecondly I have had one of the devices which is only 7 months old malfunction with false alarms several times. Despite Google support the device has continued to have many false alarms.I attempted resetting with a very long telescopic pole to reach the button and used the printed QR code. The device did reset but kept sounding the alarm on and off.I was told the only way to stop the continued alarms was to remove the device of which I could not do! I was sent a new device and had no option other than to wait until I could get a handyman here with a very tall ladder.I scheduled the handyman to come as soon as possible.  Fortunately the alarms subsided and only went off once in a while.  However last night the device sounded every few minutes for hours!! Again as I cannot reach the device I was going insane and my ears were hurting badly! Thank goodness it stopped about 4:00 AM as I was ready to go to a hotel at any cost.The handyman is trying to get here today and I will be paying him for the 3rd time!!!!!!!!!!!!Looking in the help section and other chats it is obvious MANY of these devices are faulty. Therfore I asked support if I could return the replacement for a battery only device(not hardwire) which would allow me to place the device lower than where my hardwire connection is. I was denied this request and told the warranty only allows for replacement with the same device.Google should be embarrassed to have made such an inferior product and obviously put absolutely no thought into support or how it needs to work for all its consumers. At the very least there should be a way to shut down the unit until a remedy can be had!! Shame on Google.And lastly I was given wrong info by support. One person insisted I turn the fuse off from the power box. When I told him that would only cause the back up batteries to kick in he kept insisting there are no backup batteries. I was given a contact phone number for installers and when I called they do not do smoke detectors!  And EVERY support person kept calling the smoke detector a thermostat.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719964800000}
{"reviewTitle":"BEWARE - 6 Year Aged Inventory Expiry - Poor Service Life","reviewDescription":"I'm afraid to say this is the first negative review I have ever written on Amazon. Despite how much I genuinely enjoy the service and quality of Google Nest Protect devices - they are worth the price. Only if you receive them with reasonable expiry service life from the date they are manufactured.I purchased 2 battery Google Nest Protect detectors, only to find that the manufactured date is from 2018 (it is 2024 now). This means this has been sitting in inventory for 6 years, with only 4 years remaining for the manufacturer's service life.I decided to return for replacements assuming that I would receive new Google Nest Protect detectors. I was wrong in my assumption. I received the replacement detectors today and they, too, are from 2018 manufactured date.Why would I accept a device that has 6 years expired, with only 4 years remaining for service life? I am paying a premium for a nice device, but want 10 full years of service, not 4.I went with Google Nest Protect devices after a lengthy research process to ensure I am buying a quality home safety and protection device. I am honestly very let down by this situation. Having given a fair chance for a return to resolve the problem, only to have it occur again leaves a sour taste in the brand and product.I am afraid that this is a sign they have excess inventory that is aging and they are desperately trying to offload the devices that are reaching their expiration date. I feel this is a very shady situation considering these are devices that are used to protect valuable lives and homes. I honestly am afraid a large majority of customers might not check the manufactured date and expiry date - it's very small on the back of the device. I can only imagine how many have been installed with only a few years remaining when you think you are protected for 10 years.I hope Google steps in to resolve this ongoing issue. I genuinely like all of their services and products. I just want others to double-check their purchases and make sure they receive what they are paying for.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719878400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Do NOT buy since Google bought Nest - Unless you are an all in Google person","reviewDescription":"This is the 3rd house I've bought and placed the Nest Protect Smoke & Carbon detectors in.  One of the three detectors started going off at 4:00 AM, saying there was smoke in the kitchen, but there was none. I couldn't shut off the alarm and needed to get a ladder, disconnect the detector, and pull out the batteries just to shut it off.I called for support, and that now goes to Google. I was told that we had to migrate from the legacy Nest system to the new Google system before they could support the failing detector. Okay. I was stepped through the process, and I made sure I could continue using my personal email, and it was validated that I could...that was until it converted my account to a Google account, at which point and time I was forced to use a Google Gmail account. No options.I was upset because she just lied to me, and now I could not log into the Nest account with my personal email address, and I could only use a Gmail account filled with Spam and junk emails that I never check. When I requested a supervisor, she did not want to get one and argued with me until I hit the roof.I was told a supervisor would call me back in 24 - 48 hours, and they never did. I called back one week later only to get the same response and refused to escalate the call. When the supervisor returned my call barely 48 hours later, he verified that they would only allow a Google Gmail account on the Google platform. They could not transfer me back to the Nest platform, and I could not even create a new account on the Nest platform. The only thing to do is to use a Google Gmail account. To make matters worse, when he did say it was a known problem and a return would need to happen, they would only process a return if I opened a Google Wallet Account and reserved a Google Wallet account and reserved through the cost of the smoke detector. They won't send me the replacement even though they validated that the smoke detector was bought. On Amazon, unless I open a Google Wallet and secure the replacement transaction within it. I don't have a problem securing the new device sent to me with a credit card until they receive the broken one, but I do have a problem with Google forcing me to open a Google Wallet account to do this.Not all people are dedicated Google people, and not all want everything going through Google. I loved the Nest Protect, but not in the hands of Google. If you are not a dedicated Google person willing to jump through all the Google hoops, think twice before buying the Google Nest Protect. Kidde and Treatlife have better products doing the exact same for less money, and you don't have to jump through and swear your firstborn to them; they have decent smart smoke and carbon detectors.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698278400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Avoid","reviewDescription":"I don\u2019t normally write reviews, but this product bothered me so much that I felt it necessary. Here\u2019s everything that\u2019s super annoying about this product:1. They expire and then you have to throw them away! I only bought this particular nest because the one I bought a few years ago started endlessly chirping. That was excruciatingly annoying. More annoying is that I learned it does that when it\u2019s time to be disposed of so you can buy a new Nest thermostat to replace it.2. When I went to add the new Nest to my account, it made me migrate to the new version of Google Neat accounts, which disconnected my Nest thermostat skill, which is something I use all the time.3. Since I wanted to avoid #2 above, I installed my nest in the wall without connecting it to my account. Unfortunately, this means you can\u2019t turn off the path light feature that is activated by default. This means my bedroom lights up every time I move the tiniest bit at night.4. Due to #3 above, I decided to go ahead and do the account migration. During this phase, the app insisted it use one of my older nests that didn\u2019t die yet to assist with the setup. Only problem is that those older nests don\u2019t actually have this feature, so I had absolutely no way to actually add the new nest.5. I was able to solve #4 above by removing all my old nest devices from my account. So now I have to disconnect three other nests in my house to get to their QR codes to add them again. They are high up, so of course now I need to get out a ladder.6. The new generation nest thermostat uses a different connector than the old one. This means that I need to go to my power breakers to turn of the electricity to my thermostat circuit to unwire the old connector and wire the new connector. Luckily, I\u2019m comfortable enough with electricity to do this, but most people would have to hire an electrician or handyman.7. The mechanism to connect the nest thermostat to the wall bracket it comes with is very poorly designed. It is hard to fit the little teeth on the nest into the slots in the bracket. It is totally unclear how many turns are needed or in which direction you can turn. So if you don\u2019t want your thermostat at an angle, or you don\u2019t want the label with all the fine print aimed at you, you might have to remove and retry adding the wall bracket a few times.Since I value the usability of products, I am greatly bothered by all these things. How can one of the largest companies in the world make a product with so many fails? They just do.I suggest buying a cheaper thermostat without all these hassles. At the end of the day, there is no reason to have this device because it doesn\u2019t do anything interesting considering it\u2019s connected to WiFi, etc. There are so many features it could have, like being a speaker, for instance, that it lacks.Again, look elsewhere so you don\u2019t find yourself having to come on here after all these annoyances and:8.

This appears to be from the same large manufacturing batch as a Protect I ordered for my then new winter condo two years ago.  This must be why they were 20% off \u2014 2 years off of the promised ten, but this should have been noted in the product description, otherwise a class-action lawsuit is possible, which manufacturers and retailers should avoid.The dozen or more Nest Protects I had previously purchased were quite easy to install.  These recent batch of 3, to replace old style knob detectors expired past their 10 year life, could not be added to my Nest Account by scanning the QR code on my up-to-date iPhone.  Not a major problem, as after each timed out I could enter the code on the back.  With two of these I could join the network from a Nest Protect that was temporarily moved adjacent \u2014 but one Protect could not synch with my original one and I had connect via the temporary wifi network.Another issue \u2026 when I selected from the Nest installation menu \u201cGuest Room\u201d for the name of the Protect to be installed there, I had an error message that \u201cCustom Names\u201d could not be announced and to either pick another name from the menu (Guest Room was still an option) else pick the no announcement option.I then picked Bedroom \u2014 but when the installation was finished, I was informed that \u201cGuest Room\u201d was now added.  Aaargh!I assume the issue is that there has been an update at the Nest server which hasn\u2019t caught up with these two year old \u201cnew\u201d Protects (yet my even older guest room Nests in Maine are called \u201cGuest Room).Regardless of the issue causing this, I almost returned these, and the Protect team should be aware of these issues when older \u201cjust sold\u201d devices are activated.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710115200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Be warned: pairing with your WiFi network can be a nightmare","reviewDescription":"Be warned: Nest Protect setup is NOT easy, and may never work.I have spent hours trying to pair my new Nest Protect 2nd Generation Smoke Detector. It still fails to pair with my home WiFi network every time. My network uses an ASUS RT-AC68U router and I am trying to connect over the 2.4 MHz band. The router's firmware is up-to-date, it is connected to the Internet, other devices are working normally, and no MAC filtering is used on the router. I am trying to pair the detector using the latest Nest app on my iPhone. I've lost count of the number of times I've tried to pair the Protect. I've killed the Nest app and restarted it several times. I've completely reset the Protect several times by holding the button down for 10-15 seconds. I've even rebooted my router. And I have been standing next to the router during this, so there is no issue with distance between the phone, router, or Protect. I tried calling Nest Support. The friendly support person said he was told during training that Protects often have a problem pairing, and to encourage customers to keep trying until it works. He was also told that the other Nest devices do not have a pairing problem. So, this is a known issue with the Protect. I will try again with another Protect (I bought four) and will call support again is pairing is unsuccessful again. I'll update this review if my experience improves.I am surprised by this trouble. My Nest thermostat had no problems whatever in pairing.UPDATE (3\/16\/2006): I am returning the four Nest Protects to Amazon. It's a shame, but spending any more time trying to get them set up would be pointless.After more attempts on my own, I called Nest support again and spent about 90 minutes talking with a second-level support person (Nest Senior Support). We tried experiments like changing my 2.4GHz network to 802.11n only (it was b\/g\/n\/ac) and the encryption to WPA2 instead of WEP-Personal, but that didn't help. (More Nest advice appears at [...]) He eventually got additional help from a third-level person, a Nest development engineer. It turns out that the Protect needs ipv6 running on the local home WiFi network. (Why is that? I don't have more than 2^32 devices in my local network.) My router supports ipv6, although it needs the ISP to support it too. COMCAST is working on that, but it's not supported in my area yet. Furthermore, setting up ipv6 is really complex: for example, you need to set the IPv6 Prefix Length and the Tunnel MTU. Google'ing \"router ipv6 setup\" will give you a taste of the complexity involved. When I suggested that requiring ipv6 sounded like a bug, the Nest support person told me they are \"working on it\".I'm leaving my rating for the product as one star. It really is a shame, because these smoke\/CO2 detectors have some useful features when they work. My router is a popular one because of its range (CNet gave it their highest recommendation a year ago) and my wireless setup is not complicated, so I'm really surprised that more people don't have these problems. I look forward to future Nest Protect updates that fix these networking issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1457827200000}

After I finished washing a load of pants, I took them outside the laundry room and shook them to get them untangled from the spin cycle, immediately thereafter, the Nest Protect alarm went off full blast, \"Emergency, there is smoke in the hallway.\"  Some foreign object, such as a piece of dust, or water droplet may have gotten into the detector.  I would have been better served by a \"Heads up, there is smoke in the hallway.\"  I hope that such false alarms will be exceptionally few and far between.After clearing the alarm, I checked the settings on my phone to confirm that the \"Heads up\" option was in fact turned on for all five smoke alarms online, which it was.

{"reviewTitle":"A Good Safety Investment but Difficult to Get Excited About","reviewDescription":"From a safety perspective, the Nest Protect is a solid investment for anyone looking to replace an old smoke detector or add a carbon monoxide detector. It is comforting to know that there is at least one detector in the house that is routinely testing itself and capable of detecting both slow and fast moving fires along with CO gas. If you really think about it, how much do you know about the capabilities and accuracy of smoke alarms that may have been sitting in your house for a decade or more?So if you have not replaced a smoke detector in years or ever, you will probably want to spend the extra money to make sure you have at least one really good detector and the Nest Protect would be a good choice. It installs easy, monitors itself and was designed to last for a decade. There is only one major drawback: Nest decided to not provide an interface for the interconnection wire that typically connects wired smoke detectors and allows one alarm to trigger all the others. This seems to be a big oversight as most homeowners will probably only replace one or two detectors at a time and it would be great if the Nest Protects could communicate with the older alarms.I'm sure Nest would prefer that we replace all our old smoke detectors with Nest Protects, but that could be close to a thousand dollars or more for houses built to modern building codes. And that is where the Nest Protect fails to excite enough to justify that large of an expense. Yes, the Path Light that automatically shines below the Protect in a dark room is a convenient feature, but too bad it turns on for pets as well as people. Similarly, using the Nest Protect to improve the accuracy of a Nest Thermostat's Auto Away feature is also foiled by pets. Most responsible pet owners would set Auto Away's minimum temperature so that their animals are comfortable, let alone safe. Thus, preventing Auto Away from turning on when a Protect senses that pets are home seems to be a poor design choice. Basically pet owners are forced to decide whether to disable a feature of the Nest Protect (improved Auto Away) or disable a feature of Nest Thermostat (Auto Away alltogether) instead of enjoying both.In fact the relatively minor integration with the Nest Thermostat is what disappoints me the most about the Protect and is the main reason why I will not be rushing out to buy more until I absolutely need to. It is great that the Nest Protect can turn off the HVAC system in an emergency, but what about the other 99% of the time when it is still monitoring the air but no smoke or CO is present? Why isn't the Nest Protect sending temperature data back to the thermostat so that the entire house can be comfortable instead of just the area around the thermostat? Why can't the Nest Protect's occupancy sensors be used to control lighting or improve the efficiency of the HVAC system or track intruders with the NestCam? Since indoor air quality can be a big problem - especially during the winter when windows are not opened - why doesn't the Protect have an air quality sensor?It is the abscence of features that transform the Nest Protect from just a really good smoke\/CO alarm to an integral building block of a \"smart\" home that prevents me from wanting to install more of them or give the product five stars.  Of course, safety is the number one purpose of this product and aside from air quality, it provides great piece of mind. However, for the price, it could do a bit more to improve our daily lives while still protecting against the occasional emergency.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1452384000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not your average smoke detector","reviewDescription":"This is not your average smoke detector, it's ability to integrate with other nest devices adds to its usefulness, but there are also some things that it will do above and beyond. The Nest protect is constantly checking itself, allowing for a install and forget mentality that you could not do with older, not-smart smoke detectors.The install process for the Nest is not too difficult, with step-by-step directions provided online, in the box, and even when you run through the add process on the app. Install takes about 15-20 minutes as long as you are replacing an already wired Nest. I haven't tried the battery operated one yet, but would imagine that would be about 2-3 minutes to hook it up to the app. Everything you need is in the box, minus the ladder (or chair) to reach the installation location.The device itself is sensitive, but not overly sensitive that you get false positives. It's early detection capabilities pick up more than a standard smoke alarm. The voice announcement is very useful too, especially if you have these installed in multiple rooms. You can also silence the alarm, either on the device, or through the app.There are some features above and beyond the old school smoke detectors too. You can configure the device to show a green ring when all the lights go out, showing that everything is ok, giving you piece of mind before bed. You can also configure the device to emit a path light when it detects motion, this is great for when you need to get up in the night and don't want to be blinded by the light. The path light strength is also configurable in the app.This brings me to the app itself, the app is the controller for everything with the nest protect, and you can tell a lot of thought and design went into the app. It is easy to use, well laid out, and gives you near instant alerts. The power of the app though it that it can control all nest devices from anywhere. Fortunately I haven't had the smoke alarm go off when I am not home, but based on the 'Sound Check complete' notification I get monthly, it would also notify me if there was a fire at home. Also, as the app ties in with the other Nest products, you can have the heating or AC system automatically shut off, when paired with a Nest Thermostat. This would slow down any fire, potentially saving lives. Nice feature, unless you accidentally set off the alarm and it is hot\/cold outside (a trade off I am willing to make!). I don't have the nest cam, but there are integration points there that I plan to install in the near future. If Nest is not only devices you want to integrate, there is also the IFTTT network support that allows for much more compatibility, for example, you could have all the lights flash red if there was smoke detected (if you have the colour lights installed).The square design isn't too bad, you can turn it around to look good against the walls, but it would be nice to have a round option too.Overall I am happy with the product, I want to replace all the smoke detectors in the house eventually, but it comes at a significant cost. A price point closer to $80 would make this device a 5 star product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1473638400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nice aesthetics and monitoring options, but limited verbal room names","reviewDescription":"I purchased six of these to replace expired non-interconnected battery units from another manufacturer.  While I was not necessarily looking for Wi-Fi enabled units with web portal and mobile app support, the criteria I did have narrowed my options down a lot. The criteria were: Battery powered, CO and Smoke detection, and wireless interconnection (wireless multi-station, not to be confused with Wi-Fi). Of this limited group I decided to spend the considerable extra money for the latest Nest Protect in order to also get less disruptive yet more specific low battery notifications. It also helped that the aesthetics of the Nest were better, blending into the interior the way all such devices should. I definitely had and still have reservations about spending so much money for something that will need to be replaced in 10 years, but hopefully when that times comes there will be a less expensive yet fully suitable option.Setup was relatively easy, although dependent on the mobile app. I do wish there was a method for making the interconnection links without a smartphone or even the web portal (also currently not an option). However, my biggest complaint is that the list of verbal room names is very limited. Sure you can assign \u201ccustom\u201d names, but as the app makes clear, the custom names are only used for display purposes in the app and web portal. When the units verbally announce the location of an alert or notification they can only do so from the limited predefined list from which you must select even with a custom name set. Technically speaking I understand that the units don\u2019t have full voice synthetization capability, but there should be more prerecorded names and maybe even the option of appending a prerecorded number, say 1-6, to the name. This would really help distinguish multiple rooms of the same type. While one might say this is a minor thing when it comes to notifications for a low battery, etc. as you can simply login to the web portal or mobile app to see the text label of the offending unit, this could be a safety issue for actual smoke and CO alerts.The web portal and mobile app allow you to review the status of the units, including the details of each function\u2019s last automatic or manual check, along with an event log. The monthly report email, which can be turned on or off as desired, is a nice touch for those that would like a little extra assurance and\/or can\u2019t be bothered to login to the web portal or mobile app regularly. Of course if there are any issues, such as a low battery, failed sensor, or failed horn, the units are supposed to physically indicate this via the LED ring and voice announcement. The User\u2019s Guide has a good breakdown of all the LED and voice indications for people that are curious how the units should respond.I really don\u2019t have much else to say as once these things are up and running there isn\u2019t much to do but sit back and hope they do their job in an actual emergency. I am hoping that the \u201cSplit Spectrum\u201d photo sensor does what is advertised in terms of detecting both slow smoldering fires and fast burning fires, but I also hope I never actually need to find out.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1446336000000}

I didn't have time to troubleshoot further, so I stuck it in the garage until I could deal with it today.Wound up figuring out how to do a factory reset (hold button for 10 seconds). I erased all settings and then was able to set it back up on the app with zero issues. Guess the sensors are good after all (let's hope lol)The only reason I give it 4 vs 5 stars is because of the price point this thing carries and the lack of warranty support (2 yrs I believe for a 10 yr product). But I'm 5 yrs in with minimal hassle, so that's saying something at least.I went ahead and bought a 2nd one today to replace the 1985 detector downstairs that constantly complains about my cooking lol. At least I can just his the button to shut this one up haha.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693958400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Overall good with a few quirks","reviewDescription":"For years, I was positive I was hearing our old USI smoke detectors chirping at odd times.  I noticed I was waking up in the middle of the night around the same time.  I wondered for a long time if the old smoke detectors were for some reason chirping, but just once, making it impossible to tell which one was doing it.  Due to a fatal design flaw, the battery door sometimes wouldn't go back in, so just replacing all the batteries was impractical.Anyway, I finally had it, and decided that I was going to spend the money on hardware which would hopefully tell me if something was wrong, and where the problem was, and I decided on Nest.Things I like:- The installation process is fairly simple.  I have 8 hardwired units.  I'd say it took me a couple hours all together (I did them on three different days).  I have enough knowledge to turn off the correct breaker and use wire nuts, but that's about the extent of it.- The friendly green \"I'm OK\" indication is nice.  The configurable motion sensor night-light feature is nice.  It would be annoying in a bedroom, but it's nice if you're roaming a dark hallway at night.Things I don't like:- One unit was defective.  I tried the setup multiple times and kept getting a connection error.  I tried the factory reset, which didn't help.  Nest support was very friendly and determined the unit was bad.  On a good note, after they determined it was bad, they suggested requesting a replacement from Amazon.  I did so on a Sunday morning.  The replacement was at my house the next day.- It seems that once you configure one, you can't change anything (device name, wi-fi SSID or password) without factory resetting it and re-doing the setup (which involves taking it off the ceiling so you can scan the QR code).  That's annoying.  Since it has Bluetooth capability for setup, it's unclear to me why you can't use the app to reconfigure the device.- The original 8 units I received all had a manufacturing date in June, 2016.  I installed them in March, 2017.  I lost 9 months of use on a product with an \"up to\" 10 year lifetime.  The replacement for the defective one was built in January 2017, so I guess this just depends on how lucky you are when you buy the units.- The included hardware make some incorrect assumptions.  The builders who built my house for some reason decided to put the ceiling boxes in at wildly varying depths, so the screws didn't work in all cases.  Fortunately, I was able to just use the screws from the old units.  Same thing attaching the power connector.  Sometimes, there were two wires to tie together.  Sometimes, there were 4.  4 wires of the gauge used in household wiring won't fit in the Nest wire nuts.  Once again, at least I was able to re-use the ones from the original installation.Overall, I'm happy.  The one bad unit got replaced quickly thanks to Amazon.  I haven't woken up in days now wondering if the smoke detectors are trying to make me insane.  Hopefully these continue to behave for somewhere near their expected lifetime.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1491436800000}

It still is a great night light.but after working out the technical problems everything seems to be working very well. I like the fact that I can see what's what when away from home. So far no false alarms which is a great improvement over the last smoke alarm we had. And because we got the battery version power outages do not effect the devise. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00XV1RCRY?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0(Original review) This product has a wonderful night light.  It will turn on when you are around it which is really cool at night.  WiFi stopped working as soon as it was installed on the ceiling.  After the WiFi went out the app stopped working.  In order to delete the app and re-install the app the Nest has to be taken down from the ceiling because the phone has to scan a pattern on the back of the Nest.  Do not know if the Nest will protect against fire and monoxide but it is a great night light.  If you want a really cool looking automatic night light and you have too much money this is a great thing to do.  For everything else this is just useless tech.  To make this thing do what it is promised to do will not only require a lot of money but a lot of time.  Dependability in a warning device is crucial.  No evidence to date that this thing is dependable except for the night light which is really cool.Update:  After two days of effort got the features to work.  It was not easy because tech support is misleading.To fix this thing you must first delete this thing.  If the app has locked up you must delete the app and then re -install it.  What nobody except a few savvy users will tell you is that there are two levels to screw you up.Nest's instructions tell you to log on to the nest WiFi.  This is not the way.  Sure go to your Iphone settings and connect with the nest network but it is not your WiFi connection, it is merely a sub net of nest devices.  Your WiFi is still the same and you will have to connection it like you always have.The real trick is to delete the device in the nest app and then choose to add a new one.  It took me 3 times to get traction but then it worked out.  You will know that you have it when it asks for your WiFi name and password.  So that was a whole day well spent.  Time will tell if it reliable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1439251200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not bad. Better than old-school smoke detectors, and they seem to work well for the most part. There are a couple of glitches.","reviewDescription":"The Next Protect is a decent smoke detector, and overall I'm happy with it. Previously my house had several First Alert smoke detectors. The First Alerts had an annoying problem where they would occasionally beep at full volume for about 1 second. It wasn't a low battery beep. I don't know what caused it, but it was driving me crazy for years. I finally decided to replace all 8 of the First Alerts with Nest Protects. Here is a summary of my experiences:Pros:  \u2022 Attractive design  \u2022 Easy to install where the First Alert detectors were previously located  \u2022\u00a0Doesn't beep randomly like the First Alert detectors did  \u2022\u00a0Night light feature is pretty cool  \u2022 Night light can be disabled (like in the master bedroom where it would be annoying)  \u2022\u00a0It's nice being able to see the status of the detectors using an iPhone app  \u2022\u00a0The backup batteries have a 10-year lifespan  \u2022 Detects carbon monoxide as well as smoke  \u2022 The detectors communicate wirelessly with each other (no communication wire required)Cons:  \u2022 I installed 8 Nest Protects, and I had difficulty setting up 2 of them. It was a software glitch, and it was very frustrating.  \u2022\u00a0Twice during the last month the detectors went offline (the iPhone app couldn't communicate with them)  \u2022 One time a single detector went offlineOverall I'm quite happy with them.

It seems like one a month.Update: 2023I have to downgrade my review to 4 stars. The Nest protects have been fantastic except for one thing. I'm 6 years in and they're starting to fail with the carbon monoxide sensors. I've now had three of my eleven fail in the past three months. The thing that concerns me about them all failing at roughly the same time is that I had a similar issue with another Nest product, the temperature sensors for the thermostats. All of those failed within a month or two, too. It's almost as if these are engineered to fail at a certain time. I'm hoping the remaining Protects do not start failing soon, but given the pattern I'm seeing, it looks like that could happen.Original:I recently bought two of these units and the installation went flawlessly. I'm not a particularly handy or hands-on person around the house, but these units took less than 5 minutes each for me to install.The installation was as simple: Add the units to my Nest account (via the app), turn off the power, take the old detectors down, remove the wire nuts attaching the old unit, remove the old unit's base, attach the Nest Protect's plug to the wires coming out of the ceiling using the wire nuts, screw the new base, attach the Nest to the base, and turn the power back on.So far, the Nest Protects have been working flawlessly.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent peace of mind, with added smart home features","reviewDescription":"While these are a bit more expensive than a standalone smoke\/carbon monoxide detector, the way they interconnect and communicate, and can be managed\/silenced from your smart phone (at least for me) is worth the extra cost.  I love the path lighting and nightlight feature.  My only complaint is that despite having the sensors updated in this second version, steam will still set off the alarm (hence the four stars instead of five).  Luckily, they are easily silenced, but is still an inconvenience to have an alarm go off because your teen opened the bathroom door after sitting in a hot shower for 30 minutes and the escaping steam sets off the smoke detectors.Because of the naming feature, when something is detected, they all announce the alarm, and then the location:. Alarm sound, \"Smoke detected in the downstairs hall\".  This is great so that you can investigate the issue more easily rather than running around the house trying to find which alarm is the source.  The phone app (and online access) also keeps you informed of the battery status, as does a green flash when the lights are first turned off for the night.If you have the nest thermostat, a carbon monoxide alert with shut down your HVAC unit to prevent pumping the poisonous gas throughout the house.

Nest\/Google survey \"encouraged\" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3\/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a \"mesh\" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange\/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!!

I just repeated the add and then it was good.Clever back plate lets you orient the detector any way you wish.No false alarms so far.  One is about 4 feet from a fan that runs fast at night which is not recommended but all is good.Looking forward to getting all remaining 6 detectors replaced but that's an expensive proposition.  But right now I effectively have two detectors that won't set the other six off and vice versa.I personally feel this is a $90 product.  If it was I'd give it 5 stars.

It comes with everything you need to mount it.My only complaint is that Google Nest uses several separate apps for Nest WiFi, Nest security devices, Nest thermostats, and Nest smoke detectors rather than one integrated app, which would make it much easier and less confusing to access and change settings for each type of device.

It was a product that is well-designed, but since Google bought Nest, they have al but signed the death warrant. First, you cannot get professional monitoring on the smoke or fire portion, so even if you did have a fire in your home, let's say when you are not at home. You basically have an expensive puck notification system as long as your electricity stays on. It will not call the Fire Department nor any monitoring service, so it's pretty much useless in that regard. And Google just discontinued their home security product line, so it does not bode well for the nest protect. If you are concerned with adding true professional monitoring, then you are better off not buying into the Nest ecosystem at all which is a shame because it's such a well-made product First Alert makes the same product which has Z-wave plus technology for integration into the Ring alarm system for true professional monitoring and emergency response.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1609200000000}

If there is a fire in the basement it will cause the bedroom alarms to sound to ensure no one sleeps through a fire.The Nest Protect's genius design does not have an interconnect.

The two reasons why I didn't rank as a 5-star is the cost, hard to justify $100 on a fire\/carbon monoxide detector. The other reason is that we noted that it \"illuminates\" a walk way.

{"reviewTitle":"Too much work!","reviewDescription":"I had nothing but problems trying to install Nest Protect . At first all my wireless devices (including the nests) would keep dropping off my network. I found out I needed to replace my old D-link router. I did this and still spent over a half a day on and off the phone with Nest Customer No Service (CNS). The first problem I encountered was that I could only remove one Nest in the app. I tried to re-scan them in but I couldn\u2019t add them because my app said they were still connected. I thought setting up another account would resolve this (big mistake), You are allowed two residence in your account in case you have a rental property on the same as your home. I deleted that second account and almost deleted the account entirely and that would have been another mistake. With the help of Customer NO service I was able to delete them and then set up each one again.  However after reconnecting the nests only showed up as online on their end but not on mine, we tried  plugging and unplugging the router, uninstalling\/reinstalling, etc. after several calls it was decided that they may not show up online on my end because they were not physically connected to the power (false).So I went through the process of climbing up and down ladders installing and testing each one. One after another they said they were online and connected. The app even showed it was online.  I got to the last one and when I tested it the nest said my first one was offline. I moved my ladder down the hall climbed up the ladder to my first one, plugged and unplugged and tested it. Now it said that one was online but my 3rd and 4th one were off line. I played the game of climbing and plugging and resetting numerous times. I called back CNS and they had me play the game again with them. No resolution. They finally showed up as online on my app, but if you physically pushed the button on the device itself it would say one or two were offline and then the app would change to show it was offline. I decided to test them using the app and only two would respond (and not always the same two) . Again another call to Nest and another wait on hold for the final Customer No Service. At this point I had spent 6 hours on and off the phone with Customer No Service. I gave the rep the case number, he read the notes, had no idea what to do took me through some of the same mundane steps as I did with the other reps. He refused to take ANY ownership of the problem . At one point the last rep said that they must not be wired correctly, which I replied, \u201cthey all have a green power light\u201d, the nests  DO NOT use wiring to interconnect  to each other but just for power, correct? He agreed, I then said if they all show a green light they are getting power so how could they be miswired? He didn\u2019t have an answer for me.  I told him that at this point I think one or more of these are defective but I have no way of knowing which one. He asked me where I bought them and I told him Amazon.I told him I was thinking of buying other Nest products but after this experience I don\u2019t think I will. He then said \u201cI should have bought them from Nest and not a third party on Amazon\u201d. I told him I didn\u2019t buy from a third party, but from Amazon directly and they were brand new Nests!  He just shrugged me off and told me to call Amazon to deal with the problem (these Nests are 2 weeks old). I called Amazon explained the problems and they expedited shipping me 4 replacements (this is what Nest should have done!) I also learned by googling the problem that you must have IPv6 enabled on your router so that the Nests can talk to each other. I went into my router settings and did this as well as uninstalled and reinstalled the app but it hasn\u2019t resolved my problems.Next weekend: I got the shipment from Amazon within a day of my call (Outstanding Amazon-5 stars for you!)  I problem checked everything before installing the new ones. First I checked my cable modem and made sure it was functioning properly, even contacted my cable company to do a test and reset the modem. I checked to make sure it was in bridge .I then checked my internet connection \/speed which was 64mbps up and 6 down so all good there. Checked my new router, even though it was new I flashed the firmware to latest version. Removed the old nests from the ceiling and uninstalled each Nest in the app (this time I could do it). I pulled the batteries on the old ones so they had no power.  Lined all the new ones up in a row in front of my router and went through my recommended steps. Checked the app and behold they all showed up as online\/connected\/ battery power. I climbed the ladder from room to room and installed each one. Then I checked the app and it showed them all connected and on house power. I then tested the Nest\u2019s via the app and the first one programed (master bedroom) spoke and tested (smoke, co2, click click). The others then spoke and tested together. I don\u2019t know if this is an error but at this point I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s been 4 weeks now with the new nests and I haven\u2019t shown any connection or battery problems.ConclusionI started looking at smoke detectors about a year ago. I spoke with electricians, fire chiefs, and did my research. Nest had  great reviews.  Besides setup issues I would say that the pathway light is kind of useless when you have a high ceiling, there is no way it would illuminate enough to light up a hall if there is smoke. Nest also monitors movement as well as your cell phone to determine if you are home, if you are sleeping or not moving around it goes into \u201cAway\u201d mode, you can fix this in the app. One important thing to consider is that Nest is different from other smoke detectors. Nest uses its own proprietary fire detection system they call \u201csplit spectrum\u201d, it got good reviews, other smoke detectors use either Ionization, photoelectric, or a combination of the two. Before you put down your hard earned money do some research on smoke detectors. I will warn you, it\u2019s confusing and you will find differing opinions on which are the best types to buy. Nest does offer an install with a contractor; if you are going to buy them you should seriously consider this service, although with the cost of install you probably will have the most expensive smoke detectors in the world.Due to the setup problems I encountered I cannot recommend Nest Protect.  I believe when a product costs AT LEAST THREE times as much of its nearest competitor, it should just work. It should be plug-and-play and you should not have to devote a weekend trying to get them to work and deal with frustrating Customer no Service!  And at these prices you should have outstanding Customer Service.  If they were the battery version I would just boxed them back up and returned them to Amazon. I would have then  bought first alert or kiddie and mix them up with photoelectric and ionization types, but then I would have had to uninstall the detectors, backplates  and  wiring  and then re-wire for Kiddie or First alert as well as new back plates Too much work!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"21 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1517788800000}

I am frequently gone for weeks and months at a time and it is reassuring to be able to monitor my property when I am absent. I noted that the units have an expiration date on the unit label which indicates the sensors wear our after 10 years and the units need to be replaced. I am mindful of keeping track of these so I don't get end of life alarm problems when I am traveling. I also note that they advertise a 10 year CO sensor. Excellent, but not true. Two months ago one of my units went out with CO sensor failure indicated. A quick trip to the Google help site indicated the units must be replaced when a CO sensor failure occurs like this one did. I figured it was a rogue unit so I bought a new one from Google since some retailers will not ship these into California due to California restrictions on battery life which turn out not to be valid for these wired units. Hooked up the new one and all was good. Double checked the expiry dates again as I would be gone for th next five months and did the performance check as well. All good until I am sitting 2,000 miles away and I get an alert that another one has alarmed with a CO sensor failure. Paid my handyman $50 to go in and pull it down since this type of alarm cannot be silenced through the app and I didn't want it to disturb the neighbors. I called Google support to find out how their 10 year CO sensors could fail in 7 years and got a scripted run around indicating that the units only have a 2 year warranty and the 10 year sensor life is subordinate to the 2 year warranty. I asked how can they advertise a 10 year CO sensor life and not honor a 10 year warranty on the sensor. Two more rounds of them repeating the same script and when I asked to speak to a supervisor the CS agent said that was not possible, she had other calls to attend to and terminated the call. Google needs to honor their advertised claims of 10 year CO sensor life or pull the claim down. Anything short of that would imply fraudulent or misleading advertising.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687305600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nest makes a brilliant thermostat, but they have completely and utterly failed ...","reviewDescription":"Nest makes a brilliant thermostat, but they have completely and utterly failed at making a reliable smoke\/CO2 alarm. Well hang on, I take that back - the smoke\/CO2 alarm functions of these things likely work just fine; it's the \"smart\" features that just don't work reliably. And let's face it, those are the features that get you to buy a Protect over the $10 smoke\/CO2 alarms at your local Big Box store.The very first thing that made me want to buy the original Protect was the \"wave\" feature that allowed you to silence the alarm by waving at it. As someone who does a lot of cooking, I'm no stranger to the smoke alarms going off during the preparation of an extensive meal, so the \"wave\" feature was seriously compelling.And then Nest removed the feature because - brace yourself - it didn't work properly. It was so awful, the feature was removed permanently.So okay, the headline feature that made me want to buy the Protect in the first place didn't work right and was eventually pulled, but a network-connected smart smoke\/CO2 alarm that can send notifications to your phone when you're away is still a super useful feature and still worth the investment. But that's where we come to the biggest annoyance with the Protect: buying one means you have a not-insignificant chance of getting one that hates connecting to networks. HATES it.I bought 5 of the 1st generation Protect units to place throughout my home, and I had to have no less than two of them replaced several times. After various replacements came and went, I finally managed to get 5 functional units to cover my home. Seeing that Nest had come out with a newer version of the Protect, I bought a 6th so that I could plug a hole in coverage in my new house.The new model has a slightly sleeker design, a markedly better speaker (the voice is noticeably clearer), and presumably better hardware. There's a new battery door which is a seriously welcome addition seeing as how the old one required a screwdriver to replace the batteries, and an improved mounting plate.Unfortunately, the redesign has done absolutely nothing to improve the Protect's reliability. Straight out of the box this new Protect paired with one of the old ones and set itself up perfectly, connected to the network (and my account) with no issues, and seemed to take off running without a hitch. I discovered a problem this morning when I happened to notice in the Nest app that one of the Protect units was offline, and lo, it was the new model. I tried giving the thing a reset to no avail, so I moved on to a hard reset to erase all settings and start over. After deleting the Protect from my account I then struggled to set it up fresh, which it absolutely refused to do. The network functions in this new Protect just ceased working entirely.So I called Nest technical support. Now I will preface this part by saying that every single time I've called Nest tech support in the past, I was met with super nice and incredibly helpful technicians. They have always been extremely efficient and didn't waste any time reaching a solution, even if it necessitated sending out a replacement.Today was a very different experience.The 1st level technician with whom I spoke ran me through the setup process as expected, but then went on to insist on some bogus troubleshooting steps to the point of pulling one of my old Protect units off the ceiling and taking it, the new unit, and my iPhone to within 2 or 3 feet of my wireless router. During troubleshooting she also insisted that I clear Safari's history and cache on my iPhone, which made absolutely no sense (and I told her as such) and the 2nd level technician confirmed that wasn't part of normal troubleshooting and called it \"a complete waste of time,\" expressing my same confusion that the 1st level tech even had me do it.Suffice to say, the 2nd level technician hit the level of support I was expecting from Nest, and he's overnighting me a replacement for the new Nest. Great support aside, these things are still absolute garbage when it comes to connecting to a network. I don't know if it's a QA problem or what, but still having the same issues after two generations of hardware and countless firmware updates, something is seriously wrong here.And that's a shame, because if not for the horrible unreliability of the connection on which the \"smart\" features depend, the Protect could be an incredible product.

This did not make sense to me since I have multiple IOT devices that are 2.4GHz only and they have not had trouble connecting to my router which had one SSID for both 2.4GHZ and 5GHz channels.  Nonetheless, I took the advice and set up a 2.4GHz only SSID.  Two attempts after this change I successfully added the first Nest Protect.  Each successive device took 2 to 6 tries to add to my account.  A very frustrating experience made worse by the fact that I had to change the network settings on all my other existing 2.4GHz-only devices (thermometer\/hygometer, garage door opener, water detectors, etc.) to recognize the new SSID.  I finally was able able to add all 8 Nest devices to my account.  In the end, I'm not sure if changing the SSID fixed a problem or if simple persistence prevailed.  In any event, not a very satisfying experience.I also found the included plastic mounting brackets to be shockingly flimsy.  If the area behind one of the bracket holes is not flush with the surface it is being mounted to (such as might happen if you're mounting over an existing J-box), the head of the included screws just rip right through the bracket. The plastic around the edge of the screw hole, meant to hold the head of the screw,  is very weak.,  This happened 3 times to me.  Surprising that a top of class (cost wise) product would provide such lousy installation materials.  How much could it cost to provide a solid bracket?Just installed yesterday so can't comment on battery life or other long term questions, but wanted to mention the installation shortcomings.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1677456000000}

{"reviewTitle":"New Nest Protect Didn't Work!","reviewDescription":"It was time to upgrade one of my old Nest Protect 1st generation smoke alarms to a new one, as the end-of-life date was approaching. I was also looking forward to having the ability to silence the alarm from my phone instead of having to jump and hit the button on the ceiling whenever we created too much smoke cooking  as they had removed the app functionality from first gen units, which had been very disapointing. Luckily for us, within the first two weeks of installing this new Nest Protect my wife accidentally closed the fireplace flue instead of opening it. When we lit a fire the first floor of our house filled with smoke. There was so much smoke I had trouble getting close enough to open the flue. We had to open windows and put in window fans to get the smoke out of the house while I sprayed water onto the logs to put out the fire. I was close to getting the fire extinguisher out. What stood out after this experience was that the new Nest Protect never went off! It could have been disastrous if there had been a more dangerous fire.I'll add that I did notice it not going off once before a few days earlier after making a bit of smoke using the wok, but figured maybe the new unit just handled cooking smoke better. My old Nest Protect definitely would have gone off.I wasn't sure if I should send it back, as I'd been a Nest Protect user for a long time and had another unit on the second floor. I decided to contacted Nest Protect support. They sent us a new one. I don't recommend doing this, as they sent an old unit and we lost an entire year off the expiration date. So, not only did we get a defective unit, but the replacement won't last as long as the one we originally purchased. Very disappointing. I should have just returned it to Amazon and had Amazon send us a new one.I tested the new unit by actually generating smoke beneath it. It did go off. My trust in Nest has been shaken, but I like the spoken alert and functionality, so I'm betting on this being a fluke. Hope that turns out to be true. I won't ignore it next time the new Nest Protect doesn't go off after cooking.This review is to let people know they should test their Nest Protect with real smoke if they get one. The built in test function only tells you if the speakers are working and alarms can sound, but it doesn't tell you if it can actually detect smoke.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1575936000000}
{"reviewTitle":"One major flaw to a great product!","reviewDescription":"First of all I want to say that, despite one major flaw, these are great! If you have ever had a smoke detector fail, setting off all the detectors in your house (And not be sure which one it was or if it did really detect something); or if you have ever blindly stumbled around the house in the dark trying to figure out which smoke detector is chirping so you you can rip it down, get the dead battery out, and get back in bed... then the benefits of this system will be obvious:- it will tell you, with a voice, that it detects smoke and that it is about to go off- you can name them in the app so you know which one has gone off and why (again it will tell you with a voice and in the app)- they test themselves and know if a sensor has failed so you do not get a false positive (and customer service is very good... they replaced one that I had with a failed sensor after nine months)- you can get the message on your phone if one goes off when you are not home, where it is in the house, and what it detects- they put an end to that maddening intermittent \u201clow battery\u201d chirping that always seems to happen in the middle of the night and is so hard to figure out which smoke alarm is making it... again with clear and early notifications by the Nest Protect itself and on your phone with the app letting you know if there is any problem or maintenance issue and with which one- the little nightlights that turn on on them in the dark when it detects someone walking under them in the dark are surprisingly nice when you get up in the night (and can be disabled if you do not like it)- if you use a Nest thermostat, supposedly the motion detectors on these can be used to send additional information to the thermostat to let it know that someone is home to help it better optimize when to turn the heat up and down, though we do not really use this feature.There is one major drawback though: these thermostats only use two wires (and not the three of old dumb thermostats). These use just the black and white wires for power, and not the orange (or red) wire that are used to interconnect regular smoke detectors. On one hand this does not seem like it would be a problem. It does not, for example, make them any harder to install: just screw a plastic cap (included) on the old interconnect wire and use the power wires. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, it means that these do not talk to the old system (only to other Nest Protects). They are, in effect, not backward compatible, and can not be mixed and matched with other smoke detectors if you want\/need them to talk to each other. If you have an old smoke detectors in the kitchen that go off because of smoke, the new Nest smoke detector that you just put in the bedroom will not go off to wake you up, or vice-versa. It does not seem like it would have been hard for the Nest Protect to keep the third wire and simply say, \"Warning: some other, non-Nest, smoke detector in your house has detected smoke\" when a signal is sent on the interconnect line (and send it's own signal when it goes off if you tell it there are other older smoke detectors on the system). Also, keep in mind that depending on where you live the building codes in your area may require your smoke detectors to all talk to each other. So in effect, you have to upgrade ALL of your smoke detectors to Nest Protects or none to keep them interconnected and\/or possibly to comply with building codes.If you are like me, you do not typically replace all the smoke detectors in your house at one time. You do them one or two at a time, when one is old, or you want to change a smoke only detector to a smoke and carbon monoxide detector, etc... It seems like Nest made a mistake here by not recognizing that most people do not do upgrades like this all at once, but usually just start with one or two and see how they like it. I recently saw a listing on Facebook Marketplace for someone selling five of these at a loss. They had bought that many, but the building inspector in their area told them they needed to all be able to talk to each other so they would need to do all thirteen in their house or none, and they were not willing to spend $1,547 plus tax to do them all thirteen. So know what you are getting. If they work for you, they solve so many of the problems that make people hate smoke detectors and are those nightlights make them surprisingly pleasurable to have in your house. But not talking to your old smoke detectors could be a deal breaker for some people, particularly if you have a big house, local building codes require them to all talk to each other, and you are the kind of person who likes to replace these one at a time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1568764800000}

Once installed, the alarms communicate with each other and conduct a test, listening for one another to ensure each one is working properly. Having the ability to hush an alarm from the app instead of searching for a broom when cooking gets a little too... intense is wonderful. The letdown (and deduction in rating) came when I tried to add my spouse to the app so she could do the same from her phone. You cannot add a user to your home from the Nest app. You can only do so from the Google Home app. You cannot control the alarm from the Google Home app. To use this product fully, Google expects you to use one app to control the alarm, and ANOTHER SEPARATE APP TO CONTROL WHO CAN CONTROL THE ALARM. This is hands-down the best smoke\/CO alarm in the world (I'm keeping them even though I don't use anything else in their ecosystem), but Google's utter inability to see why that might be frustrating to users will probably drive some potential users away.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1710806400000}

I decided to go with Nest Protect (gen 2) for a number of the features, but one of the most important to me was the verbal announcement of the room where the detection has occurred.  I knew up front that the app \/ device supported custom room names, and that really sealed the deal.  Well... turns out that while you can set names, it won't speak them.  You can only have it speak a small pre-defined list of names.  In particular, a bedroom can either be \"Bedroom\" or \"Master Bedroom\".  Similarly, if you have more than one \u201challway\u201d, garage, patio, balcony, etc. those cannot be differentiated in any way.  It can't even do a generic right, left, north, south, east, west, so at least I could try to give some hint of where a fire might be by using one of those instead of a room name.  I ended up with two \u201cbedrooms\u201d nowhere near one another, two \u201dgarages\u201d, and three \u201challways\u201d.In my case, I'm in a house on stilts because I'm next to a river that can flood, and there is a ground level single car garage on opposite ends of the house, with a bedroom over each garage, and the center area is open.  If there's a garage fire, I have no way to know which one it is, to know which way the family should evacuate, given you obviously don't want to head out the side of the house that is on fire.  Similarly, one child sleeps in a bedroom on the far left side, one in the bedroom on the far right side.  No way for the verbal warning to let me know which one could be on fire.I contacted support and they advised me to use the app.  I explained that in a fire I'm not going to be getting my phone out to see which side of the house is on fire...  zero help.I see people complaining about this issue dating back to 2015, so given it's seven years later, I have no hope Google is going to provide a solution.Fairly disappointing for a smoke alarm at this price point, but guess it is what it is.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666310400000}

They have been working well and have had no issues since. I just purchased an equal number of these Ver 2.0's for my own home and love them. The entire process has gotten much easier and more refined. The app has certainly gotten better in 2 years.I like the way the menus and user interface works and looks in the App. As soon as I start it up I can see the status of my system, perform a self check, look at the history of the readings and actions of the detector and various other useful actions. It runs well on my iPhone 7 and I've had no issues with the App so far.Installation of hardwired detectors took about an hour. The round mounting plate fits well over round ceiling boxes or rectangular single space wall boxes equally well. There are various screw hole spacings on the plate to accommodate different sized electrical boxes. The kit comes with 3 wire nuts and 4 screws. The screws are unlike and that I have encountered before and look very modern and nice. (not that you will be seeing them after installation). One wire nut for the hot (black), white (neutral), and one to cap the unused signal wire if you have it. The pig tail that comes with the Protect is about 6 inches long and is the perfect size.I like the way the Ver 2 Protect has a built-in microphone to self test it's own alarm speaker. That seems like a good self checking feature. I do wonder how many speakers have ever failed in smoke\/CO alarms. I have never seen  nor heard of one fail in that respect for the over 25 years and hundreds of homes that I have worked on. I am sure there is a statistic for that however. I hope the microphone is never used for privacy violations.I got the Protects because I wanted a smoke\/CO detector that would email me if there was an alarm so that I would know when away from home. I looked but there really aren't any other competitors currently with similar device. I was hoping to get one that was Apple HomeKit enabled. I wish the Nest was HomeKit enabled, but as Google has positioned itself as a major competitor to Apple I don't guess that will be happening soon. Maybe they will add that when some competition does come to market. Right now Nest is still the only major option. I tried a couple of First Alert One Link detectors. Both the Battery and Hardwired versions failed miserable within 8 months on installation.This is a wonderfully designed device. I like everything about it. The path night light has proven to be a very useful feature. It gently lights up the pathways at night when motion is detected. I love that feature. The design aesthetics really go well anywhere you put it. It looks way better to me than any other on the market. The circle LED ring that changes colors based on state is very nice. (Blue, Green, White, Red). The voice guidance and room name announcement are excellent features. It has a pleasant and natural sounding voice. I really do think this a complete package. I wonder if there any other features that could be added. If there are I'm sure the designers and engineers at Nest are working hard to think some up. It is a 2nd generation product now and has little to no bugs. If only it was HomeKit enabled it would be a complete package for me.

I always loved the idea, but didn't feel the cost was justified given the negative reviews and early issues. Although they have been able to gradually improve the Nest Protect through software updates, I figured if I was patient enough, I could wait until they released a whole new hardware refresh. I'm glad I waited!Compared to the Nest Protect 1st gen, this one has an improved smoke chamber (fewer false alarms), smaller physical footprint, App Silence feature (silence alarm through app via Bluetooth), and other hardware improvements that extend the stated lifespan to ten years (up from seven)! All very good improvements.But does it work? Well, my house hasn't done the ultimate test of becoming engulfed in flames yet, but I did do some basic false alarm testing. Steam from a nearby bathroom, and light smoke from a candle, both failed to trip the alarm. So it seems their claims of fewer false alarms are true thus far.*Setup*Getting this set up was very easy. You can really tell they put a lot of work into the presentation and setup. The box is easy to open, and very welcoming with its simplistic and well-designed instructions. Everything in the manual is accompanied by very good pictures to help you along the way.Basically, the steps are:1) Download app (Android and iOS compatible) and create a free account2) Open Nest Protect box and remove hardware3) With app ready to pair device, pull plastic tab from Nest Protect unit to power it on4) Unit goes through some brief testing where you will be left with absolutely no doubt the alarm works (LOUD!)5) Unit will pair with your phone so you can enter in wifi network info, after which it will connect to wifi6) Remove old smoke detector and mounting plate7) Disconnect old smoke detector wires and reconnect new wires included with Nest Protect8) Screw in Newst Protect mounting plate and snap in other end of new wires to unit9) Twist in unit to new mounting plate10) Finish with another test and make final configuration changes via app. Done!This was the first time I had ever replaced a smoke detector, and I found it very easy.*Mobile App*The app is very well-designed and works well on both my phone and tablet. It also integrates with a ton of other home automation gadgets, which is really cool (Nest Thermostat obviously, Philips Hue bulbs, Skydrop sprinkler controller, and many others). Here's some of the things you can do from the app:- Change mode between Home and Away (not really relevant to CO detector, but good for other devices)- Iniitiate Nest Protect sound test, checkup- Silence alarm- Change Protect location (family room, bedroom, etc, for accurate communication)- Adjust Nest Sense:- - Toggle Pathlight to light your way when you are under Protect at night- - Nightly Promise (Unit self-tests and gives green \"OK\" light each night)- - Steam Check (reduce false alarms on steam, good for units near bathrooms)- - Heads Up (less loud & annoying pre-alarm warning when rising CO levels detected)- Adjust unit LED brightness (low, medium, high)- Change language (English, English (UK), Spanish, French, French (CA), Netherlands)- View unit status (model, serial, software version, battery status, replace date, last update time, wifi MAC\/IP addresses)- Add\/remove devices to your account- What To Do (advice on preparing for CO\/fire alerts)- Device History (logs on alarms and updates)So overall, the Nest Protect is an expertly-designed device and I love it so far. It has everything I could expect from a smoke\/CO detector. Although it would be awesome if it could double as a wireless access point or security camera! I will definitely update this as I get more time with my Nest Protect 2nd gen units, especially if I get false positives, or actual positives.

{"reviewTitle":"Easy installation, absolutely SPECTACULAR user interface!","reviewDescription":"A year ago, I purchased a first generation Nest protect (battery only), but didn't install it because one of its features was disabled by the company (waving to silence alarms) and all the detectors in my home were integrated by a\/c current. Two weeks ago, just as we were preparing for a trip away, the smoke alarm near the entry way began chirping and beeping (two different sounds). We were able to silence the chirp with a new 9 volt battery, but the only thing that would stop the beeping was to turn off the power to the a\/c circuit to which it was connected. Even totally removing the malfunctioning unit didn't silence the beeps!Descriptions of our dilemma provided us no clues, but eventually, we contacted telephone support for the unit's manufacturer. A REAL LIVE PERSON with concern and humor answered, listened to me describe our problem, then responded, \"honey, the ceiling can't beep! Do you have a CO monitor close by?\" We did. She then told us that the beeping was the \"end-of-life\" signal coming from the CO monitor plugged in at ground level 10 feet away. Sure enough, unplugging it silenced the beeping. Then she told us that our other CO alarms and all of our smoke detectors were well beyond their intended lifespan (all manufactured in 1992) and all of them must be removed, even though they all displayed their \"AOK\" green LEDs and passed their aural tests). (We purchased this home 2 years ago, paid several hundred dollars for a home inspection, and nothing in the inspector's report mentioned that our detectors were beyond their expected usable lifetime).Clearly, we needed protection that gave us more feedback about their normal and abnormal performance. Extraordinarily satisfied with our Nest thermostat, I decided to purchase Nest Protects for the rest of the house. I installed the 1st generation unit to replace the one I'd already removed. To do so, I needed to drill some holes into the ceiling because the holes for its mounting plate didn't line up with the junction box in the ceiling, and two of them required a power drill in order to penetrate the 2 x 4 ceiling framing. We left on our short trip knowing that we had at least one working device and several more to install when we returned home. When we returned, we unpacked the new, a\/c powered units, lined them all up within 20 feet of the 1st generation battery operated unit, and began the ID\/registration process. The thought that's gone in to the user interface for this device immediately became obvious, when a quick routine of scanning the code on the back of each device led to prompt addition of it to our existing network of Nest thermostat and an increasing number of registered Nest Protects. Physical installation went just as quickly, as did an initial \"checkup\" initiated from my iPhone.I did spend a few minutes reading the manual, and learned that 10 years from now, when units require replacement, they'll alert me both verbally when I'm in their proximity, and by sending me emails that they're in need of replacement! Another plus: the thermostat in our 2 story home is located in a small blind corridor where it cannot \"see\" traffic through the rest of the home. Consequently, when we're asleep at night, our Nest Thermostat decides we're away, and the temperature drops to the \"auto away\" setting during the night. We save big on our power bills but it gets a bit cool in the house! Now, with the Nest Protects \"talking\" to the thermostat, we awake to more comfortable temperatures.I have only two concerns about these devices. One is that, in a very large home, the \"checkup\" testing of individual devices may overlap others in time. That's not a problem in our relatively small 2 story house, but in a large home the overlaps could make it difficult for one person to confirm that all the units are working. Even that's not a real issue, because the units test THEMSELVES when we're not present and send us email confirmation that they're all functioning.The other concern is that these products were born in the minds of people who worked at Apple, who clearly learned their lessons well while there. They are attractive, communicate clearly to their owners, and guide their owners with an outstanding user interface.

{"reviewTitle":"Great smoke\/CO detector, beware amazon inventory age","reviewDescription":"The Nest Protect smoke detectors are great.  They warn you before they alarm, giving kids and pets time to clear the area before loud noises and parents time to silence the alarm or deal with the issue.  We've experienced far fewer false alarms from our kitchen Nest Protect than the (much cheaper) first alert it replaced.  The smart app features are handy if you travel or are out of the house often. I love the Protects and since my older house is not wired having the Protects linked by wifi\/bluetooth is a major safety factor for me. I'm replacing expiring detectors in my basement and second floor with Protects and feel like it's worth the extra cost.The major caveat is the age of the Protect you are sent.  Be very aware that the inventory Amazon has may be old. I bought two Protects from Woot for $30 off MSRP (amazon subsidiary) and both were manufactured in 2018.  This means they are 6 years old and only have 4 years of service life left. Almost all CO detectors have the 10 year lifespan limitation.  Google disables the Protect after the replace by day. You get an audible \u201cNEST PROTECT HAS EXPIRED. REPLACE IT NOW.\u201d message.  Given that I can buy Protects locally for MSRP and that they were made in the last year or so, I should get 8-9 years of life from a $150 Protect.  So a Nest Protect with only 4 years of active life is only worth $60-$70, far less than what woot\/amazon was selling these old stock units for.  It may be worth buying locally so you can return them easily if you get given very old stock.  That is what I'm going to do after returning these.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722384000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Connectivity tips for Nest Protect Smoke Alarm","reviewDescription":"I just spent 4 hours attempting to connect my Nest to my Starlink router and I have troubles but I was finally succcessful and I want to help other Amazonians, who were so helpful to me in the past, so here goes.  You need to download the Nest app - and as far as I can tell there is only this one app that works with this device.  After downloading the app I went through the set up procedure several times, called customer service who was very helpful  (I see some people write they are mad at Nest because of poor customer service so I will remind you that your service experience is COMPLETELY dependent on the cooperation of the single person you talk to.  If you don't get help from an assistant hang up and call back but don't get mad at the company, for crying out loud).  The tech told me (he's reading from a screen I think) that Nest Protect should work on both 2.4 and 5 GHz Wifi bands however I had better luck with my 2.4, GHz band which I separated on my Starlink program.  Secondly, make sure your Bluetooth connection has nothing on it at the time of setup.  Also , I had my phone connected to this same server partition, the 2.4 GHz band.  I held down the center button so that I could hear the version stated and then let go once I started to hear which version it was.  Finally I downloaded the app a few times - uninstalled the app, re-installed the app, and then reset to factory conditions by pressing the center button for 10+ seconds. For some inexplicable reason it seems like each time I re-installed the app I got a slightly different response in terms of instructions (on time it said I needed to connect to a temporary server, another time it bypassed me setting a password - can't explain it). Bottom line, follow instructions to the letter, keep repeating the proceedure from the beginning until the WiFi gods cooperate.  Now my dread is that once my internet goes down (and I live in a rural area that never has cell phone reception and therefore am completely internet-dependent) it may not recover and I'll have to go through this same thing all over again.

It's beyond easy. I'd say I spent 10 minutes installating the first one because I was reading and checking everything twice. The second through sixth took 2 minutes: one minute to install the bracket with the 4 provided screws, and another minute to add inside the Nest app. The additional detectors know there is another unit in the house and they pair with each other to save you time.EDIT: I hadn't tried the nightlight feature initially, though it was activated on the units I now own. Two nights ago I got up in the middle of the night and the light on my bedroom unit came on almost instantly. While I appreciated the light I was concerned it would wake my wife. It didn't. The next day I turned off the feature in the app for all the units that are in bedrooms.EDIT #2: While attempting to setup the 7th and final unit - a used one - it appeared to have been switched on already. Not a problem since the batteries are long lasting, but the unit would not allow a factory reset. The support link in Amazon takes you to Google.

The Nest app indicates the the smoke sensor had failed and the Protect needed to be replaced.  This \"failure\" seems to be the result of excessive dust in the bedroom.  If I remove the Protect from the ceiling and give it a good cleaning with compressed air it will go back into working condition for about 6 months.  This is a pain to do this as I need to get a ladder from the garage on the first floor and drag it upstairs to the bedroom, remove the Protect, clean it, replace the Protect, and put away the ladder.  The Protect is like all other dumb smoke detectors - the chirping always starts in the middle of the night!  The app needs to provide a way to acknowledge the problem and stop or postpone the chirping.

I've got better things to spend $900 dollars on.  Problem with NEST, they have MAP pricing.

Maybe we'll get lucky enough that this will be a black Friday deal or cyber Monday deal. Amazon ran my nest thermostat as a black Friday deal last year and i got it for 179.99 (pretty good deal) considering it is 249.99 everyday of the year at every retailers who sells it. Put a price on safety? Aww well probably not and I can live with 10 dollars a year as this product has a usable lifetime of ten years.

They all use the red third wire for interconnection, so if one alarms, then they all alarm to notify everyone in the house. Nest Protect does not use the red third wire (it only has 2 wires for hot and neutral), so it acts more like a standalone smoke detector.  If one on another floor alarms, then all the detectors will go off except the Nest Protect. The Nest Protect will not go off until the smoke has moved to the part of the house where the Nest is. This seems like it would be a huge benefit if Nest used the third interconnect wire and sent out a notification for any alarm. I understand that Nest is wireless, but this forces me to replace all of the smoke detector with Nest. I have way too many detectors and the cost would be too high.

So really, if this is a device that's designed to let you know what's going on in your house when you're not there, and the companion app that it's supposed to communicate through doesn't work, what's the point?The ONLY reason I gave it two stars is because the hardware itself seems amazingly solid.Like my cameras (that actually do work the way they're supposed to), I began looking into other areas of my house that I'd like to be able to let me know when something's wrong. If you're a commuting home owner, you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to deal with 3rd party security systems and subscription fees when devices can supposedly communicate directly with me instead. That's what Protect is *supposed* to do. It's flaw: the companion app. It requires you to verify your email every, single time you start the app. The other issue is that after about four or five uses, the app forgets your Protect and you have to pull it off the ceiling and completely reinstall from scratch. I did this three times in two days before throwing my hands up in disgust.If they can't get the app fixed in a couple of weeks, I'll be forced to return the device.UPDATE: 10-29-15I sorted out the device dropping from my Nest account on my own. That still left the app e-mail verification issue to resolve. Using Firefox (instead of Chrome) to follow the outbound link from the verification email solved the issue.

I decided to purchase just 1 at the time and now ordered a second.  The nest protect seems to be the top of the line product in smoke detectors according to other reviews here and top websites, but it is also the most expensive.  I think if they lowered the price to 75 or 80 dollars, it would be a great deal.The look and appearance is top-notch along with the quality of all components in it.  This thing weighs more than any other detector I have purchased, which usually means it is a quality product.  The setup is fairly straightforward, but you have to make sure you are ready to hook up the unit to wifi right away.  Installation went fine, but the product really needs drywall anchors to hang it from the ceiling.  The weight of this thing made me not trust the screws alone.  If you have it located where at least 2 screws can be placed into a stud, then it will be fine.  For the cost of a Benjamin, it should include 4 cheap anchors at least.  You also have to make sure of the backplate orientation as the unit turns in only 1 direction.  Not really an issue unless you are picky about how it looks when you look up at it.The only issue I have is the unit is in a dark room of the house and thinks it is night sometimes when the sun is out.  Also it occasionally doesn't light up when approached, but that could be if it detects a light source coming from a lamp outside the room.  For the most part, it seems to be working.  Hopefully I never have to find out in an emergency.Overall, a fine product.  I highly recommend them for the home if you can afford them.

Installation is a breeze as I went with the battery option. You simply unpack everything and pull the battery tab and you are good to go. Seeing as I have a Nest account already, adding it to my account was simple enough. You should definitely pair prior to installing on the wall or the ceiling as you need to press the button in order to do so. The circle mount they provide was a bit smaller than the existing smoke detector I had, so I had to make some modifications to make it work. The volume on the alarm is very high, you can run through a series of tests to make sure everything is working by pressing on the button. I installed this on the lower level and I was able to hear it from upstairs no problems. Viewing information via the app is easy but very barebones. You basically see when it was last tested, if there was ever any alerts and when you should replace the alarm (approximately every 10 years); that is basically all the information available. You also can configure whether or not you want the Nest to communicate with other Nest products and whether or not the light ring should light up when motion is detected; I personally turned the latter off since I did not want to drain the batteries. Compared to traditional alarms, this is pricey. But being somewhat an early adopter and choosing a simple option, the cost would obviously increase. I'm fairly satisfied with the purchase based on what I have experienced thus far.

Good points:  We have one location where our Kiddie alarm would get set off when we took a shower.  The Nest Protect is engineered not to react to steam.  Our dogs and cats give this feature 4 paws up!  They would give it 5 but, you know, four is all they got.  The second feature that makes this worth it is being able to control, test and silence the alarm from my tablet.  The alarm should be placed at a highest point on your ceiling because smoke rises.  CO molecular weight is slightly lighter than the molecular weight of air so it would have a bit of buoyancy as well.  This makes pushing a button on any alarm in the middle of the night difficult or dangerous while responding to a false alarm. With the Nest, you can use your phone or tablet. Another great feature is it tests the batteries many times a day.  You do not need to get up on a ladder to change batteries twice per year.  It will tell you when you need to and you can check it on the Nest application.

The nest protect in my bedroom alerted to dangerous levels of Carbon Monoxide and woke me up at 8 AM the morning after my first night back in my home. After a call to to the Fire Department confirmed the presence of CO in my bedroom, our whole three family townhouse was assessed & we found two sources for the gas. One, the location of the exhaust pipe for my unit\u2019s boiler, was an easy fix. The other, my second floor neighbor\u2019s boiler which is on the other side of my bedroom wall, will be harder to address - but it\u2019s off now and I can safely sleep knowing that if there is another problem, my nest protects have my back.Both my alarms detected the gas and went off. None of the other alarms in our building, including the two in the boiler room with the leaky boiler, went off. I highly recommend the Nest Protect for safety and peace of mind. Sniffers measured the CO level in my bedroom at 100+ ppm, with 80 ppm coming from the leaky boiler.

We got very lucky because I am a light sleeper and woke up and smelled something funny. The kitchen was full of smoke but the fire was still contained inside the toaster oven. We used the extinguisher to put it out. Turns out the smoke alarm was dead (probably just due to being so old) and I kick myself for never testing it like I'm supposed to.I immediately started researching smoke alarms and was intrigued by the Nest Protect due to it being a \"smart\" alarm and had an app that would notify me on my phone. It also tests itself regularly to ensure everything is working which is great for those of us that forget to. I have 3 dogs that are often home alone and I started thinking if there is a fire or carbon monoxide alarm, I won't know if I'm not home. After reading lots of reviews, I decided to try it out. Installation and app set up took less than 5 minutes. Today, my son was making bacon in the kitchen. I was at work and we were actually texting as I got a notification of an emergency, smoke detected. As I got that notification my son texted me that he set off the alarm. This means that the notification came immediately to my phone. I was able to silence it on my phone since I knew it wasn't a true fire. Then as you can see in the pictures, it tells me the smoke is clearing. The peace of mind I get from this makes it worth every penny. If you are contemplating purchasing it, just do it.

Then if something triggers the alarms, the unit in your bedroom (or the alarm sent to your phone) can be specific...  \"there is smoke in Kids Bedroom\".

I love that they both speak and play an alarm when there's an alarm. If you have a Nest thermostat, they can also be programmed to shut the AC off.

I could sit here easily for 30+ minutes typing up all the things they can do. It's easier for you to just go to the product page and read up on them. But long story short, yes these are more expensive than a basic smoke alarm, but they're definitely worth it. Especially if you need multiple of them and have Nest thermostats and Nest cams.

The Nest Protect had great reviews, and here\u2019s my experience so far.The unit arrived well packaged, with clear instructions.  I was prompted to download the Nest app, and scan the detector with my phone prior to installing.  There were a few prompts and settings to configure, but nothing too time consuming.  Primarily configuring the unit to work with your Wi-Fi, which was easy to do.I was instructed to run a test, and was pleased by the clarity of the voice that came from the unit advising me that a test would begin in 10 seconds.  The voice was also nice enough to let me know I had 10 seconds to cancel the alarm test, as the alarm would be loud.  The alarms themselves (both smoke and carbon monoxide) sound like a traditional detector.  They are accompanied by a color coded warning, though, which makes for easy understanding of what\u2019s going on.  Also, depending on the severity of the detection, the color will change (i.e. if toast is burning the color will be different than if your couch is on fire).  The unit can detect how much smoke is in the room, and gives you the option to silence from your phone\/tablet.  Also, if the alarm goes off while away from home, you receive an alert.Other nice features:  1. Low battery warning will never go off in the middle of the night (major selling point for me!)  Also, alerts are sent to your phone, so you don\u2019t have rely on annoying beeps to know batteries are wearing out.  2.  Installation was surprisingly easy for the wired version, and literally took about five minutes.  However, the square shape of the unit did not completely cover the marks left from uninstalling the old, round unit.  3. I LOVE the motion detection capability.  If you walk under the unit at night, a soft white glow is provided to illuminate your way.  A small feature, but pretty cool in my opinion!Very happy with the unit so far, and I will post a follow-up once we\u2019ve had some time to live with it for a while.  The only negative so far would be the fact that the unit, while nice looking, is smaller than my old smoke detector, which requires some ceiling touchup painting (I might just leave as is, as it\u2019s not that bad).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1466121600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Expensive but Effective","reviewDescription":"These are more expensive than your typical smoke detectors but the added perks are worth it. I bought a bundle to replace all of our smoke detectors and knocked them out fairly quickly. Installation is as simple as a regular smoke detector with the added process of configuring each with the Google Nest app. The app is also simple. You scan the code on the back of each unit, assign a room identifier and follow the few prompts. Done. It's also convenient these come with everything you need to mount. Some common detectors don't include wire caps which you're not always thinking of ahead of time.The app is where this shines. There's a few customization options. The pathlight is nice but not really necessary. Turned them all off. The nightly check is excellent for peace of mind.The only negative reviews I've commonly seen were in regards to manufactured date. I bought all but one in bulk. All arrived with the same manufactured date of only 1 month prior. I miscounted and left out one detector to replace and bought it separately. That single unit arrived with a manufactured date of 9 months ago. Could have been worse.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687737600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nest Protect equals Peace of Mind","reviewDescription":"First, let me say I originally ordered 5 Nest Protects for my small home that originally only had one detector.  The devices came separately; I got 2 of them along with my Nest Thermostat E and then I cancelled the 3 pack shipped from another location leaving me with 2 devices to install in my home.  The reason for the cancellation was because the life expectancy of these devices is 10 years from manufacture.  The ones I received were manufactured in Mar 2016; already past 15% of their lives.  Some folks may think I'm petty but I wouldn't buy a 2016 \"new\" car in late 2017 and pay MSRP.  I decided we could live with two of them so that's that.Now to the 5 stars.  I'm a tech geek; I like that these devices detect both types of fire warnings AND C02.  I like they they talk to one another insuring the alarm is sounded through out the house.  I like that the Nest Thermostat E we got will shut down our gas Furnace if C02 is detected (the likely curprit) by ANY of our Nest Protect detectors.  I like that I will get a notification on my phone almost instantly if a problem is detected, even if I'm out of town.  The entire concept of this product is simply GREAT.  I hope that I will NEVER hear it but life simply doesn't offer such guarantees and being prepared for those possibilities is a great comfort.I've installed two devices, one by our gas furnace, the other by our gas clothes dryer and gas water heater.  I will most likely get a 3rd one and place it in our home office where most of our electronic equipment is operating.  I am very comfortable with the product's operation and anticipate years of service (less just a little bit).To get full benefit from these devices, you need to have a Nest account and WiFi in your home that will permit these devices to establish a communication mesh.  The Protects can only be configured from your cell phone (IOS or Android).  If you are not comfortable setting up such stuff, I would recommend you get the professional help that the company offers.  Otherwise, follow the directions with the product and enjoy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1508457600000}

It works when you first install it. However, when you decide to change your password for your WiFi network (or the SSID for that matter), there is no easy way to update the device. In fact, Nest Customer support told me that I needed to remove them from my account, and to add them again. This means you need to access the barcode on each device, which means you have to remove them from wherever they are installed. I have some in high-ceilings. Their advice is to not change your WiFi password and they do not consider not changing your wifi password a security issue :-)In my case, I purchased a Google WiFi router and had to remove all my Nest Protects to get them to connect. I also have a Nest Thermostat, and I had read that all the nest devices communicate with each other (outside of WiFi). My thought was that Nest would update all the other devices.

That morning, around 2 am, the alarm vocally alerted us to smoke in the bedroom.  I shot out of bed and looked around for a source of smoke.  I then glanced at the humidifier and suspected that perhaps the smoke detector (mounted 7.5 feet off of the ground) was going off because of the humidifier (sitting on the floor across the room).  Some googling revealed that people have issues with these mistaking hot showers and humidifiers for smoke.  We've since ditched the humidifier in the bedroom and have had no false positives since.

However, the only thing in the dining room at that point was me, jumping to hit the silence button, while praying to the Lord that the neighbors arent going to call the fire department.First problem, one night we were having house work done while we were at work.

No problem says I as I fire up the trusty Nest app. But lo and behold, you cannot silence the alarms from your phone, you can only see that your house is 'burning' to the ground.

[You can silence the alarm on the phone when you are on your home network, but if you are at work, you are SOL. This is a horrible design fail.]Fast forward four months and now for two days in a row the Nest is now telling me that there is smoke in the house. Once again no smoke and this time no dust, just me playing Team Fortress 2 upstairs. I take down the unit and clean it off and the next day the same issue on a 11 month old unit.

The unit is easy to setup, and is well made, but a pain to install.1. Note that the unit lacks a third wire to integrate with your other detectors. It will only link with other Nest Protects. This is a huge problem. I have 11 smoke\/CO detectors in my house. Unless I am willing to spend $1100 to replace them, my existing detectors will not generate a whole house alarm to include the Nest Protects and vice versa. Not a good design, may I say dangerous!2. The base was designed in a laboratory, not the real world. The mounting ring is very thin, and breaks easily, and you can only use the included flush mount screws due to clearance issues. Do not screw down anywhere near tight, it will break the mounting ring, or the ring will be too tight to the mounting surface and the unit itself will not have enough clearance to mate to the mounting ring. I have Deja Vu here......not a good design.While having bought into the nest integration, I'm really disappointed in the Nest Protects. The thermostats work great, but the lack of integration with existing smoke\/CO detectors, and the poor mounting design make the Nest Protect a \"do not recommend\".I have also been watching the Nest Cam for the next generation, as the current version is way overpriced for a fixed camera.

Even if you use a different brand and you get shorter life, on a projected 5 year lifespan you would expect to see a little more that 2 weeks.  It's past the 2 year warranty, which is another peeve. If you say it has a 10 year lifespan but you only warrant it for 2 years, then you're pretty much saying that the lifespan is a lie, right?And Google, where they light cigars with 100 dollar bills, don't appear to want to 'fess up and take on the expense? Give me a break. Bring on the Justice Department anti-trust prosecutions as far as I'm concerned.There are also a number of disturbing reviews alleging that while the units appear to be online and functioning they do not actually detect the presence of smoke or CO. My hunch here is that while Nest appear to be OK for your thermostat, the whole protection technology thing is still a little beyond them. Or was, and while they may have fixed it they don't want to live up to the claims they made when it didn't.Probably going to move back to old school alarms from First Alert or similar. They claim ten year life. They warrant ten year life. It's about that simple.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1607644800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Beware of Age","reviewDescription":"Buyer beware of the age of the device that this seller is shipping. Mine was manufactured in 2015 and below is the story of how I figured that out, and the problems that it\u2019s age created. I got it out, attempted to connect to my home network (google mesh Wi-Fi, which you would think would be very compatible), and it came back with an error code that was related to not being able to connect to a 5GHz network. The google mesh automatically switches between 2.4 and 5GHz, and this really hasn\u2019t been an issue with any devices I have connected to my networks in the last 5 years because 5GHz has been around so long. Then I noticed the manufacture date on the back of the device and thought that was pretty weird that they would sell that since you\u2019re supposed to replace the device 10 years from manufacture date. Then I got to thinking that the device might be so old it wasn\u2019t 5GHz compatible. So I went to Best Buy that same evening and got a next smoke alarm manufactured in 2022 for the same price,and it connected immediately. So, my guess is that the seller found some almost-expired early manufacture nest smoke alarms and is trying to  sell them for an enormous profit, which I find to be extremely uncool.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673827200000}

{"reviewTitle":"A warning for those with attached garages...","reviewDescription":"Let's start with some detail:*) Packaging: 5 stars*) Install instructions: 5 stars*) Installation: Slicker than a hot knife through butter*) Autodiscovery by my Wink: Superb*) Operation: Delights the senses beyond belief - *Great* detectors!What happened? I learned shortly after install that in my state, a connected garage *must* have a heat sensor (according to Electrical and Fire code), and that sensor must communicate to smoke detectors, and all detectors must communicate together. This is to provide early warning when there's a fire in the garage; you might not be aware of it until the fire has entered the house, where it would be too late to escape.You are prevented (at least here, by law) from putting smoke detectors in the garage. Why? Unless you have electric vehicles, there's smoke (car exhaust) and carbon monoxide everywhere. Therefore, you may only install heat sensors in the garage.Nest's assertion is that \"you don't need wired interconnects! Buy a wireless Nest!\"  Well yes, but Nest doesn't sell heat detectors today, and more importantly, Nest does not inter-operate with any other brand of heat detector on the market today.  Yes, I'm aware that smoke detector interconnect is a proprietary interface, and true interoperatibility doesn't exist between brands, but Nest has enough partners that Work With Nest, and if I were Nest, I'd sure be looking for partners to produce a sensor that Works With Nest. None exist AFAIK.This point isn't clear from their marketing, unfortunately.  I'd suspect that a significant number of Nest customers have adjacent garages, and I hope all are aware of the requirements for garage detectors in their states.(Would a Nest Protect work in my garage if I disabled smoke and CO sensing, and left only heat detect? I'd buy a 3rd Nest Protect to do that, but the product doesn't support it, according to their friendly and courteous Tech Support).Back to Amazon they go.Nest, please let me know if the 3rd+ gen product ever supports Works With Nest heat sensors, and I'll snap them up in a heartbeat.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1482105600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nice idea, major flaws","reviewDescription":"I bought 2 of these and ended up returning them before they were even installed. I have 2 Nest thermostats that I'm very happy with and thought these would be an upgrade to my smoke detectors, adding carbon monoxide sensing and working with other Nest products.It turns out they have a lot of drawbacks that I didn't initially know about. My issues:-Biggest problem: They don't really advertise prominently, is that they don't work with other smoke detectors at all. I have at least 6 smoke detectors in my home (maybe 7, I'd have to go count). I don't want to have to spend the money to buy all new ones, but that is what would be required to use Nest. They all communicate via the house wiring and if one goes off they all beep. The Nest Protect only uses the power portion of the hard wiring, and doesn't trigger any alarms other than other Nest Protects. Of course this means that they don't beep if another alarm goes off either. So if there is a fire in my basement and I'm upstairs, or vice-versa, I won't know about. Nest's help section of their website says that it's not just Nest, that none of the brands operate with each other, but I have multiple brands of smoke detectors now and they all set each other off.-Second problem: Even if I bit the bullet and bought all new detectors, they don't work with fire sprinklers. Now this is not a problem for most people but sprinklers are getting more and more common and not working with them makes the Nest dangerous and against code to use. If my sprinkler goes off in another area of the house, I won't know that it happened at all.-More minor issue: I saw the feature that this had a temperature sensor, and being that it operates in conjunction with the Nest thermostat, I assumed that the thermostat would get this temperature data. My fault on this one for assuming, but it doesn't use the data for the thermostat at all. The only thing it does is turn the heat off for a carbon monoxide alert, in case that was the cause. This seems like a waste as it would be a great way for the system to know what the temp is like all over a particular area, not just wherever the thermostat happens to be located.So overall, I think this could be a great product if they fix it. Seems like it would be simple to add a wire that connects to the rest of your home's smoke detectors\/fire sprinklers and add an option to send temperature data to the Nest thermostat. I'll look at them again when they get to the 3rd generation, but for now these are definitely not worth it for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1450656000000}

Easy setup directions using the Nest app. Nice packaging. Once mounted, it looks more like a WiFi AP than it does a smoke detector.I wanted to replace at least one of my old-school detectors with a \"connected\" model, and having good experience with other Nest products, decided to go with the Protect. A major bonus is the \"pre-warning\" level of alerting if there's a little bit of smoke (like over-zealous baking). But I can't speak to its sensitivity, not having set any fires or experienced any CO leaks since installing it 2 months ago.Quibbles:The mount tolerance is VERY precise. If your old electrical box causes the screw heads to protrude at all, the unit won't rotate into the ceiling mount.My techie brethren will want to know it doesn't do everything over HTTP\/HTTPS like newer Nest designs-- your statefull firewall will need to allow a specific port outbound to nest servers. Google for the specific port-- it's not mentioned in the nest documentation (boooo).The unit does a cutsie green flash when the lights are turned out to say it's working, which can't be disabled.Most complaints about this unit seem to be about replacing the relatively expensive hardware in 7 years time. That's the kicker-- but it's not Nest's fault, since the expiration is based on guidelines for CO detector lifespan. They could try to keep the smoke alarm working while the CO detector shut itself off, but presumably there's liability reasons for just flagging the whole unit as \"replace\".I'm not 100% onboard with the short lifespan, but the expiration is a known factor when buying units with CO detectors-- and is part of why I'm only using one of these pricey ones (the others are all cheaper, non-connected units).

I accidentally pressed the center button on the device during \"Spanish\" and there was no option in the app to change the language.  I had to call their tech support, which was very good.  I was initially very irritated at having to call them over such a small issue that I should have been able to fix myself, but the hold time was very short, the guy was clearly based in the US, and was very helpful, walking me through a reset.  The UPS guy showed up with my second Nest unit while I was on the phone, and I told the tech guy \"well my second Nest just showed up so now I know what to do\", and he answered by asking me if I wanted him to stay on the phone to help get that one set up too.  I was impressed.  Very much opposite what tech support experiences are usually like these days.After everything was set up, updates downloaded, etc, the option to change language was there in the app, if you're wondering :-)Pros:1.  Great tech support with native English speakers and short hold times.2.  When you set up your second, third Nest smoke detectors, the unit reads your settings from the first one so you don't have to re-enter your wifi info, etc.  The app walks you through the steps and is easy to follow.  They couldn't have made it easier short of coming to your house and doing it for you.3.  You don't have to line up the base bracket perfectly when screwing it into your ceiling, since the smoke detector rotates on the base to make adjustments in being flush with your walls, etc.4.  You can test the units in a minute or so on your phone's app from anywhere....and it tests all of them sequentially.  It has both an alarm and a voice, as well as a red light ring on the unit.5.

Love the pathway light that comes on in the hallway at night. It's just bright enough to light my way, the light brightness is also adjustable. Only took 5 to 8 minutes to connect it to the Nest App and screw it in to the wall.As far as mounting, it's no longer a problem (as with the 1st generation) to level the square detector since once it's on the mounting plate you have a lot of play to move the detector in a circular motion to a level position with it staying securely on the wall.So I have seen complaints about people having trouble installing these Nest Protects especially multiple. This actually isn't a problem if done right.  The Nest App walks you right through it. The biggest tip is don't mount it on the wall until you register it with the Nest App. And the set up is done.  The reason for this is that one of the first things you are asked to do in the Nest App is to take a picture of the QR code ( square bar code) on the back of the device. You need to do this even before you pull the tab out for the batteries.The App then leads you through entering your Wifi password etc. another issue for some people. You need to make sure you have a 2.4ghz band of your router up and running. The Nest protect won't connect to the 5ghz band. If you have a dual band router like I have( runs both 2.4 and 5ghz) the Nest Protect should seek out and connect to the 2.4ghz automatically.The next issue people seem to be having is connecting a second or subsequent Nest Protects, especially if they add them at a later time. The reason this is a problem for some is because every Nest Protect installed after the 1st one has to be very close to the original ( just during setup) the reason for this is that the 2nd Nest and the 1st. one talk during the install process. The 1st Nest Protect copies over all the Wifi password info to the 2nd one so you don't have to do enter it all over again. So your phone that is running the Nest App, the original Nest Protect ( 1st one installed) and the second one you are trying to install should all be with in a couple feet of each other as well as in range of your wifi until the install process is done.If you install like above it installs flawlessly. Once the second Nest connect is installed it will then be linked to the Internet and to all other Nest protects previously installed. The nice thing about this is that if a Nest Protect goes off across the house they all will go off and identify which one has the fire near it. Pretty cool.Hope all this info helps.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1451606400000}

{"reviewTitle":"This is the only fire alarm worth owning","reviewDescription":"We invested in the standard fire alarms with the ten year batteries in them.  We thought it was a great investment until they started going off for no reason in the middle of the night.  Not the best way to wake up at 3 a.m.  One by one, we were replacing them because they kept going off for no reason.  Apparently, fire alarms are highly sensitive.  You get some dust in there or a spider decides to take a midnight stroll over the alarm... not good.  The alarm will go off.  We tried cleaning them out with air cans to get rid of any dust and... no luck.  So we tried an amazon nest.  Guess when it goes off?  Only when I cook.  Yes, sorry... not the best chef here but at least I know WHY it's beeping and it gives me a polite warning beforehand.  Much appreciated.  Plus, I can push a button to have it silenced for thirty minutes while I finish preparing food that probably won't taste that great.  We started with just one of these and have slowly invested in additional ones to replace the original alarms.

{"reviewTitle":"It's easy to tell the guy in charge once worked at ...","reviewDescription":"It's easy to tell the guy in charge once worked at Apple. Just like the Apple of old, these things are just really fun and pleasant to use.Here's what I love:1. The batteries won't fail in middle of the night. The protect will notify your smartphone well before your batteries fail, so you'll have plenty of time to replace them.About every six months the batteries in one of our old detectors would fail (for some reason this always happened in middle of the night). Then they would chirp once every three minutes. So it would wake up my wife and then me, but I could never immediately tell which smoke detector was beeping because the chirp was so infrequent. Usually, I'd spend about 20 minutes trying to find the problem detector. Unfortunately, the dog would always get nervous and start shaking, and the whole ordeal made it much harder to fall asleep again.2. It knows whether there is steam or just smoke. That means the detector in the hall by the bathroom doesn't have false alarms.3. It warns you using a voice before sounding the super loud alarm, and you can silence it either with your smartphone or by pushing the button on the detector.Our old smoke detectors were interconnected, too, but that was more a pain than a pleasure. The detector near the kitchen would go off, which in turn would set off all the other alarms in the house. Again, the dog would freak out, and I'd have to run upstairs and press the button.4. This detector actually has two type of detectors in it to get both the smoky fires and the fast burning ones that don't produce as much smoke. That makes me feel more safe.5. This detector also finds carbon monoxide, which is important if you have a gas oven, furnace, or otherwise burn wood in your house. When it detects carbon monoxide, it will also shut off your gas furnace, which might be the device causing the problem. (Note that this detects carbon monoxide NOT natural gas, so a gas leak will not be detected by this or any other carbon monoxide detector.)6. It automatically checks itself so you always know they're working.7. If this is a fire, the detectors will tell you where it is in the house, which in middle of the night with children could be a huge life saver (literally).8. It's a very good smoke detector, but it also integrates with the Nest thermostat, so if anyone's in a given room, the Nest will report that to the thermostat along with the room's temperate and humidity so that Nest can make sure that room's at the right comfort level.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1438992000000}
{"reviewTitle":"one for fast fires and one for smoldering made me look closer at my choices and I really didn't like the idea of having to pick","reviewDescription":"I chose to spend $99 a pop for 5 of these. I bought my fixer-upper house about a year ago and had the roof replaced and all ceilings repaired as soon as I took possession. I took down all the existing and probably aging smoke detectors at that time thinking I'd install all new ones as soon as the work was done. However, l completely forgot about it until my co-worker lost her home and possessions to a fire this summer! Dreading the prospect of remembering to change batteries when daylight savings rolled around and then tracking down the obnoxious chirp in the middle of the night because, of course, I'd forget, probably didn't help my memory. I considered getting 10 year battery type smoke detectors, but it's still not a set it and forget it situation. You have to test them once in a while and I was likely to forget that too. Then learning there were two types of smoke detectors, one for fast fires and one for smoldering made me look closer at my choices and I really didn't like the idea of having  to pick my poison. Then the thought of my cat perishing in fire because I was away at work sickened me-- how's a smoke detector going to help my cat- it'd just add to his fright. Finally, having to get CO detectors and dealing with their batteries and the confusion about placing them high or low led me to look into the expensive \"smart\" smoke detectors. The Protect's managing its own batteries, being able to detect both kinds of fires, having a built in CO detector, having the gentle early warning feature come to my phone so I could run home to check things out so my cat at least has a chance in a bad situation, sending a monthly email report of what's been checked and when, and having immediate access on my phone to check the detector when I happen to think of it instead of fruitlessly trying to remember when I got home all made spending the money a no-brainer. They're very easy to install. They communicate with men in plain language or simple color codes instead of cryptic chirps and tiny flashing LED sequences. Each detector knows where in the house it is, so there's no more removing batteries waiting for no-chirp in hopes you got the right one. The app is super easy and always at hand. You don't have to worry about stuff like \"smart hubs\" or \"works with nest\" unless you have want to. Though, I don't think it's absolutely necessary, you need a WiFi home network and a smart phone to use the best features of the product. For me, since I had those things, it was just crazy not to somehow get installing these into my budget, and I'm glad I did.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1476662400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great for peace of mind and an added layer of safety in the home","reviewDescription":"My apartment feels all high tech and fancy now.I am very paranoid of fires and gas leaks after some personal and family history with both tragedies. I was going out of town for a week and leaving behind my two furbabies (cats) plus I work so my cats are home alone a lot of each day. Since they were going to be home alone most of each day while I was in a completely different country, I wanted to make sure I could perhaps help save them in the case of a fire or gas leak. The only two solutions I could find were to either buy a full on security system that included a wifi smoke alarm\/CO2 alarm OR buy this nifty Nest device that didn't require me to have insane security systems. I have a security system but I just didn't like the idea of being required to have everything be part of the same company and would have had to buy a ton more equipment to get that fire protection benefit from my current security system. Ugh.This Nest device arrived quickly and setup was a breeze. The packaging was great and the instructions were super clear. The best part is I was able to add my dad and my sister (who live 2500 miles away) so that if my alarm went off and notified me via the app but I was distracted by vacation or in a bad international service area... they would be able to call the fire department for me and inform them that my cats are indeed inside waiting to be rescued (since they ignore those 'save my cat' stickers a lot of the time). That added level of safety really helped but my mind at ease. Now I can feel at ease while I'm at work too.I know that getting a notification of a fire via wifi isn't going to be the fastest method for getting help and my stuff would definitely be unsavable but I don't care about my stuff. I just hope that a fire will be quickly reported by neighbors and via the network system when the building alarms sound and then I will be able to notify rescuers that my cats are inside even if I'm nowhere near my apartment and completely unaware of the fire otherwise. A gas leak doesn't instantly kill so I hope that I would be able to notify rescuers fast enough with the help of this app.It's really just a helper and something to ease the anxiety of leaving my cats home alone when at work or out of town.Overall a great product and I like the added feature of the app telling me what the temps are like in my neighborhood.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1490572800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not worth the money","reviewDescription":"I am very disappointed with this device and trying to decide if I should just return it. Most reviews here complain about the expiry date, mine was recently manufactured. However it has 3 major issues: first the installation, the backplate is very poorly designed: it has 4 exact wholes which will only work if your junction box happens to be exactly the same size, mine wasn\u2019t. Secondly and most important: WiFi notifications are very delayed. I have my device with the Nest app open connected to the same WiFi network as this alarm, I trigger the alarm and the app keeps showing \u201ceverything is ok\u201d. There are no push notifications. It takes the app at least 1-2 minutes to change the status of the device, that\u2019s practically useless. I bought a $150 smoke detector expecting to be notified when I am on the go, it doesn\u2019t work for this purpose. Lastly, the device does not integrate with anything but the Nest app. Not even Google Home.

{"reviewTitle":"Installed 8 in new construction - SERIOUS CONCERNS","reviewDescription":"I liked the fact they are smart detectors. My thought was they would give you flexibility to silence false alarms and notify you of events or  issues while you are away.That is-- of course if they work and are reliable.I am a computer professional with years of experience with networking and troubleshooting computer issues.  So, I a have better than average computer skills and knowledge.NEST PROTECTS are a serious pain when trying to get them to be stable on your network and reliably communicate to the server and each other.  I had thought that the issues we experienced originally were that i had a weak WIFI signal in various areas of our house. (4900 SQFT)  so, I did not complain much, expecting it to go away once our new mesh WIFI network was installed.  My WIFI is now strong and full strength in all areas of the house.  I still get offline units, that will not reconnect until I remove the unit from the software, reset it to factory defaults by holding button for 10 seconds, and then SCAN the bar code on the back to add to the software (BTW, the manual method without scanning has never worked for me. so, the unit must be removed from the wall and scanned)MY major concerns1.  Will these really work in a real fire?  I have serious concerns.2.  Randomly, a unit will go offline and never come back till I reset it, it is various units through-out the house.3. The app tells you very little, so how do you know the interconnect feature will even work?4. Self-Testing the units, the offline units never respond?  if they were interconnected, they would work just like a cheap hardwired unit does.5.  The app is very weak and immature in what you can do or see.  For example, why must you remove a unit from a \"house\" in order to reestablish connectivity, versus just review and edit the settings.  ( an advanced settings tab would be great)6. No method of direct connect even over Ethernet.  BTW, POE would have been cool.  relies on WIFI. (which seems unstable)for the $$$ spent, I fear, we will need to replace them with traditional units, in order to be sure our family is safe.

I liked the feature that lets you know the alarm is about to go off. It always triggered when we seared steaks. We had to open windows and let the smoke out to prevent actual alarms, but it's nicer than hearing alarm. Also, it meant that it was working well at detecting smoke, I guessed.Well, that was a false sense of security.Today, I came home to find out that my mom left something on oven again. My house was full of smoke almost to the point that it irritates my eyes. After opening all windows, doors, garages to dissipate the smoke, I was wondering why Nest didn't alert me by phone. I checked Nest app, nothing showed up. I ran Nest Protect self-test. It completed fine. House is still in deep smoke and Nest can't detect the actual smoke!How am I going to trust a device that couldn't detect a house full of smoke?FYI, when it detected a smoke (during cooking steak), it probably detected burnt oil? This time it looked like my mom tried to boil something. After boiling water away, gas oven burnt pot and vegetables inside without oil. I'm wondering if it only detects burned oil.Anyway, I can't return this, and I can't trust this device anymore.Goo $100 wasted.===========I've added the screenshot of this Monday stat.

So I come home from work and two of my units are screaming, of course my poor dogs had nervous break downs over this and DESTROYED the house(not something they would ever do) they then escaped the house and would not come back in the house(not something they ever do) so here I am looking at my ruined house and trying to figure out why the f these are going off, So I end up having to borrow 16 foot ladder to get at one of them that's in a stairwell ( another giant ordeal that requires a new windshield in a brand new Range Rover).

I don't use throw-away batteries anymore.  Don't know how this slipped past my radar when I ordered the Nest Protect Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm, Battery (2nd gen).  The \"batteries included\" promise was true - the throw-away batteries were indeed present.  But the \"low battery\" screeching began beeping every 60 seconds at exactly 4 months (May 15 to Sep. 15).  I was disappointed to find throw-away batteries in the package when it arrived, but the \"long life\" statement in the technical specs booklet made me hope they'd be good for maybe a year, or at least 6 months (though 6 months is NOT long enough for me when it comes to having to take batteries to the hazardous waste facility).  Live and learn.  Rechargeable batteries are the only way to go, and battery powered smoke detectors are certainly convenient for someone with disabilities living alone.  But I need to pay better attention when buying anything that runs on batteries.  So why am I pinging Nest with only 2 stars for a mistake I'm owning up to?  Four Months Is NOT Long-Lasting.  Period.UPDATE:  Went to the Nest website to learn more about the special battery requirements.  Website states:  \"All Nest Protect models are designed for multiple years of battery life.\"  At first glance, someone who can't climb a ladder might think that the BATTERIES would last for \"multiple years.\"  But no, it means the DEVICE is designed to work for \"multiple years\" while chewing through unbelievably expensive batteries 3-4 times a year.  And the website says you CANNOT use rechargeable batteries - not even rechargeable batteries that meet the extra voltage requirements of this device.  I eliminated throw-away batteries from my life years ago.  There is so MUCH data to absorb when making this purchase.  The reviews are more helpful than the information provided by the manufacturer, since the reviews go right to the heart of the most common problems:  Interconnectivity with other smoke detectors, short battery life, WiFi connection problems, etc.  This may be 2nd Gen, for Nest, but it's still not ready for the general public market.  This is the only 2nd Gen product I've seen in a long time that was really only 1st Gen beta stage.  Took my 2nd star away and reduced my rating to the single star it deserves.

That part is trueYou can silence the alarm via the app. This is two separate lies.  You can \"hush\" the alarm, which is akin to hitting snooze, it will go off again in 10 minutes.  You can do this via the app but ONLY in bluetooth range, NOT via WIFI.If you have a false alarm (I had 2 devices fail in 6 months) it will notify you via the internet.  Even if you have cameras or a neighbor check for you, you can not turn the alarms off until you get home  (remember you have to be in bluetooth range).  Hopefully you're only at work or the grocery store, but you have to go either push the button or hush the device within bluetooth range.  AND you need to do that for EVERY device you own not just the alarming one.  And they will all go off again in 10 minutes.  So you need to run around, hush all of them, figure out which one is broke, get the ladder out, probably hush all of them again, disconnect the failed device and remove it's batteries and hush them all again.  Hopefully the rest of the devices will go back to normal.  And you'll have to deal with the aural trauma your kids, friends, pets, and neighbors have endured.Now there is no hard reset or anything other than factory settings reset, so most likely you'll have to spend an hour chatting with a google robot to convince them that the device has failed.  Then you can buy a new one from them, send them the old one, and after they inspect it, they will refund you the cost of the replacement.  Sounds cool right?  Yeah I didn't think so either.

Little on the pricey side, but I looked at several other brands that are more expensive, so I figure it is probably cost competitive.I had difficulty with 2 out of 9 getting them added to my nest account.  Restarting the application was the resolution both times I had the issue (P009 error).  There was one user error, where I did not get a good connection to one of the wires.  But what was great was that the nest app told me that there was a problem with the power, so I went back and fixed it.Besides the P009 error that I got adding 2 of the units to my account, the only other complaint that I had was during also during installation where it starts the language preferences.  During install, it has you flip the unit upside down and use the QR code on the back to identify, then yank out the plastic price that keeps battery from making a connection during shipment.  At this time the unit turns on and asks you to press the button to select english, you have to be quick and flip it over and press the button before it switches to Spanish.  2 of my units were set to Spanish since I hit the button while it was asking to hit the button for Spanish.  Needs a little longer wait between languages.  So after setup, you can switch the unit back to english using the nest app, but this change is not immediate.  So it was fun doing the final test after all of the units were installed, and some of the units spoke Spanish (by the next day they were all English).Other than the 2 above mentioned issues, I do love the units.  There is a lighting feature where it turns on when it is dark and it detects movement, at first, I did not think that it was going to be a great feature, but I really like it.

I have the Nest Thermostat and many other products house so i though that it would be beneficial that i get the Smoke & Carbon Monoxide detectors. I needed to replace all the smoke detectors in my house anyway so it actually worked for me. Yes i know that they are pricey but, buying with Nest insures that there will be updates in the firmware and you are future proofing the technology. Also, you will get a low battery notification on your phone when the batteries are about to die. No more chirping in the middle of the night.WHY TO BUY OVER REGULAR DETECTORS: (features)Waving at the detector if there is a false alarm to silence.Pathway - the blue ring will light up white at night when movement is sensed, very helpful when navigating the room at night (you can adjust the brightness that you want it) Another cool thing if you have pathways turned on is the app records when the light was on and off so you can track what time certain events happened. (I will attach picture)Ring around the middle button will be a visual if there is an issue. (Disconnected from network - Smoke Detector - Alarm Sounding)INSTALLATION:The installation was very easy. It really is plug and play. All the detectors come with a 9v battery that is rated to last for years. They are very expensive 9v batteries and are made for this type of application. They are easy to take down from the roof\/wall with a simple twist.APP:The app aides with setting up this device so that it connects to your existing network and smart appliances. Currently I am using the Net Thermostat, and SkyDrop with these smoke detectors. (SkyDrop will turn sprinklers on in a 3 minute interval if a fire is detected to try to limit the fire from spreading) The one complaint that i have about this detector is that every time you need to change the wifi name or password you have to manually factory reset each smoke detector and set it up again. Nest really needs to make a way inside the app to just change the settings because its not very convenient to get the ladder and go to all the smoke detectors and reset them.PROS:Buying from NESTSolid built hardwareFirmware updatesLoud! - Only when they need to beCONS:Network Changes require factory resetting each device.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"81 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1451952000000}

There is no disappointment here.  Heavy cardboard and plastic to retain all pieces parts and a nice sleeve for the manuals.  Though who cares about he packaging, what about the product.  Definitely follows through here, the product itself is high quality and heavy.  No cheap parts in this.  Set up was quick and relatively painless though trudging through 8 of them is time consuming but necessary.  Installation was a breeze and even a beginner should be able to do it.  Just remember to turn the power off first. After setting all units up the app still insisted that the units were offline.  However just give them a few minutes to connect to your wi-fi and restart the app.  All was right after that.The BAD? - the unit comes with 4 screws yet you only need 2 to install it properly.  It really would have been nice if 2 of the screws were 1\/2\" longer for those installations were the electrician didn't mount the box properly and it sits back further in the ceiling.  A couple of mine I had to utilize the longer screws that were used to install the previous smoke detector.  Not a deal breaker btu longer screws would have been nice and followed along the line of high quality.  Another issue I ran into is the mounting plate for the Nest, it could have been a little larger.  If your drywall is not directly touching the mounting box you will have a gap.  The gap is not visible when the Nest unit is installed but not sure if dust and debris will be an issue; or maybe bugs.  Will update if it becomes an issue.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase,  It was time to replace the old smoke detectors and I wanted a little more protection from my house burning down to the ground when we were not home.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent detector.  Easy installation with great features.","reviewDescription":"I highly recommend the Nest Gen 2 Protect. I have seven in my house that have been up and running for just over two months.  Many other reviewers have given excellent overviews of this product, so I won't get into the specs or features.  I will say that install is simple.  I had my 9 year old take care of registering each detector with my phone while I took care of mounting the Nests on the ceiling.  The screws provided work great on a drywall ceiling, no need for any sort of anchor.  Another nice touch is that the detectors can be rotated on their ceiling mounts.  This is great for those of you that insist, as I do, on having your detectors mounted so sides are parallel to the walls.  Simply rotating the installed detector is much easier to than trying to install the a ceiling mount exactly square to a wall.  The only problem I encountered after installation was a failure of the detectors to maintain a connection to my 5 year old  Linksys router.  I was ready for this because my wireless devices would also lose signal in the same areas of the house. This problem was easily solved by switching to an up to date, more powerful wireless router (TPLine AC1900).  Overall, my experience with the Nest detectors is such that If you are having installation issues there is definitely something wrong.  Stop and give Nest a call.Yes, the detectors might seem expensive, but you do get a lot of features you don't on other detectors.  Path light, a motion activated LED white light,  is great. It is fairly sensitive to movement, so I only have it activated in the hallway mounted detectors (multiple brightness levels are available, but the dimmest setting is still too bright for a bedroom).  \"Accumulating smoke\" is also a nice feature, especially in my kitchen mounted detector.  It provides plenty of time to silence the alarm and open a window.  This is very powerful when coupled with the connectivity of the Nest Protect. If you are roasting something that starts to smoke, but happen to be outside of the kitchen, your phone and the other detectors will notify you about the problem.I couldn't give this product a higher recommendation.  I sleep easier at night knowing that my family is better protected with the Nest Protect keeping track of CO and smoke.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1444089600000}
{"reviewTitle":"I really like the features the Nest Protect offers","reviewDescription":"I've upgraded about half of my smoke detectors to 2nd Gen Nest Protect from whatever cheap item the builder installed (and will continue replacing the others).  Overall, I really like the features the Nest Protect offers.  My primary reason for choosing the Nest was the \"smart\" features.  We have pets in our home, and receiving an alert for smoke or CO conditions when we are not at home was worth the premium price, as we can summon help more quickly and increase their chance of survival.There are two things I was just a little disappointed in:  (1) Interconnect only works with other Nest Protects.  In other words, if you have interconnected smoke detectors and replace one with a Nest Protect, don't expect that it will activate when the others do.  This isn't necessarily Nest's fault; there is no standard for interconnect communication, so the same is true if you replace any smoke detector with a different brand.  It is just something to be aware of (I didn't know this until I installed my first Nest Protect).  Just beware of that fact and make your choices accordingly.  (2) The Protect has a test feature that can be activated from the button on the device or from your smartphone, but it does NOT activate any mobile alerts you have configured--it just activates the siren and audible alert at the device.  I would really like to have the test trigger the mobile alert and my IFTTT rules, so that I can test the full range of notifications for my Nest Protect.  I'm planning to buy some canned smoke to try to activate one and test that it that way.  Otherwise, you have no confirmation that alerts will work.Despite those relatively minor complaints (the interconnect isn't a big deal, I really would like to see a better test method) but I still really like the Nest Protect.  They're very easy to install and offer a great peace of mind.  I really like knowing that I will be alerted to dangerous conditions at home no matter where I go---at a fraction of the cost of installing a monitored fire system.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1449100800000}

Only 2 weeks after installation, the Nest app alerted me that it was time to change the batteries on my Protect unit.  After attempting & failing to install Eneloop rechargeables in the device, I found out that the protect will only operate on Energizer L91BP-8 Ultimate Lithium AA Battery which will set you back $15, which is 15% of the Nest Protect cost. I also noticed on the Nest website that it states \"All Nest Protect models are designed for multiple years of battery life\" so I wrote into their customer service line to see if they would reimburse me for the batteries since it was obviously a defect.  After multiple days of not getting an answer, they finally wrote back and stated \"At this time we do not offer reimbursement for that scenario.\"","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1447372800000}

The only solution to this is to remove it from the Nest app, and re-add it (which involves climbing a ladder, unplugging the Nest Protect, scanning the code, reattaching, and then putting away the ladder).  I cannot possibly recommend this product to anyone who is intending to incorporate it into the Nest App.  Why can't the Nest Protect use the same wifi technology deployed in the Nest Thermostat (about 4 feet away from the Protect) that doesn't have any issues with WiFi?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1440979200000}

I looked over Nest website and found the question among FAQ obviously many other buyers have same issue. The Nest answer is like they do not understand what is it we ask for or they just do not want you to keep using your old wired detectors, they want me to replace all 12 fairly new detectors with their product, dumping over $500 to the dumpster and spending $1200 for Nest Protect. Now way, it is not going to happen. It is surprising that such smart crew of Nest ignored this need which for many users is a deal breaker when investing in expensive Nest Protect devices. The Nest website keeps talking about how wireless connection between smoke detectors is superior over the wired model and how California authorities carefully reviewed their spec and approved Nest Protect. Well, great but California is not a center of the universe, that is one thing, another is that is not the point of the question people ask about 3rd interconnect wire, or it's lack.

The carbon monoxide sensor in my combination smoke\/CO unit was 10 years old, and gave me an end of life warning. I researched several WiFi units and decided to give Nest a try. I have had several people ask me questions regarding them at work, so I thought I would try to get some first hand knowledge to share in the future.The features I read about seemed great, probably more than a person really needs.  I was excited when it arrived and immediately went about installing it. The first thing I noticed was that there were only 2 wires to connect as compared to most hard wired alarms that have 3. This 3rd wire is what interconnects all the smoke alarms in your home, if it was built since this feature was available\/required.I jumped online to see why this unit only has 2 wires. It only has 2 because the alarm will not activate any of the other alarms in your home.....unless you purchase them from Nest also.This is a major problem, and one that I can't believe UL or NFPA haven't made a larger issue about. All smoke alarms, regardless of brand, have been manufactured to work together for nearly 2 decades. It almost seems unfathomable that a company would risk lives just to make more money.Let me be clear, the Nest units do interconnect, but they do it through their own wireless connection, which is fine. This technology is also available through other brands, but with one major difference...they also sell hard wired base units to tie into your existing alarms. These companies are more concerned about keeping people safe, rather than making more money by you having to replace all your alarms.So, long story short, the Nest product is a neat idea, BUT, not for those wanting to stay safe without replacing ALL their alarms.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1480723200000}

This red wire is what sets off all alarms in your home if one detector picks up smoke\/CO. This way if you are sleeping in one end of the home and a fire starts in the far end, you will be alerted long before the fire and smoke reaches your sleeping family. The NEST detector does not use this interconnect wire, it uses a proprietary ad-hoc wireless connection between NEST devices only. YOU MUST REPLACE ALL DETECTORS WITH NEST, OR NONE.This really irritates me to no end, because the corporation could easily have integrated their detectors with industry standard wired interconnect systems, but doing so would allow home owners to buy just one device to leverage the iOS monitor\/notify functions, and more cost-effective, good quality detectors for the rest of the home (which was my plan). But to up their sales, NEST forces you to replace all of them with a detector that costs 2-3X the price. I have seven detectors in my 5\/3 home and I will not be coerced into spending $1000 to use their proprietary tech!Also fair warning \u2013 regardless if NEST uses your home WiFi or their own ad-hoc wireless, all wireless connections are subject to signal interference from certain home appliances and\/or building materials, as well as distance degradation. Even if I was willing to spend $1000 on all NEST detectors, I would insist that they use a WIRED connection for interconnect, to make certain I do not miss an alert during a life-threatening situation.Just because code today doesn\u2019t require wired connections (there were no wireless detectors when the code was last updated) doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t specify this in the future. I would not be surprised to see future lawsuits being filed for a large home where the wireless ad-hoc fails and a family dies from smoke inhalation from a fast-spreading fire, simply because they weren\u2019t warned early enough to escape.

I bought 4 of them and installed during a remodel, which means there is no internet or wifi at the property. But guess what, they have pass inspection, which means they must connect to each other and all alarm at the same time. Nest makes it impossible for no good reason.I tried everything to get these devices to connect to each other. Nothing worked. I've now spent about 5-6 hours trying to make them work and have given up.Since there was no wifi, and according to their article all you need is a wifi connection (Search: \"How do I install my Nest Protect\"; on a side note, Amazon needs to update their draconian policy on not allowing external when they are absolutely relevant to the review), I bought a cheap router and set it up at the house. The article does not state that you need the internet backbone, just wifi. Well, it doesn't work. None of them would connect.Next, I tried to use a wifi hotspot. Again, none of them would connect. Failure after failure. At this point I wanted to toss them in the trash.But instead of that, I disconnected them all from their power supply and brought them somewhere with a strong wifi connection and internet (although I still have no idea why you need an internet connection for this - there is no reason all of that linking functionality can be handled locally on the app without an internet connection). And after all that, they still didn't work. 3 of 4 devices would see each other, but not the 4th. The 4th device knew the others existed but wouldn't sync with them. Deleted all them all via the app and tried 2 more times. Same problem. Not to mention the app crashed during this process (see pic), and it always said \"Offline\" (see pic) and blamed my internet connection even though I have 100 Megabits download speed, a brand Netgear Nighhawk router, and all 4 devices were displayed in the app settings.I wish I could get my money back.

These are wired alarms so I bought one wired and another battery only nest protect ( for a new laundry room that was not wired ).  They both connect to each other and the thermostat.When the old smoke alarm would burp, I would hit the mushy red light to try to get it to stop, some times it would, some times it would not, until I pushed it a couple of times - to be honest I did not know if it was working or not, just wanted it to shut up and stop scaring the baby.The nest protect has a big button on the front and you know it is doing something when you push it - lights change color, it talks to you, goes through a check with audio, etc.  In other words it works like a modern device should, as apposed to the pre-cambian era smoke alarms out there.One day I was out doing stuff and my cell phone popped on and said the nest was doing an audio check back at home, finished it and sayed everything is cool.  This is how it is supposed to be, instead of a burping smoke alarm.It was easy to setup and so far no problems, but I expected that from this company - no surprise there.  So now I am replacing my other smoke alarms, one per month.Also bought my mother in law one - a battery one so she can put it in her hallway in the rental she is in.

I LOVE the \"nightlight\" feature- it's exactly the right amount of light to navigate by. Bright enough to walk through the house without turning on additional lights, but not so bright that it wakes up the rest of the family. I also enjoy the peace of mind knowing I'll get an alert on my phone if I have a fire or carbon monoxide issue while I'm at work.The device itself is well constructed- heavy for it's size, feels solid. The mounting bracket is well thought-out, making the protect easy to remove if you need to wipe it or set it up again. Physical installation was a snap- my existing detectors were already hard-wired for power, so all I did was remove the wire nuts from the black\/white wires, add in the Protect's wiring harness, and secure the wire nut again. I capped the yellow lead and tucked it back up in the ceiling. That wire is unused in the NEST, but my old detectors use this to communicate with each other.I will be buying more of these to replace the aging detectors that were installed when the house was built 7 years ago. Just one at a time, because I don't want to drop 1,000 bucks at once. You may want to check with your homeonwers' insurance- some offer discounts on your policy if you have these, some will offer the protects at a steep discount, and some may offer a rebate for your purchase.One note- before you spring for the NEST stuff, make SURE that you have solid wifi signal throughout your house.

No one was in that area and couldn't hear the former smoke alarm going off.  Just two weeks after installing these (4), we had some steam near the kitchen and everyone was notified.  You can even tell Nest what room it's located in and it will tell you what room is detecting something.  It also detects Carbon Monoxide.  Love this thing.  Just bought another one and will be putting them in our home.Minor issue:There's a predefined list of rooms you can select from in the list.  The room names are used to tell you where the problem is.  The room names are great for home, but there's nothing really suited for a business.  I'm sure this isn't marketed commercially, but is well-suited for smaller offices like ours.  I wish I could have selected from a larger list of room names.  But that's a minor concern.Oh yes, if you have wireless security on your router (i.e., MAC filtering), you'll need to add the Nest Protect to your authorized MAC addresses.  It took me a while to find the address.

Insist on what you paid for.Second item of note: Nest continues to show contempt for their early adopters: those of us with the v1 units which only had a 6 year service life.  Nest did it with their thermostats.  They've now done it with their smoke detectors.  These 2020 Nest Protects are not physically compatible with the v1 units.  First, they use an entirely different 120V connector and no adapter is supplied nor available.  That means that many owners will need to call an electrician or installer to open the junction box, disconnect the old connector, and install the new connector.  That's what, a $75 - $100 call just for an electrician just to come out?  Ka-ching.  But wait, there's more!  Second, these newer Nest Protects use an entirely different mounting plate.  You must replace the v1 mounting plate with a new one (provided with the unit).  This new plate is more difficult to use compared to the v1 plate.  Mounting the unit to the v1 plate was quite easy.  These 2020 plates are more difficult to use.  Oh, but there's still more!  Third, the 2020 plates have four fewer mounting\/screw holes.

The product itself is well-built and sturdy.  I ran a test and the voice announcements are loud and clear.  The CO \/ smoke alarm functions without problems.  It even has a night light function and automatically lights up the hallway when it detects movement in the dark.However, the software installation didn't go without a hitch.  The first thing the mobile app asks for is for your address.  Incidentally, Hong Kong isn't on the list.When I raised this issue with Nest customer support, they mentioned that I should pick the closest location to me that's in an available country, which is China.  Unfortunately, I can't select that because it asks for a required zip code.  Hong Kong does not have zip codes.  The other countries on the list (Russia, Saudi Arabia) also require a postal code.Nest Support got back to me and indicated that they are not licensed to do business in Hong Kong.  This is interesting, because the local laws in Hong Kong do not forbid the use of smoke alarms in apartment units.  The fact that I was able to purchase this product from Amazon and ship it to HK implies that it is authorized to be sold there.  If it's not, then I suggest someone to update this Amazon listing to indicate so.The REAL problem is with the mobile app and website settings.  All Nest needs to do is to allow the user to choose \"Country Not Listed\".  I mean, it's just a CO\/smoke alarm with WiFi connection.  I don't see how it wouldn't function in other countries.  They totally ignored this suggestion.After some fiddling around, I was able to find a solution, which is to use postal code \"000000\" as default.

The physical install of the three hard-wired models was not very difficult as I'm am a technically-inclined person.  However the software setup took several tries, as did each interlink.  Once the three units were installed and connect via Wi-Fi I tested the alarm on each and it was as loud as any regular smoke detector.  The night time pathlight feature is pretty handy, as is the voice alerts.I tested the smoke sensitivity by overcooking something and it did indeed trigger as expected with a \"heads up\" vocal warning immediately prior.  However...the following is why I'm currently giving only a three star rating.During the vocal alert it is supposed to allow \"silencing\" of the Protect from the app.  When I attempted this it did not work on my phone (Moto X Pure Edition running Android 6.0).  I then tried on my wife's phone, which is identical, with the same result.  I did some reading on Nest's support site (which is actually quite thorough) and discovered that the Safety Checkup initiated from the app also uses the same Bluetooth Low Energy protocol.  So I tested this and it did not work either.  I then pulled out and older Motorola Droid Mini running Android 4.4. and both \"silencing\" and the Safety Checkup worked flawlessly.  So unfortunately for me this is most likely an issue with OS\/app versions.And also unfortunately the silencing feature was one of the main selling points for the purchase of these three Nest Protects.  And Nest support is currently working with me to troubleshoot the issue.  Once this feature is working on my phone along with my wife's I will change my rating.Overall I like the quality and solid feel, but I am less than satisfied with the app compatibility for now.

It turns out the install program crashes constantly on iOS. The only thing you can do is delete all Nest messages inside the app (seriously) and then it will only crash one in five times as opposed to 19 in 20 times. One installed detector refused to add itself to the network.

{"reviewTitle":"Slow to trigger alarm","reviewDescription":"Purchased a 2nd detector. Had a lot of trouble getting the sensor online and to appear in my existing account. I've gone through the steps multiple times and it failed repeatedly. Finally, it appeared in the account hours after it said it was successfully added. However, I just encountered a new issue today. Checked in on the status and it's showing to have been offline for three days despite the fact that it flashes green every night to reassure me to it's functioning correctly. I had no idea that it was offline as the app did not alert me.I'm also concerned about its ability to actually detect smoke early enough. I have a wood burning stove and needed reliable technology to alert me of trouble if I'm outside of the house and there's smoke (like leaking gasket). Unfortunately, when I lit a piece of cardboard and placed it right under the detector, it failed to sound an alarm 2 out of 3 times. Perhaps its magical algorithms need a couple of minutes to figure out what's going on, but then this is completely useless to me.Will see how it goes. If I see no improvement, may switch to z-wave entirely.--UPDATEAfter removing and adding it to the account few times the connectivity issue seems to have resolved itself. I'm not sure why that happened so I will attribute it to user error \/ network connectivity and up this review by one star.While I appreciate that Nest Protect is smart enough not to detect certain types of smoke that could trigger false alarms (cigarettes), it doesn't seem sensitive enough to detect a real issue fast enough for my use case, which doesn't seem all that out of the ordinary. As I mentioned, I have it directly on the ceiling above a wood burning stove. When I open the door, some smoke always escapes. So far, it hasn't triggered an alarm when that happens and I'd like it to. Perhaps the presence of smoke needs to fill a large area and stay longer for the detector to process it, but I fear that it would be too late by then. I'll keep experimenting to see if there is better placement for it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1449446400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Who would\u2019ve thought a smoke detector could be so much more?","reviewDescription":"So, my home is 20 years old, and none of ours old detectors had ever been replaced. When they started failing, I knew it was time to do something about it. I have been teaching in my local CERT class, and we had been discussing different kinds of smoke detectors, and I knew I needed something better than what I had. As I began my search, there were quite a few well-rated smoke detectors available.  However, these nest detectors kept being at the top or near the top of everyone\u2019s list. My home is not super fancy, but I like it to be nice. I set aside the money, and decided to give these a try. Honestly, that was the biggest deterrent using these. The cost was a hard pill to swallow, but after looking at all the different things that these detectors would and could do, I felt that nothing else would quite match. When they arrived, everything was packaged very nicely the directions were easy to follow and the app was easy to find. My teenage handyman son and I had no trouble initializing them with the app on my smartphone and getting them installed. The only downside that we came across was in giving each detector a location name. There were some already set up in the app and on the detectors, but not enough to easily label my modest home. You can add names, but when the detectors go off, they will talk to you and tell you where the trouble is located by that name. Names you add are not able to be spoken by the detector.  For example, we have one near my kitchen. Earlier last week we had some toast burn, and so when the detectors went off they announced there was smoke coming from the kitchen. If I had had to rename that detector it would not have been able to tell me where the smoke was. That was a little frustrating trying to name the different rooms in my home in a way that made sense to how we spoke of them and still fit with the vocabulary of the detectors. Now that everything is in there are some things I really love and some things that take some getting used to. I really love the light signal that lets me know that the detectors are checking themselves  each evening as all of the house lights go off. I also really like the communication that I have with my smart phone, remember that burnt toast? I was able to silence the alarm easily from my cell phone and we didn\u2019t have to put up with the screeching detectors or fan any of the smoke away from them. The night lights are nice too. But I have a couple of children who are light sleepers and so I\u2019ve had  had to turn off the night light in their room so that it wouldn\u2019t keep waking them up every time they or the dog moved. I love having CO2 detectors available and the ability to let those motion sensors work with a thermostat in the future to be able to learn how we use our home and adjust that thermostat accordingly. Altogether I am very pleased with our nest detectors, I think there are some possible improvements, but they are way beyond what I have had in the past.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1523923200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great Looking Smoke\/CO Detector... w\/One Caution","reviewDescription":"I just installed three of the wired versions to replace some Kidde Silhouette detectors that had reached their end of life.  The setup and installation were a breeze. I particularly liked the design of the mounting bracket, which provided a lot of screw hole combinations, and had soft padding up against the ceiling. After installation of the smoke detector, the bracket allowed the detector to be rotated to the desired angle, a thoughtful design.  I installed the Nest Protect brackets over our existing round junction boxes.  The one caution I have is the brackets themselves aren't very strong where the screws attach, so don't be overly aggressive about tightening the screws, as I \"punched through\" in one location, which wasn't a total loss since I just repositioned the bracket to another screw hole and tightened it \"snug,\" without excessive force.Yes, the Nest Detect smoke detectors are expensive, but the design of the app and the detectors are beautiful to look at, and painless to install.  If they work as well as they look and without false alarms, I'll be thrilled.Like other reviewers, the three Nest Protects I received all had different manufacturing dates: May 2022, Feb 2023, and May 2023.

We have a smoke detector, that constantly goes off whenever anyone uses the stove.  So, hearing how good this unit is at differentiating between cooking and actual smoke, had me very intrigued.It was harder to remove the old smoke detector, than it was to install the new one.  I have the 120V one, and it was almost as easy to install as changing a light bulb.  I know what I'm doing around this house, but the detailed instructions were so easy to follow, that anyone can do it.  Right down to the mounting plate, having a diagram showing you which way to install it on the wall or ceiling.The pairing with the app and my wifi, was as easy as anything else in my house using my wifi.  The unit comes with batteries included for once, and not crap ones, as a backup in case the power goes out.  You pair it to the app, before you mount it on the wall, using only the batteries.  Once paired,the unit runs a self test, just to make sure everything is functioning properly.After removing the old detector, mounting plate and power, I was ready to install the Nest.  I installed the new plug, mounting plate and Nest.  Took about 10 minutes to do the actual removal and install.  It's up and running with no issues or missteps.Only issue I would say is that both the unit and the app only tell you when the Nest is on battery power.  But it doesn't tell you when it's on house power. Which I think is odd.  Since, to connect the app to the Nest, you do this on battery power.  The unit actually announces that it's on battery power and you get a message in the app.  But after it was installed and hanging on the ceiling, I still had no idea if it was on battery or house power.  To test this, I unplugged the unit from power and was told, that it had lost power and is on battery power.  I then reconnected it to the power and nothing, no message or update to say that power has been restored.  The unit is just still on.  Checking the status on the app and it has check marks acrossNow, you may be asking, why did I not dock Nest for this issue?  Cause, it really is more a pet peeve or mine and perhaps not an issue for someone else.  I'm told the unit will run for years on batteries and it didn't cost me anything extra purchase the powered option over the battery only option.  So, I don't feel like I've been wronged or that the product isn't living up to expectations.  Just giving an honest review and feedback.Update - Looked at the Nest App today.

The device wants to connect to WiFi prior to installation; no big hassle -- then you need to turn off circuit breakers in order to install -- also understandable.  The problem lies with installation of additional Nest protects -- I was unable to pair with the original connected Nest unless the Wifi was on -- this meant turning on the circuit breaker; then turning it off again to install (can become a pain in a three story house with half a dozen alarms to set up).  Beyond this, the product ID\/Key is stuck on the back of the device (prior products also had a serial listed in the instruction manual).  This means that adding the device to your network requires it be disconnected to scan the code or serial number. The Nest app won't store the device unless it is successfully set up, meaning you can't add all the alarms to your app first, then install, flip the power on and pair; you have to pair, turn the power off, install, turn the power on, and pair for each device.

One for our downstairs living room area, one for the upstairs hallway and one for each bedroom.  Overall they are pretty nifty.  The light is a great feature and I am looking forward to getting a notification through the app that the batteries need to be replaced as opposed to the usual 3am chirp that leads you from one smoke detector to the other trying to figure out exactly which one you need to rip out of the wall. They appear to be well made and the set up of each unit was very simple.  Where I ran in to trouble was the installation and wiring of some of these in certain rooms.  I spent a couple of hours taking down the old detectors and wiring in the new ones and getting them all set up.  Upon installation of the last one I received a warning that this last unit was not receiving power.  So I removed the detector from the ceiling and upon inspecting the wiring job I had done I noticed that I had not made one of the connections properly.  I went downstairs and shut off the breaker and rewired this unit.  Once I thought I had the wiring done properly I reactivated the system.  Now I was getting a notification that the power was out to ALL of the upstairs units.  I also noticed that I had no power in two of the bedrooms and the hallway where the new detectors were installed.  So I began an online chat with support and they walked me through the process of deleting each of the units and reinstalling them.  This didn't work.  I pulled each of them down to inspect the wiring and they all appeared to be wired correctly.  I called my neighbor who happens to be an electrician and he came by to take a look.  He noted that the power wasn't working in the hallway and the bedrooms because it was likely that the wiring used to connect the smoke detectors was a part of the circuit that supplied power to these areas of the home and that there was likely a connection that hadn't been properly made.  He took each of the detectors down and noted that the wire nuts that came with the new detectors were too small and were not allowing all of the wires to maintain proper contact with each other to complete the circuit.  He replace them all with bigger wire nuts and everything everything fired up.  So if you have a lot of wiring running through your smoke detectors you might consider getting the larger wire nuts.  Otherwise you'll spend a lot of unnecessary time trying to figure out why things aren't working.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1488758400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Overall excellent, lack of interconnect with older systems seems shady.","reviewDescription":"I have purchased and installed two of these in the wired format. The first from Amazon for my house, and shortly after a second (from Home Depot) as a present for my sister's new house.I will actually start with the one thing that irks me about this system. The Nest protect is designed to interconnect with only Nest protects. At my house this is a non-issue as only the main hall smoke detector (and now CO) is wired. At my sisters however, the system is actually fully interconnected. So the only way to maintain interconnect would be to replace all 6 smoke detectors with nest systems. Frankly, since it is already set up to interconnect, the only reason for not allowing this to interconnect via wire appears to be to force you to buy more Nest devices instead of staying with standard detectors. For a safety device, that type of design and decision irks me much more so than were this any other type of device. For that alone it won't get 5 stars since it is a feature that comes on an 18 dollar smoke detector.The positives...and really there are a lot.Installation, the installation is about on par with any other wired detector. They do have a good design to allow you to align the detector so it is parallel\/perpendicular to walls\/ceilings. As someone who is a bit OCD I was worried that this non-round unit wouldn't line up well. Only big reminder is if you are wiring these yourself this is a real house circuit 110-120v, so you need to verify that the power is off before you start playing with the wires. The directions were clear enough to follow, it does want some steps such as the actual setup done before you install it so read those quick before you start.Setup: Before you install you have to set up and pair the device. I do not have any Nest devices in my home (Sorry Nest, Ecobee3 won) so this was my first time ever interacting with the app. If you can follow directions and know your wifi password you are good.Overall- So far I have, luckily, not had anything that would trigger the detector. The app has worked fine so far, I do like the nightlight feature (this is in a hallway) which provides enough light. If you woke up in the dead of night you could see in whole hallway with just the nightlight on this. I would say it is about half as bright as a standard home improvement store nightlight, but it is a nifty added feature.Last thought, if they were release a gen\/v 3 that included a wire interconnect I would buy that in a heartbeat for my sister's house.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1459555200000}

The head of the screws are often too thick and interferes with the tabs lining up with bases. I tried for an hour and could not get the NEST to fit properly. Two sides would engage, but the third wouldn't I used the NEST screws and using the groove was able to secure the base.

The path light and self test features work as advertised.I messed up on installing the base plate. I am not sure if it was Nest's fault or mine, but when I installed the plate, I did so in such a way that my Protect does not line up at right angles with the ceiling framing. My solution was just to leave it not fully rotated so that it looks good.The Protect is supposed to work along side of its older brother, the thermostat. It does in the sense that you can have it turn off certain devices if CO is detected and similarly with smoke. However, that is about the extent of the cooperation. One additional item that would have been nice is a notification via the thermostat that a test was performed after the test occurred and whether or not it was successful, and possibly if the detector's batteries were running low. As the batteries are fairly new, I'm not sure if it wouldn't do that, but since there are no other notifications I've seen on my thermostat regarding the Protect, I suspect not.The Protect allows you to specify times when you would prefer it to self test. However, the times are rigid and there's no way to specified allowed days. I would have preferred to specify certain times we are almost guaranteed to be away and blacklist times where we are almost guaranteed to be home.The history page on the Protect shows when everything is OK in the house, but it did not register test events (self-induced or manually induced). That would have been nice to see as a pinpoint during one of the green bars (which indicates no alarm). This is mainly related to the app and the website which technically aren't part of the Protect itself (they're part of the service), and could possibly be fixed later.It's probably the best smoke detector out there. There are some minor caveats and the issue of costing $100, but I will probably buy more of them to eventually fill the house with. The ability to find out whether or not you have a smoke or CO issue while away (and virtually anywhere in the world) is hard to pass up. The above issues are why it's not a 5 star (which I would regard as virtually perfect), but it is awfully close. If they close these gaps, then I would change it to a 5 star.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1447113600000}

In that respect they're brilliant; they're also far less likely to alarm under inappropriate circumstances (the \"steam\" configuration is a big win; likewise the \"heads up\" function that lets you know that the smoke from the woodstove or kitchen is starting to make some unit twitchy allows you to correct the condition before there's a bunch of screaming banshees going off all around the house).  The mobile app is also quite nice (if hopelessly undocumented) and provides the sort of functionality that you'd expect from a bunch of Internet connected devices.That's the good news.  The bad news is that the WiFi implementation on these things is busy speeding American into the 1990s, in that it operates *only* at 2.4GHz and only talks to systems that broadcast their SSID (the documentation [such as it is] claims that it works with hidden SSIDs but subsequently includes \"make sure your SSID is broadcast\" as part of the troubleshooting hints). These things interconnect via RF and during at least part of their lifetimes broadcast their own SSID, making them at least theoretically another attack surface; having been backed into having to turn up a 2.4GHz network to even configure these things I just stuck a firewall appliance between the 2.4GHz WAP and my edge router so that these things don't form a potential backdoor into my interior networks.The only other minor irritation I had was an apparent bug in the installation app:  while it's possible to associate any text you like as the room name for the Protect and have that delivered as part of the notification to your mobile device or desktop, the Protect itself has a limited collection of room names that it can voice; consequently during installation if one selects a \"custom\" room name it's also necessary to select one of the predefined room names so when these things start bellowing they can tell you where they think it hurts.  Makes perfect sense, but the mobile app ignored what was specified and did apparently random associations (I ended up with two master bedrooms and a basement I don't have).

I haven't started a fire or tried to poison myself with carbon monoxide to test them for real, but they seem to be happy and they're telling me that everything is OK.So why only 4 stars and not the full five? Here's why.The Nest Protects are only good for 10 years; after 10 years have passed, they cease functioning and will nag you repeatedly to be replaced (presumably with new Nest Protects). 10 years seems reasonable to me, except for one thing: The 10 year clock starts ticking the moment the Nest Protect is manufactured; not when you install and activate it in your home. I received and installed my four Nest Protects at the end of December, 2017. The manufacturing dates of the Nest Protects I received were: Aug, 2015, Sep 2015, Jul 2016, and Dec 2016.Instead of a combined 480 months (ie. 40 years) of functional life from my Nest Protects, for which I paid around $480, I am instead only getting about 395 months of life; a nearly 20% reduction on what I was expecting; or about $85 of my money up in smoke (ha ha) before I've even activated the first one. Since I lost 20% of my purchase before receiving it, I think it only fit that my review be reduced by 20%, or one star.It appears that different sellers are providing the Nest Protects to Amazon for delivery (I got mine from OneStop Gadgets), so the age of the Nest Protects you receive will vary. The manufacturing date is on the device itself, with no indication of said date on the packaging itself (unless the serial number means anything to you). You have to remove the plastic shrink-wrap and break the seal on the box to get to the date. I suppose I could have returned the (now opened) Nest Protects I received that were older than (say) a year and hoped for more recent replacements, but it didn't seem worth the hassle to me; you may decide otherwise. When my Nest Protects start nagging me to be replaced, I may decide otherwise myself.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1514592000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Night light is useful","reviewDescription":"The night light turns on when we got to bed, then goes dark. If we get up at night it turns on. This would be better for the hallways. We installed inside the bedroom, near the door. Sometimes it turns on if we move around too much in bed.I can't integrate this with Google Home or any other app, so it's a standalone, which makes it much less useful than my z-wave ones.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702944000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Sometimes its the device and not the user!!","reviewDescription":"First of all, got the device quick. During the install, the protect would not connect to WiFi. After multiple attempts, deleting of app and reinstalling, restarting phone and 3 reps later, I gave up. The support had me do everything and still no progress. Even sent me link of the steps I already went through. With the 3rd support person, I gave up and told them I am going to replace it and if the same issue arises, go back to the old school style.I requested replacement last night and it came in today. Installed it with out issues.Shipping and return were excellent but nest support could use work. Also not to excited about the google integration.  Trust issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1596067200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Oops! Big Surprise on Installation!","reviewDescription":"Good Grief!  I love the Nest products, but the backplate for the new, second generation is different from the original. The new one will not fit my old ceiling electrical box. I just got off a 30 minute call with Next, and the final result was, \"We can't help you!\"Come on Google. I've got a LOT of Google stock, so I root for the company. But this is disheartening.I'll figure out something, but you shouldn't necessarily expect the installation to be easy!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1639353600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good product, but overpriced","reviewDescription":"While, I want to say this is a great product (elegant and simple design) it's price makes it hard to justify. The setup was super easy, and it seems to work well. However, as someone where this is the only nest product and will be for a while, the $99 is hard to justify as it's more of an overpriced smoke\/carbon detector with WiFi. The nightlight feature is simply useless. As a standalone Nest product, it does little extra other than alert my phone. I was hoping the pathlight\/nightlight would be nice for my kids, but not bright at all. If this product was $50, I guarantee they'd more than quadruple their sales, because that's really about the true value of it. I'm sure it's a little better with the whole Ecosystem, but I still can't see justifying $99 for each and every detector in the home.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1457049600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Upgrading from Generation 1","reviewDescription":"I have a bunch of generation 1 Nest Protects. They all had an expiration date of December 2020, so when the Protect in the bedroom starting detecting non-existent smoke every few week, I figured it was about due. So I ordered a replacement, a generation 2. This morning, the old alarm started its alarm for no good reason thing, I figured I was doomed to a minute or two of boring labor popping out the old one, and hooking up the new. Little did I know that Google had completely upgraded both the mounting plate and the electrical connector, so instead I had the joy of spending about 45 minutes running back and forth between the ladder and the breaker box. Did I mention that the screws were too short?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1585872000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not what I expected for the battery version","reviewDescription":"I have a Nest thermostat and I love it. One of the issues with it was that it I have it mounted in the stairwell and it doesn't know I am home and will go to the away mode. So I bought the Protect primarily to be a presence sensor for my Nest as it is advertised but it doesn't really work. According to the searching on the Nest website, the battery version I have doesn't broadcast this information very often and one article said once a day. So when I walk under the Protect, the thermostat knows about it hours later??? I've already adjusted the thermostat by then.One good feature is the warning before the siren. We tested this out while cooking one day and it was nice to not have the shrill sound but a nice gentle voice saying \"there might be a fire\".","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1441670400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good product, challenging installation","reviewDescription":"Connecting Nest Protects to your home WiFi network can be a challenge. Some important technical  facts that Nest unfortunately doesn\u2019t tell you is that Protects only work on 2.4Ghz WiFi. Also, if you have an 802.11 WiFi network, be sure that your router has 802.11 b\/g\/n enabled. Until I realized those facts, I could not get my Protects connected to the Nest app. Afterwards, connection and installation went according to the documentation.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1650672000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Bracket size for wired detector doesn't fit all electric boxes","reviewDescription":"There are two common electric boxes that ceiling light fixtures use. 4 inch square and 4 inch octagon. The bracket that Nest makes only fits the octagon shaped boxes. I have a square shaped box. I have had to make considerable modifications to get my Nest protect mounted because of this oversight on Nest's design team. Be aware that if you plan to switch out an old wired smoke detector with this wired model, you can only easily do it if your electrical box is the right shape. Nest marketing makes no mention of this requirement. Considering I paid a premium price for what is considered a premium product, Nest should have an additional bracket that fits this other sized box.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"53 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1496361600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Next time I\u2019ll probably buy a different brand","reviewDescription":"This was an upgrade from the original alarm required , according to Nest, because smoke alarms have a lifespan of only 10 years. My old alarm was just 7 years old. Nest apparently can\u2019t count.For no apparent reason, they changed the hardware used to attach the unit to the ceiling - turning a very easy upgrade into a pain in the donkey (otherwise known as an ....).The most annoying thing is that if I\u2019m in the kitchen cooking and the alarm goose off in the living room, I can\u2019t turn off the alarm with the Nest app -it\u2019s necessary to go close to the VERY loud device and manually turn it off.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1608595200000}
{"reviewTitle":"This is extremely annoying when making breakfast and people","reviewDescription":"I would give it 5 stars except for one glaring problem.  When it detects what it decides is too much smoke (like when I burned a pancake on the stove), it goes off and will not shut off the alarm.  When you try to tell it to be quiet, it says \"this alarm cannot be silenced\" because, if you are close enough to push the button on the smoke detector, there's no way you can be trusted to know whether or not there is an emergency.  This is extremely annoying when making breakfast and people, especially young children are sleeping.  If you like losing control of your smoke detectors then this is the product for you.  Otherwise, I'd suggest going for something else.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1496707200000}
