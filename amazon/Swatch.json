{"reviewTitle":"Impressive piece of tech with almost zero real world purpose for the average person","reviewDescription":"I'm an Apple guy. I got this watch on a whim because it was on sale and I thought it'd be a nice companion to my new iPhone and Mac Studio. I waited a few weeks before writing a review because I felt like I might've just been \"missing something\" but I think I can now admit that this tech is just aggressively not for me and I'd bet it's not for the average person either.The first thing that really shocked me was that it doesn't feature that classic Apple \"it just works\" kind of software design literally at all. I'm sure it's obviously extremely challenging to pare down all of the \"features\" to the size of a watch face, and maybe the Apple Watch is the smart watch to do it the best so far, but even if that's true, that doesn't mean it's actually good. I felt like it wasn't remotely intuitive.Once I got my head wrapped around it though, it disappointed me with the lack of exciting apps available for the device. Sure, you can get text messages and download podcasts to it, but unless you're an avid runner who somehow doesn't already have a solution to this issue, in what real-world scenario are you not going to have your phone on you at literally all times? I supposed the fitness tracking stuff is interesting as well, but to get the most out of it you pretty much have to be wearing your watch for 24 hours a day. You could take it off overnight, but then you miss out on the sleep tracking. I get you have to charge it at some point, but I bring this up to say that some of the most-hyped features of the phone, by default, aren't as helpful as they could be because of this admittedly unsolvable technical limitation.This brings me to my most damning criticism, it's just plain not comfortable. I hate wearing it. Sure, it looks cool as a fashion statement, but out of the (admittedly, very few) watches I've worn in my life, this is the least comfortable by far.Unless you already have a VERY specific use-case for one of these and you know ahead of time exactly what you need it for, strongly consider saving your money. You won't be surprised by some magical super-cool applefied use-case like I was hoping to be. It sure looks cool as an accessory to your fits, but that's about it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692230400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Exercise Rings are impossible to close at times.","reviewDescription":"Watch looks nice and has a lot of cool features which are customizable.  I only have a couple of complaints.  It doesn't sync to my iPhone. I don't expect it to be exact, but is consistently off by a few thousand steps.  The biggest bugaboo is the Exercise Rings.  I could run on a treadmill and it sometimes closes only 4-5 rings after 30 minutes, and sometimes no rings close at all.  I have taken to restarting my watch before each workout, but that doesn't seem to work either.  I gave it a low overall rating due to it not being able to sync with my iPhone and most importantly, the exercise ring issue. For the money you pay, and with today's technology, you would think that Apple of all companies could figure that out.  I don't run with my arms to my side but I also don't run waving my arms around like Kermit the Frog to get the rings to move.  I guess the plus is that my OCD makes me want to close those rings, so now I average like 24,000 steps a day just to close the rings, lol.  I also constantly check my watch to see if the rings are closing, causing the battery to drain faster than normal.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1700611200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Upgrade From Fitbit Versa 2","reviewDescription":"As an owner of several Apple products (iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Air) I took advantage of the Prime Day sale on this watch at about a $100 savings. I was happy with my Fitbit Versa 2 as it is a less expensive and simple means of capturing your heart rate and steps in real time and can alert you to notifications received on your iPhone.The Apple watch is a bit more complicated and I found there is a learning curve associated with setting it up properly. It offers a great variety of watch faces that can be customized through setting the \u201ccomplications\u201d in the Watch app on your iPhone. By the way the term \u201ccomplications\u201d threw me off at first because it simply refers to the options you\u2019d like displayed on your watch face such as temperature, heart rate, moon phase and many more.One issue I was aware of before I purchased the watch is that there is no easy way to capture your \u201csteps\u201d on this watch. Fortunately You Tube is a great resource if you get stuck with something like this and I learned the third party app Pedometer ++ will resolve this issue to some extent and you can set it up as a \u201ccomplication\u201d as I did in the photo above. Unfortunately there seems to be a lag such that, unlike Fitbit\u2019s real time steps display, it may take a few minutes for the system to catch up. I like to see my heart rate when exercising but most of the \u201ccomplications\u201d display it with a heart symbol that you must touch to see your current rate. Another thing I noticed is on some watch face options the steps, for example, show up in a small font that is difficult to see with older eyes whereas others, such as in my photo, are displayed as a larger font. The band that came with the watch is a little small in that I have to use the last notch on the band. So, you might consider a larger band. I\u2019ve ordered a replacement on Amazon.Lastly, while the watch comes with a charging cord, unless you have a USB C base at home, you\u2019ll need to purchase one because, unlike my other devices this requires a much smaller socket on the plug base. Otherwise, I think I\u2019m going to like the watch as it integrates well with my iPhone.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"52 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689897600000}

Within a few weeks of getting the watch it got a large scratch down half of the face. I have no idea how it happened. I went to put it on one morning and the scratch was there.I contacted Amazon to see if they offered a warranty, but they referred me to Apple.Apple said that it was not covered under the warranty because it was considered \u201cwear & tear\u201d. It would cost $200+ to replace the face. Which is more that we paid for the watch when it was purchased on sale.I ended up buying an Otterbox protective face cover and am now try to prevent further damage.I\u2019m disappointed with the quality of the watch face based on the description, but I guess I should have assumed that it would need a cover.

This can easily add up really quick.Then I went to Fitbit. Very disappointed because it started to glitch and never turned on again. Had it only for a year.

{"reviewTitle":"A nice Watch, not much of an upgrade though","reviewDescription":"UPGRADES from Series 7:S8 Chip:  This is basically the same as the S7 chip, with a few new integrated sensors:--Temperature Sensors:  Measures wrist temp. only while sleeping, takes five days to build baseline.  Currently only used to help retroactively analyze ovulation cycles after two cycles.  Not predictive.--High G accelerometer and improved gyroscope:  Able to detect car crashes and call for help.  (Same feature available in iPhone 14)-Different Color options: (Currently no blue or green?)That\u2019s it.  Everything else is exactly the same as the Series 7.  The only way I can even tell them apart is by the color, otherwise they look the same.  The only benefits to upgrading to a Series 8 from a Series 7 would be the improved ovulation tracking features via nighttime wrist temperature, (though Apple warns that this is not necessarily predictive and should only be used to retroactively analyze your cycles after a couple months of use, and you would have to be wearing it at night often because this feature only uses sleep temp data), or the car-crash detection (but if you are going to get an iPhone 14, then this feature will be in your phone already).  So, if you are not interested in the ovulation data (or just don\u2019t want to wear the watch every night- because maybe you charge it at night), and you plan to get an iPhone 14, then there is no reason to upgrade to this Series 8 at all.  The series 8 does come with Watch OS 9 which has some new software features, but all Apple Watches Series 4 or later can upgrade to this same OS 9.  (So that is Series 4, 5, 6, and 7, and SE, all support upgrading to Watch OS 9)So basically, it is hard to recommend getting this Watch Series 8.  If you can live without the wrist temp ovulation analysis and car crash detection in the watch, then I would suggest sticking with Series 7.  Even Series 6 isn\u2019t that different in terms of performance, it and will still support Watch OS 9.  If you are buying your first Apple Watch, I would still suggest getting the less expensive Series 7.  Or you could also look into the new SE 2, which is about $150 less expensive than this Series 8, but lacks several other features like the Always-On-Display, ECG, blood oxygen and IP6X rating.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"447 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663372800000}

{"reviewTitle":"First Apple Watch","reviewDescription":"This is the first Apple Watch I\u2019ve owned. I had a FitBit Versa 2 before purchasing this watch and used that pretty much every day for the past 3 years. This watch is a MAJOR upgrade. I track workouts, monitor my heart-rate, send texts, even call sometimes from it. The customization options of the watch face is absolutely incredible. My current watch face shows my heart rate, the weather, and even battery top left, but there are so many different customizations to choose from. I even use Apple Pay on it almost every time I use it. It\u2019s incredibly easy to use and all of the different utilities of the watch are worth every penny. The sync between the watch and the standard iOS apps on the iPhone are seamless as well. Way better than my old Fitbit. I plan on having this watch as long as possible. BATTERY: compared to my Fitbit, the Apple Watch battery doesn\u2019t last nearly as long. However, this watch charges pretty darn quick. I put it on the charger when I shower in the morning and shower in the evening and that\u2019s enough to keep this watch charged. Overall - I\u2019d say the charge lasts around 24 hours if you\u2019re not tracking a workout and aren\u2019t checking too much. When I wake up at 5:30 AM, I put the fully charged watch on, work out for about an hour, and go about my day at work. I take it off around 9 PM and by this time, I\u2019m usually anywhere from 35-45% battery. SLEEP TRACKING: I\u2019ve used sleep tracking a few times but not every night. I\u2019m just not always comfortable sleeping with a watch on. But when I have used it, I\u2019ve really liked seeing my heart rate pattern and sleep cycles.

{"reviewTitle":"Best Watch for Health and Daily Life!","reviewDescription":"This is probably the most useful watch to own when it comes to health related tracking. It can track everything from your heart rate, exercise, standing time, distance, and sleep. As nice as that sounds I honestly barely use those functions. I imagine knowing this information probably help if I worried about my health personally, but what sold me on this watch is the other features. Here are a few I personally found incredibly useful.1. If you are a apple household and own several products and like me tend to lose them thru out the house, for example your iPhone. There is a nifty button on your touch screen that lets you buzz your phone and make it play a loud sound till you find it.2. Lets me track my wife and kids when they wander away and leave me all alone in target. I can either use my watch like a walkie-talkie and look like a weirdo spy in the store asking for help. Or I can see them on Find My iPhone (wife). (Requires setting up the family options)(Kinds creepy stalker option)3. I know when someone text messages me without looking at my phone. I can use siri to reply back by talking into my watch. Or ignore them like I usually do. . .4. I can pick out custom faces for my watch so I can use analog and impress absolutely no one. Or set it to digital military time and do math. Or best yet, pick one that shows me the weather which is really useful to understand why you are sweating in really bad places today and should probably find AC fast.5. The band that it comes with absolutely sucks but for about 1\/3 of the price of the watch you can go to apple and choose from a crap ton of options. I honestly think they are worth the price so you don't get wrist sweat running down your hand. I do also recommend hunting down a screen protector on Amazon for your watch as well to protect the face from accidental dings.6. It has an app for that. Yep it has soooo many apps that do all the things that it can be very overwhelming. But some are really useful, like if I am listening to Spotify while jogging (walking speed but wheezing for effort) I can swipe songs I don't like and turn up and down the volume without grabbing my iphone from my pocket. Yes it isn't far but I am dying and probably drop my phone if I tried while running.7. Okay now for a more serious note. For the older generations it has a really useful feature on the newer models that allows you to monitor your heart and detects when you fall. If you fall it shows a sos button on your watch you can press to get help. If you don't move or respond after a minute or two it just makes the call for you. For the heart monitor you can set up your high\/low BPM and have it track your heart and after awhile it can detect whether or not you have an irregular heart beat and warns you. It cannot track heart attacks but it can help you monitor your heart if you have any heart conditions so you can see a doctor. Please keep in mind that there is a lot of setup involved with these processes so if you are getting it as a gift for someone elderly or not very tech savvy. Please take the time to set it up and help them out. I found it somewhat easy just a bit time consuming.8. Lastly for the kids, it has a few features that I think are good to know for parents. The find my iPhone features shows you where they are even should they get separated from their iPhone as long as they have their watch on. If they should forget their iPhone and it gets too far from them the watch alerts them that they left it behind. It has a emergency call button (hold down the button under the crown *wheel thingy*) if they need 911 and sends out their current known location should the worst happen same as the iPhone. And lastly if someone plants the AirTag on them that isn't registered to them it alerts them that one is nearby.It does a lot more then what I listed but I think the review section would implode if I tried to list them all. These are just the ones I typically found useful. Like it also has a flash light feature and a spit water out the side after you wash your hands feature. If your curious to know more about the watch, apple does an amazing job on showing you all its features on their website so I would definitely visit it before you make the purchase. Also you can see all the wrist band options they sell so you can bling it out I guess.

And seeing how I converted from Android to IOS (a decision I\u2019m happy I made), I figured I would get an Apple Watch. I guess I was expecting a watch that was as good as the Samsung. Again, disappointed with the features offered on this watch. It\u2019s no better than the $25 watch it replaced. Other than the Mickey Mouse watch face. I love that one.To summarize:Quality of build = 5 starsIncluded watch faces = 2 starsIncluded apps = 2 starsBattery life = 1 starWould I buy it again?  No.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690502400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Replaced a Series 5 Apple Watch","reviewDescription":"I wanted to take advantage of the enhancements available on the Series 8 watch over the Series 5.  As I have COPD (a lung disorder) the ability to have quick access to the Blood\/Oxygen level was a definite attraction.  The fall detection and crash detection were also a consideration.  Well, the watch is accurate as it gets its time from GPS signals.  I thankfully haven't had an occasion to test the fall or crash detection yet but the Blood\/Oxygen reading is a complete joke for those of us who really need this statistic.  I have found that if the actual reading is low (anything below about 91%), I will inevitably get an \"Unsuccessful Measurement\" from the watch.  For people with advanced COPD, readings below this are quite common and need to be monitored.  Not only does it refuse to read low settings but the actual reading when it is available is way too high for medical tests.  The watch will inevitably read 2 to 5 percentage points above what the actual reading is on a calibrated SPO2 sensor.  When the watch shows a 92% oxygen saturation, you probably have an actual saturation level of 88 or 89% which is well below the safe margin.  Given the known results of that test, I actually have little faith in the watch's ability to detect a fall or crash.  Overall, I am disappointed in the watch as an enhancement over my Series 5 which I found to be very useful except for the short 18 hour battery life and the Series 8 didn't really improve on the requirement to charge the watch every night.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"41 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667260800000}

My big disappointment when ordering was about band size. I need a larger one, but there was confusion around the order and I ended up with a smaller one. While I could return the whole AW order, I didn't really want to do that. Now I'm using a new watch with an old band because I can't just swap bands and buying one identical to the one I have is a ridiculous price. So I'm stuck. I bought an aftermarket band, but it isn't what I truly want. To all of you ordering, be extra diligent when picking sizes. Yes, I should have returned it, but I didn't.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675555200000}

Sadly the first thing to go wrong - after a promise of a delivery date from Amazon Prime - the watch was 3 days late and not in time for his birthday.  We chose T-Mobile as our cellular provider and went in person to their store.  Just to find out that this particular watch was only WiFi enabled and NOT cellular enabled!  The watch cannot do what he wants to do --  talk and text.  The T-Mobile Customer Service Rep explained to me that this happens all the time and customers are very upset.  He said that the cellular enabled watch has a red button to indicate that it is cellular enabled.

She loves anything and everything apple, and I myself prefer other options.As for a review, I am comparing the Apple Watch 8 to my Garmin Venu 2.Many of the added and new features of Apple's newest watch, like SOS and biometrics monitoring, have been a staple in their competitors' products for a while now.Comparing the responsiveness of the Series 8 to the Venu 2 is quite a big leap, as the Series 8 has a faster chip and can perform many tasks, including video animations like Toy Story characters running around the screen with phenomenal clarity and resolution, which is one thing it does that my Garmin does not.Comparing the reliability, however, does show how Apple is lacking in the functionality of its watch. To start, the GPS signal in the Garmin is better than the Series 8 when out in the wilderness or anywhere where the signal may not be as great, whereas the Series 8 seems to lack a proper signal. As well as my Garmin has more accurate biometrics reading when comparing our vitals being monitored with a pulse oximetry device.Overall the build quality seems comparable to my Garmin, as both have been plunged into deep enough water, both in the ocean and in 10'  swimming pools. Neither has shown any water damage since. For impact damage, the Apple watch seems to be more resilient as my Venu 2 has a few dings here and there for it hitting desks, and normal wear and tear, yet the Apple Watch still looks as good as it did out of the box.Overall, the Apple Watch 8 is a great product for someone who likes to stay in the Apple ecosystem.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"243 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667001600000}

I\u2019m reluctantly using my iBook plug to charge the watch until i can get a new plug. This should be explained in the numerous description information and the photos. Yeah, it shows the cord- who would think it didn\u2019t come with the plug?I\u2019m thrilled also that Apple partnered up with Product Red so  that i could support a cause that I have a huge respect for- that of preventing HIV and AIDS. I had a family member die of AIDS and if the research and prevention happening now had happened in the early 90s then she might not have died from a tainted blood transfusion and could\u2019ve afforded the medication protocol. So for me- this watch is not only my favorite color, but also a purchase to support a cause I feel strongly about.

But because my battery still registers at 86%, the rule under my Apple Care is that I can't send it in for repair until the capacity reads 79%. Nice rule for Apple, bad rules for customers. That means I can't go out my house and expect my watch to last for the day. And can't send it in for repair until get worse!Apple Care's \"we'll fix it\" guarantee has conditions that don't favor the customer.  Wouldn't this all be easy if a battery replacement was simple and didn't take  three days to be sent into Apple? Wouldn't it be great if a Genius Bar appointment for 10 minutes meant that an Apple staff member could change the battery? Realize before you buy the watch that the battery will start to go on you in about 8 months.Wouldn't buy this watch again.  Their technology is great on the fancy features and not on the basics.

This error led me to question other statistical feedback. Third, if you use your iPhone for music in your car via bluetooth, the watch will interfere with that link resulting in oscillating on\/off playback. To correct this you have to turn off bluetooth on the watch.  Finally, the 2 week time to return the watch is too short since one doesn't discover many of the shortcomings until the 3rd or 4th week.

I also appreciate the fall detection, accident detection and emergency sos capabilities.Apple watch is probably the one electronic device I did not think I needed until I got one.

If you don\u2019t feel it then your only clue is a small red dot on the top center.-sleep isn\u2019t very accurate. It won\u2019t show me time spent in each sleep stage-I don\u2019t like the whole rings and such gif the activity app. But this is just me I think.Why Fitbit was better than Apple Watch:-sleep tracking was more in depth-heart rate was live 24\/7-battery life was much longer at 2-3 days-price was much more budget friendly-vibrate and loud enough for texts and reminded you if you didn\u2019t open the notification-I liked the clock face betterBoth calculated speed, distance and calories accurately as far as I can tell.Overall I liked my Apple Watch better than my Fitbit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"47 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692057600000}

Even when I am next door at the neighbors' house.However, I just don't understand why Apple couldn't do better with the battery life.  My Series 1 Watch from 2016 still works and gets 4 days before needing a charge.  My fitbit gets 4-5 days on a charge.  I upgraded to this I-Watch Series 8 and turned off the \"always on\" feature and I still have to charge it every 30 hours or so.It's a bit of an annoyance trying to find a convenient time during the day to keep this watch charged to record workouts and to use the sleep tracker at night.  And then to remember to put the watch back on.As far as fitness and sleep tracking, I still prefer the Fitbit.  It seems to be more accurate and I prefer the Fitbit App's interface for stats and info, especially for the sleep tracking.  So now I put the Watch on the charger every night before bed and I don't have to worry about it going dark in the middle of my workday.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693699200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great Apple product but for usual apple quirks.","reviewDescription":"Apple watch 8 is my first apple watch. As expected, it is a great product, very reliable, has great resolution and is fun to even look at. However, most people buy smart watches to track activity, and in that regard it\u2019s way behind even compared to much cheaper yet reliable watches like Garmin vivoactive tgat I owned. For eg. a regular activity tracking watch would have watch faces with compact display of several activities on the main screen and one doesn\u2019t need to do anything else for it, in an Apple Watch even for stuff as basic as a step count you either have to look on your health app in iPhone or you download a paid app like pedometer and use that as a \u2018complication\u2019 for a watch face, what that leads to is the dependence on a third party app which has its own reliability issues like it may not update the steps when you look at the watch face quickly. There are several such small quirks which are annoying but overall considering the number of features it has like fall and crash detection etc it remains a worthwhile purchase. And it looks great. I also wish that the provided strap was magnetic though one can easily but that from apple or from other inexpensive sellers. I also wish they had more apps supported like ring app for security etc.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691280000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Alice in Wonderland Meets The Apple Watch Band","reviewDescription":"It is a well-known fact that I'm not Alice, and this ain't Wonderland, but my new wrist band begs to differ. Let me unfold the story of my misadventures with a wrist band fit for the Mad Hatter himself.Upon opening the box, I was greeted with a wrist band that could easily find its place in a Barbie doll accessory kit. Yes, dear reader, it was that tiny!Believe me, I'm no Goliath, but this wrist band clearly was meant for the miniature world. I am certain that even my pet hamster, Sir Fluffington, would struggle with this fashion statement.I jumped in too fast and sync'd my phone before even trying it on - a rookie mistake fueled by caffeine, enthusiasm, and an overly zealous sense of faith in Apple and Amazon. Turns out, my watch now holds every iota of my personal information while snugly attached to a band that wouldn't fit a toddler.Now comes the real predicament: do I return it, risking my personal data, my sanity, and the peaceful coexistence of my coffee machine and me? Or do I keep it and use this wrist band as a constant reminder of my hasty decisions, and an unintentional toy for Sir Fluffington?One would think this mishap would warrant a single-star review. Still, I'm giving it three because the band may be doll-sized, but it sure is pretty. Plus, the hilarity of this episode has given me more laughs than any comedy special on Netflix recently.The silver lining? Next time I'll check the size chart more carefully and if I ever get invited to a tea party in Wonderland, I've got just the accessory to impress the Mad Hatter!Laughing at my own misfortune,Your Fellow Tiny Band Sufferer.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"209 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687996800000}

Make SURE you have the watch band positioned correctly when you put it together.  :)2. Try several of the different faces.  I fell in love with the photos face where I loaded it up with pictures that purposely bring me joy  Every time I tilt my watch to see the time, I'm greeted with one of my kids or my grandbaby or my cat and I smile 100 times a day.3. Sync it with your calendar and your Health app.4. It can be used as a remote for taking pictures with your phone and you can talk to Siri with it.5. It holds a charge for a couple days.6. The watch charger is NOT USB.  I recommend ordering a watch charger that has USB on it.  There are a few very affordable ones on here.

I combined a plastic snap on frame-style \u201ccase\u201d (no back) with soft plastic sticker style covers that come in a large pack so that you can replace as needed.  The only other negative so far is that accessories are prohibitively expensive.

{"reviewTitle":"Case Is A Piece Of Junk","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve had the watch for a day and a half and the paint on the face has already significantly scraped off, the durability of the case is an utter joke. Now I have a shiny new watch with chips in the paint that I now get to be irritated by every time I look at my watch. Functionality and upgrades are cool but the quality of the body of the watch is significantly compromised.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666051200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Terrible Wrist Band For Medical Professional","reviewDescription":"Two major complaints that made the person stop using it after they were gifted it:1. Why can I not start using the watch on it own without pairing to a phone\/account?2. (Deal Breaker) = The wrist band it came with is terrible for a medical professional working in fast paced hospital settings. Watch fell off twice before they deiced to stop wearing it altogether.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673568000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good Watch, Not Perfect","reviewDescription":"This is a good watch, not outstanding. I honestly believe it is over priced. It really needs a charge every day. It is a bit clunky and not the most user friendly smart watch I have had. Yes, it has great features but they are not that easy to use. That said, it does what it says it will do.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667606400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Battery less than 24 hours","reviewDescription":"If you leave face always on your battery will not last an entire day. Love the features but I have to charge twice daily because once daily takes to long to charge and won\u2019t last until next charge. Turn the always on feature off and you can charge once daily just expect to be without your watch a few hours.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666483200000}
