{"reviewTitle":"Xbox SeriesX =  amazing console, absolute BEAST and best value in gaming. Playstation convert.","reviewDescription":"I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.This new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.So how can't  you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.Yes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.PROS:- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).- Intuitive and very functional OS.- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.- FPS Boos feature for older games.- Automatic HDR for older games.- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.- More available space in internal drive then PS5.CONS:- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.SPECS:- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)- Graphics: AMD Navi\/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB\/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB\/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)- Die Size: 360.45 mm2- Process: 7nm Enhanced- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w\/ 320mb bus- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB\/s, 6GB @ 336 GB\/s- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD- I\/O Throughput: 2.4 GB\/s (Raw), 4.8 GB\/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mmFinally, I will recommend  this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.The Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.PRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.Great job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"227 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1614988800000}

Go Microsoft!","reviewDescription":"Step into the realm of gaming greatness with the Xbox Series X, the Hercules of consoles \u2013 muscular, powerful, and ready to elevate your gaming experience to celestial heights! Assembling this gaming marvel was simpler than beating level one of a classic arcade game. Unbox, plug in, power up, and voila!

The wallet might feel a bit lighter after acquiring this gaming beast.

{"reviewTitle":"From someone who owned a PS4 and Xbox One","reviewDescription":"I started out on the OG Xbox when I was 5 years old cause my dad bought it, he then bought the 360 and I loved that. When PS4 came out however I bought that cause the og Xbone was trash. After a 4 years or so however I had a spat with Sony customer support which if you have dealt with them ever it's awful. Pre-ordered a bunch of games, but then decided to stop gaming  in college (stupid decision), they wouldn't let me cancel despite then being pre-orders cause they're policy is trash. I disputed it, they banned account, I created a new one later on my roommate's PS5. Really liked horizon forbidden west not gonna lie. Nothing was actually seriously wrong with the PS4 itself, just Sony was. Xbox one x came out and I just had to buy it. My dad had the og Xbox one, and my word the continual updates to Xbox UI showed, it was fantastic. Then the game pass came out, if you are a playstation camper, let me just say this thing is actually amazing. I'd been falling out of love with gaming honestly, all the AAA games coming out had sucked recently. It felt that I couldn't have fun without spending a lot of money. One of the first games I played on the game pass was Control. Holy crap I missed out on this when it launched, and  I never would have discovered it if not for gamepass. I've discovered over 20+ games I never would have bought at full price and am loving it, it made me like gaming again truly.  When PS4 and XSX we're announced it felt like PS5 was the Xbox one at launch all over again. Trying take as much money as possible, and not being consumer friendly. Xbox smart delivery (no rebuying games) compared to Sony's pay $10-$20 for upgrade or buy the PS5 version for $60-70 all over again. Like come on, that's BS. All my saves are saved in cloud, I set up my XSX in 10 min, 7 of those was because it was updating. Only thing I had to do was download my games. Yeah launch titles sucked, but Xbox bought Bethesda so that doesnt matter anymore. All first party games are on the game pass day 1. I have not bought a single game since I bought control's XSX version (I could still play Xbox one version on game pass but I wanted to give Ray tracing a go, I had not purchased the Xbox one version though I should note, so this was my first time buying at a gp discount no less). It's fantastic, I'm getting equal or better value than PC (since new games are released on it as well). Everything is just so easy and simple on Xbox compared to PS5. It's like IOS vs the early days of Android (which I now own). Having experienced PS and Xbox, Xbox just has a much more stream lined experience. Also Xbox live crashes like maybe 1\/6th (honestly maybe less) of the amount of PSN, like good lord that was actually the most annoying thing ever. The PS5 itself just seems outdated, and Sony seems hostile to the consumer.  Honestly this is hands down the best console I have ever owned except maybe the 360 because that was gaming's last golden age imo with COD, halo, GOW, mass effect, too many to name. Overall a just superior product, I do hate Sony after my spat, I fully admit that, but objectively this console is just better. I see nothing but frustration on the PS5. I will miss Horizon, but that's it. So unless you absolutely need God of war or something, like what Halo is (was) to me, buy this. Hell buy this over a PC, I was debating it, but this year and probably next year as well is just bad for getting or building a gaming PC. Seriously buy this console if you are on the fence, if you are debating at all, buy this console. It's xbox's generation this time around, for value, ease of use, as a finished product, and #1...for games and gamers. I debated for weeks which console to buy last generation, but it was simple this time around and I have zero regrets. In the end for the same amount of money you will be able play 2-3x the game you would on PS5, you can play 360 and OG Xbox games as well, for free if you own them already. If you own a gaming PC though, you don't need it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"149 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1632268800000}

I don't want to spend $200 -$400 to install the games I frequently play on an expansion cards sold only by one supplier. You can only play XS games on internal or the Seagate card. As more of the games on my external hard drive update to XS they become useless as I have no room on the internal hard drive.  PS5 allows you to pick your own compatible ssd drive from various suppliers making them affordable. PS5 also allows you to pick ps5 or ps4 versions of the game allowing compatibility with what ever hard drive you have. Xbox forces you to update your game to XS if you are using the XS....thus making your game on external hard disk useless. Xbox please stop making dumb decisions and make the system as compatible and versatile as possible. With halo dead and gears of War dying Xbox needs to step things up. I left PS because the network WAS terrible always down, matchmaking at the time WAS none existent, then they got hacked, ruining all online play for half a year and my credit card info was sold on the black market. I remember when Xbox gold games was A list games not F or D list games, and you owned them.  I have not forgotten, but if you don't tighten up I'll leave you too. But other than my personal rant and no choice but to by high price memory, the system works. Pushes 120 frames and 4k with games that allows the settings.

I can't even remember the last game crash, but many \"next gen\" Xbox series X titles operate on medium preformance and crash routinely. This clunky, ugly (PS5 isn't anymore handsome mind you), dust trap spends more time playing 360 and Xbox One titles really, and even those have stability issues on this \"next gen\" hardware. Save your money for a mid range gaming PC (I just bought one for $600 and added another few hundred over the years and it plays all current titles fine), or buy a PS5.

That sure does make one nervous about what the darn thing is doing behind the scenes w\/ your network.  Then entering the PIN the Xbox presents into the app it count not find the \"Xbox\".  Fortunately, my being rather computer\/network savvy, I used the phone app to connect to the Xbox created network w\/ the PIN then could finish the connection and attach it to my network.  Now, somehow I apparently\/inadvertently changed some setting to disable \"Game Mode\" and cannot find anywhere obvious tho change it.

Navigating the console menus is terrible. The photo video editing software is awful as well.The first party games are lacking as well. I played Gears 5 on it. I loved Gears 1-3 but was immediately turned off by 5 as the first thing I saw when I launched the game were $20. The campaign was a good one time play through. I struggled to get through the open worlds a second time as they are empty, pointless and out right boring. I loved the linear chapters, I thought they were great. I quickly grew bored of the multiplayer as it hasn\u2019t changed since Gears 2 (I can\u2019t believe there is still sticky cover).I played Halo Infinite and the game is unfinished. They continue to add cosmetics instead of content like maps. I grew bored of the game after a month.I am looking forward to Fable and Hellblade 2, but remain skeptical because of Microsoft\u2019s heavy monetization practices. The focus seems to be on heavily monetizing first party games since they are available on GamePass. That is a huge turn off for the console.I do love some of the backwards compatible games, tbough most of the games I want remain unavailable.At this point, I haven\u2019t touched the console in a few months as the GamePass games have been uninteresting for me personally. I can\u2019t believe Halo, the launch title for this console, was unfinished and a massive disappointment. I just can\u2019t wait for some great first party games, hopefully sooner rather than later and with no heavy monetization.

{"reviewTitle":"Awfully designed OS, bad optimization, no freedom, no games","reviewDescription":"So, I bought an Xbox Series X. I already owned a PS5 before this, but I was curious to see what was available on Xbox and wanted to check out Game Pass, so I was also able to get a Game Pass trial with my purchase.The first thing I noticed was that the Xbox controller looked pretty nice, but that feeling only lasted until I actually used it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever used another controller that was so loud in my life. That dpad is criminally loud, it sounds like an old typewriter, which poses a major problem if you play fighting games at all or mostly play at night. The noise is distractingly loud even during the day, but at night you can hear every button being pressed, especially the awful dpad. In comparison, the PS5 controller makes no sound, while also having buttons that are more responsive and sensitive to the touch. I need to press the Xbox controller buttons harder for the Xbox to read the input.Another thing I noticed is that the Xbox doesn\u2019t even come with a USB cable for the controller, and instead brings batteries, which means that the Xbox controller does not have a rechargeable battery built into the controller the way PS5 does. Do they really expect everyone to be changing batteries over and over? The only other option is to buy a USB cable and play with the controller wired, which feels extremely outdated in the case of Xbox because anything that involves using a cable in 2024 should have a rechargeable battery like the PS5 does.Additionally, I noticed is that the Xbox Series X fans keep running if you turn off the console the \u201cwrong\u201d way. I kept wondering why these fans were still spinning long after I turned off the console, and I literally had to Google this problem and find that you actually need to go into system settings and select \u201cshut off completely\u201d to actually shut the Xbox off. Holding the Xbox button on the controller and selecting shut off from there actually just puts it into rest mode, so why isn\u2019t that option called rest mode then? Really stupid of them, honestly. On PS5, shut off means shut off, and rest mode means rest mode, period.Also, I don\u2019t like how exposed the top of the Xbox Series X is. All those holes spells disaster for the console unless you place some kind of cover on it when it\u2019s not in use, otherwise anything can just fall in there by accident, whether it be dust buildup or any small object really such as a screw, and if the latter happens I feel sorry for you because that\u2019s where the fan is, and now you have to open the console just because something fell in there. That\u2019s a huge design flaw, in my opinion.Additionally, is it not possible to take screenshots on the OS? Pressing the share button to take a screenshot prompts a notice to pop up saying, \u201cFor this, start a game, then you can capture game clips and screenshots.\u201d So, if I wanted to take a screenshot of something on the OS, such as something in the Microsoft Store, or literally anything other than a video game, I can\u2019t do that?On PS5, you can take screenshots of anything on the OS, except for when you\u2019re streaming a movie of course due to piracy concerns. You are far more limited on Xbox in this regard.Another big problem regarding screenshots on Xbox is that they automatically disappear from your capture gallery, which Microsoft doesn\u2019t tell you this and you find out the hard way when you see that they randomly disappeared from your library.In settings, they give you the option to automatically share your screenshots to the Xbox Live Network, for others to see and engage with. If you shut this off, what\u2019s left is that the screenshots are only saved to your internal storage, which knowing this, you would think they have no way of disappearing, right? They\u2019re YOUR screenshots, so why would they, right? WRONG. They disappear because you are limited to store only a certain amount before the \u201colder\u201d ones begin to be replaced with the newer ones. This is unbelievably pathetic when you consider that on PS5 and even PS4, your capture gallery is infinite as long as you have the space for it, and they will never disappear until you CHOOSE to delete them. I have screenshots saved to my PS5 that I took years ago, meanwhile on Xbox they just disappear without warning. What the kind of garbage OS is this?Another really odd thing on Xbox Series X is that you can\u2019t disable HDR from screenshots? It is automatically applied to them even if you literally shut off HDR from video settings. I don\u2019t play any games in HDR because I honestly think most games look worse with it on, and it\u2019s rare to see a game that actually implements it well. I also don\u2019t really see the appeal when it just looks like you auto enhanced a picture with contrast to make the black colors look blacker, which makes the other colors \u201cpop\u201d and that\u2019s it. I shut it off just like I do on PS5, and yet for some reason on Xbox, the screenshots look much darker and it\u2019s because HDR is being applied to them. Why? To trick people into thinking Xbox games look better based on screenshots? That is hilariously pathetic on Microsoft\u2019s part because I see no other reason why they did this and never fixed it and it doesn\u2019t actually make them look good at all.I also noticed that even with the extremely limited gallery functionality on Xbox, it also lags like crazy and acts up when you\u2019re viewing your captures. I think Xbox OS tries to do so much that I\u2019m convinced Microsoft thinks an Xbox should function just like Windows, which is also why their games tend to run worse and so many devs find it easier to optimize a PS5 game. The OS on PS5 is far simpler and to the point, which helps devs focus on what actually matters, which is the games, not the endless ads and worthless ecosystem features that are hogging up all the memory, which for Xbox is a very bad thing because the ram on Xbox Series X is split between games and OS. Quick Resume being forced to always be running is a fine example of a feature that cannot be shut off and automatically enables itself the moment you start any game app, and Digital Foundry themselves proved it causes system stutter that affects game performance and often disables 120hz functionality.All in all, some rather perplexing issues on Xbox for me. Bad design choices and oversights that years later were never addressed. This console feels very outdated to me compared to the freedom I get on PS5. I honestly think Xbox Series X is the worst console I\u2019ve ever used, and it barely has any games either, so I\u2019m not sure what Xbox players are even playing these days. I literally have Game Pass and couldn\u2019t find anything worthwhile that I hadn\u2019t already played on PS5 and Switch.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1720396800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Whatever happened to value for the money?  And no more nag upsell garbage?","reviewDescription":"Ok, so the first gaming system I ever bought new was an Atari 2600 - so I'm definitely dating myself.  Beyond that I didn't go in for the continual upgrades and updates and all the constant upsell.  I finally did break down and buy a Wii decades later and that was fun until they shut down the entire multiplayer network and basically bricked the things to sell new games.  Fast forward to 2022 and this fails at every level for delivering satisfaction and fun without the constant annoyance of money grubbing.  First of all, include 2 controllers.  It's multiplayer and you ought to make it so out of the box.  Having to go buy an additional controller just to play it new out of the box with the girlfriend was an absolute annoyance.  Second - RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!!!!  OMF....F....G!!!!!  Include rechargeable batteries and stop destroying the environment.  This is a simple no brainer.  Include a charging pad of some sort or even USB cables and 2 rechargeable controllers.  2 days in and the batteries died.  I'm shocked in the quality and power management.  I can use my phone constantly for days on end now and a few hours play kills a set of new batteries at $3 per pair and instead I had to go spend extra on rechargeable.Biggest gripe - NONE OF THE FREE GAMES ARE FREE!!!!!  Most are demo, limited, locked down!  The advertising says hundreds of free games!  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!  YOU MUST PAY MORE TO UNLOCK THE REST OF THE GAME!!!!  What the heck kind of scam is this?  I'm seriously thinking about just returning the whole damn thing and saying screw it.  I mean there's 49 selections for Grand Theft Auto and you must constantly buy new feature packs and updates, or even worse you must subscribe?  Heck, when I was a kid, you bought an Atari console and it came with a couple games.  If you wanted an extra game, you went and bought it.  There were no maintenance fees, updates, add-on packs that you could buy to get an unfair advantage!!!  What has this crapola come to?The game play and controller is like every other latest tech.  Buzzwords and features galore, but it is all predicated on screwing you for more money at every step.  CONSTANT IN GAME UPSELL!!!  PLAY A NEW FEATURE!!!  BUT WAIT, IT'S $9.99 TO PLAY IT!!!!

I attempted swapping cables, changing TVs, and performing factory resets. In the end the issue would not go away.I decided to see if I could get a replacement through Amazon. Unfortunately they are currently out of stock. So the only option they provided was a refund or gift card.So I decided to give Microsoft support a shot, hoping that I could send it in for repair and get a replacement. This is where my journey of jumping hoops began.Microsoft only option for phone support is to fill out a form to have them call you, which is fine most of the time. After completing the form I was told I would receive a call in 90 minutes. 3 hours later I receive a call that the queue is full and my request was canceled. I would need to try again the next day.Next morning at 7am I refill out the form and receive a call from a human 2 minutes later. Woohoo! I explain my issues and the steps I took to trouble shoot. The service agent sets up a service request and says that I'll receive an email with what to do next.After hanging up and waiting a bit of time I receive the email and my shipping address is completely wrong from what I had told him on the phone....... So I hop online and resubmit the form to be called and I'm told it will be a 90 minute wait this time. 3 hours later I receive a call from a rep. I explain the mistake that was made on my address and he says that he needs to put me on hold so that he can escalate the issue. After being put on hold for 30 minutes  I abruptly get hung up on.After waiting to see if I would get a call back with no success I resubmit a request to be called online again. 4 hours later I get a call that the queue is full and my request has been canceled. I will need to try again tomorrow. I've owned every Xbox console that's been release and I would consider myself a bit of a fan boy.

The dash is exactly as it is on the XB One so you immediately get the impression of no upgrade to \"Next gen\". Absolute failure on Micros part. Pure laziness.

Games \"Enhanced for XB X\" show zero difference at all whatsoever so Micro must use a different dictionary defining \"enhanced\". I don't follow PS5 so I don't know or care what they have but the games on this X are pretty pathetic. The current gen of gamers must be so easily amused or enjoy the same games over and over  since they all look like repeats of last gen. Nothing new, nothing appealing. Gamepass is just as bad. Maybe nobody makes \"new\" games anymore. The games \"on sale\" on gamepass are ALWAYS the same garbage. The controller felt weird in my hands as I hated the texture they put on it. It felt like sand. Glad the original Xbox One S controller worked on it. Oh yeah, they added a new animation when you turn it on (woopty doo) then it takes you to the exact same dash. So nothing new. If Micro had actually put some time into overhauling the dash instead of being lazy and keeping the old one it may have been better but other wise it feels the same as XB One.

Little did I know this would be one of the purchases in my list of \"I wish I had done more research\". To start off, I live in a semi-rural area, where I don\u2019t have the best internet. Why am I saying that I live in a rural area? Because every time I buy a physical copy of a game and put a disk in, I have to most of the time wait a whole day (or longer) to play the game I just bought because the Xbox, before you are able to play the game, requires a download to \u201coptimize\u201d the game for series X. I know the gimmick of this console is quick resume and some optimization for older games, but until after I bought it I had no knowledge whatsoever that I had to do this stupid download even for new titles. The most infuriating part is if a new game is available for Xbox Series X, the marketing team will most of the time still cater toward Series S\/the Xbox one, and even if it says Xbox Series X on the game case, I still have to do a long download. I can sympathize an optimization of a newer game that wasn\u2019t originally made for the Xbox Series X, solely to allow the game to access quick resume, but for psychical games that literally have \u201cMade for Xbox Series X\u201d on the game case, it makes absolute no sense I still have to do a long download to be able to play. I personally like collecting digital copies since there\u2019s a charm to it, but for the Xbox Series X, it\u2019s 100% better just to buy from the Microsoft store on the console. Regardless of the downloads there\u2019s still a lot of good to come out of this console. The Xbox controller for the Series X is the perfect size, and is very responsive to imputs. Even though I hate doing the optimization downloads, I still enjoy the small graphical upgrades the Xbox Series X does to enhance the visuals of old games, and especially the relatively new ones too. While playing games on the console, the games ( at least to my eyes ) consistently run 60 fps and paired with my 4K HD TV, the games look stunning. In the end, there is some gripes I have with the console, since no console is perfect, but to be able to play some of my older games with more stable fps, a good controller, and new, visually stunning games, I am quite satisfied with the console.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1650240000000}

Setup was seamless, game sharing wasn\u2019t effected once I got my cousin\u2019s account on as his home Xbox and I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to use my mixamp tr because there\u2019s no optical audio output but thankfully it only needs to be set up through USB \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 which I honestly think it sounds better than my Xbox One. I\u2019ve been playing Hogwarts Legacy since it came out on Xbox one and I can\u2019t believe how much smoother and faster the series S\/X version is. My cousin whom I file share with ended up going to target and buying one (he has a day 1 Xbox One) himself after hearing me talk about how great it actually is. I usually feel like I\u2019m going to regret such large unnecessary purchases but not with this, I\u2019ve already fallen in love with this console after 12 hours of use. Everyone I know has a PS5 now and I wanted to be different, plus I\u2019ve been an Xbox gamer since I switched from the PS3 to the Xbox 360 (I despise PlayStation controllers, they cramp my hands 30 mins in). If you love Xbox and are still on the fence and have the disposable income, just pull the trigger already and I bet you won\u2019t regret it \ud83d\ude1c","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"36 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1685059200000}

Customer service let me down.It is a series x...so yeah if you want one and can get this in stock it will save you a lot of $. Overall the console is very clunky and runs awful compared to my PS5 but hopefully they'll remedy it with some UI and software updates. Disappointing when you pay so much for something which lags opening up its side menu and is plagued by awful software and UI. The potential is there but it is not well executed. A $700 console should not freeze and crash opening the side menu...or randomly boot you from games. Sheer laziness on Microsoft for using the same exact UI as the Xbox one. Controller sucks compared to the PS5s dualsense but has been slightly revamped over last gen, but nothing to celebrate really still feels cheap and they ask a premium price for it .","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"Canada","date":1647129600000}

There are new bugs to contend with like the controller just disconnecting itself completely from the Xbox, and some apps no longer work well. There are some screen popping and HDR issues on certain TVs as well. And they've killed the Kinect entirely.

{"reviewTitle":"Fast, quiet, powerful! What more can you ask for? Better design maybe. Best console ever made?","reviewDescription":"Excellent is the best word to describe this xbox series x. I been a gamer since the 1980s and this is by far the best console ever created. Lets take a look at some pros and cons and also why I think its better then ps5.ProsIts fast! When I say fast I really mean FAST. Loads games in 5 seconds flat, menu system is snappy etc.It's powerful! The few games available to try right now that are optimized for the series x look very good and you can tell the future will bring alot of good high end graphics to consoles finally!Great selection of games thru game pass. And its backwards compatible with all Xbox games from previous consoles.ConsSo far there's only 2.1. I think they could of did better with the controller.  Although I still believe xbox controller is better then the competition in layout and thumb sticks etc. the plastic just feels cheap. The better grip and dpad is nice but the overall feel is cheap. Theres a small lip at the top that gives it a unfinished feeling. Also no rechargeable battery is a bummer as well.. Ps5 controller just looks way better and more of a future look to it.2. The system is bulky and looks like a fridge or just a big black box. The insides alot of work went into to develop a closed system with good cooling and a monster fan which is quiet and I appreciate that but the design is not good.Ps5 design is definitely better.Now why do I feel the series x is better then ps5. It all comes down to a few things.1. It's a bit more powerful2. Better online game library with gamepass.3. Better mobile play options with being able to play straight on your mobile phone or laptop or pc gives the xbox an advantage.If you always been a Playstation guy and all your friends are on there I can see sticking with ps5. But if you don't care about friends and want a bit better experience with ability to play your games even on the go then xbox is the moveI know this is a long review but I feel microsoft deserved it since they did a hell of a job with this system and I highly recommend it to anyone.If your a gamer and thinking of switching from pc to a new console then this would be the one I recommend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1605312000000}

I am a real human and gamer and actually play this console for it's intended purpose.Second, as a near daily gamer with over 400,000 gamerscore, who has been playing Xbox since 2007, this console definitely is the culminating event... thus far. Games are played smoothly with the best 4K graphics.This replaces my Xbox One X.Improvements:-The console is more quiet than my ceiling fan, so I can't even hear it.-It's cool. It vents heat well to maintain CPU peak efficiency. (Update 1 Jul 2023, the console does kick out quite a bit of heat.)-Load screen time was cut by more than half. I usually load into a game before all my Co-op partners, even the host.-Lag is no longer a problem, unless it's internet related.-Set-up is extremely easy as the contents are only the console, 2 cords & a controller.The full price tag ($499.99) was currently well worth it for anyone who games regularly on Xbox. I considered the Xbox Series S, but that idea was quickly shot down because the hardware is much less powerful and it doesn't play a physical disc. I like my physical copies still (even though discs are nothing but verification of permission to play the current version of the game, the actual games isn't on the discs anymore).I checked online for a new Xbox Series X from several retailers 5x a week for a year and a half before Amazon came through. I simply ordered it and it arrived on my doorstep. Never left the house to claim a ticket or stand in line.Lastly, thank you Amazon for selling the stand-alone console and avoiding the greed of making it an $800 bundle of other junk we don't need.Gamertag: E vee dub","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1650240000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great game console","reviewDescription":"I bought this to replace my 10 year old first generation Xbox One, and the difference in speed and frame rate are immediately noticeable. Loading times from my T7 SSD take seconds to finish versus the old console.Plus, there\u2019s no bizarre loading latency during gameplay:For example, freezing cutscenes with out of sync audio, & occasional pauses for the old console to load more of the game off the SSD.The Series X with newer hardware & USB Super Speed 3.1 fixed these problems.My one issue with this new Xbox is that they did away with the HDMI-in port that allowed me to watch cable\/satellite TV through the console. Not a problem with the console in regards to what it has to offer, but more of a loss of convenience.Some final notes I feel worth mentioning:\u2022When it came to connecting up the console, it\u2019s a breeze.\u2022 There are fewer USB ports versus the old console.\u2022When you power up the console for the first time, you are required to get the Xbox App for IOS\/Android and have an internet connection to start the process of getting the console running.\u2022Games made specifically for the Series X\/S must be installed in the internal storage to run. Xbox One games run fine on a decent SSD, like my T7.\u2022On a final note, despite the rectangular box shape, it\u2019s surprisingly small, quite light in weight, and very quiet.Overall it is a great game console and it delivers exactly what it promises.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675641600000}

I really enjoy how smooth everything is even in older unoptimized games. The amount of time i save not sitting waiting for a game to load is just crazy. Performance is fantastic, no lag to speak of, games load fast, graphic detail is awesome, love love love this xbox.One downside though is I play with friends that don\u2019t have an X and if I want to play with them on the same game, some of the games, require you to play the non-optimized version. This makes me sad. I dont know that this is an xbox problem or just that of certain publishers.Only glitch Ive had is the xbox \u201cforgetting\u201d how to sign in. A reboot fixes that so far.

Like maybe a second.The controller is a joke the layout is fine but the response is ludicrous having to jam buttons just to get it to respond unfortunately that is no where good enough for any online play.Not sure if it is just the one I received or this is a known issue. My 1x controller is fantastic with one of the best response times I have ever had.My 1x cost about the same as the series x so it is a small upgrade VERY SMALL.Do I recommend it sure if u have the money and u like xbox why not.But if u have a 1x and are looking to \"upgrade\" I'm not sure this is for u. I despise sony but the ps5 is faster I think it does not seem as if it's quite as bogged down with down load issues.I have a gigabit fiber internet. The fastest I have ever gotten on my 1x is about 230mbps and dl a new game was well a joke. With the series x dl will start at around 500mbps and then I can watch as it counts down to about 120mbps if I run an internet speed test through the series x it says my speed is around 920 to 940 then I can go back to dl screen and see the speed bumps back up around 500mbps only to watch it drop back to about 150mbps or so. This is a known issue with Microsoft xbox and has been for years and years. It's been documented all over the internet just look it up.So again it's not bad if u have the money and in need of an xbox then get it. The graphics are nice but it feels like there are few games actually made for series x just a lot of upgraded one x games.Not sure what happened of the last 5 or 6 years but Microsoft has definitely dropped the ball on that one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1662681600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Fantastic Evolution of the Xbox Ecosystem","reviewDescription":"This is a fantastic console, runs great and is whisper quiet. I wouldn't be the first to admit there aren't a ton of games that fully leverage the Series X's horsepower at launch, but I'm sure that'll improve over time, just as it will for the PS5.Availability is a serious problem, and Amazon is not helping by selling to scalpers and allowing scalpers to resell consoles on their platform at insane markups.Pros-- 4K120 support. Not many games leverage this yet, but games that do look outstanding.- SSD - Any games placed on the internal SSD load at PC (or very close to PC) speeds, which is incredible. Once the SSD is full, games can be stored (but not ran) from external storage. Transfers usually don't take long between external drives and the SSD, but your mileage may vary depending on the kind of external drive you have.- Compatibility - The Series X is fully backwards compatible with any Xbox one game (besides Kinect), and works with a pretty large selection of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games. Just about any accessory that worked with Xbox One will also work with Series X, no need to buy all new headsets, controllers, or much of anything.- Looks\/Aesthetic - The Series X blends in super well into an entertainment center. Mine sits right at the center of the entertainment center and doesn't look all too different from something like a home theater receiver- Temps\/Noise - The series X runs super quiet and has no issues with thermals. The only suggestion that I would have is don't put it in an enclosed cabinet. It intakes through the bottom of the backside of the console and outputs heat through the top, so that needs to have at least a few inches of clearance and space to intake ambient air. My entertainment center has an open front and back, and the Series X has no issues in there.Cons-- Availability - this is a little bit Microsoft, a little bit Amazon and a lot of bit scalpers (\"resellers\"). Please don't buy this console for more than the $499 MSRP, it encourages scalpers to snap up more supply just so they can make a buck. Supply will catch up, but it's going to take time especially given the state of the supply chain right now.- Wireless Headsets\/Accessories - I'm absolutely flabbergasted that Microsoft STILL hasn't figured out how to enable any USB\/wireless headset to just WORK when plugged into the series X, or allow for bluetooth pairing with the console. Instead, Xbox still relies on a proprietary wireless standard or the ridiculous port on their controller for the use of any headset that isn't a generic 3.5mm one. PlayStation and PC BOTH support this easily, plug-and-play and have for years. There's no excuse at this point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1614729600000}

It isn't a random feeling someone gets like when walking down the candy section. It's and upgraded xbox one, just like that was an upgraded Xbox 360, just like that was an upgraded Xbox. No difference than how Sony made the playstation, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5.Now I will say, opening this up and turning it on WILL NOT feel like it did when you opened any of the following: NES, SNES, N64, GAMECUBE (defiantly won't feel like that), OG Xbox, or the PS2. They hit different but equally, except the GameCube that thing was just a touch better. If you were lucky enough to turn these on back in the day then this Xbox will be like turning the microwave on to heat up pizza rolls. The sound of it starting and humming doesn't fill you with the antici............................pation like other systems have.Now I'm not saying that the Xbox is dull or not worth it, the ps3-5 are just as blah. None of the systems lately have had that startup experience like the ones I mentioned. Yeah for me the NES was something new to the world and it was because I was so young that it impacted me like it did but the SNES was pretty special. the N64 held its head above water just, but the GameCube was something entirely different with the PS2 right there on its heels. The og Xbox was about like the N64, it wasn't bad but it didn't get to you like other systems did.Yes I'm old, my nes has been with me since I was 5 and I didn't limit myself to a brand. I still have my Sega master system and other Nintendo\/Sega systems along with every Xbox and PS system. I've even got a Panasonic 3do..... but anyway.Like I said, this review won't get you down off the fence.

{"reviewTitle":"visibly faster all around than my XOX","reviewDescription":"I bought this new console specifically for starfield. pretty sure my XOX was not going to run it. but I play a ton of Xbox games anyway so I didn't mind. it was well worth the cost. The NVMe SSD is phenomenally fast. I want to get another for the external expansion plug. I have a 500 GB SSD and a 5TB game drive plugged into the USB 3s. but the quick start is really awesome so I would like to have another stick for increased room there. some games need to be restarted every so often. Cyberpunk crashes if you use quick start too many times on it. it's an unstable game after running for 20 to 30 hours without a restart. That's fair. I'm not super picky about that because I get a lot of enjoyment out of the game.what I don't understand, Microsoft, is why Seagate is the only supplier of the NVMe expansion cards, and why they are all out of stock!and another thing, an NVMe for my PC is about $50. why are the expansions for this console $150? why don't you have one yourself, instead of only supplied by Seagate?but that complaint belongs on that other product, not the XSX. although this is a good place to bring it up as well.this console is noticeably faster than my XOX. you might say that's obvious but the OS \/ dashboard is remarkably faster. I had to run something on the XOX to transfer games over and was surprised at how sluggish it is. I had just gotten used to that and didn't know that it could be so much faster. and it is on the XSX! it is so much faster!I was happy to see when this popped up in stock for the first time in years, literally. I grabbed it immediately because starfield was coming out and I was going to do my best to get it to run on the XOX but was skeptical. so, grabbing this was a no-brainer. I'm happy that I got it for $500 and that I waited for supplies to resume.it's a surprisingly heavy black box! noticeably heavier than an Xbox One or XOS or XOX, and I owned all of them. what in the world is in that little box that makes it so heavy? it feels like there's a pound of gold inside. it must be a very heavy dense heat sink because I can't imagine silicone and plastic weighing so much. motherboards definitely don't weigh very much. The 4K Blu-ray doesn't wait that much. The power supply? yeah, probably, that might be integrated with the heat sink. not a complaint but just interesting.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"44 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693353600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Starfield Awaits","reviewDescription":"First, I'll start with my cons: Amazon's waitlist. I've been holding out to purchase an Xbox Series console until I weighed out what works best for me. When I finally decided on the Series X, I knew it might be difficult to get. I clicked the waitlist or whatever button to be deemed worthy of purchasing a Series X and waited. And waited. 4 weeks went by, nothing. 6 weeks went by, nothing. I randomly checked one evening to see if anything had changed and what do you know? Amazon showed it as In Stock! No text, no email, no notification from Amazon. I hurried home to check from a computer in case my eyes\/phone had been deceiving me and they did not. So I ordered it right then and there.With that out of the way... The XSX really is just an upgrade in almost every way possible. Love that backwards compatibility is always on the checklist for Xbox. Love that the UI is the same no matter what platform I access it from (Xbox One, Android App, XSX, PC app). Love that once I power it on, sign in, I am ready to go.While I don't have any true \"next gen\" games (ahem, Starfield...), the games I do play were met with improved fidelity and 60 fps. That alone was a game changer for Fallout 76... and the 1-2 second load times... I can no longer set my fast travel, go grab a beer, a snack, pet the dog, and come back and grab the controller. I literally stood up from the couch the first time and I was at my destination... took some getting used to, but in a totally good way.Now that I've got a XSX, I'm waiting on Starfield. I don't expect instant load times\/fast travels, or steady 60 fps, but I do expect a fantastic experience from this console and games. Even though Playstation came before Xbox, the Xbox controllers just feel 'right' in my hands. The Xbox Live\/Service is faster and more stable in my experience than Playstations (Sony has made huge strides, don't get me wrong). While Xbox doesn't quite have the exclusives some of the competition does, their platform for me has always worked better for me and my needs. So that's where I play mostly. And before you start thinking we got an Xbox fanboy here... again, I've owned every Xbox generation to date, every Playstation generation to date, PC, Android, and Steam Deck. The only platform I've not used in recent generations is Nintendo (last I owned was the NES)... they're just not for me.If you are on the fence about the Series... get off and pick one! But if you do pick the Series X and it's out of stock, be aware of the waiting through Amazon.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"69 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689724800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Next-Gen Done and Begun Right","reviewDescription":"Back in 2013, both Microsoft and Sony launched the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (respectively). Compared to the generation prior (Xbox 360 and PS3) and how those compared to current PC's of the day, the seventh console generation did not start well. From false promises from Mark Cerny about the PS4 hitting 1080p and 60FPS for every game, to Microsoft's loss of focus on gaming... couple that with the less than impressive comparison to PC's, and you would find the apology for sale a few years later with the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. Those were what we should have gotten to kick of a generation.Now here we are in 2020. The only downside has been acquiring one of the consoles and the lack of supply due to COVID-19. The Xbox Series X (seriously, Microsoft needs to do something about the naming) is a great offering with great value tucked away inside of the Xbox service.Without getting deep into the technical specs, I will highlight some key differences between the Series X and the One X. The SSD is first. Fast load times across the board for games and the system itself. The 1TB is not what you get in full, but it is not an issue if you keep a small catalogue of installed games. Currently with 6 games installed (AC: Valhalla, Destiny 2 ((all expansions)), GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Watch Dogs Legion), i am sitting at 357.5GB of free space. The frame rates are great with the ability to keep a steady 60FPS and achieve up to 120FPS. 4K is glorious with HDR. The Ray Tracing that some games have is a really nice touch, but unless you stop to smell the roses (or in this case the, wander up and stare at them), it doesn't jump out at you.Otherwise the console is impressive. Not a single sound has come from the machine in my few hours (extended this evening) of play time. The start up speed is incredibly fast and this is both from a fresh boot, to the low-power mode, to the unplugging method. Quick Resume is something to appreciate as well. Being able to have a handful of games running at once is a nice feature especially if you are one who has game ADD, or want to hop back into a single-player game after having a multiplayer session with friends.The new controller is built on the old saying, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" While Sony went with a new design and functionality for the PS5 with the DuelSense controller (seriously the haptic feedback is a cool addition, but I have a weird feeling it will fade out at some point), I can't help but feel Microsoft kinda missed a chance with the Series X controller, by not adding a similar feature. However, the controller feels lighter than the last, that could be due to the fact I am using batteries instead of a play and charge kit. It feels also, slightly slimmer all around, but the shape is still ergonomically pleasing for any hand to hold. I don't mind the absence of an internal battery pack. I find that the play and charge is a nice option, and that with batteries you never have to worry about being plugged in. The jump to USB type C is nice as well, as most of the devices I own use that port exclusively. Added on to the controller's body is a texture around the back of the hand grips and the tops of the triggers. My grip feels more stable and connected. Also, the addition of a share button is nice for two reasons. First it is a great way to capture what you want without sacrificing gameplay or being vulnerable in a multiplayer title. And 2, it allows for screenshots to now be captured that when being taken by hitting the Guide button, would sometimes cause elements to disappear.As for the value tucked away that I mentioned, that comes thanks to Game Pass. A service I was not fully sold on when it was announced, but as time went on, I became interested and am now a member. And now with them (Microsoft) partnering with EA to bring EA Access to game pass, it makes me wonder what the future holds.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1606521600000}

After two hours of playing that, it was ready to ask for my email address, but then told me that I am already using my email address so I must make a new one. Then it tells me that it will sell all of my information to everyone. Two days in and it tells me that it wants me to pick a color that will make this unique and mine, but then limits me to only a few colors. Then, no mater what color I pick, the thing just stays the same black cheap plastic color. it's going in the fire.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668124800000}

{"reviewTitle":"A+ box presentation!","reviewDescription":"So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box?  Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.You open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest.  It was great!  I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console.  So good job on that!I'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade.  I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it!  I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.And here it is.Visually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S.  There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before.  Everything is less fuzzy.  So that's good.  It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES.  Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2.  But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One.  The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me.  I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.And that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games.  While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility).  With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.Well... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so.  I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice.  And it isn't even the best part of the Series X.  That would be the load times.  With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast.  I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done.  This thing zips along.  That also applies while you're in the game.  Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly.  There's a lot of power in this rectangular box.  The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.It's a lot of the \"under-the-hood\" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One.  The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives.  I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now.  If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service.  I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.And, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass.  You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X.  It's a good deal.I'm happy with my purchase.  I wish Halo would have made launch.  I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing.  But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable.  In the end, it comes down to where your friends are.  Mine are on Xbox so here I am.  This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.But if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season.  Miles Morales looks really good.But if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform.  You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get.  In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.Oh! This thing also has a controller!  It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller.  This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version.  There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch.  So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now!  I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.Anyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware.  This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time.  Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.But, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"132 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1605225600000}

{"reviewTitle":"An upgrade in almost every category","reviewDescription":"I am not much of a console guy, preferring PCs. I bought an Xbox 360 several years ago for my wife as she had had a plain Xbox that she used before.I found consoles at least the way I prefer them allowed group play and comradery. They could bring a family together. All of the console games I have bought therefore allow for group play.I love this new console, I do not upgrade with every iteration and I felt it was time to do so. I wanted a console with a physical disc slot that allowed most of the previous games to work. I am a bit disappointed at some that unfortunately do not work. I honestly feel that even if they are newer versions you should get a significant discount if\/when you purchase the newer version.The Xbox series X is fast, it took ages for the 360 to load, this one does it very quickly and keeps your last save so you can jump right back in without a lengthy load screen.I do not mind the blocky appearance. I have had no real issues with overheating but I have not really played any cutting edge titles on it for long periods.I miss the Kinect though, my 360 still works and I will be keeping it to play (my wife and my daughter) some of the titles that didn't port over and the adventures that were very family friendly.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase. I know most persons would have had a Xbox series X for a while. My only regret is no Kinect like service.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712016000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Excellent performance but the price doesn't hold up as well in 2024","reviewDescription":"The Xbox Series X has certainly made its mark as a powerhouse in the gaming world. With its impressive specs, it delivers a great experience that\u2019s smooth, fast, and visually pleasing. The quick resume feature is a game-changer, allowing you to switch between games almost instantly, and the load times are so short they\u2019re barely noticeable.However, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the price tag, which seemed reasonable at launch given the technology packed inside, doesn\u2019t have the same \u2018wow\u2019 factor a few years down the line. As tech advanced, what once felt like a steal now seems like standard pricing for a console. At this point, there are even some budget PCs which can perform similarly to this for about the same price.Despite this, the Xbox Series X remains a top-tier choice for gamers looking for quality, performance and a robust library of games, especially if you\u2019re invested in the Xbox ecosystem. It\u2019s a solid investment for serious gamers, and with Game Pass, the value does get a little better. Overall, it\u2019s a console that still deserves a thumbs up, even if the price now feels more expected than extraordinary.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712188800000}

I had a quick issue where the code that was sent wasn\u2019t working, so wasn\u2019t sure if it was the code, or something incorrect with my email\/password.

This is definitely a nice upgrade from Xbox one.Love premium game pass, and the user interface is similar to Xbox one.

I\u2019ve held out a long time for one of these! Worth the wait!UPDATE: Xbox X is great. Blu-ray drive works, love the quick resume option for games.

{"reviewTitle":"The caveats aren't that big of a deal--it's a solid console","reviewDescription":"I bought this knowing I wouldn't be doing much with Xbox this generation, but I wanted to check out what they had on the menu. My complaints are few and minor.A lot of people call it ugly, but I think uninspired is a better word. It's like when the stylish cars they made through the 70s gave way to the boxiness of the 80s and transitioned into the scientific designs of the 90s and beyond. There's no style here, but it's well designed for distribution of cooling to the components. I can't be too upset at that, and honestly, little time passed before its appearance was forgettable. For my tastes, Xbox designs have always trended gaudy, so this was a step in the right direction.I like the texture on the new controller. It feels good in my hand just holding it, but also during the action.Connectivity is fantastic. I'm impatient, but the download\/installation of games and patches never leaves me fuming.It's a fast console. It suffers when running games that have no business being played anywhere but on PC, but that's to be expected, and it's nice to have the option if you don't have a PC. I was fairly impressed with the way the controller handled some PC games, offering a decent substitute to mouse and hotkeys.Graphics are pretty for sure. They look great on my 4K TV.I'm not crazy about how they handled extended storage this time around, but I haven't dabbled in it either, so that's more of a philosophical complaint at this point, rather than practical.I guess the biggest gripe would be that you need to partner with Microsoft if you choose this over the PS5 or Switch, and I don't like the way they do business, particularly their choices regarding console gaming.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694390400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Mostly great. Mostly.","reviewDescription":"Our old Xbox One was dying a few months back, so we bit the bullet and upgraded to this. We both play, so we also got an extra controller (the console comes with one). I took the extra one, and my husband took the one that came with the console. In case you're curious, my old controller's buttons were starting to give out as well right around the time the console was dying, and my husband wanted a backup controller, hence the need for two new controllers instead of just one. Anyway...I was using the \"extra\" one because it's purple (yay!). It works fabulously. The console itself is amazing because all the games we have played load ridiculously fast, and the graphics are amazing. Then the not great part: my husband's old controller (which we *just* bought last Christmas) died one week after getting the new console up and running. No biggie, we have the new controller to use, right? So he grabbed the one that came with the console and started using it. That was just a few months ago. The stick drift started a few weeks ago, and it got really bad really fast. That controller is straight up unusable now. Thank god for the black friday sales coming up this month. Given how new the console and controller are, I thought someone would help us, but no. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft\/Xbox care one bit. I guess less than 6 months is now the expected lifespan of a new controller?

Compared to PS5, the Xbox Series X is good but I have experienced several bugs.  Bugs include: static noise from menu sounds (ended up disabling the menu and notification sounds); HDMI signal was lost when starting a game leaving the TV with a black screen, had to unplug HDMI cable and plug back in to get a signal; Resolution defaulted to lowest resolution upon startup, had to reboot.  The Xbox is more like a PC in terms of dependability.  Reboots seem to be the fix.  PS5 is more polished and just works.  Also, Xbox Series X does not support WPA3 Wifi security (Wifi 6), has to be in WPA2\/WPA3 mode on Wifi router to use 5G.  Have to download an app for Dolby Atmos to work.

Some of my favorite games are 100+GB (Ark was 151+Dlc)... so my 1TB (800GB drive) can't really store that much. And since your X\/S game has to be native to play ...

{"reviewTitle":"Definitely a Box","reviewDescription":"As a long time PlayStation customer, this is my first ever Xbox. I have to say that I am pleased with the shape of this console. It is as advertised\u2014it is, indeed, a box with an X on it, although the X could be a little more prominent. It is difficult to see when the console is off, but luckily, the X lights up when the console is actually turned on. So it could be better, but this is acceptable.The Xbox also plays games. I don't really have much to add about that. It is a game console, it plays games. I do wish the Xbox had a better selection of games though. As is, I play my PS5 a lot more than the Xbox simply because it has more exclusive games. Here's hoping Starfield and Avowed will eventually make the Xbox more appealing, but as of now, Xbox doesn't have much going for it.Lastly, the console's UI is very cluttered and unappealing to me, especially compared to the PS5. However, unlike the PS5, the Xbox lets you group games and other apps into folders, allowing you some measure of organization. This cannot be done on the PS5 for some reason. Xbox also has themes, though there is a limited selection.So overall, the Xbox Series X is a fine console. I don't think it's going to make me want to switch over from PlayStation, especially with its lack of interesting exclusives (as of the writing of this review). But as far as consoles go, this one is okay. I like playing Alan Wake and Cyberpunk on it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689724800000}

With the Series X, I can play RDR2 without any noise from the console. Everything looks better too on this compare to the One X. Now there have been some hiccups here or there since launch but Microsoft have done a good job so for with trying to fix things. My major issue are the controller not syncing when the batteries die and having the restart the console to get it to sync, some games won't quick resume and that causes all the other game and apps not to launch, and games like Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War crashing all the time.

Due to the fact that Microsoft waited for AMD to finalize the RDNA 2 feature set so the Series consoles could have the entire feature set, the system is behind in terms of max performance capabilities. Once these system updates roll out and the system fully utilizes the full RDNA 2 feature set and games are taking full advantage of them, we should see the full potential of the console. Early on there seems to be some slight performance issues with the cross gen titles at least.

I got some insight on specs etc. This review will not be about the specs because we already know it\u2019s damn better than last gen console Xbox One X.After a terrible, terrible, terrible...... the worst preorder experience of my life. I\u2019m not joking. This generation of consoles preorders will go down in gaming history infamy because how bad it was, especially during our pandemic. I was as excited as I ever could be to receive this item as if I was a child all over again. And to top it all off it came 9 hours earlier on release day! I call that a significant win for preorder delivery, since this is my first time preordering a console online.Now for what your really here for, the console review. Personally, I love it. Load times are significantly faster! Games look so damn good! And total backwards compatibility with this console made me cry tears of joy. A true 4k experience. Something last generation promised us that didn\u2019t happen.Now not anything is perfect. The one huge downside is there are no new games for this system yet. Usually there will be about 5 to 10 day one (some exclusive only to console) games. This year there\u2019s basically 0. Yes, the positive spin on this is you have a while back catalog of older games you can play on this newer system and see the graphics ramped up. But as an avid gamer I am a Little disappointed that Microsoft the back big time even during pandemic that they couldn\u2019t even offer at least 3 day one games. Sony is the same. These consoles will not have new games coming out day 1 unfortunately. We\u2019ll have to wait till a little more in 2021 to expect the games we really want.If you want a more in-depth review you can head right on over to my YouTube channel where you can see an extensive review on the console today at 8pm central standard time. My dad and puppy will be on. It\u2019l is going to be hilarious and cute. My channels name is Clive Childress.

Within a few days of owning this console, it became apparent that it is 3 to 4 times faster than the Series S and found a use for the disk drive as we are able to purchase used games or find a lot of discounts for older games.

{"reviewTitle":"Most of the problems of a PC, none of the upgradability; Less consistent than the Xbox One","reviewDescription":"I have owned an Xbox Series X since they came out years ago, and I have bought Xbox consoles for console generations previously. I have had gaming PCs, Playstations, and Nintendo consoles, but my Xbox is my default gaming home. That is basically changing, because over the course of its lifespan, for the first time for any Xbox console, I am having all sorts of problems that I used to only have with my Gaming PC. Things like random components of the Xbox breaking until I hard reset the console, issues with downloads from GamePass processing incorrectly (matched with an inability to fix the problem because, unlike a PC, Xbox is a closed system), issues with saves, issues with bluetooth connectivity; essentially, everything under the sun that I deal with as an owner of a gaming PC, also haunts my Xbox experience, all the more so because you are limited in what you can do with your Xbox.The reason the Xbox is my home is so that I don't have to deal with these things when I play games. More than ever, I spend a lot of time diagnosing and fixing problems with my Xbox so that I can just play my game. This has gotten significantly worse over the console's life cycle, and it appears to be almost all software issues, or issues with the Xbox store, or issues with the way my Xbox chooses (without any capacity to really change it) to download things. I find myself hating that I bought this box instead of a PC where I could actually attempt to address or avoid problems.I can tell you this: this is my last Xbox console. I will not be buying another one, because I don't see what I would be getting out of it. It's clear that this is a trend, and that Xbox\/Microsoft has no intention of addressing most of the problems people have, many of which have been known about for years, but I suppose are rare enough that Microsoft doesn't actually fix anything (I guess I'm super unlucky?). I don't know if this is a trend with Playstation because I only have a PS4, but I know my Switch works by default when I turn it on, and I spend almost no time Googling how to fix problems with it.I am really genuinely disappointed in Microsoft, in a way that deeply impacts how I perceive decisions are made at that company. I really liked Phil Spencer, I really liked the plan for GamePass, because it is exactly what I wanted; but I guess I wanted it on the Xbox One, which never game me ANY of these problems, despite the fact that I owned the same console since buying it at release, and the fact that it survived my entire college experience and kept rolling like a trooper. I could still probably unpack the ol' girl, and I would be willing to bet it would run better than my Series X. Last generation, I went through about PS4s (all of them were bought pre owned instead of new, to Sony's credit), but my store bought Xbone never died on me until I respectfully laid it to rest in its box once I got the Series X.Yeah, so I'm done, Microsoft. I'll probably keep GamePass on the PC, and just abandon console gaming altogether, because I'm really only interested in playing the games I want to play, I don't care about hardware or live services or microtransactions or any of that. The Series X, to me, is unambiguously worse than the Xbox One","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1696982400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very limited Audio Output options, No TOSLink, S\/PDIF, or Optical Out!","reviewDescription":"I just received my second Xbox Series X and all I can say is that you don't know what you don't know. The first one connected directly to my 4K TV and was able to pass the audio across HDMI to the TV and then use ARC to my old receiver. Everything just worked. However, I've been using my Xbox One X in my bedroom with an old 27\" 1080P monitor and an Energy Soundbar that only has optical and RCA inputs. Today I took my new Xbox Series X out of the box and noticed right away it didn't have an optical (S\/PDIF) port. As a matter of fact, it only has 1 HDMI port now as well. Boy, this really stinks!So, I spent the past several hours trying to do research on how I was going to navigate around this issue and pretty much came up empty handed. Apparently you can get an 'audio extractor' and hope it works well enough and sounds decent too, but from the reviews I've been reading it is really hit or miss. I've also read those things mess with your VRR and other video signals and some of them barely do 4K at 60 Hertz. Then I read a lot of reviews from headset users who were completely left out in the cold because a lot of the best headsets used optical in the past and now that they've updated them to use USB the audio stream isn't great anymore.Microsoft's justification was that not that many people were using the optical port and so they decided to omit it for some cost savings. At this point, after reading hundreds of posts about this issue, I think Microsoft either didn't know how many people were actually using it or chose to turn a blind eye and figured we would just work around it.I am writing this review in the hope that others will see it and learn about the lack of audio format support before they make their purchase. If I had known (paid attention with my first Series X) I would not have purchased a second one. TOSLink, S\/PDIF, or Optical should still be considered quite necessary considering the lack of other options available for getting audio out of your Xbox Series X. Especially considering Microsoft doesn't even seem to support USB drivers very well for 3rd party products. Also consider that having to convert digital audio to USB and then back to another format isn't a great design either.This review wouldn't be so negative if Microsoft actually sold a product for this purpose, but I was unable to locate one and I'm feeling quite disappointed right now.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690502400000}

The console powers on and delivers me to the hone screen in less than 2 seconds, and boots games in a similar timeframe.One major issue Microsoft needs to address, but probably won't, is the fact that many gaming monitors aren't compatible with the xbox at 1440p 120hz. These monitors can run these specs over hdmi 2.0, but don't conform to the standard VESA timings, which is all Microsoft uses. This limits many high end gaming monitors to 1080p 120hz, or 1440p 60hz, which is unfortunate.

{"reviewTitle":"XBox Series X - ALREADY SENT FOR REPAIR","reviewDescription":"I decided to \u201cbite the bullet\u201d and pay double for the XBox Series X compared to the retail price in stores. I was a little wary of paying this much (close to $900) and doing so from a third-party, but I just really wanted to experience the next generation of gaming.Everything seemed to be alright when I opened the box. I followed all instructions to set up my XBox and soon enough I was ready to play. I began playing an online game and a couple of minutes into the match my XBox began lagging. Then, my XBox started making a loud rattling type noise and abruptly shut all the way off (perhaps to protect itself?). The controller light was left blinking and not responding. I had a terrible, sick feeling, but I decided to try again. Maybe my internet connection was bad or something? Soon after restarting the system, I began playing again. I checked the connection first and had full signal strength, so it couldn\u2019t be that. I started the same game over again and the same exact thing happened again. I tried a game on a disc next and the same problem occurred. Desperate to play some games, I put up with this nonsense for a couple of days. There were some times where I got in some solid gaming, but the system would always eventually lag, rattle, and shut off. Finally, I reached my mental limit and decided to call XBox. I sent my Series X in to be repaired because thankfully it was still under warranty.I am not going to get on here and berate anyone. I am just extremely disappointed in the whole situation occurring in gaming today: scarcity of consoles, outrageous pricing, etc.My goal I\u2019m writing this is to hopefully make others think twice before giving in and paying way too much for a potentially faulty product.If I could go back and do it over again, I would not make this purchase. I would wait patiently to find a console in the stores for retail price. I cannot help but feel cheated.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1632614400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Kept turning off","reviewDescription":"The console itself looked to be in great shape. Then I turned it on, the previous owners profile still logged in games still on it (again not a big deal) after a few minutes of it being on the console shut itself off. I updated the console hoping that would remedy the issue and still shuts off after a few minutes.After about the 4th or 5th time of turning the console back on it stayed on for around 20 minutes and then went back to shutting off. Fan was running, and the console didn\u2019t seem to be too hot.It went on to shut off around 8 more times within an hour span. So needless to say within an hour of opening it I packed it back up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646179200000}

{"reviewTitle":"This thing is worth even less than a PS5. Unfortunate","reviewDescription":"This console release is even worse than the PS5 in the sense that it has even less future exclusives. They are trying to price this at a lower rate to compete, but the reality is that after 2 months, you can see that the PS5 is in much higher demand than the XSX. They are smarter about the material since they use matte black, which is way better than some cheap gloss black on the PS5. The issue is the design of this, it is literally a rectangular box. If there's somewhere that you can put it without needing to look at it on a daily basis, that is fine. Otherwise, it's a box sitting around.The performance of this is also not as great as the PS5, but it seems like every generation Microsoft is just a touch behind. Without a current list of exclusive released yet, you are better off staying with the older generation machines until more games come out or stick with a PC.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"Canada","date":1612051200000}
