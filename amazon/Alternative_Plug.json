{"reviewTitle":"Items work as Advertised - Kasa Technical Support Is A Joke","reviewDescription":"Any business can sell a product.  What truly differentiates companies is how their customer service \/ technical support treat their customers.  Kasa presently stands at an \"F\" for their customer service \/ technical support with me.I'm a 40+ year IT professional and thoroughly research any product(s) I purchase. Overall, Kasa seems to have a reputation for dependable products.  As I build out my smart home ecosystem, I wanted to stick with one brand so as not to have to deal with multiple companies.  So Kasa was the company, other than Amazon (i.e., Alexa) that I was going to build-out my smart home with.I've purchased several products from them (plugs, light bulbs and a camera).  Overall satisfied with their products, but the hoops they require you to jump through to replace a product is laughable. When attempting to register a product, if a serial number is not recognized, then you have to call technical support. They also ask you to upload a copy of the invoice.  This is fine for me, as I know how to work around the system like Amazon (where I buy my products) to get the invoice and upload to their site.  But how does a \"non-technical\" person work through this?I started having a problem with one of the plugs I purchased from them.  It started making a loud buzzing sound.  I called technical support. Waited 30 minutes for a technical support person.This is where it gets fun.  He wants me to video the plug in the socket making the noise and send him the video.  Wonder how a grandma in Omaha would feel having to jump through that hoop?  So I did the video and sent it to him.  Was this enough?  Nope.  He wanted me to send him a copy of the invoice.  Okay, no problem. Downloaded it from Amazon and sent it over to him. He told me \"We'll, get a new plug out to you.\"  Okay great.Well, don't get your hopes up - I was sent another e-mail from another technical support person, asking me to go online and \"register\" the plug and \"upload a copy of the invoice\" (which I had already sent to the first tech person).Long story short.  KEEP AWAY FROM KASA.  Products, when they do work correctly, are GOOD.  BUT! If you NEED TECHNICAL SUPPORT OR CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR A REPLACEMENT you WILL meet a wall of resistance - and will have to JUMP THROUGH A LOT OF HOOPS.  Stay FAR, FAR AWAY from Kasa.I'm glad I learned about them quickly, when I had only invested a couple of hundred bucks in their products.  I can trash what I have and start with a QUALITY company who VALUES their customers .So, if you purchase from them - you've been warned.  You get what you pay for. And Kasa figures we don't pay for technical support so we don't get it.So, CONGRATULATIONS to Techs Luis and Danielle. Not only did you cost your company my business, but many other's business who look to me for computer and smart home recommendations. And I'm hoping this review will lose you at least 10-20 people.  We'll see how it goes.  Shame on you for having poor technical support representatives.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"90 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699920000000}
{"reviewTitle":"V2.6 protocol is unsupported by ST, Echo, Sense - Undocumented \"Bluetooth\" feature on \"WiFi ONLY\"","reviewDescription":"These were my \"go to\" plugs that coincidentally were compatible with my sense, smart things, and Alexa devices. I purchased 3 packs of these plugs, versions 1.6. Sometime in 2024 these plugs were updated to version 2.6 (hardware design) and the 2.6's are terrible. When attempting a WiFi setup, they won't connect to the same wireless network at all, I've opened a brand new box and none of them will talk for initial setup while I have several 1.6's actively online. It's possible I got a bad \"batch\" but I just tried them all in this box and I'm not going to open 8 more to see if they are good\/bad. Returning.Sense no longer recommending these as of March 2024 and if that concerns you, avoid.UPDATE: After posting this review and reading other comments, it appears the 2.6's have an undocumented \"feature\" of Bluetooth even though the Amazon product page listing says these are \"WiFi only\" at the time of writing. If you setup the 2.6's and choose the Bluetooth option in the app, the app detects the plug and sets it right up in seconds. I can report that some other new features in the Kasa app appears for these plugs but at the time of this writing when compared to 1.6 but the 2.6's are not detected by Smart Things, or Amazon Echo devices, and also Sense as previously mentioned. A deeper dive into why this is experienced is linked to a protocol change that Kasa has made in recent months enabling more features and better security for the 2.6's but also making them incompatible with the old app linking features between Smart Things, Amazon, and Sense. Sense as stated in a forum post they have no plans to adopt the new protocol allowing the new 2.6's to communicate and are no longer recommended.As of this writing the individually packed KP115 plugs here on Amazon are still version 1.6 and work great with all advertised features and work within seconds on Smart Things, Amazon Echo, and Sense devices. 4 of the KP116s cost more than this 4 pack but it's worth it for function if you ask me.For those only interested in using the 2.6's within the Kasa App\/environment with no external connections to the mentioned smart platforms, I would give these a 4 star review in that regard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717113600000}
{"reviewTitle":"1 Year Later - 3 Failures","reviewDescription":"Purchased these over other Kasa Plugs due to their 15A rating, and the ability to monitor energy consumption. I love the app and have many other Kasa devices in my home. I've now had 3 failures from these EP25 plugs that were used on my refrigerators (3 different refrigerators on 3 different circuits). As seen in the video, the failure results in the rapid cycling of the control relay, resulting in rapid disconnect and reconnect of power to whatever load is connected. This behavior can result in damage to the connected device, which I am certain would not be considered to be the fault of Kasa, and therefore not eligible for any recovery of damages caused to my refrigerators. Compressors are especially sensitive to power cycling. I still have 2 of these plugged into other \"high-current\" devices, 1 in a window A\/C unit, and 1 in a dehumidifier, both of which draw 10 amps steady-state. I can only assume those will also eventually fail, so I now must proactively stop using the Kasa plugs to avoid potentially damaging my equipment. It is simply unacceptable that 3 devices have failed, given that all 3 are plugged into standard household 15A outlets. Failure mode is likely due to the high current draw during start-up of my equipment. However, these plugs are rated for a 15A outlet, and there is no warning on the product nor on their website that would indicate that there are any restrictions in use of these plugs. In fact, older generation Kasa plugs were rated to 12A, which is why I specifically avoided those for these loads. Kasa should either redesign these plugs, or provide instructions\/warnings that would indicate them as non-suitable for high starting current applications, like an A\/C compressor, or refrigerators, etc.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1720396800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Caused multiple network issues!","reviewDescription":"Ordered 8 Kasa smart plugs in late November to handle Christmas lights after a few older smart plugs had failed. Initial set up & connection to my network was without issue, except they would not be recognized by the app where my previously purchased smart plugs from another manufacturer were controlled, so I downloaded the Kasa app (which would not recognize my older smart plugs). Configured all to use with Alexa. Within 2 weeks I began to experience multiple network issues. My Wi-Fi thermostat started disconnecting & reconnected multiple times a day. I rebooted the modem & the Wi-Fi router multiple times over several days. I contacted the thermostat manufacturer & after troubleshooting they offered replacement since it was under warranty. Once installed, within a few days the new one was doing the same thing and the same model thermostat for upstairs HVAC started dis-\/re-connecting. So it wasn't the thermostat to begin with. Then, my smart speakers would stop streaming randomly, sometimes resuming a few minutes later, sometimes not. Then one speaker wouldn\u2019t connect to the network at all. Replaced it too\u2026 same problem with the new one. I contacted my modem & router customer service teams and described the problems. They offered troubleshooting, but issues continued. (Note both modem & router are under 2 years old & the Wi-Fi mesh router is a TP-Link Deco, which you would think would work with the Kasa plugs!) Monitoring my network & apps more closely, I then noticed other smart devices were going off- & on- line randomly when previously I had no issues. I then contacted a local computer geek who advised unplugging the modem & router and ALL smart devices one-by-one. (Note: I have about 35 devices connected to the network -- PC, tablet, phones, plugs, freezer, TVs, speakers, Roku, etc. My Deco router is rated to handle 100 devices.) After plugging up the modem & router, then adding smart devices back one at a time, the problems appeared to be resolved... but reappeared about a week later! Then came Christmas and I unplugged all the indoor\/outdoor Christmas lights using the Kasa plugs (and a few of the older plugs) before leaving for 5 days. Checking my apps, everything seemed to work normally while we were away\u2026 hmmm?! When we returned home, I plugged everything back in, and within 2 days the disconnection issues returned! Had to be the Kasa plugs. Christmas (& the Kasa plugs) came down last week and the Kasa app deleted from my phone and everything is back to normal! Kasa plugs (or app) had to be the culprit from the beginning! Luckily, the plugs were still within the Amazon return window, so they were returned today.

{"reviewTitle":"Unbelievably bad Homekit AND Alexa integration","reviewDescription":"Kasa Smart Plug Mini 15A, Apple HomeKit Supported: $44.99 for a 4-pack at the time of reviewNormally, I pride myself in writing thorough and in-depth reviews, especially when it comes to technology. However, occasionally, I encounter a product that completely fails, in its stated goal. In that case, I tend to keep my review, limited to the frustrations and problems that I had in an effort to keep other people from having the same problems. Unfortunately, that is the case with these TP Link Kasa Home Kit enable smart plugs.Like all things, I read the review on these plugs before ordering them. I did see that some people had trouble getting HomeKit to work. But, I've worked in the technology field for over 25 years. 10 of those were spent as a network engineer. I have over 100 network enabled devices in my house. I love smart home technology. So I figured, \"how difficult could these really be to get working?\u201d As it turns out, impossible.I'll keep my experience limited so as to not run up the length of this review. But as the subject line implies, I was unable to successfully get these to link with HomeKit and while I was able to get them to function with Alexa, eventually, it took WAY longer than it should have.With regards to HomeKit, I was able to successfully get them to register in my HomeKit instance. However, within 10 seconds of registering the device, it would go off-line and be unreachable permanently. I could remove the device and go through the registration process again, only to be greeted with the same result. Out of all four plugs, I was never able to get any of them to work with HomeKit pass the initial registration.With regards to Alexa, that one was a little bit murkier. I had attempted to register each of these plugs with HomeKit first. In doing so, it disables the ability for me to enable the \"Allow external connections\" setting that is required to work with Alexa. In order to get these functional, I had to completely remove them from HomeKit and the Kasa app on my phone. Registering them in Alexa first, without attempting HomeKit registration first worked.In the end, I am extremely disappointed by TP links implementation of these devices. Unfortunately, for me, I didn't have a chance to set them up until I was well past the 30 day return date. Fortunately, though, I will be able to utilize these at my mom's house, where she doesn't use HomeKit (only Alexa). Frankly, I'm surprised that the engineers at TP Link let these out the door. My rating is an emphatic one star out of five. Not only would I not order these over again, they have completely soured me on TP Link products. Period. I have no intention of trying my luck with anything of theirs again. I'd rather spend a little extra money to get something I know will work.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1674864000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Loses connection, Rough edges with Homekit integration, good energy monitoring","reviewDescription":"Came back to Kasa platform as i wanted to monitor energy usage on key appliances. Had migrated to smartthings smart plugs for a couple years but energy tracking on that platform just never evolved to something easy without getting into custom apps, which have also been a mess with platform migration etc.Both smartthings and Kasa plugs work well for basic remote control, scheduling, and automation needs. In fact, Kasa integrates into Smartthings so you can leave the kasa app completely unattended after initial setup if that's preferable. The key difference is in the connecting technology; wifi vs. zigbee\/zwave. The latter has less interference and creates a mesh network for all other zigbee\/zwave devices.The reason I came back to these is to leave them plugged into key appliances like refrigerators and dehumidifiers so i can track energy use over time. Kasa doesn't provide detailed reporting but the app shows current usage, last 7 days, and last 30 days which is good enough for my intended use to see longer term trends. These don't work great if you're seeking to record energy usage for multiple devices, a kill a watt is a better tool for that. This is for dedicated outlet and device usage. The default smartthings energy reporting is just a running log of interval power usage with no real practical way to get similar summary as Kasa provides.Installation is super simple via kasa app but homekit integration is a little rough. The app set up asks to include homekit setup but the home kit code is printed on the plug in a light grey font that the app has a hard time reading, nevermind that once plugged in it's at an awkward angle to human eye read. I resorted to writing down the homekit code on a piece of paper. Once it's set up in home kit via kasa app, it again asks you to add to Kasa app and instead of carrying over the homekit name it starts with the generic plug name again. Awkward but the job gets done.I have an older plug running for 6 years now so we'll see if these have similar longevity.\u2014\u2014update\u2014\u2014-After less than 2 months, all 4 plugs lose connection to app every couple days to weeks and requires unplugging to reset.

It gets annoying after awhile, since the plugs are under desks or other inconvenient places.It's really disappointing.

No longer I guess as a consequence of cutting corners to reduce the price. Most reviews are from when they were reliable.Not a good idea to attach an important device (like cameras) especially if you are traveling and need remote access since it might not work when you need it.If it breaks, throw it away. support is not there to help. it is only there to collect information with the idea that you will give up at some point so they save money by not replacing the item.

You have to modify\/adjust the settings on your router wifi, especially on the 2.4Ghz, even though your network connection work perfectly for other smart devices, but it may still not compatible with Kasa smart plug.

{"reviewTitle":"Cannot Recommend \/ They Refused to Honor Warranty","reviewDescription":"The ad copy made a point about the \"industry-leading quality\" and the two year warranty. In my case, one out of four was completely defective virtually out of the box and when I pointed this out to their tech support, they refused to do anything about it. They did not replace my purchase or offer to make this right in any way. The problem with the one smart plug involved failing to receive a proper Wi-Fi signal and since it initially and briefly worked just fine I am extremely suspicious about the three remaining smart plugs continuing to function as advertised. The one device would drop off the network which was difficult to understand rationally because it was located within inches of a second TP Link\/KASA smart plug which maintained a strong 2.4 GHz signal. I tried relocating the device to narrow down the problem anyway at the insistence of technical support and found that even when located within 3 feet of the router it still could not get proper reception according to both the Kasa software and my router's system information screen. (Another smart plug 36 feet away (and through a wall) had a much stronger connection than this plug managed at 3 feet from the router.) Based on my experience, this product is defective and there is no warranty whatsoever. If they won't replace a product which cannot receive a signal 3 feet from the router when every other device in the home is functioning normally and properly exactly what value does their Wi-Fi smart device have? The purpose of a Wi-Fi product is to have connectivity and function in locations where running a physical wire would be difficult or impossible. They sold me garbage and apparently don't care about that. Also, I wish the integration with Alexa was better. To use this with Alexa you must install the Kasa software first, and each time you are forced to do this while setting up your \"smart\" home the limited space and resources of your smart phone are being incrementally taxed. I wish more devices had native Alexa support.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691020800000}
{"reviewTitle":"App & Plugs have amazing potential BUT here are WARNINGS.","reviewDescription":"The Pros:Cost is great.Form factor is great.Automation integration with BOTH Apple Home \/ Homekit and Alexa is Amazing!This is a big deal for DIY smart home people who need smart plug changes in Homekit to trigger scene changes, etc., to products in the Alexa world. I\u2019ve tried a few other plug brands and the Kasa plugs have way more capabilities so far.Connection to Homekit is easy, this is probably great for most people but there is a cost for hardcore home automation people (will explain below).The CONS:Not the most robust wifi connection when power cycling your router (seems to have decent connection otherwise).Plugs go offline more easily compared to other, hub connected smart plugs (plugs that communicate with a central ethernet connected bridge\/hub that have a proper IP \/ internet card, for example, the Yolink plugs). These are more sensitive about temporary disconnections.Fortunately you can usually just unplug and replug the smart plugs to fix things when this happens.You can NOT change your network name or passwords however without significant problems.If you do, get ready, plugs will go offline, you can not update the wifi info afterwards, and in my case, I couldn\u2019t even erase them from my Kasa App (they just showed up as grayed out and I could not add them back, which is extra weird because other apps let you do this basic function with an offline accessory).You\u2019ll furthermore lose all of your connections and automations on all platforms they are connected to (when changing the wifi network name or password.In any situation where a network change is needed, you have to do full reset to factory settings. This is a problem for people who have lots of custom automations associated with these devices.TP-Link really needs to fix this.If the network changes, the user should have an option to update the network via the Kasa app. For example, let the user tell the app to use the network their phone is now connected to, in such a conflict.I lost so much time and work because of this.The one Yolink plug that I own did not go offline when I changed my network settings and never does (because it pulls it\u2019s internet connection from an ethernet connected hub), however it does require a hub, does not have nearly as many automation capabilities. I will use it for hard to reach or critical situations over the Kasa plugs.So, if you need to change network settings (which of course you should do for security reasons), make a plan, execute carefully.1. document your automations so you can remember how to reprogram them fast.2. I think it\u2019s best to delete the accessories before changing your network settings or your App will basically have a meltdown.  I created a whole new account to move forward after the original account kept showing stuck, ghosted devices) but will remember to delete my accessories before changing account settings, next time.If Kasa fixed this network change problem, I would give this app and the Homekit plugs 4 or 5 stars.  Would definitely give them 5 stars if they made the connections more reliable. I\u2019ve had a couple plugs go disappear in the Kasa but still show in the Apple Home App for reasons I can\u2019t figure out.I overall appreciate them though because they can act as triggers to synchronize devices \/ scene state changes in both the Homekit and Alexa and ecosystems simultaneously (I use Homebridge for this as well). I have not found any other plugs that work with all the products that I\u2019m needing to sync yet so I give these plugs major props for that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"60 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673222400000}

A few reasons:First, you must choose to set these up in the Kasa App or in the Apple Home App, and the instructions steer you towards the Apple Home App.  BUT, once you go through the pain of setup via Apple Home, and then open the Apple Home App, you learn that there is no scheduling functionality unless you invest in an Apple hub or have an Apple TV- an additional $100 or so.  Well, there goes the \"cheaply.\"  (And I am not sure Apple Home allows you to see watts consumed, as the Kasa App does.)So I reverted to the Kasa App. which does allow scheduling.  But I got lots of error messages while establishing WiFi connection to some of the smart plugs.  Some of the error messages were incorrect (thus confusing), telling me that Wifi signal was bad.  In one case it was in fact connected, but the App kept prompting me for need to reset the smart plug.  Then it prompted my to update the software in the smart plug- (this may have been the real issue).  At one point it told me I needed to reset, but the App showed the plug appearing as normal.  So, LOTS of wasted time with setup.  I felt like a monkey at keyboard, flying blind without proper instructions, and with incorrect\/misleading error messages.So finally, I have them all on the Kasa App, and it is very cool to be able to schedule lights on\/off while we are home, and diff schedule while on vacation-  One very nice thing about the scheduling is that the scheduler can be set to be relative to sunrise\/sunset, so you don't have to diddle with your time settings as the days get longer\/shorter-  NICE.  Also a \"vacation\" feature that will turn lights on\/off randomly to simulate someone living there.I do trust TPLink\/Kasa as we have their outdoor unit to turn on string lights and it has held up well, works well (over Alexa voice command).  And as I'll be away as these units click on\/off, I trust the brand to not burn the house down; I would NOT buy an unknown or newly launched  brand for this reason.  And for those who care, I saw a video review that shows these units do draw 1\/2 watt just sitting in the wall- not much at all, given the convenience feature.So in the end, I am happy with the switches, but wow- Kasa could have made it easier with a better decision tree for how to set up, and a video showing exactly how to set up, and typical error messages and their resolution.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714435200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Setup problems at first, but now they\u2019re great","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve been wanting smart plugs for a while, but I didn\u2019t want to spend all that money. Luckily, I saw these for a great deal on prime day so I bought two packs, eight plugs in total. I was so excited when they arrived, and I couldn\u2019t wait to get home and set them up. Unfortunately, that part wasn\u2019t so easy.I originally tried to add these on the Tapo app, since I already use it for some cameras, but it kept saying that my network was unstable and just  wouldn\u2019t finish configuring the plugs. I\u2019ve got fiber, all my tests was reading strong signal, and none of my other devices were having issues, so I couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. I thought i was going to have to return them all and just wait for Black Friday to try another brand. I finally decided to try the Kasa app, and that was what worked for me.Once I downloaded the Kasa app and signed in with my Tapo login, configuring the plugs was a breeze. And since the Tapo app can sync anything I\u2019ve got in the Kasa app, I can now control it all through Tapo. Crisis averted!I'm pretty happy with these plugs now. I'm able to schedule my lights to turn on, turn on fans with my voice via Alexa, and (because I'm paranoid about these things) make sure small appliances are \"unplugged\" when not in use. As silly as it probably sounds, I worry about things like a toaster going haywire and starting a fire when I'm at work, and these little smart plugs allow me to cut power to them, even if I forgot to do it before I left the house. That peace of mind is awesome.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721347200000}

The default process for the EP25 may be required if you are using Apple HomeKit.  The Kasa app could not find nor connect to the smart plug when using the recommended WiFi setup option (as shown in the iPhone Kasa App).  Various on-line recommendations talked about waiting 15 minutes for the HomeKit process to timeout.  That still did not work.  Finally, I found a recommendation on a TP-Link forum saying to SELECT BLUETOOTH for adding the smart plug to the Kasa app.  Of course Bluetooth is only used for setup, and my iPhone controls the smart plugs using WiFi and cellular.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723939200000}

I downloaded the Kasa app and used my tablet for initial setup. Then, I was able to add them to Google Home and do basic control from that app on my phone. We'll see how long they last since early death seems to be the biggest negative in the reviews.One thing I'm surprised about is the lack of an easy way to identify each plug. I don't intend to use each one in a permanent location, so I will need to be able to clearly identify which plug I'm taking out of the box. There is a unique 8-digit number on each one -- perhaps for Apple Homekit use -- but it would have been nice to simply have a big 1,2,3,4 on the outlets so I know at a glance which one I'll be controlling. I may just use a magic marker and write 1,2,3,4 on them to make them easy to identify in the app.EDIT: So, I tried to set up a simple on\/off timer sequence fora short trip and the process is ridiculously convoluted. Instead of simply giving you an on-time & off-time option, they have actions and triggers, with secondary options for everything. I'm sure this gives some people tremendous flexibility, but for a simple on\/off timer that most people would need, it's not at all user friendly.

Of the six, two of them integrated seamlessly with iOS Home (which is what you want if you don't do Alexa and instead rely on Siri for voice activation). I have followed Kasa's instruction to a \"T\" and sometimes they work (twice) and sometimes they don't (4x). If you have patience and can think like a computer you can get them to work (about 20 minutes each). I WOULD SUGGEST the tiny QR code stickers that come with each one, that you do not stick them on device. Instead, put all the stickers on a single sheet of paper and mark which device each sticker belongs to. Because sure enough, you will have to repeat the process (maybe several times) before they talk nice to your iPhone\/iPad. Once they do life is sweet, you can say \"office light on\" and it works.

Now, I decided to delete all six from Home and restart. I went to the Kasa iOS app, tapped \"Add To Home,\" got the message \"Your device has been added to Home,\" tapped \"Go to Home\" and ... the device is NOT there!

The number 4 at the end of the model numbers denote that they are sold as a 4-pack. This review is for the EP25P4. In the subsequent photos you'll see screenshots from the app that show that the energy monitoring features of the EP25P4 do not offer a graph, nor does it offer tariff to track your energy costs in dollars. Another feature missing (most important) is the ability to set the default state of the plugs, which returns them to the user chosen state whether it be on or off when there's been a loss of power. If it's plugged into something like a refrigerator, you'll want it to automatically come back on after a power outage, especially if you're not home. Imagine your disappointment coming back from vacation, only to find that everything in your refrigerator is ruined. That's an extremely important feature that's sadly missing from the EP25P4! Just be aware that TP-Link Kasa is not consistent with product features within the same device category nor do they clearly indicate the differences.

{"reviewTitle":"I am using this with Apple. It was a pain to get to work because of Apple.","reviewDescription":"So integrating these device on an iOS iPhone platform turned out to be a serious pain. The reason is that iOS \"see's\" this device as being added to \"homekit\" which means that you can't connect to the devices WiFi network. That in turn means you can't add it easily. I am still not sure what I am doing to make it \"get around\" that. But basically I plug the unit in, then keep holding the \"reset\" button until the I see it only in the WiFi list, not in the HomeKit list. If you happen to have added the network to your \"know network\" list on the device, I have not been able to make it work, so I just force a \"forget\" the network and keep going. There is a click that happens after one has been holding the \"reset\" button for like 20 sec and that seems to be the magic to make it happen, but it doesn't always happen. I basically just keep unplugging and plugging it in till \"it works\" to be just in the list. I also turn the wifi on and off on the iPhone as the newer version seem to have a weird issue with \"not seeing\" stuff easily.Finally, I did try the route that has been put out there of being in \"Air Plane\" mode ... but that not only doesn't make sense to me it also doesn't seem to work any better than not being in it. I have pair four different plugs, and unpaired and paired the same plug about 10 times trying to get to a \"repeatable pattern\" with no luck. There is obviously a \"path\" through the firmware on the device that allows this to happen ... however, I hold Apple responsible for making this sooooo hard ... the issue is with them not allowing us as end users to say we want to connect to a \"device\" that we don't want to put in the our \"Home\" ... even if the app isn't installed on the iPhone it still forces us to use it ... which is all Apple and their dev team.In summary, you can make this work with iOS 15.5 ... but you have to go through a random number of times to make it so that it only shows up in the WiFi and not as an Apple device to be add to home. One final note, even if I went down the path of using the \"Home\" app on the iOS device, it still didn't work right and I couldn't find the energy usage which for me is one of the primary reasons for having the plug :(","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1660348800000}

{"reviewTitle":"may work may not","reviewDescription":"I was very excited about these plugs but have yet to really get much use out of them. Setting them up was hit or miss - a few worked perfect, a few were a huge pain to get connected. I have no idea why but eventually through trial and error I got them all connected. I also had an issue that the plugs already connected to WIFI would disconnect each time I added a new plug to my system. Literally the only way to get them back online was to physically unplug and re-plug the devices back in. What I have learned - they CANNOT reconnect to WIFI on their own UNLESS they also lose power afterwards. Meaning that if you  reboot your WIFI or they lose its signal, you have to physically unplug and re-plug the unit back in (the on\/off switch won't fix this either). Not a huge deal for an easy access plug - but a huge issue for one behind, say, an entertainment center. This is kind of a deal breaker for me. I cannot go around unplugging 10 outlets every few weeks just because. - The company TP-LINK has confirmed through there help desk that there is no fix.The only other gripe is the monitoring software (for power usage). It works fine - but you can only look at one plugs' usage at a time and its a few clicks to get to that info. It would be very nice if you could see all plugs and their power usage in one single dashboard view.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657238400000}

So I shopped around for another brand, and was optimistic about these based on glowing reviews.However, despite multiple efforts to make this work -- and I've been trying for a while, working with tech support to make it work -- these just are not working with my Apple Home and\/or Google Home setup -- and they do require Apple Home, if you try to connect them from an Apple device.At first, it would add it to Apple Home & the Kasa app, but then after a few hours, it would lose connectivity completely. After multiple attempts and emails to tech support, I still couldn't get it to work. Sometimes it wouldn't even connect in the Kasa app. This was several months ago, when I first got them, and I tried for about a month (off an on) to get them to work (and I did test multiple plugs in the 4-pack).Fast forward to today, and now it just won't connect to the Apple Home app (I'm on the latest OS, and have an iPhone 14, so only one gen from the latest).These are just flaky devices. I didn't realize Apple Home was required (which I actually don't use, since most of our automation is on Google Home). But the Apple Home integration just doesn't work.Unless you're lucky (like apparently most people in these reviews), you may run into similar issues, and ultimately have to return them. Unfortunately, I'm well beyond the return period (I was optimistic I could eventually figure it out, with the help of Kasa's support), so I may just be out the $40 I paid for them.If you run into issues while still within the return policy, don't wait -- just return them and move on to another brand (or go with the non-Apple Home version of these).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701302400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Limit on three \"smart actions\" is HUGE deal-breaker. Choose another product","reviewDescription":"I excitedly received, opened, and set up my four new Kasa smart plugs. The app made it easy, but it took several hours given the electric cords I had to wrangle, the decisions about timing devices on and off I needed to make, connecting each device to wifi, etc. Anyway, when I was all done, I felt great!--until I realized a built in limitation made these plugs USELESS to me.\"Smart Actions\" are what the Kasa app calls settings that allow you to automate when the plugs take action. For example \"turn off lights at bedtime\", \"turn off fan after 30 minutes\", or \"turn on lights when I enter the room.\" Such automations are the heart and soul of the smart home.But Kasa limits them to a total of three. You can create 50 (another unreasonable limit), but you can only have three operating (that means only three can be alert, waiting for the right conditions to be met to take their prescribed action).I can use three Smart Actions just to control the behavior of a single device in a single room. I suspect that when I finish my smart home setup, I might us 12, 25, or maybe even 100 or more such total automations.I have no idea why you can only turn on three Smart Actions at a time. But whatever the reason, this strikes me as totally unreasonable, totally unexpected, and frankly, almost fraudulent given that I only saw this limitation disclosed after I had bought and installed the plugs.The product category is called \"smart plugs\". \"Smart Actions\" are the ability that make these plugs \"smart\". To limit Smart Actions to 3 is just UNBELIEVABLE to me. I'm returning these. Do not buy them if you are into home automation. you will be disappointed.There may be workarounds with IFTT, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, etc. But i don't have any of that stuff right now. I want to head in that direction but don't have time now. I want this to work with the app. I'm very disappointed.PS For my other smart plugs that work with the Smart Life app, similar limits are in the HUNDREDS. So Kasa's limit doesn't seem to be industry standard in any way.This just seems crazy to me. I just don't get it. Otherwise these things seem pretty great.

I hate how fragmented all of it is and that there are separate apps for every brand's stuff. I don't want to use a bunch of different apps, and you never know how long companies will support these things. Lifespans of LED bulbs are very long, and plugs like this could last decades. But, if the company stops supporting them they'll become paperweights.However, I have a set a JBL LSR305mkII studio monitors I use on my desk for guitar-playing, music recording, and general listening. These have switches on the back. With these plugs I can control them without having to reach behind and that's great!Because they also make affordable bulbs I was able to add those to my network without the need for a separate app. The app works pretty well, too. Others have confirmed that these will work without contacting TP-Link's servers, including blocking traffic to them over the internet after you set them up. So, that means there may be potential to keep using them after TP-Link drops support in favor of newer devices in the future.The setup could be confusing if you're not very tech savvy. If you use any kind of VPN on your phone, it might not work. I had to disable mine to do the setup. Afterward, I could re-enable the VPN and use it without issue. At one point in the setup you need to connect to temporary wifi network broadcast by the bulb, this isn't the clearest in the directions.The only negative I can see here is that TP-Link hasn't come out and said they'll support Matter once that's released. However, it should be doable since these use 2.4ghz wifi.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1648857600000}

I was annoyed about that at first because I had been using another app for everything but it has changed my mind to more positive thoughts now.When you connect in the Kasa app, you click the + sign and you choose which Kasa item you have. I click the mini smart plug choice and it does it's normal asking if it's been reset, blinking slowly or quickly, and my favorite part is it asks you to go to your wifi settings to connect to what I'm guessing is a signal from the plug.You still have to type in your 2.4ghz internet password at some point in the app and it takes a second, then it's done.

Install TP-Link's Kasa app on your phone.2.  In the app, click the + to add a 'Smart Plug,' then 'Smart Plug Lite \/ Mini'3.  Plug in 1 of these into the wall, it should start flashing blue and orange without you touching it.4.  After a time, the app will prompt you to join the smart plug's network*note* Each plug has its own WiFi network at first you'll need to connect to wirelessly using your phone.  This is a different network than your existing home wireless network.4.1. the plug's default network will be called something like \"Smart_Plug_0123\"5. After connecting your mobile to THAT network, return to the Kasa app so it can speak to this device wirelessly.6.  After initial talks between the plug and your phone, the app will prompt you to teach the plug which WiFi network it should use instead of its own default network.  Specify your home network through the mobile app and enter the password you use for devices to connect to it.6.1  The app will send the WiFi name and password over to the plug, which will then be authenticated and joined to your home network in the background.7.  On your mobile, rejoin your home network (the 'normal' one you started on) and validate your plug is now on that same home network as well.8.  Using the Kasa app, try turning the outlet on and off.  If it works you should hear a click as it turns on and off, indicating the internal 'relay' device inside the outlet is switching on and off from your app's instructions.Power usage note:  Even when the relay is switched off, this device uses 0.5w at idle.  This means plugged in 24\/7\/365, one outlet will be responsible for a yearly usage of 4.38kW.  That is, 0.5w * (365*24) \/ 1000.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1647129600000}

Won't reconnect to Google home after power outage","reviewDescription":"Update from 2 to 4 stars: it seems that Kasa may have fixed whatever issue was causing a lack of reconnecting after a power outage. Honestly without that issue its hard to fault these for the price. Still keeping one star off as this was an issue for me and many others for a few years and that speaks to Kasa's slow customer response.Original: Won't reconnect to Google home after power outage90% of the time, these switches work just fine and they control through Google home relatively well. Any time I have my power go out though, they revert to a \"local only\" mode and will only control through the kasa app. I have a Deco mesh wifi which is also a Tp-link product so I don't really know why this occurs. The solution is to unplug the switch and plug it back in. The reconnection seems to be all it needs. Which is simple enough except two of these switches are behind bookcases I cannot easily get too. So to reset those I have to reset the switch in the app, go through the setup process and re-add it to my Google home. I will be trying other smart switches out at some point to try and find more reliable replacements.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1645315200000}

It just makes it hard to know if you're scanning the code or not. After that, everything works fine. It integrates into apple HomeKit just as expected.

{"reviewTitle":"These plugs are ok, depending on what you want to do","reviewDescription":"I recently had my house wired for a generator. I wanted to get a realistic idea of what each of my electrical devices draws, so I figured I'd get these plugs and let them run for awhile.One thing I was curious about was how often things like a refrigerator or freezer cycle on and off. I put one of these plugs on my refrigerator but found that the control unit that monitors temp etc draws enough power to make the plug think it's on all the time (any measurable amount of power shows as \"on\", even under .1 watts). It will show different amounts of power being drawn if I look at the app in real time, but according to the kasa app it runs 24 hrs a day. I was hoping for possibly a way to graph the power consumption so I could get an idea of how often it cycles on, and for how long, but no such luck.It turns out I have the same issue with a washing machine and tv (but not the dryer, it shuts completely off).So, if you want to watch power consumption in real time and see how much power has been used in a 24 hr, 7 day, or 30 day period you're good to go with these.  If you want to see how long something had been running or any more detailed info you'll need something else.They still work fine for remote control, scheduled events, etc.Since they each report back to the kasa server  (very frequently, 500+ times a day....) it seems like, with a little tweaking of the app, there could be a user defined threshold of what constitutes the \"on\" state (maybe over a watt or two). You could set an alert for a change in state (pump comes on, something unexpectedly turns off, etc). This would also be handy to set an alarm for an excessively high consumption rate as well (or maybe a total power used in a time period).  An alert for total power cycles would be handy from a maintenance perspective too.  Anyway, lots of possibilities with a little work on the app.So, if you want remote controlled plugs (with scheduling etc) that will give you an overall idea of how much power the device is consuming, these will work well. If you want more data look elsewhere.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670371200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Very good, but won't connect to Bluetooth","reviewDescription":"None of the four plugs would connect to Bluetooth, despite following the directions for \"what to do if it won't connect to Bluetooth.\"  I then decided to go ahead and connect them via WiFi.  They definitely won't connect to 5 GHz WiFi, so you have to make sure you have a 2.4 GHz band.  Renaming your 2.4 GHz band something different from your 5 GHz band helps, but you may mess up something else, like a video door bell, that is using the 2.4 GHz band under the original name.  You can keep the bands named the same, but it makes it more difficult to pick the right one when setting up the plugs.  The Kasa app seems really good, so far.  You can group your plugs or other devices by room.  The customization of the schedules for the plugs is really good.  Controlling the plugs from your phone is very easy.  I don't know if anyone will read a 4-star review, because if you're like me, you read the 1-star reviews first, then read a few of the 5-stars, and then decide.  Anyhow, I would recommend these as long as you don't absolutely need plugs that connect to Bluetooth.  I gave \"Easy to Install\" a 3-star rating only because they won't connect to Bluetooth, as advertised.  The connection to WiFi is actually pretty easy as long as you have a dual band router that uses the 5.0 and 2.4 GHz bands simultaneously, and you can select the 2.4 GHz band.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"51 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694908800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great little units!!!","reviewDescription":"I bought a 2 pack of these because they were on sale just to use for a floor lamp that has a foot switch. Once I figured out how to set them up, I had to have more. I now have 8 of these. They work with Alexa so when your coming through the front door, you can say, \u201cAlexa! Turn on the floor lamp!\u201d and a second later, it\u2019s on. Or if you are coming home from grocery shopping in December when it\u2019s gets dark at 4 pm, I can go in the app and turn on the lights from the grocery store so when I walk through the door with all my groceries I don\u2019t have to fumble for a light switch. I have one on a small, one room, window air conditioner and can set a schedule for it to come on at a particular time on certain days. I have one in my kids room for a salt lamp that they use for a night light scheduled to come on every night at 8pm so they can see at bedtime and then off at 11pm so it\u2019s not on all night. The only thing I can say remotely negative about these is that they need to upgrade the app. It works well but the user interface is a bit clunky with the widgets on iOS. They haven\u2019t taken advantage of the new widget format so you can\u2019t put it anywhere. It stays in the widget page and there is a lot of wasted space. This is not negative of the products functionality, it\u2019s just how I feel about the app. There are some really nice things about the app as well. You can make \u201cscenes\u201d which is having more than one outlet doing something together in one tap. When I want to watch a movie, I hit my \u201cMovie\u201d scene I created and it turns off all of my lights but turns on a nightlight in the kitchen and a dim mood light in the living room. Some items that I have like my battery charger do not have an on\/off switch so I would constantly have to plug it in to use it and then unplug it when I was done. This made it hard to place because I have to have it near an outlet that I have access to. Now, I put one of these smart switches on it and I can put it wherever I want. I also made a scene for \u201cAll Off\u201d so I can turn off everything with just a tap. When you open the app, it shows you what outlets are on and which ones are off. Great for the person who always thinks they left something on.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1632873600000}

Any smart outlets you set up later may (likely will) need to be discovered by and added into the Alexa device list via a simple \"Add\" process.Of note for doing that, there is a long pull-down list of compatible devices, and this does not show up under \"Kasa\"... Keep scrolling to the \"TP-LINK KASA\" entry. From there, easy peasy, click click, discovered, done.Some other observations...Name your plugs the name you want to use for voice control. I named them 'Kasa Plug 1\" then 2, 3, and 4. Then ended up resetting one and starting it over to name it a more useful and intuitive name (Christmas Tree), since nobody but me knew the numbers.

This happens every time I have a power outage, as EP10 quickly recover when the power is restored, but before the WiFi router finishes booting. As a result, the EP10 thinks there is no WiFi, and they are not programmed to check again every, say 10 minutes, to see if the WiFi is back. As a result, you cannot control them with the Kasa app. If you try, you get a \"Device Unreachable\" error message.

I thought I'd try these too, because of their lower cost, easy plug in  and possible voice activation by Google speaker for lights.  I initially managed to get voice control via Google Home setup on a cell phone, but found that did not give remote Kasa control by cell phone, which was another setup.  That setup ended up requiring a reset, removing in-house Google Home control.  Kasa recommended a software update as part of its setup, which I did.  After that, Google Home was unable to find the Kasa device in half a dozen failed install attempts.  Even resetting the Kasa device, presumably removing its setup, did not let Google Home find it again.  So I've given up on Google voice control and settled for just Kasa app cell phone remote control.  I believe the Kasa software update permanently destroyed Google Home access to the device.  So it's strictly a Kasa app device for me to plug in when I will not be there.  Without the ability to give a voice command to Google to turn a room light on, I will not handicap those lights by preventing their use by anything but a cell phone app.  I also do not plan to buy or use more for strictly remote control because it is far less versatile than other devices I use that can be accessed from any of my PCs - not just from a cell phone that could be lost or fail.

Everything seems fine, and I am able to add the devices to my iPhone's Home app. Because I am setting this up near our router, located in the living room, I then have to unplug the smart outlet and then move it to the desired room.

I disabled my 5Ghz Wifi and ALL off them connected immediately.  I then turned 5Ghz back on.  This is the ONLY way these will connect in this environment reliably.  Out of morbid curiosity I performed a power test and I was able to get one to connect by boosting the power of my 2.4Ghz and lowering my power on the 5Ghz. This is not fool proof and not recommended. All of the reviews that state none of these work can be summed up by this review.

{"reviewTitle":"How to integrate motion detection with the plugs during certain hours!! I figured it out","reviewDescription":"I am beyond thrilled to have finally figured out how to integrate motion detection with the smart plugs so that certain smart plugs (where i have plugged in lamps), go off only with motion detection during certain hours. So first off, get the indoor Kasa cams too. They are inexpensive, and place them where you want motion detection. I was lucky bc we already had indoor Kasa cams all over our home. Next set up your smart plugs normal set up(go through the Kasa set up to add the device to your app).This is where it starts to get tricky but I promise once you do it once, you will find it SO EASY!! I am so excited to share this bc even when I asked Kasa support they didn't know the exact steps.First you are going to set up the ACTION you want triggered (you will set up the hours you want this to happen between later).1. Go to \"Smart Action\" tab. --> \"When\"-->\"Trigger Device\"-->choose camera of your liking.---> \"Then\" ---> \"Control Smart Device\" --->choose your smart plug of your liking.--> Label it \"Motion Front Entry\" or something like that. Save.NOW we are going to set up during WHAT TIMES we want this motion detection to happen. For ex you likely only want a lamp to go off during nighttime hours, such as after sunset till 11pm. You can even offset your sunrise and sunset times such as \"before sunset 10 mins, or after sunrise plus 30 min\".1. Go to \"Smart Action\" tab--->\"When\"--->Trigger Time-->choose time you want your motion detection to start.-->Then--->\"Enable Smart Action\"--->pick the \"Motion Front Entry\" or whatever smart action you made for the motion detection. Hit Save.Now do this last step again but instead of \"Enable Smart Action\" you will choose \"Disable Smart Action\" at your specified Trigger time.You can even set up different times of day. For ex I have motion detection during early morning hours AND PM hours. I love this system so much.If you don't want motion detection just set up normal schedule like whatever days of week to turn on and off certain time too.

The Kasa app was easy to use and I was up and running no time. (You can also use the TAPO app if you prefer its interface. Try both and see which one you prefer.)I was so impressed with the ease of setup and the app, that I bought a total of 8 Kasa Mini Plugs and two smart bulbs.You have the option of an \"Away Mode\" which turns the switch on and off randomly during a period of time you specify. Works great, but you have to set the start and end time within the same day. You can't for example, set the \"Away Mode\" to begin at 10:00pm and be done by 2:00am the next day. You can however, use the regular switch on\/off to cover that same period.

{"reviewTitle":"Connected these to our OhmConnect account","reviewDescription":"These have served multiple purposes.  First, we are using one on a hot-water recirculation pump that was originally plugged directly into a wall outlet.  We didn't want it to run all the time, just for a few minutes before taking a shower, so now we can control it from a smart phone inside the house rather than going out to the garage to plug in then unplug it.  (I know that any smart plug could do this, but I'll say that the Kasa has been reliable in maintaining an internet connection and the Kasa app is really easy to use.  I don't see a need for Alexa or another program since all of our smart pugs are Kasa brand so far.)Second, we enrolled on OhmConnect, which offers small rewards (one example of which was one of these smart plugs, which is how I learned about them before deciding to buy more) for using less energy during peak electricity generation hours.  That saves my utility company from having to buy the most expensive power and I think it reduces use of less environmentally friendly options, like burning coal.  Pretty much a win-win.  We let OhmConnect control our Kasa outlets for brief periods of peak electricity use (usually one hour at a time, early evening), meaning that they can turn them off for those periods.  This works great for our fridge and freezer, which are fine being off for such short periods.  If we had other big energy drawing appliances that could be shut off during the hours chosen by OhmConnect, we'd buy more.  It is minimal hassle while contributing to the greater good.  The 'worst' that has happened has been to open the fridge during the shut-off period and find the light is off, but fridges lose very little of their coolness in as short a time as an hour.  Probably more than you wanted to know, but hoping to offer some education about this program.  (I'm sure there is more than one like it offered and it has to be offered by your utility company.  OhmConnect happens to be what our utility company partnered with.)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672790400000}

If you're in the same boat as me, here's a workaround to BYPASS the initial HomeKit setup (so you can connect only to Google Home or Alexa) that I discovered:1) Open the Kasa App and click, Add Device2) When it asks you which kind *DONT* pick the HomeKit plugs - instead pick 'Smart Plug Lite \/ Mini'.Then, before following the prompts - hold down the power button on the side for 20 seconds or so until you hear a prominent click - this means the plug has been restored to it's original factory settings3) Now follow the prompt to plug it in, hit Next and when it asks if its flashing orange and blue - you actually need to hold down the power button again for about 10 seconds until it's flashing between those colors QUICKLY.4) Hit next and it'll ask you to connect to the plugs internal network via Wifi - do do this easily on iPhone, swipe down diagonally from the top right of the screen to access control center, long press on the WiFi button, and when the list of available networks pops up - pick the TP Link one. Now back out back to the Kasa app and it'll ask for your WiFi network. Connect it to your 2.4ghz network (not 5ghz).  it'll take a second here to set everything up and then it eventually asks you to name the device.5) Once you're done, make sure to open the Kasa app settings, go to 'Settings' and go to 'Firmware Update' and make sure your plugs are up-to-date.That's it! Now if you look at the device info, all the information is correct - it shows the right plug (EP25 is the HomeKit model) - and you'll notice there's a 'Add To Home' button available to you. This means, down the road whenever you are ready - you can still fully integrate these into Apple HomeKit. For now though, all the plugs work reliably through Google or Alexa.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"38 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1655769600000}
{"reviewTitle":"They work well for the price, integration to Home Assistant was no problem","reviewDescription":"Short review: For a 15A relay, these are a good price. They connected immediately, they respond quickly, and when I set them up in Home Assistant I didn't have too much of a fuss pulling in the integration.------------Note, I got the ones that are just a switch. No energy sensors. Just a solid, beefy relay in a smart plug. And by beefy, most at this price point, with this form factor that doesn't  block the second wall plug, are 10A. I never intend to stress it to the full 15A, but there's peace of mind in being well under the rated load factor.To add them  you need the Kasa app. I'd prefer not to have them ever phone home to the internets, but unless I go with Tasmota I have no choice. All of these smart plugs will require something similar.First, you plug them in and they'll have a Wifi server available. You connect to it, then choose the router you'll use, then you connect to the router you'll use and it'll pull the plug into the network. It's a little convoluted, going back and forth between the android settings and the app, but the app guides you reasonably.Once joined, adding it to Home Assistant is a matter of pulling in the integration. It'll auto detect and find all of the smart plugs that are powered.  I suggest you plug them all in before having HA find them, though, I bought four plugs and only had three running when I grabbed the integration. The running plugs all got their names, as assigned during the setup in the Kasa app, but the one that wasn't plugged in got the stock name \"TP-LINK_Smart Plug_AE13 EP10(US)\"  instead of the one I'd given it.Not complaining too much, HA is sometimes quirky that way, but all four switch when called and that's what matters. Likewise, I tried some Kasa Smart bulbs and spent hours trying to get them to connect before sending them back to Amazon. These inexpensive smart plugs were all four set up 20 minutes after I grabbed the package from my doorstep.  So, for the price, they are worth the stars.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672876800000}

{"reviewTitle":"DON'T BUY Product does not stay connected to HomeKit or even their own app","reviewDescription":"Update: I spent days troubleshooting these plugs with their tech support staff. They had me install a Beta of their software and provide logs. I even connected to a different WiFi network. In all cases the plugs would lose connectivity to the app and Homekit after a few days at best and less than 24 hours at worse. Tech support mentioned that they were having trouble seeing them on their servers (these are cloud connected) and tried to push through Beta firmware that never reached the plugs. In the end, they agreed to RMA the plugs, but only if I paid for shipping. DON'T buy these! Pictures show that within hours plugs started going offline and within 2 days (not checking constantly) all plugs were offline, again.Works with HomeKit, when it stays connected. I have to manually unplug and then plug the devices back on every few days because it loses WIFI connectivity. My router can see the plugs, and can report good connectivity. Also, one plug will lose connectivity while the other one maintains it just 10 feet away. One plug is just 10 feet from router and loses connectivity. This suggests it is definitely the Kasa plug, not the wifi.
