{"reviewTitle":"Seem legit, however...","reviewDescription":"Aside from being in German packaging, the brush heads look exactly the same as the ones I've purchased from the store. I also got them much faster than anticipated, which was nice. I've already replaced my old brush head with a new one and they look\/feel\/perform like you'd expect from a brush head so they seem legit, authentic Oral-B brush heads. These fit both the Pro 1000 and Pro 1500.I would purchase again considering I can get a four-pack for a good price, as the ones I've purchased from the store usually only come in packs of two and are a little pricier.EDIT: I've purchased these a second time and the packaging is written in Arabic maybe? I guess I got lucky the second time because the brush heads still perform exactly the same as the last ones I had. Some people seem to be having issues with these but so far I've been lucky and got legit brush heads.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1603497600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Knock-offs","reviewDescription":"Like most people who use electronic toothbrushes, we all know how expensive the replacement brush heads are. So, again like most people you start searching around for cheaper options. I came across these \u201cOral-B\u201d Cross Action brush heads which had an awesome value. Seemed to good to be true but I figured I would just see for myself. Once the package arrived the first thing I noticed was that there were a LOT of different languages on the back of the package as well as the misspelling of Sonic Complete in English (spelled Complate). Once I opened the package I noticed that those colored plastic rings on the bottom of the brush heads were already installed on the brush heads. If you\u2019ve purchase Oral-B brush heads before you know that the colored plastic rings are loose in the package and it\u2019s up to you to install them on the heads. Just to make sure I wasn\u2019t crazy I went to my local Target and purchased a package of Oral-B Cross Action toothbrush heads to compare. Upon comparing the two, one difference is the plastic the heads come in. The ones from Target were a softer plastic while the ones from Amazon were a much harder plastic. Also, the imprint on the plastic from the ones at Target are stamped \u201cPFT\u201d while the ones from Amazon are stamped \u201cPET.\u201d Moving on looking at the bristles you can see that they are different as well. Another note is the Oral-B print on the neck of the head. The ones from Amazon had completely come off after only about a week or two of daily use. The one from Target did not seem to have been affected. While the ones from Amazon are a great value, know you are NOT getting a genuine product from Oral-B. And it\u2019s important to think about exactly how they are made and with what (i.e. chemicals, etc) that could be harmful to your teeth and health. Considering the great value these replacement heads are, I think I will pay the extra money for a genuine product from Oral-B for peace of mind. With all that being said these ones from Amazon do seem to work and perform as an electronic toothbrush head should.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1653782400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Works Best for Us","reviewDescription":"These cross action heads seem to do the best job of cleaning our teeth out of the several styles available. They are easy to use and are holding up pretty well so far. None of these last a long time, but I think these will still be cleaning effectively at the end of their suggested three month life. One thing we do is soak them in denture cleaner at least twice a week. It seems to clean out the mechanisms and reduce the noise they make when running after a cleaning. These have really reduced the plaque levels and have noticeably brightened our teeth. As coffee and tea drinkers, the stain reduction performance was a welcome bonus to my wife and me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1564617600000}

{"reviewTitle":"It has some get up and go!","reviewDescription":"My Phillips sonic was limping along after 1.5 years, so I decided to try the Oral B.  Holy Moly!  What a difference.  It revs up like a hot rod, but you can adjust the intensity.  This red light kept coming on which I found annoying.  I finally read the instructions and the red light indicates you are putting too much pressure on the brush.  Now, no more red light.  I like this feature.  I\u2019m not using any of the phone bells and whistles.  I just wanted a good electric toothbrush and feel as if I got that.  I would buy this model again when the time comes.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1594771200000}

I went from string floss to the little plastic things to this and the angle makes it easy to get in and out without cutting off the circulation of your fingers or gagging with your fist in your mouth.

{"reviewTitle":"Great value, packaging is also in another language","reviewDescription":"I compared them with the much more expensive ones I bought from the local supermarket here in America, and these appear to be legitimate Oral B made replacements. The only thing unusual is that much of the language on the package is written in Polish in addition to English. I'm guessing they sell these for less of a mark-up in Europe than they do in America (the retail price of these in the USA is ridiculous), but that's just a guess. I have been using one for a few weeks, and it works and cleans just like the ones I've bought from the store.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1617667200000}
