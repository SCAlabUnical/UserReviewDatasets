{"reviewTitle":"Great, affordable hairdryer with a couple caveats","reviewDescription":"This is a great little hairdryer, with a couple caveats.  It does feel a little cheap; however, I am through buying super expensive luxury hairdryers, as they break just as often as the cheaper ones.  I bought a very pricey hairdryer that only lasted 2 years!  So from now on, I'm buying affordable dryers, as I'm pretty hard on them.  This little dryer has excellent heat and speed control.  There are three reasons I gave it 4 stars:  1) I have very curly hair, so mainly use the diffuser attachment, and it's very small compared to most curly hair diffusers.  It also blows the air a little harder than I like, but it still works pretty well.  2) There were some rough edges on the teeth of the diffuser the first time I used it, and they were catching my hair and pulling it.  I scraped those off and it's been smooth sailing every since.  3) No hanging loop.  Overall, I recommend this dryer, just be aware that it does have a cheap feel and a very small diffuser for curly hair.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721865600000}

My mom seemed to be in love with her new Wavytalk Professional Hair Dryer I gave her as a Mother's Day gift. As someone with curly hair, she struggled with finding a dryer that enhances her natural waves without causing frizz. This dryer is a total game-changer.The diffuser attachment is amazing! It helps to define and dry her curls without leaving them crunchy or frizzy. The dryer itself is powerful but doesn't feel too heavy. The ionic technology is a definite plus as it leaves hair feeling soft and smooth. Plus, it dries hair surprisingly fast.We are impressed with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with curly or wavy hair!

{"reviewTitle":"Just not worth it","reviewDescription":"I picked this hair dryer in November of last year (it is now late August) with the hope that it would replace my old Revlon dryer and look a bit more sleek. Ultimately, it had too many problems and I have just ordered a replacement. But I hope my experience can prove useful.The first issue with the dryer was that it lacks a loop. I hang up my dryer with a loop, and I should have known right away this was going to be irritating to me - especially given that part of the reason for the purchase was aesthetic.The second issue was that it didn\u2019t seem to be even a mild improvement from my prior hairdryer even though that one cost a fraction of this one. It wasn\u2019t faster. It wasn\u2019t quieter. It was weaker, so I did find it was better on my hair, but I\u2019d rather have a full speed dryer I can just make cooler.The last issue developed over time. Within the last few months, I\u2019ve noticed that the handle gets hot. Others have mentioned that here as well, so it\u2019s not just a lemon. Something about this dryer is sending heat into the handle, and it\u2019s deeply concerning to me. I have a sneaking suspicion something is about to break or melt in the unit, and I don\u2019t want to risk it happening while I\u2019m using it.Honestly, I\u2019d just stick to the more reputable brands. These private-label brands are a dime a dozen on Amazon, but you\u2019re not actually getting a deal.

I wanted a more compact\/lightweight  but affordable option for travel. (Overweight bag fees suck when you have a heavy dryer)  SO in my search i came across the Wavy talk hairdryer and it seemed super promising after looking at tons of other options.. it filtered in the high wattage category somehow but now i see it is only 1500 watts but plenty of thick haired ladies gave it great reviews. My only assumption is that their hair either is not very thick or they have not experienced the magic of a 2200w hair dryer. I know the new technology of the dyson type hair dryers have lower wattage so it still should have been slightly better than it was. But at the rate of dying time the WavyTalk dryer gave me i may as well not pack a dryer and use the conair cheepy hair dryer that come in a lot of hotel rooms. But vacation time is precious and i don't want to spend an hour in my room blow drying my hair if i have a special event i need to use it - most of the time i will let y hair go au naturale curly\/wavy but i want a hair dryer with me just in case which is why its important it was not heavy. which it wasn't too heavy but its lightweightness didn't match the weak drying.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718668800000}

{"reviewTitle":"I would not recommend the product","reviewDescription":"I purchased this hair dryer since it was less bulky than my Conair and the Ionic feature was appealing. The size is great, easy to handle. It doesn\u2019t feel to heavy that my arm gets tired from blow drying my hair. It comes with two add-ons, a concentrator and a difusor. It also isn\u2019t as loud as an older hair dryer which is a nice feature as well. The reason I would not recommend this product is because your hair gets sucked in and caught on the motor on the back of the hair dryer. I have never had this issue before and it is become an issue every time I use this product. I began to notice this issue when I would use the difusor. I have long, curly hair so I enjoy using the difusor option. I was bending over, had my hair flipped over my head and began diffusing my hair. Since you have to diffuse your roots, I moved the hair dryer close to my root which the rest of my hair fell over the hair dryer. I started to feel a tug on my hair and noticed that the motor on the back of the hair dryer had pulled my hair in. Even though the hair dryer has a cap that covers the motor, it still is able to pull your hair through. Additionally, since my hair ended up getting caught in the motor, the strands started to burn. Even if you remove the cap, you can\u2019t access the motor so I was unable to pull the strand of hairs out from the motor. When I use the hair dryer now, it emits a burnt smell since my hair is still wrapped into the motor. It\u2019s unfortunate that you can\u2019t use this hair dryer to its full capabilities. It also raises a concern that the motor can get tangled in the strands of hair it sucks in. I should be able to place the hair dryer in and out of my hair to be able to properly diffuse so not be able to diffuse my hair makes me regret buying this hair dryer. I would prefer to spend more money on a quality product that works to its full capacity.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1662940800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Pleasantly surprised! Less than 1 min\/per section on 4a long hair","reviewDescription":"I used this for the first time last night. I presectioned my hair into  4 quartes for 8 sections total with those split in half. Sprayed a Whole Blends moisturizing heat protectant and put them in bantu knots until time to blow dry. I have hair that is completely shrunken when air dried. I'm talking higher than shoulders. When straight in is within 3 inches of my bottom.  I was extremely impressed with this blowdryer. I spent less than 1 minute blow-drying each section. I used a small pump of Garnier fructise frizz\/ sleek serum and went to work. It's not as straight as using a paddle brush. I started with that but my hair is took kinky for that. I swapped to this with the comb attachment. That comb is strong. Detangle first and you will be fine. I put tension on the hair by pulling on the section. I straighten my hair twice a year for a trim to even it. This is a champ. I have recommended it to others. We all have rather dense thick curly hair. It's small enough to travel with if that's your thing. My hair feels pretty smooth no doubt aided by the serum used. The cord length was sufficient. So far there isn't anything I dislike. I do wish it came with some kind of storage box or bag to keep it contained. None of them do though. It's a simple, yet strong little blow dryer. It should get the task done for all types of hair.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724544000000}

{"reviewTitle":"The cool air option is not that cool...  La opci\u00f3n de aire fr\u00edo no es realmente tan fr\u00edo....","reviewDescription":"[Mis comentarios en Espa\u00f1ol est\u00e1n al final del texto en ingles]I must say this is a nice small and light weight hair dryer. I loved the perl pink color and the warm air power options were good; I bought it after doing some research based on reviews. However, I had another hair dryer before from a different brand which had the cool air option and that dryer had a really cool blow even when being used at its maximum blowing power. Before that dryer I never looked for this feature before when using other dryers but I must say it is a VERY nice and refreshing feature to use before finishing your hair drying. Therefore, I definitely wanted to have it with my new hair dryer but the \"cool\" air was just less warm, never really cold or cool, and, as mentioned, felling the cool air before finishing is just too good to not have it. So, I am returning it to probably get one from the brand I previously had. No picture or video can actually show what I am pointing out, but those who have used a really cool air blow option may clearly understand what I am referring to.Debo decir que este es un secador de pelo peque\u00f1o y liviano. Me encant\u00f3 el color rosa perla y las opciones de potencia de aire caliente eran buenas; lo compr\u00e9 despu\u00e9s de investigar un poco en funci\u00f3n de las rese\u00f1as. Sin embargo, antes tuve otro secador de pelo de una marca diferente que ten\u00eda la opci\u00f3n de aire fr\u00edo y ese secador ten\u00eda un aire realmente fr\u00edo incluso cuando se usaba con su m\u00e1xima potencia de soplado. Antes de ese secador, nunca busqu\u00e9 esta funci\u00f3n cuando usaba otros secadores, pero debo decir que es una funci\u00f3n MUY agradable y refrescante para usar antes de terminar de secar el cabello. Por lo tanto, definitivamente quer\u00eda tenerlo con mi nuevo secador de pelo, pero el aire \"fr\u00edo\" era menos c\u00e1lido, nunca realmente fr\u00edo o fresco y, como mencion\u00e9, sentir el aire fr\u00edo antes de terminar es demasiado bueno para no tenerlo. Entonces, lo devolver\u00e9 para probablemente obtener uno de la marca que ten\u00eda anteriormente. Ninguna imagen o video puede mostrar realmente lo que estoy se\u00f1alando, pero aquellos que han usado una opci\u00f3n de aire realmente fr\u00edo pueden entender claramente a qu\u00e9 me refiero.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1724112000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Hair Dryer Disappointed, Here is Why\u2026","reviewDescription":"First, I think this ionic hair dryer performs admirably for the low price point of $40.00. I like that the cool button delivers cold air promptly unlike my current hair dryer. Also, I like that it has a cool temperature setting, so u can move the switch to this setting and not have to worry about holding down the cold button. It\u2019s convenient for when I want to wrap up my hair styling by locking the follicles in place with blasts of cold air.Moving on, the hair dryer has a moderately powerful engine that delivers a satisfactory amount of air to your hair, but it is less powerful than my current hair dryer.There are two settings for controlling the amount of air flow. Honestly, the slower speed is just too darn slow to be effective at drying my hair in any kind of timely basis. It just doesn\u2019t move enough air even for a slow setting. That leaves the high speed option. For me with hair that isn\u2019t too long, the high speed setting it is good enough. However, others might find having a much less powerful slow air flow setting as problematic.Another downside, for me at least, is that this hair dryer is heavier than I had expected. It\u2019s not like it weighs a ton, but it does weigh almost exactly as much as my larger professional mid-ranged priced hair dryer, much to my surprise. (After re-reading my review, I think that I should cite the cost of my current hair dryer since I\u2019m using it to compare; it cost me $60.00 two years ago.)This is minor, but I also don\u2019t like the power cord on this unit. It\u2019s a regular cord that u might have on any low-end hair dryer. It\u2019s no comparison to the thick long protective power cord on my current hair dryer that resists getting tangled, which is a handy perk.I hadn\u2019t even considered looking at the hair dryer design to check that it had some kind of loop to hang it in my bathroom, which is exactly how I have stored a couple of hair dryers I have gone through over the years. That\u2019s a big problem for me as space is at a premium in my bathroom. I definitely don\u2019t want to have to pull out a hair dryer from below the sink every day to use it.Now, I did by chance find a possible solution while looking at alternative hair dryers. There is a small plastic shelf that u can stick to your bathroom wall. It has an opening in the middle of the shelf for this hair dryer and many types of ionic styled hair dryers to easily slide into; it costs less than $10.00. So that\u2019s a good option that I\u2019m probably going to go with on my next hair ionic hair dryer.Consequently, bc of the weight that I consider to be too much, sadly I\u2019m returning this hair dryer. I have looked at other ionic hair dryers and I selected one that had thousands of positive reviews and that has a price point of $120.00. Obviously, that is a sizable jump in price from this unit; however, I figure I need to spend more if I want a lighter hair dryer with a thicker protective power cord that will not twist itself into a tangled mess.For the price point of just $40.00, u get what u pay for with this hair dryer. It\u2019s not going to be a light weight ionic hair dryer, but it is an ionic hair dryer that will likely deliver much better results to your hair than a similarly priced regular hair dryer that u might find on Amazon or at a box store like Target or Walmart.You know from my review that u aren\u2019t getting a super powerful hair dryer here. It is not bad but it\u2019s still less than great. Therefore, if u have a lot of hair that u need to dry, this unit is not for u. It comes with a couple attachments but no magnetic interface on the dryer. You cannot hang this dryer from a loop on the unit, but u can buy a plastic shelf for a small amount of money that will serve u well I imagine.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"60 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703980800000}

I have medium length hair that is dense but fine and I wanted something smaller then traditional hairdryers due to my arms being short. I will update if something goes wrong with this product.Complaints:1.The switches to turn on the hair dryer do not match up with the air flow\/heat setting you're going for. That could be more of a spot on thing.2. When using the diffuser I have to section my hair & diffuse that way or else my hair will get sucked onto the vent. (You would really have to try to get your hair caught into the fan, but its possible through the vent.

The first time it happened I put it down to user error and in the future I had to be more careful. However, today I was drying my 5 y.o. Nieces hair which is super long and it happened again. This time the suction power of the dryer pulled her hair in from a good distance. I was being careful, running it on the lowest settings and I was not distracted. The damage was minimum because it was only 10 strands of hair but the fear was real. It pulled the hair in with force. I was lucky that I reacted quickly and was able to turn it off before it pulled closer to the rest of her hair and sucked more in. It\u2019s a great diffuser hair dryer for rollers or scrunched curled hair but I won\u2019t be using around young children or to blow dry loose straight hair. I think it\u2019s due to the lack of a rounded back air intake and removable filter.

I use a dryer 5-7days a week. Thank goodness I had an old $10crap basic dryer that's yrs & yrs old that still works for backup. I just like a dryer with features like this one. I'm so bummed it didn't last...***update** the seller issued me a new dryer free of charge. I'm glad to have a blow dryer again& appreciate the extra mile that was done by seller to make things rightm","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698969600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Seller doesn't respond","reviewDescription":"I read the reviews on this product and several others before I finally made my decision.  For the first week or so the hairdryer was great and the attachments were exactly what I wanted.  A few weeks ago I messaged the seller asking what can be done as the attachment I use daily just falls off as I'm using it.  I have to wait a few minutes to attach it again as it is very hot.  Its to the point now it falls off every few seconds I'm using the hairdryer.  The thing that bothers me the most is the seller just ignores your concern .  The hair dryer is decent and does what I was hoping to find but the hair attachments is what I really am aggravated about since I use it daily to eliminate frizz.  Do your homework before buying from this seller.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"82 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695513600000}

I reset the cord and finally I got it to work. After 10 seconds it sparked and burnt my arm. I smelled smoke and immediately unplugged it. My husband tried turning it on again and the same thing happened. I will not be using it again. Not taking any chances and burning myself again, let alone possibly burning my house down. Unfortunately it's outside of the return window. I wish I would have gotten more than 6 months out of it.

I only used it twice a week heavily, and maybe a minute each day. So I can't attribute it to overuse.

I used it tonight and I put it on high heat with high blowing and immediately it smelled toasty. Which kinda worried me. It smelled like something was burning. It wasn't right.
