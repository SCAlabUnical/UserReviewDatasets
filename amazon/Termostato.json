{"reviewTitle":"Not really that smart - interface is difficult","reviewDescription":"Latest Edit #3  (upgrade to 3 stars): just FYI\u2026 Amazon customer service will contact you if you leave a bad review. lolI didn\u2019t have time to spend with them on the phone, but I kept fiddling with these thermostats until I  finally have a reasonable setting. The interface in the Alexa App is somewhat confusing. Imagine that! There are two different  \u201cauto\u201d modes. One is a scheduled mode for temp ranges pre-set in 3 categories of home, away, and sleep. That\u2019s your only choices. You must preset the preferred temp ranges and make a control schedule and set it to auto. This differs from the auto control choice which uses hunches to automatically change thermostat to the preferred temp ranges set for home, away, and sleep. If you choose the hunches option, it will not work correctly unless everyone in the house connects their smart phone to the thermostat so Alexa can \u201ctrack you in the background\u201d (bad idea) to determine through hunches whether anyone is at home or everyone is sleeping. That just does not work for me.Thankfully, I don\u2019t feel like I completely wasted my money, but these thermostats only get 3 stars because: 1) the Alexa app (always trouble to find\/control anything) is particularly cumbersome for these devices and confusing to navigate. 2) the inability to set a true time schedule at a specific temperature which can hold automatically. 3) no option to create a custom temp range other than the 3 offered.PROS: the thermostats are streamlined and look nice and are reasonably easy to install if you have basic electrical knowledge. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll probably need assistance from a professional. The auto switch between heat and AC to keep the temp range is nice. You can control it well from your phone with the Alexa app. Having their own app which is easier to navigate might be helpful. Controlling the thermostats by voice through the dot or echo (as with all things) is hit and miss.Edit #2 - After fiddling with these things a bit more, I came back and reduced this review from 2 starts to 1 star. Awful! Can\u2019t get rid of the darn \u201chunches\u201d setting even after turning it off. Argh!The auto range to set temps whether in the Auto setting or with a schedule does not allow for heat and cool temp to be set close enough together. You\u2019re constantly either on too high of a setting for cool or too low of a setting for heat. You never have a truly comfortable setting.1st review: You are stuck using temperature ranges for Home, Away, or Sleep functions without the ability to SET a specific temp at a certain time.The old thermostats I had where I had to manually go through and set a schedule at least kept my house reasonably comfortable. With these so-called smart thermostats we are either too hot or too cold because the temperature ranges will not allow us to set it where it\u2019s comfortable.In the end, this thermostat is not really that smart and makes me feel dumb for buying not one, but two, of these things. I will probably just end up reinstalling my old ones again. Ugh! What a waste of money because I can\u2019t send them back since I\u2019ve been trying to learn to use them, and my return window has closed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"66 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704931200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Works with 2-wire systems w\/ C wire transformer (but could be better as a smart thermostat)","reviewDescription":"I'll first talk about installation, and then the actual review. Overall, this smart thermostat is fine. I wouldn't give it an A+ but wouldn't give it an F, either. It maintains the temperature, and passes that initial test well. But you generally want more out of a smart thermostat, and this one is just sort of okay on that front. It's cheap, and very basic, and you get what you pay for.INSTALLATION WITH 2-WIRE SYSTEM (NO C WIRE)So, I was unsure whether this would work with our ancient wall heater, which runs on a 2 wire system with no C wire. But after doing some digging around, I figured out that it might work, and indeed, it does. Quite well, in fact. Which is great, because the simple mercury thermostat our landlord installed was terrible, and couldn't read temperature correctly, so it was always boiling hot or freezing cold, and if we forget to turn off the heater at night, we're screwed.What you need to install this with a simple 2-wire system without a C wire is a C wire transformer\/adapter. Don't get the C wire adapter option offered with this device, that's not what you need if like me you live in a house that just has a single wall heater with a thermostat, and that's it. You need a transformer to take the place of a C wire to power the device. You can get these on Amazon. The brand\/model I got is Viivria 24 volt Transformer, C Wire Adapter, with a 30 foot cable, and it was about $14-15. Any similar transformer adapter should work. Yes, the cable is a bit ugly, but it's necessary and it works. You can always tuck it away next to molding or otherwise camouflage it.The transformer has two raw metal cable ends. These need to be secured into the C and Rc ports (you will need to slide down the little blue cover to expose the Rc port). This will power the thermostat. Then secure your red cable to the R port and the white cable to the W port. These usually are literally colored red (or red stripe) and white, but just make a note of which cables you disconnect from the old thermostat. One is usually connected to a port that connects to a literally red wire in old style analog thermostats, that wire coming out of the wall is your R cable.Once all these wires are connected, secure it to the wall, plug in the adapter, and go through normal set up. If you have a wall heater like I do, have Alexa treat it as a forced air heater. It works perfectly fine.PROS & CONS REVIEWPros- Really the main pro is being able to control temperature pretty effectively. I haven't tried to change the temperature while out of the house yet, and am not yet sure if I'll be able to do so. For example, if we leave the house and want to shut off the heater manually, I'm not sure yet if that'll work.- It is indeed adaptable for simpler heating systems, and given that I got it for $40 on sale, I didn't mind spending an extra $15 for a transformer to make it work.Cons- There are a few cons. For example, the mounting plate, which is needlessly huge and wide, with no option for changing the orientation of the plate. I suppose this is to cover those giant, wide thermostat footprints, but there's no option to make it vertical, so it didn't work in the spot our thermostat is in, which is right next to a door frame. I might look for a third party mounting plate just to make it a bit nicer.- The controls for brightness, etc., are buried deep in the Alexa app, and it's annoying to go through so many steps to get to them.- The controls in general are really limited. For example, I'd like to have the room cool down gradually over the course of the evening, and set it quite cold at night while asleep, to save energy. But you can only choose three temperature settings, you can't set temperature for individual times.- Alexa voice controls are not great. They are extremely limited, and there's not really a good list of commands that will be recognized. There are some things that Alexa inexplicably won't do. Alexa will also turn the thermostat OFF but won't turn it ON. If you ask Alexa to turn the display brightness to 0, Alexa will turn the whole thing off, and then won't turn it back on. There's no real way to adjust the brightness without going many layers deep into the app.I definitely wouldn't pay any more than $40 for this thing, and that's about the price I paid. It's the cheapest of the smart thermostats, and it shows in usage, but it gets the job done. If you want a smart thermostat to save some money on heating, have a simple two wire system, and you are already using the Alexa environment, and you're on a budget, then if you can find it on sale and get a 24 volt transformer adapter, it'll work fairly well, albeit simply. If you want more robust controls, then it might be worth looking into more expensive devices like the Nest or Ecobee, etc.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"121 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670803200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great Thermostat with a fatal flaw - no remote temperature sensor functionality","reviewDescription":"This is a great thermostat, with one fatal, very frustrating flaw for my household, that has me on the verge of scrapping it and moving on to something else. For some reason Amazon has not enabled any kind of remote temperature sensor functionality, so you are forced to control the temperature for your whole house based on the one location the thermostat is installed.Welcome to 1980, with Alexa integration and a digital readout, lol. (I worked for years in HVAC back then, I speak from experience.)It's all the more frustrating given the Amazon Echo devices, of which I own FIVE, have temperature sensors built into them.  So why does Amazon, who markets both of these devices, not allow the thermostat to use the temperature readings from the Echo devices as control points?It would be child's play programming wise for them to update the thermostat so it would allow using its internal temperature reading, or allow you to select the reading from a remote Echo, or an average of selected Echos, etc., but it totally does not do that, nor do they offer stand-alone remote sensors. This should be a setting within Alexa for the thermostat, but it's simply absent, you have one choice, the thermostat's internal temperature sensor. Well, that's not a choice I guess, lol.You can try to write routines in Alexa to control the thermostat using the temperature readings from an Echo as a trigger, but to say it's kludgy is an understatement. Once you think through the ungainly logic to make it work, which requires alternately setting the thermostat high and low, the routines will stop running, randomly, and suddenly you're sitting there, wondering why it feels hot or cold. I've been messing with that, trying to get it to work for a week now with two different (new) echos, but my research indicates many others have tried this, and ran into same issues, with Amazon seemingly unwilling to help.Even if the routine worked well, it's a joke to have to control the thermostat this way. Making temperature changes requires going into two separate routines, changing a setting with a slider, then running them both again, all to see them stop running randomly a few hours later, aaaagh!I have many Amazon devices, I generally love their stuff, but it saddens me that they won't fix this thermostat to properly use Echo devices as remote temperature sensors, so it appears this one will be going in the trash for me, sad because I really like it otherwise.Amazon, for the love of all that is technical, have your programmers spend a couple hours, and add the ability to use the readings of one, or better yet, an average of Echo devices as temperature sensors. You could market this on both sides, sell more thermostats, sell more Echos, why aren't you doing this?Summary:If you have a situation where your thermostat is perfectly positioned to reflect the temperature of your house, and where you spend your time, this thermostat will work great for you, but if not, like 90% of the households out there, save your money for something with remote temperature sensor functionality, it will greatly increase your comfort levels.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"128 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696204800000}

There should be some more features like support for TOU power plans, additional temperature settings. (More than Sleep, Wake, Gone, Return.) Even the ability to schedule the fan separate from heating\/cooling.There is no easy way to resume the schedule once you have manually changed the temperature.

I was going to eventually get around to setting up Home Assistant primarily for this, but there isn't any integration for it. You can use a workaround to send a faked ausio signal to Alexa to change the temp, but I wanted a card widget for my Dashboard like how the Alexa app has.

It will not do it through voice control. This should be easy folks. The 20+year old thermostat I replaced allowed the fan to be cycled. I had hoped for some improvement in the last couple of decades.  Other than that, it keep the temperature pretty constant.

{"reviewTitle":"Works, look great, and cheap, but frequently loses wifi connection","reviewDescription":"Bought 2 of these during Prime Days for $40 each, got a $50 rebate from my state so ended up being only $15 each.  For that kind of deal I really cannot complain much, as these look great and work great as thermostats (though the on-screen controls are a bit wonky and take getting used to).  When connected to wifi they work great with better controls available from the Alexa app, and I finally figured out how to talk to Alexa to control them.  I did set a schedule but am not employing it yet (not cold enough yet), preferring just to turn them on and off manually as needed.  I have not tried Alexa's \"hunch-based\" automatic control and really don't plan to for a number of reasons.BUT, they both periodically lose their wifi connection for brief periods.  These are my second set after returning the first set for this reason, and they all act the same way.  It could be my network environment, as I do have a mesh wifi system with dual band, the Asus ZenWifi AX Mini, and employ its \"Dual-Band Smart-Connect (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz)\" which senses and automatically places devices on the fastest band and the node with the strongest connection.  This seems to work great with our smart phones so don't plan to disable the feature.  So instead in the router settings I \"bound\" them to the node with the strongest connection and forced them to connect only to the 2.4 GHz band (this latter step is likely overkill as these devices only connect to 2.4 GHz).  When it continued to happen I manually assigned a static IP address for each.  I'd like to say these steps helped, but the thermostats still routinely drop their connection for minutes at a time before reconnecting.In conclusion, these work for what we need, look great, are cheap (particularly for us), and are a big upgrade from our old and yellowing fully-manual Honeywell thermostats.  But since they're supposed to be \"smart devices\" and cannot be reliably smart with intermittent connectivity problems, I'm giving this product a 3-star rating.  It looks like I'm not alone out there with this problem, but it seems a vast majority of buyers are not reporting this problem - which is why I suspect it might be something in my home environment.I should mention that in my 20-year old house (which we bought 10 years ago) the c-wire DID exist but was NOT connected to the furnaces.  They were also cut way back at both ends, and I had to splice them and connect them (I'm an amateur DIYer and not an electrician).  So I also wonder if the furnaces in my home have unreliable low voltage in their common connectors?  They didn't register a steady 24v when I tested the thermostat-end with my voltmeter, but again I'm an amateur so don't know if I'm just not testing correctly.  These work well enough for what we need, and I'm not about to replace our furnaces for just this reason if it is the problem, so we'll just deal with the finicky wifi connection and hope for a firmware push by Amazon that resolves it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667260800000}

{"reviewTitle":"UPDATE on Incompatible with new heat pump system","reviewDescription":"Installation and basic operation:I am replacing a Honeywell connected t-stat on my 1-year old heat pump.  After trying for several hours, I gave up on the installation of this t-stat.  Nothing seemed to get the unit to recognize that I have a heat pump. After finally getting to a somewhat technical person at Amazon, they were unable to help trouble shoot, so sent a new unit. In the mean time, I reviewed the installation instructions several times. In the previous version of the Alexa instructions in the tiny video loop playing at the top of the instructions (in the installation\/wiring section), I finally noticed that the Y wire was shown connected to the L terminal for heat pumps. On my old T-stat and in my air handler, my Y wire is connected to the Y terminal for conventional and heat pumps.  So, when installing the replacement t-stat, I tried connecting the Y wire to the L\/A terminal in the wiring block.  This seemed to work, except heat came on rather than cold.  Updated installation instructions asked if the unit was blowing hot or cold and I selected hot.  The unit switched the setting automatically and now all works as expected. So installation problems solved. So beware if you have a heat pump, the old Y wire becomes the L\/A wire and old W goes to AUX-E.Operation\/Control:The basic program provided through Alexa allows only three pre-named settings (sleep, away, home) and only allows four choices per day(home, away, home, sleep).  And it assumes you always want the same temperature when you are home. Unlike the Amazon SW engineers that get up and go to work, my family works from home. I also do different things during the day, like exercise , cook, relax.  We need more options and different names. (ex. morning, afternoon, evening, exercise, relax, etc.)  For me \"away\" would be more than a work day and more like \"vacation\".  The SW does not allow customization of names.  Hunches only works with the sleep and away settings, so it basically becomes useless to me.  My work around is routines in Alexa.  Unfortunately,  I must adjust temperatures in the winter because \"auto\" mode does not work as expected \/ like other thermostats with routines.  Users should be able to set ranges via routines so auto mode works like it should.A few other strange issues.1. If the mode is set to \"auto\", Alexa will not adjust the temperature by voice command. If I'm hot and it's in auto mode, I should be able to tell Alexa to reduce the temperature by 1 degree, etc.  2.  On Echo Show devices, Ask Alexa to show the thermostat and it refuses.  If instead I ask \"Alexa, what is the thermostat set to?\" it then shows thermostat controls.  3.  While \"hunches\" are an interesting idea, I don't see them ever working satisfactorily .  For example, Alexa can only guess I went to bed AFTER I went to bed and turned off all the lights.  I want the house to cool down for sleeping BEFORE I get in bed. Houses don't cool down quickly.  4. As mentioned, the scheduling options are very limited and were obviously defined by working folks on typical schedules. More flexibility and control would be a great SW update.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1654819200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good for simple systems, Not good for more complicated systems","reviewDescription":"Our experience, admittedly, is not the norm so I want to give a little grace, but we ended up paying more to fix Amazons mistake than we did for the actual devices.We have a complicated set up. We have a large home that has 3 zones. So we bought 3 thermostats. We have both forced air\/heat pump and geothermal. While we did have some initial issues with the traditional thermostat setup, we were able to call tech support and get that one installed and working fine. It was only a minor hick-up and if that were the only issue I would have given this 4 stars.  The rub came with the geothermal. We called tech support and they had us install them the same way, days go by and the aux heat keeps kicking on. We call tech support again. We get escalated to the second level of tech support because it\u2019s geothermal. After an hour of troubleshooting, ohmsing the wires, and reinstalling the darn thing 3 times, they told us that the thermostat was defective and wished us luck like it wasn\u2019t their problem. So with no heat, we had to put in a call to our servicer only to pay $350 for them to come out and tell us that amazon had the wire configuration wrong because geothermal requires a slightly different configuration and that there was a setting on the thermostat that had to be enabled physically for geo thermal to work. It\u2019s insane that a third-party knew more about Amazon\u2019s product than it\u2019s level two technical support. So major stars off there.For every other normal buyer, I will say having moved from a house with a Honeywell smart system, this one isn\u2019t as good. I HATE having to use the Alexa app. The thermostats are buried in the app and hard to get to, I would rather have a standalone app like the wifi system has. The Alexa app is just noisy. We are beginning to move away from Alexa due to the chatter and ads so I don\u2019t see us using these for more than a few years.Finally, the lack of features is a bit disappointing. If my auxiliary heat\/emergency heat is coming on, I want a notification. We went a few days with it running on one thermostat before we realized it. That\u2019s the problem with the Alexa app integration. The notifications suck. No way to customize and it\u2019s cumbersome to use. Definitely will be looking for something a bit cleaner in the future. Meanwhile, it\u2019s just meh.I\u2019ll also give a pro tip, if you have a multi-zone home, make sure to label your QR codes during install. You will need to rescan that if you ever need to reset the thermostat and if you have more than one you may mix them up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1678406400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good for a first try but could be better","reviewDescription":"tldr; a great start for Amazon getting into the thermostat business but needs improvement all the way around.BACKGROUND~~~~~~~~~~~I'm coming from an original Nest Thermostat which I've been using for over 6 years -- yes, it still works. So, why did I decided to switch? Well, I like new tech and I decided about 8 months that I really hate having multiple eco-systems of smart products. So, I selected Amazon a while back. I've been replacing my cams from Wyze and Ring to Ring. We've got about 10 Echo devices. You can say we are almost fully vested.COST~~~~This was a great deal. For about $50, you get a fully functioning smart thermostat. I didn't have a proper C-wire (supplies constant power to thermostat) so I had to get the Honeywell C-Wire kit. This is the kit that costs about $20 more which is auto selected if you choose the \"no c-wire\" model at the product page.INSTALLATION~~~~~~~~~~~The easiest part of the installation was opening the box. Overall, it took one hour to install including the c-wire adapter. 30 minutes of that was trying to put back on the furnace covers (@#$@!). Again, you don't have to worry about the c-wire adapter and opening the furnace if you already have a c-wire ran. You can check for the c-wire by popping open your current thermostat and seeing if there's a connection to \"c-wire\" or looking for an extra unused wire if you currently have a \"dumb\" thermostat.Amazon says there are stickers to label your wires but there was not! I checked, double-checked, and triple-checked. I'm so glad that my 6 year Nest came with some because I had already taken the time to label the wires. This was a bummer. It may make hooking up the wires to the new thermostat a real pain in the butt for some. Oh, and the honeywell kit also said it had labels. Guess what? Nope. :(Only if you don't have a c-wire run....They have you install the c-wire adapter first so you can have constant power running to the thermostat. That part was pretty easy but you have to be comfortable taking apart the furnace doors and rewiring to an adapter. ALWAYS TAKE PICTURES OF WIRES BEFORE DOING ANY SORT OF OF THIS TYPE OF WORK. You always want a reference.Let me complain about the alexa app a bit. Amazon tried. They really tried but damn. I can see this a deal breaker for many. So, check this out, you use your Alexa app to setup the thermostat. You crack open this app FIRST before doing anything else so it can guide you through the entire process. Before you do anything you want to also make sure you have the latest app version installed as well. Go to your app store and make sure to download the latest version.That being said, the Alexa app itself guides the user through the process. No videos. It's just text and picture. While it is laid out nicely, it can get confusing for some people. There needs to be more clarification on some of the steps. Perhaps a video?One of the most annoying parts of the app is that while you put your phone down to do some steps, you come back and the app quits the process. You are at the main screen! No joke. You have to literally go through all the steps again to get back to where you left off. I had to do this about 7 times. It was super annoying. Amazon, you must do something to correct this. It is super annoying.As far as the rest of the installation, it was pretty straightforward. If you wired a thermostat before, you'll get through this. Again, super annoying with the app  reverting to the begining due to timing out.I noticed that the wires in the closure were a super tight fit. At one point I closed the latch and the small closure bulched out. I had to re-open and re-position cables. That took a bit to re-adjust.The optional decorative plate (presumably to hide wall holes or imperfections), I could not get flat. It seemed thin and flimsy. When looking from an angle, you can tell a bit. :(The thermostat itself snapped real easily to the connection plate. No issues there. Pretty solid.SETUP~~~~~The thermostat fired up once I turned the power back on to the hvac. The alexa app took about 2 minutes to talk to the thermostat to connect and configure it. This part was automatic.PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you look at the thermostat itself it can be confusing even though it's simple. The arrows dissapear. The arrows I think need to be there so that anyone can understand where to press the buttons to turn up or down temp.DIGITAL\/GUI FUNCTIONALITY~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The thermostat function seems buried in the alexa app. I know you can set favorites, but there should be a way to have it up as soon as you open alexa app. I know the entire purpose is to use alexa via voice but still.How about some dedicated widgets for the thermostat? Something we can throw on the phone home screen so we can easily adjust temperature?Another note. My wife also has the alexa app with her own account. She is part of the household. She cannot see the thermostat to adjust in the app. :( I'll have to investigate this more.CONCLUSION~~~~~~~~~~~Great start. Would I buy it again? Sure. Why? Because it's nice and simple. There really isn't anything that can't be solved with a software update on this one.Be sure to check with your local utility company as you can essentially get a rebate for it making it 'free.'","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"1,427 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636243200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Works with single stage cooling - not with 2 stage heat pumps - CHECK YOUR SYSTEM FIRST!","reviewDescription":"Four Stars to get your attention. There is nothing wrong with this device - there IS something wrong with the way I bought and tried to use it - totally my fault.This is a great thermostat IF you have single stage cooling. Easy to install, easy to program, easy to link to Alexa and Ring. (That's why I bought it - I'm kind of obsessed with Home Automation.) The price is great! But ... I live in Florida and in Florida two-stage cooling is pretty common - at least in my neighborhood.Side note: I found out I had two stage cooling when, 1. the air temp coming out of the vents was significantly less cold than with the Honeywell T5 (that Alexa doesn't talk to, hence the Amazon thermostat) AND, 2. I actually READ the instructions that came with the Amazon device. Had I read the instructions as soon as I got it instead of procrastinating for 7 months, I probably could've returned it. The instructions say to call customer service if you have a 2nd stage wire ... I, of course, didn't call. There mightbe a work around for two stage cooling - I don't know. I used this as an excuse to buy the much more expensive Honeywell T9 and 2 extra room sensors which is WAY cooler and works really well with Ring and Alexa.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721606400000}

Bottom line the thermostat that did not work was now working and the thermostat that was working was no longer working. The culprit appeared to be the \u201cC\u201d wire.  At the furnaces the \u201cC\u201d wire was connected on one furnace but not on the other.  Bingo!

{"reviewTitle":"Know your existing system BEFORE deciding to purchase!","reviewDescription":"Full review below. Condensed version for those thinking about buying this item is right here:In order for this smart thermostat to be compatible with your HVAC system, you MUST have a minimum of 4 wires (conductors) going from your HVAC system to your thermostat. If you have 4 wires, you need the Honeywell C-wire adapter. If you have 5 wires, you are likely compatible and need no adapter. If you have any less than 4 wires (generally a heat-only system), you will need a 24-volt plug-in transformer to supply power to the smart thermostat (similar to the neutral wire required to install a smart switch). The plug-in transformers are frequently marketed to be used with smart doorbells, and look like a standard plug-in device you would use to charge or power a household device, but are designed to meet the specifications for a 24V device. The Amazon Smart Thermostat is ONLY compatible with 24 volt systems. If you question your existing system\u2019s voltage, do a google search for your thermostat\u2019s model number, and you\u2019ll likely be able to find out what voltage it is. If you are still uncertain, DO NOT PROCEED without consulting an HVAC professional. If you are uncertain of who to call, check your HVAC system. Installers generally leave a card or sticker attached to the unit in plain view with contact information.Updated review here\u2026scroll down further for original review!After a lengthy install (we opted to rewire instead of using a c-wire adapter\/transformer), I\u2019m fairly pleased with this thermostat. The Alexa app integration is great, and pairing it up with our Ring Alarm Pro makes it easy to use hunches within the Alexa app. Our system is a heat-only forced air furnace, with no air conditioner. We have had zero issues controlling the heat so far with this thermostat. There are numerous perks that come with using this thermostat alongside the Ring Alarm Pro, one of which is uninterrupted wifi via the built-in Eero Mesh router. If there is a lapse in our wifi (we have a crappy copper connection, no fiber\/fios in our neighborhood), we are covered and still connected via the Eero Mesh network. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the thermostat and it\u2019s features\/integrations. I look forward to seeing if Amazon will release room temp sensors that will work with this thermostat, as that is the only thing I feel is missing!Original review below>>>I purchased this thermostat after doing some research and answering the compatibility questions on the item\u2019s page. Amazon \u201csaid\u201d that the thermostat would be compatible if I installed the Honeywell C-wire adapter, so I purchased both the adapter and the thermostat at the same time. On arrival, I worked to get the adapter installed (a relatively simple task, similar difficulty level to replacing a light switch or outlet). I then went to the Alexa app to begin the thermostat\u2019s guided install process. The guided install took me through another set of compatibility questions that differed from the questions I was asked at the time of purchase. Had Amazon incorporated the same guided install questions into the pre-purchase questions, I would\u2019ve known that additional steps were needed and that the c-wire adapter that was purchased was NOT going to make the device compatible with my heat-only (2-conductor) system. Only after consulting with Honeywell who manufactures both the C-wire adapter and the Amazon smart thermostat, was  a solution reached. I was told to return the C-wire adapter and buy a 24V transformer adapter to provide power to the thermostat, making it compatible with my existing 2 wire system. I then consulted a friend who does commercial HVAC, and was told that if I thought it would be easy to do, I could always just install new wiring from my furnace to my thermostat using 5-conductor thermostat wire, and my issues would be resolved. If that wasn\u2019t a possibility, the 24V transformer would easily solve my wiring problem, just with additional wires running on the exterior of the wall, visibly instead of tucked inside the wall like the rest of the wires. I\u2019ve yet to get the thermostat installed due to the wiring issues, but will update this review with my thoughts about its overall function once it is installed!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"85 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666137600000}

It seems they are very interested in creating a working product that lasts a long time so I'll focus on the product itselfThe thermostat integrates obviously very well with Alexa. The biggest frustration is there being limited Alexa commands and routines available for the thermostat. Also, the programming function is a little funky, I should be able to change the thermostat to 'away' mode (with my preset temperatures) through a simple routine or voice command such as when I'm leaving the house on vacation. Another feature I would like to see is being able to change the temperature differential between the HVAC turning on and off, i.e. 2 degrees instead of the current 1\/2 or 1 degree. My unit turns on and off very frequently and runs for a short amount of time.All in all, it's a good unit typically with little issues doing what's it's supposed to do, but needs more effort from Amazons developer team to add some more functionality through software.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719792000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good thermostat, but not ready for primetime yet (Updated)","reviewDescription":"UPDATE 12\/27\/21: After a month it would fail to turn on the outside unit of my heat pump, only the inside unit, despite audibly clicking twice, and the Alexa app would say \"Delayed start\", as if it were on a cooldown timer, which the unit was not. This would happen both on scheduled times of temperature change and when manually changing it. Turning the breaker off and on would resolve the issue for a few hours before it would reappear. I ordered a replacement unit thinking that was the problem, but it did the same thing. I put my old \"dumb\" digital thermostat, the Lux TX9100E, for which there is a newer version (Amazon ID B00CX2QA3Y), back on and I haven't had a problem since.Changed star rating to 1 and will say to avoid this thermostat, it's not worth potentially risking damage to your system, especially when all of the issues mentioned in my original review were not addressed before the much larger issue occurred.-----------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This review pertains to the unit with Device Software Version 16843520 and Manufacturer Software Version 16844544.This is my first venture into a smart thermostat. I've wanted a Nest or one from Honeywell for a while, but their high price tags put me off. Enter the $60 Amazon Smart Thermostat. Installation was fairly easy, I say fairly because since the thermostat is small, the wiring can get cramped. The optional included backplate is quite large, which is a GOOD THING in my case as it easily covered several holes from previous thermostats. Connecting it to Alexa is also easy, just tell it to discover devices and it proceeds smoothly.There are a few negatives though. I waited 10 days to write this review hoping they would release an update that would fix them, but so far they have not.1) It has issue reconnecting to the network after a power loss. I had to pull it off the wall (it clips on to the mounting bracket) and put it back on to get it to reconnect after a few seconds long power failure today due to storms. My router is connected to a battery backup so it never lost power.2) The scheduling is very basic. You can only set 4 fixed temperature types (Work, Home, Away, Asleep) and assign them to certain times, and you can't adjust them differently. For example, you can't set 5AM and 5PM as \"at home\" and set the 5AM to 65\u00b0F and the 5PM one to 68\u00b0F, they both have to be the same. Also, as of this review anything you put in the Heat and Cool choices is changed by whatever you put in the Auto section, so it's only really possible to use it with Auto.3) Voice commands don't work well, or at all. When you say \"Alexa, what's the inside temperature\", it will often say \"Thermostat does not support this function\" when it does, same goes with humidity. Also when you say \"Alexa, raise the temperature by 2 degrees\", it may not work correctly, the last time I did that I wanted to raise it from 66\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F and the air conditioning came on because it had set the temperature to 64\u00b0F. There are also functions which are unable to (yet) be controlled with voice commands, such as turning the fan from Auto to On or Circulate, you have to use the Alexa app to do it.4) The display. Currently it will cycle between the Active and Inactive brightness at random, even when there is nobody and no sound in the room.5) This is a critical bug. About half the time when the heat is engaged it will also use supplementary heat (I have an electric heat pump with electric aux heat), even if the temperature outside is above 50\u00b0F, and it is just coming on to maintain temperature and been raised multiple degrees manually. Disconnecting the W2 wire fixes this, but also disables auxiliary and supplemental heat completely.6) There is no display for auxiliary heat in use on the thermostat nor in the Alexa app. Considering aux heat, especially on electric heat pumps, uses a large amount of energy, there should be some kind of display or, preferably, a popup notification.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"70 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1638835200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Missing Key Features - 8\/6\/23 Update, 8\/13\/23 Update","reviewDescription":"I purchased this to replace an older programmable thermostat that didn't have network\/internet connectivity.  First, you have to have (or create) an Alexa account to set up the wifi connection and control the thermostat.  The Alexa mobile app is very busy, and the thermostat functions take a bit of poking around to access.  A streamlined web interface (or ability to sidestep Alexa) would be better.We have kids and grandkids coming and going, so using the location services to tell when we leave the house doesn't work for us.  So I set up a schedule.  To my surprise, this thermostat only allows temperature settings for \"home\", \"sleep\" and \"away\".  My old programmable thermostat allowed several more temperature settings during each 24 hour period.I have not been able to figure out what Amazon's version of the \"hold\" button is.  If you change the temperature on the thermostat or the app, the schedule overrides it.  Seems like I have to go in and disable the schedule if I want to hold the temperature for an extended period.The limited temperature settings and no simple way to set and hold a temperature for a temporary period are fundamental flaws wtih this thermostat.  I would not have purchased had I known this.  I will gladly revise this review if anyone can help me solve these problems.8\/6\/23 Update - Amazon emailed me about the problems I am having with the thermostat.  The representative stated that any manual temperature settings\/changes will return to the temperature programmed in the schedule.  Apparently there is no \"hold\" button equivalent.  I will try to confirm with Amazon.The representative also addressed my problem with the limited number of temperature settings.  The Alexa app has a \"routines\" feature that allows you to schedule activities.  Using the \"routines\" feature, I set the thermostat to a different temperature from 6:30 AM to 8 AM.  This seems to be working, and apparently overrides the schedule programmed into the thermostat.  I'm glad this works, but the overlapping functionality of the schedule and \"routines\" makes things unnecessarily complicated.  Why not integrate that functionality into the schedule?  Or, since joining the Alexa cult is required to set up the thermostat, why not use the \"routines\" function exclusively?The absence of a \"hold\" button equivalent is a real problem for me.  I have the central air on the second floor of my house set to go up in temperature during the day when nobody is on that floor.  However, if we have company or something else going on and need to keep that floor cool, I'm not sure how to do that.  Hopefully Amazon has a work-around.8\/13\/23 Update - Amazon Tech Support confirmed that the only way to get the thermostat to hold a constant temperature is to deactivate the schedule function.  This requires digging multiple levels into the Alexa software to find the setting.  If you have one or more \"routines\" set up to control the thermostat, you have to disable the routines too, digging into different multiple levels of settings in Alexa.If anyone from Amazon reads these reviews, please add a \"hold\" function that's available on the front of the thermostat and on the main page of Alexa.  This is a basic thermostat function that should be easily accessed.  Additionally, the overlapping functionality of \"schedules\" and \"routines\" is confusing.  It would make more sense to give the \"schedules\" function more flexibility (ditch the limitations of \"home\", \"away\" and \"sleep\"), and leave the \"routines\" function for people who enjoy getting into the nitty gritty of the programming options.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"37 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690934400000}
{"reviewTitle":"You get what you pay for...","reviewDescription":"At first it was alright, I was excited, and it got the job done. The Alexa Hunches seemed like a really cool feature.First time trying the Alexa Hunches away mode, I left the house to visit my parents to carpool out of the state for a family visit, and it detected that I was Away not even a mile away from my house, great! So far so good! On the way home a few days later, I went to the app to set my thermostat to start heating up, just to realize that on the day I left it reset it back to Sleep mode, then back to normal mode in the morning, at the times I usually go to sleep in wake up; there was no one in the house during this time, and it did it each day I was gone. Now, it no longer detected when I'm away so I have to manually change it, then I have to change it again each morning since it resets it back to sleep mode and awake mode.Also, the store page says that you can tell Alexa \"I'm leaving\" but all this does is give you a response of \"Okay, I'll see you again soon!\" and it does not affect the thermostat at all.That was the first issue. A new issue arose months later. As it got cold, my heater was able to keep up with the help of the emergency heat that most houses around here have, the thermostat send the signal for the EmHeat to kick on as needed. And it did this for a couple months of cold. Then one day it got warm really quickly and it was still cold in my house, so my heater cut off because it was building up too much pressure, but the thermostat never sent the EmHeat signal...so my outdoor unit never kicked back on, and the fans would run nonstop while the thermostat would keep saying \"Heating\" as my house is getting colder an colder, and the only way to fix it was to go to the circuit breaker and turn off the heater from there, then turn it back on and wait for the delayed start (that's built into the thermostat, not the delay of me noticing that my heat isn't working which I've gotten pretty quick at with how often it's happened).My dad has been an HVAC tech for many decades and while he was trying to fix the issue, we realized that the app doesn't even have an option to manually trigger the EmHeat, despite a wire being hooked up for it on the thermostat. In all these decades, this is the only thermostat he's seen without that option. Today, it is really cold outside and my house is getting colder and colder as it struggles to heat my house without the EmHeat signal working, and there's nothing that can be done about it other than reinstalling the old, not smart thermostat.My dad says this is the worst thermostat he has ever worked with as an HVAC technician and says I should either swap to my old one or buy a Google Nest. It may be more expensive, but you really do get what you pay for. I would like to keep using this thermostat for the Alexa Hunches, but the hunches don't even work 99.99% of the time so there's really no point. Also, some of the energy saving programs and money saving programs that the electric provider offers only for smart thermostats are not eligible with the Amazon thermostat, but are eligible with the Google Nest, and there are no plans to add eligibility with this Amazon thermostat.Out of the many things I have ordered on Amazon, this is the only item I have felt deserves a 1-star review. Other items I've ordered are at least decent enough for a 2-star review at a minimum, but this thermostat is just a piece of junk and it feels like they didn't even try to make it decent, which is really sad considering it's an Amazon product.

{"reviewTitle":"My HVAC unit short-cycles, turning on and off again every 1-2 minutes, possibly destroyed my HVAC","reviewDescription":"Wow, I wish I'd researched this more before. Apparently, these thermostats can be extremely hard on HVAC units. There's no swing temperature setting, and the built-in swing seems to be very small, meaning in my case (in a hot climate) the hvac turns on off and on again every 1-2 minutes. That's called short-cycling. I sort of noticed it when I first installed them, but it was July in Texas so I thought the unit was just struggling to keep up. A year later my compressor died and shortly after the rest of the system (except ducting) had to be replaced, not sure its related but seems like it could be now that I know that it's short cycling my unit. I'm no hvac technician, but I know enough to know that's really bad. It took me a couple years to notice because it's an investment property I rent out full time. I installed the thermostats, called it a day and haven't lived in it until now. When I moved back in I immediately noticed my ducts leaking (which can be caused by short cycling) and then heard the unit clicking on 30 seconds to a minute and back off. I thought it was smart enough to just auto-set swing settings or something when I installed it, but no, just not an option from what I can tell now. Felt compelled to let new buyers know the risks. I highly recommend typing \"Amazon smart thermostat, \"short-cycling,\" \"still not fixed\" and related terms and see reddit discussions before buying. I would absolutely love Amazon staff to tell me I just need to change a setting before going back to traditional thermostats or buying a much more expensive smart one, but the customer support link doesn't seem to be available, probably since I bought this two years ago. And answers from staff on forums all say to reset the thermostat, which seems like a bot-like non-answer if indeed swing settings don't exist on them (and I've of course done that). So, maybe, don't buy if you're in a hot or cold climate? Honestly can't say, just do some research. If this was a forum I'd say dm me for free thermostats or if you find a solution.

{"reviewTitle":"Swing Temp Bug, Don't Buy","reviewDescription":"A lot of reviews that I read talked about having issues installing the thermostat, I didn't have any issues with the install and in fact everything works the way it is supposed to. My negative review comes after using the thermostat for 4 months and realizing that my hvac was always on and that my electric bill had drastically increased. After realizing that my hvac hardly ever turned off, I started to do some research and came to find out about \"swing\" temp in thermostats. Essentially most thermostats come programmed with a few degrees in \"swing\" temp so your system isn't on all the time. This means if you set your thermostat to 68 it will heat to 69 degrees and allow the house to cool to 67 degrees before turning back on. This swing function saves energy and wear and tear on your system. It also is such a small temp difference that your house will basically maintain a temp of 68 degrees. The Amazon Smart Thermostat doesn't have this swing temp range. It heats to 68, turns off, and turns right back on as soon as it hits 67 degrees. The end result is that your system is almost constantly running. From my internet research Amazon is aware that this is a problem, has received numerous complaints about it, but has elected not to fix the bug or provide an update that would allow users to set a swing temp range. So this leaves users either footing the higher energy use bills or to set up an elaborate work around using routines in the Alexa app. Essentially you have to set up routines telling your thermostat to heat to 68 and once at 68 to reset the thermostat temp to 66, you then have to do an opposite routine telling the thermostat once it sense a house temp of 66 to set the thermostat to 68. These routines would essentially maintain a consistent temp of 67 degrees in the home. I have done this and my energy use (which the thermostat allows you to track) shows that my hvac went from using about 1100kWh per week to about 600kWh and there has been no noticeable difference in house temp. So unless you like wasting money, don't buy this thermostat until they realize they need to fix the bug.Update: after having and using this product for 5 months I am attempting to return it. I've changed my review to one star because the true function of this item is defective. I've never had utility bills this expensive, the bug as I described above keeps this from being a smart thermostat and makes my system run all the time. Setting the routines helped some but not enough to keep using it. I have purchased a nest (which does have swing temp technology) as a replacement.

{"reviewTitle":"This product has an unacceptable deadband problem","reviewDescription":"I had to remove these thermostats. As of August 2024 the control logic on these Amazon Smart Thermostats has essentially zero deadband and it's not a configurable setting.  i.e., you can't configure it to reasonably overshoot the setpoint (which lets the unit be off for a while as the house is warms back up to and then past the setpoint before it restarts).  This results in an unacceptable number of start\/stops on the AC unit electrical starter system and the compressor.  This will cause premature failures on these from the wear and tear every start puts on them.  This thermostat at all times starts my AC at least twice as frequently as the Honeywell dumb thermostats I had originally.  In this Texas summer with very high heat load, when my units were working hard in the heat of the day to keep up with the set point, this thermostat was kicking my unit off and then back on in less than a second for much of each afternoon.Amazon knows about this problem as it's been raised many times in feedback and forums etc.  This seems like something they could fix with a very small effort just to update the control logic and let the systems update themselves over the air.Other than the unacceptable deadband issue, I was happy with it.

We had the thermostats installed before arrival in the new home. When we arrived at 11 pm to a 50 degree house, we tried to setup the thermostat. Unfortunately, our Wi-Fi had unexpectedly gone out. There is NO WAY TO SETUP THIS THERMOSTAT without Wi-Fi. That is an epic fail. I should be able to turn it on and set the temperature as an emergency without having to connect to the internet. I was finally able to get someone else to come to the house at midnight to use their hotspot (it would not work using the same hotspot as the phone!) so I wouldn\u2019t sleep in freezing temps. Even then, we only got one of our two thermostats to work. It was the one upstairs, which is a bonus room, so we swapped it out for the one controlling the main living space to deal with the bonus room in the morning.The next morning our Wi-Fi was fixed so you\u2019d think setup for the bonus room should work great. Wrong. I kept receiving unspecified errors. FINALLY after about a total of 5 hours of struggling between the two days, I got both thermostats up and running\u2014or so I thought. They worked great for 2 days. One morning I woke up and noticed the house was still on my sleep temperature. I have my bonus room  thermostat set to manual with no schedule, but I knew I\u2019d be going upstairs, so I asked Alexa to set that thermostat to 70 (it was at 62).

{"reviewTitle":"Needed a firmware update, never updated.  Install not user friendly.  No setting for Emergency Heat.","reviewDescription":"I had an old General Electric Thermostat and a heat pump.  The thermostat has a setting for Emergency Heat in the case that your compressor stops working.  A great feature if you live in an area like Boone, NC where you must have heat or your pipes will freeze and it is hard to get workers to your house.  The Alexa thermostat does not have an Emergency heat option.The GE thermostat has an X terminal.  I called technical support for the Amazon thermostat.  They gave me a phone number to call which is Resideo.  Resideo help could not tell me where the X wire might go on the Amazon Smart thermostat.  They guessed maybe it would go into the E terminal on the Amazon thermostat.Next, I installed the thermostat through the app.  I got stuck in a loop when answering the wiring questions.  Finally got past that.  The device paired with my WiFi without trouble.  Then I got a Red Blinking exclamation point.  The app told the device needed an update.  It said to remove the thermostat from the wall and then plug it back in.  Then wait 30 minutes for the update.  30 Minutes???  Hard to believe that an update would take 30 minutes...however if Amazon is using Amazon Free RTOS to do the update then maybe that is why it takes so long.  However, as far as I can tell it never updated.  I didn't receive an update complete nor any sort of indication that the update had started or completed.  After 30 minutes I clicked NEXT in the app.  Unaware, if the update had actually taken place.  It again told me I needed to do an update.  I went through the same process again.  Same results.  Your device needs an update.I then decided to remove the device from my account and try again.It told me I still needed to update the device.I waited the 30 minutes again.Initially it would only run for about 3 minutes then the Heat\/Air turned off.Once I got the thermostat on it ran the air conditioning in Heat mode and ran the Heat in Air Conditioning mode.Needless to say I removed the Amazon thermostat and went back with the old GE thermostat.  Everything now works with the old thermostat.I purchased this in October but did not have an opportunity to attempt the install on 12\/27\/23.  Amazon says my window to return has expired.

{"reviewTitle":"Died today at the 30 day mark. NO TECH SUPPORT is available!","reviewDescription":"Despite the mixed reviews, I went ahead and bought two of these for my house. Today is the 30 day mark and it is chilly downstairs in early January. I asked Alexa to turn up the heat since we have it running in a range, and it was set lower for no one being home. I walked by later and noticed there was no number showing, which has always been there. I checked the fuse box, the app, checked the unit, and asked Alexa to change it and turn it on and the end result is it is DEAD. I tried to find technical support, since the web page looks like clicking there will lead you to someone, but that is NOT the case! I got one rep, who immediately told me I had already returned them, which was false. He did not read the file. I got a price adjustment when the price dropped the next day after ordering. He went off to find support (which was at least 15 mins) and had a \"technical\" problem, so I got transferred to guy #2. He told me the unit was out of stock and my only option was a refund after making me wait another 15 mins. When I called him out on that lie since it is still on the website, he immediately transferred me again to guy #3. 45 minutes of \"chatting\" trying to get some technical support and all I got Is a replacement being sent. No technical help was offered. I asked and they said the tech people said it was defective. So in the middle of winter, I am without a thermostat for 4 days. So much for Prime shipping! The sad thing is this is tied to Honeywell, which I would have thought would have a better product. As for how it worked prior to it dying... it was ok. You could ask Alexa to lower or raise the temps. We hadn't figures out the app fully on how to have it be in the range for automatically setting it to heat or AC. In case you are wondering why I replaced it and didn't return it, I have an outstanding rebate with my power company for this model and I want it to be processed. I worry the return would mess that up and make me not eligible for another rebate if I buy a new brand. Would I recommend this model: NO.

{"reviewTitle":"It has potential.  Best price of any smart thermostat I've seen.","reviewDescription":"I've had this installed for one week.CONS:1. Alexa Hunches (machine learning suggestions) have a long way to go.  Pretty routine bet at 10PM and get up at 6 or 6:30 AM.  Alexa never fails to set Sleep temp around 3 or 3:30 AM.  5 hours late.  I haven't seen improvement even after a few \"Alexa, bedtime\" to help it learn.2. One day I went to the office to work and at 8:30 AM I received a hunch that set my \"Home temp instead of the Away temp.  I was expecting that to be a slam dunk based on GPS location 20 mins away.  This is the one I really want to work well.  Hybrid WFH\/Office, out shopping, dining, etc.  Having temp dynamically adjust to my presence to use minimal energy will be my biggest efficiency gain.3. Alexa app needs an overhaul.  The Home screen constantly changes which menus are seen.  I haven't found a way to stop\/prevent screen clutter from them pitching Popular Skills.4. This morning I woke up at 5 AM warmer than usual.  I look at the temp on the phone and it's 5 degrees higher than should be.  I checked config and all of the Home\/Away\/Sleep temps I configured defaulted to factory settings.5. Alexa Hunches asks for feedback to help it learn.  You can only say \"yes\" or \"no\" to a questions phrased like \"Did Hunches do this properly?\".  I don't know what to rate it.  If it's 3 AM and it sets my Sleep temp to what I want do I say \"Yes\" to help improve hunches?  Or, do I say \"No\" because it did it 5 hours late?  Not knowing the algorithm they use I'm assuming I could be making it dumber.PROS:1. Installation.  This was replacing a digital HoneyWell thermostat.  The wiring was 100% identical.  All I had to do is pull the old one off the wall and stick this in its place.  Launch app and setup was as easy as it gets.2. Convenience.  Even though hunches are a work-in-progress I really like being able to use Alexa voice or phone to input desired temps.  My house has one thermostat on main floor.  When I'm upstairs and want it cooler I don't have to make a trip down to adjust.  Using routines right now to set Sleep temp to 65 automatically.  Saving energy and money and I sleep better with exact temp I want.  I don't think I'd ever manually adjust the temp multiple times through the day.3. Price.  Amazon hit a price point I couldn't say \"no\" to.  With energy rebates it's potentially free.  I believe it would have paid for itself in short order without rebates though.NEUTRAL:1. If you use Alexa Hunches you can't use the thermostats schedule function.  Example: schedule it to set Sleep temp at 10 PM and Home temp at 6 AM.  There is a workaround though.  Just use Alexa routines instead of thermostat schedule.  I'm hoping this gets me best of both worlds when it eventually get my presence right and set Away temp.No regrets purchasing.

{"reviewTitle":"AIR CONDITIONER KICKS ON WAY TOO OFTEN NOW!","reviewDescription":"This is my second go-round with a smart\/wifi thermostat. Both times the same issue: the air conditioner kicks on too often because of a .5 - 1 degree increase in temperature. I am not an HVAC tech, but from what I understand, the \"swing\" on a thermostat allows you to set a variance on at what temperature above\/below your setpoints you air conditioner will kick on. Say during the day I want my air conditioner to cool to 74 degrees. With a 2 degree swing, the air conditioner won't start cooling again until it reaches 76 and will keep cooling until it reaches 74. If there isn't a swing or a .5 degree swing, this means every time your thermostat detects the temperature change, it's going to kick on. This increases the wear on the unit, not to mention the initial start-up of your HVAC compressor is what draws the most power. My 10+ year old 3M digital thermostat has an adjustable swing feature built in, but for some reason, the majority of these smart thermostats don't.Now don't get me wrong: part of this is due to our house being older and not as well insulated as a newer home. Maybe being better insulated would help keep the temperature more steady and thus keep the air conditioner from kicking on so oftenI'm debating on waiting to return and hoping that this will be an added feature in a future update.  If Amazon does add this feature, I can see this being a solid budget smart thermostat and will definitely use.

In my experience, hunches work great for telling when I leave or return home, adjusting the temperature accordingly. Detecting when everyone in the house is asleep usually has a bit of a lag, but is also pretty good.The negative: Where this thermostat really falls short is that if you want to let Alexa control the temperature using hunches you can only specify 3 temperatures:  home, away, and sleep. This is fine if you like a single, constant temperature when you're at home (and awake), but my ideal would be something like:  warmer when I wake up, cooler during the day (e.g. while working from home), warmer in early evening (e.g. before kids' bedtime), slightly cooler in later evening, then low temp for sleep. It's possible to program a schedule like this manually, but then you lose out on the ability to let Alexa control the temp when she detects no one is home.Feature request to Amazon:  Allow BOTH scheduling and hunches to be used at the same time.

I'm still new so maybe there's something I'm missing or maybe they'll modify the software but here's what I don't like: You can select setting it on a schedule that you make up. The only other choice is it guessing what to set the thermostat at based on what you are doing. You tell it what temperature you want normally, when you're gone, or when you're sleeping. It recognizes where you're at and adjusts the thermostat accordingly. Problem is:  I want it cooled down before I go to bed. It doesn't adjust the thermostat until it sees you go to bed. This is a huge problem. To work around that, I figured I'd set a schedule but that like the nest, it would recognize when I've left the house and turn the heat\/cool down when I'm gone automatically.

{"reviewTitle":"Ok but\u2026","reviewDescription":"The Amazon thermostat could be great but I believe the issues are related to the app. In my opinion, there needs to be a dedicated app for this device and better programmers to maintain the app. The problem with the Alexa app is that most times it doesn\u2019t refresh. If you make changes to the setting of the temperature in the app, you basically need to make sure you close the app or swipe down on the app with a finger to refresh the app to see changes take place. The Alexa app is not so great. It performs very poorly. The Amazon thermostat is by Honeywell. Again, I believe the device could be great if it had a dedicated app and didn\u2019t use the Alexa app. I control my thermostats manually because the schedule and hunches don\u2019t operate well. Even with manual control there are still issues. For example; I set a thermostat at 75\u00b0 at night, wake-up and it\u2019s on 77\u00b0. Another example; I set a thermostat at 76\u00b0 and it keeps coming on even though the inside temperature reaches 74\u00b0.  Stuff like that\u2026 Doing things it shouldn\u2019t be doing. Anyways, I\u2019ve tried other thermostats including expensive brands and they can be just as bad or worst. So I\u2019ve settled with this one for now. At least it\u2019s cheap. If something better comes along, I\u2019m done with this thing unless Amazon fixes the issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686182400000}
{"reviewTitle":"How to fix Alexa app crashes","reviewDescription":"I just installed my thermostat yesterday, and after much retrofitting too large a hole behind my old thermostat so that I could screw in the new one, and nearly hurting myself going into my crawlspace and finding the C wire to connect at the furnace end, I wound up with the dreaded and much-mentioned Alexa app crash every time I tried to fiddle with the thermostat settings.There are many questions on the Alexa forums and elsewhere on the web describing crashes specifically when trying to control the thermostat. None have a solution posted. Just more questions from Alexa support saying try this or that, then the thread dies. But the solution is so simple.Also, the web-based Alexa app is no longer supported, or it is being phased out as of this writing. It is therefore not an alternative to getting your thermostat going the way you want, as I had initially hoped.I am here to tell you that there is a simple solution. For your information, I have an Android phone, but most likely the solution is the same for IOS. Simply clear your Alexa app's cache AND data. You don't need to force stop, or reinstall the app, or power cycle your phone, or anything else. Once you've done this, start up the app again and sign in. Any devices you previously configured, any routines, etc. are still all there because they are stored in Amazon's servers. You won't have lost anything. Now go try setting your thermostat. This works for me.I hope this helps you all.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668470400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Needs improvement","reviewDescription":"Instructions in Alexia app to set-up where OK. Could have been better, but was easy enough to get wired up and installed. I wired as the app had instructed and when i returned power to the system, and performed the tests. Heat blew out cold air. Called Amazon customer support and they told me it was likely a wiring issue, and directed me to call Resideo. Why when i look at Amazon support page it couldn't have sent me there in the first place? . After much testing and debating on returning the product. Discovered there is a setting for the O\/B wire in the app to switch the heat\/cool settings. Even though i had specified that wire from the previous as being \"B\" to heat and not the \"O\" to cool. The app set as \"O\" to cool on the switching valve.That said 1.  Software should have caught this in set-up, 2. Customer support should know and given the suggestion to even check the setting.The next issue is that even though it was a mild day the thermostat was calling for Aux heat. It was easily 60+ degrees outside and at time of testing was 72 inside with a set point of 74. There shouldn't be the need to call for the less efficient heating when the system had been running for only a few minutes and such a small gradient where the heat pump would be more than sufficient.Overall Amazon's first attempt at a thermostat is mediocre. Especially considering it's  actually made by Honeywell\/Resideo, and they have been in the thermostat game for quite awhile. Hopefully there will be some software updates to fix the issues. As this is half the price of competitors wasn't expecting all the bells and whistles, but as an entry level 'smart' thermostat is a case of you get what you pay for.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1640995200000}

{"reviewTitle":"If you have a Nest or have used a Nest thermostat then don\u2019t buy this. It\u2019s a significant downgrade.","reviewDescription":"I have two separate heat pumps with two thermostats. I have had a Nest thermostat connected to each since Nest came out in 2011. I originally had a first generation Nest. I changed third generation Nest thermostats in 2013 when when I had to replaced both heat pumps.I am shocked that Amazon put out such a poor product. The thermostat itself as well as the app.Nothing is intuitive about the app or the interface on the thermostat. This product is a mess.But reflecting upon it it\u2019s not surprising as this is a Honeywell product branded as an Amazon product. I don't think Honeywell has ever made a device that is \"cutting-edge\". They are old-school and don't put anything fancy in their consumer products.When I ask Alexa to change the temperature or turn on the air she says it doesn\u2019t support that.You can\u2019t do a simple thing as turning on the air for a length you specify. Your choices are either on until you turn it off or on for random length of time that is unknown.The interface on a thermostat is horrible.The app does not accept Wi-Fi passwords above a certain length. I had to end up using my guest Wi-Fi password which is not as long as my regular Wi-Fi password.I\u2019ve only installed one of the two I purchased and I previously typed that I was going to give it until November 22nd before returning if I don't see a drastic improvement of the mobile app and thermostat interface as the deadline for me to return is December 8. After reading from another reviewer that you cannot have separate schedules if you have two thermostats, I am removing the Amazon thermostat, reinstalling my Nest and packing up both Amazon thermostats and shipping back.I only bought these because I wanted the advantage of yelling at Alexa to control the thermostats.

{"reviewTitle":"You Get What You Pay For","reviewDescription":"If you are wondering why this is so much cheaper than other brands, there are several reasons.1. Display - other than the current room temperature, you have to push buttons on the thermostat to see anything else. No indication of set temp, current mode, etc.2. Schedule settings - if you have used programmable thermostat before, this is very similar. But it is missing the ability to override the temp and put it on hold. You can change it temporarily, but it will reset on the next program time. Only way to stop that is to turn off the schedule completely on the app.  I am used to programmable thermostat giving you the permanent hold option when you manually change the temperature, but apparently not at this price.3. Local control - as stated above, reverts to program. When visitors come, I have to turn off schedule in the upstairs unit for them to be able to set to their own comfort level.  There is no way to do that locally, only from the app.4. Amazon Household Sharing - does not exist. My wife and I have separate accounts, and even though they are part of the same household, she can\u2019t control the thermostat from her app. She can control everything else that is shared with the household, but not that. Only way to give her access to it is to log her out of her app and log me in.  There have been many complaints about this to Amazon, over a long period of time, and nothing has changed. Don\u2019t count on it changing anytime soon.5. Echo control - same problems as above. Have to change the echo device to my account, won\u2019t work from wife\u2019s account. And you can change the temperature, but the change is temporary, will reset with the next scheduled program, similar to manual operation. No way to put on hold, or turn on it off schedule.Other than those issues, seems to be working okay, but have not had it installed for long. Absolutely amazed that the thermostat does not work with household accounts.  May not stay installed for very long anyway.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1680048000000}

Almost perfect but one bug.","reviewDescription":"I suggest the engineering team of this product perform a serious investigation on this bug.I tried two units of this product and observed the same symptom. I searched the keyword \"unresponsive\" in user review and found many people encountered this issue as well.According to my experiments, each period of unresponsive time is around 20 minutes and recovered magically by itself at the end of the period.There are either 15 to 20 or couple periods per day, depending on if the Adaptive QoS (Game Device Prioritizing) of the router is on or off, respectively.There is no such unresponsive period for all other Amazon IoT devices no matter whether the QoS is on or off. So there must be a solution for this issue if the engineering team takes a serious investigation on this bug.BTW, the router is an Asus RT-AX82U which is only 10 feet away from the thermostat and is in the same room. The ping command and the system log of the router were used in my experiments for estimating the time.During each unresponsive period, the Alexa app can not control the temperature and the \u201cDevice is unresponsive\u201d displays in the app, a red circular icon is flashing on the wall unit. I still can adjust temperature by clicking the physical button on the wall unit.Setting the \u201cLegacy mode\u201d for the 2.4Ghz wifi did not help at all.Since all other Amazon IoT devices have no such problem, I suggest the engineering team use the same Wifi module as the ones used in other Amazon IoT devices instead of the old version in the thermostat. Or made some bug fix in the firmware.You probably won\u2019t see this bug if your router is old and basic.

They told me I had to connect the thermostat in order to work with it. I said, the app is the problem it's not letting me install. The rep told me it's simple and I could just connect the proper wires.I told him, I'm pretty good with this and I likely could get this accomplished. BUT, that is really bad advice to give someone. The app clearly guides the users through equipment safety, your AC unit blowing fuses, and personal life safety, like electrocuting yourself. I think this was pretty bad advice to tell someone to basically wing it with no instructions.

I'm usually impressed with Amazon customer service but two people did not even understand what I was talking about tonight, and it's probably due to the sheer amount of knowledge they have to understand.

However, the setup has a test out of order...","reviewDescription":"I decided to use the Amazon thermostat to replace my battery driven Honeywell thermostat seeing as they used the same connection on the wall - less to wire, remove and worry about.  Of course, i did not realize the previous homeowner clipped the common wire and shoved it into the sleeve of the wiring at the thermostat until I went into my basement to connect the C wire adapter and found a little blue (common) wire barely sticking out, not connected.  Now, this is not why I give the thermostat an overall rating of 4 stars, this obviously has nothing to do with the thermostat, just the previous homeowner or the person that installed the AC\/furnace system.I give this 4-stars because, the first time I hooked up the thermostat it tested the heat.  All was well.  Heat kicked on, fan kicked on.  Fantastic.  Then the fan test.  Well, I waited about 2 minutes, remembering that the furnace (like every other furnace I have had) keeps the fan on for a couple of minutes.  I assumed the fan was working, said \"Yes\" to the fan test.  Went on with life.  Then I tried to turn on the fan.  Nope.  So, i took apart the thermostat, wiggled back in the green wire, hooked back up the thermostat, the fan worked by itself.  My suggestion for Amazon, if they read this, is to test the FAN first then the HEAT.  Then there is no guesswork as to when the fan shutdown from the heat cycle and when it is turned on from the test.  Just my humble opinion at least.Other than that part, I have loved the thermostat so far.  It took about 4 minutes to calibrate the temperature, it was reading about 5 degrees higher than the old thermostat (powered by batteries, sitting next to the new one).  I am using the programmable mode, I will need to try the Alexa Automatic Control at some point.The thermostat is clean, simple, functional at the wall.  The application tells you the humidity (which is nice) and is a bit more glittery than the device itself, which is fine by me.I would recommend this as a replacement for an older thermostat, especially a Honeywell since it just popped in over the same connector that I already had.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1654214400000}

Even if you have never installed a new thermostat, or not super savvy with such things, you shouldn\u2019t have any issues getting this installed and working.While it is absolutely works and offers all the essential functions that most people who are looking to get a smart device are looking for. The biggest flaw of the thermostat, is its reliance on Alexa to control the device, which for some reason, isn\u2019t even able to control your A\/C fan without setting up a specific routine to do so.There are some promising features with Alexa, like the the ability to automatically adjust the thermostat based on whether or not you are home. However, this also means either allowing Alexa track you 24\/7, or just setting up a standard weekly schedule. If you are really looking into turning your home into a smart home ecosystem, you should probably just pay a little more to get a more stand alone thermostat. However, if you just want to be able to check and adjust your temperature from anywhere in the world, this will get the job done for super cheap.I mostly just needed the latter. I am not using the smart or automatic senses features, but I am using some basic scheduling and keep track of the temperature while at work or away. Additionally, using the circulate feature, which turns on the system fan every hours, I have noticed a slight decrease in the energy usage from my A\/C system. It\u2019s not a huge price saving, but it is saving nonetheless.In general, if you are looking for the cheapest option to be able to check and change your home thermostat anywhere in the world, this is it.

The installation was not easy mostly because the wiring in the house is complicated. I needed the help of an electrician. All thermostats are now working. I can create groups in the app but I cannot control all the the thermostats in each group simultaneously. I need to change the settings on each thermostat individually. It seems like one of the benefits of create group is for this purpose.There is no way to override all the thermostats at once. For instance, if I leave the house for a vacation, I cannot override all of the schedules that I have set up for each thermostat. Each thermostat has an \u201cAway\u201d schedule option but that is to be used when you know that you will be gone during certain portions of the day. You can also turn on \u201cAutomatic Actions\u201d and set an Away temperature. Alexa will have a \u201chunch\u201d that no one is around. The problem is that I have radiant heat so if I leave the house for a few hours, Alexa will turn down the heat. When I return, Alexa will turn up the heat but a radiant heat system takes too long for this to work for me. If I want to turn on this function when leaving on a vacation, I would need to do so on each of 10 thermostats, a time consuming process that would need to be reversed upon coming home. If I could simply go to a group and set the temperature and have it hold there, overriding all schedules, that would solve this.Whenever I needed help from Amazon during what turned out to be a long installation and setup process, they were terrific. They answered the phone almost immediately and did the best they could with a complex situation.In summary, great product, great support, but there\u2019s lots of work needed on the app if you have more than one or two thermostats.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669248000000}

My older thermostat went down to at least 40\u00b0.Another disappointment.  The device measures humidity as well as temperature, but you can't use an Alexa command to be told what it is.

I went to the toilet in the middle of the night - didn't turn any lights on, didn't touch my phone, just tiptoed to the bathroom, did what needed to be done, and returned back to the bedroom.

I guess it simply tracks your GPS location on phone and turns on when home off when gone.Also, you can set up schedules in the app.  Turn off when at work and on a few min before you get home.  You have the ability to set up 4 schedules and add them to the various days to meet your needs.  This is how i have it set up.Cons:Makes an audible click when AC unit comes on.  They need to fix that.  It is annoying.  This is in my TV room so just as the clown is about to jump out of closet .... Click.Would like to see that the unit is running without looking at app.  My old thermostat had an LED that lit when running.I have to pull it off the wall to reset it ever so often.  It seems to forget the program and has to be restarted.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1657065600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Can be better via software update","reviewDescription":"This is the 3rd smart thermostat I have used.  Compare to the two I have (Emerson Sensi and Nest), this is probably my least favorite, and least expensive ST.  Installation was easy and the unit comes with everything that unit.  The design is minimalist, which is ok for the price.  You won't impress anyone.  As for the function, unless you fully embraced Alexa in your everyday life, and expect to run your a\/c 24\/7, this unit may not be as functional as you'd expect it to be.Two lacking features that make it a 3-star unit for me:1) I have Echos for my 2nd floor, and Google Home for ground floor.  The Amazon Smart Thermostat (AST) is NOT compatible with Google Home, so I can't voice control it when I'm at the ground floor., while both my NEST and Emerson work with Echo.  Shame.2) It doesn't have a sleep timer.  My family and I only use a\/c on demand.  In most cases, hot summer night when we go to sleep.  With other ST, we could set a timer (2hrs for example) so the A\/C turns off in the middle of the night.  The AST DOES NOT have sleep timer.  So I either I've to get up in the middle of the night to turn it off when it gets too cold, or set a higher temp and let it run all night.  Either way is good for us.  Overall, it does the job and a good value for the price (when discounted), but lacking two key features we're used to.  Hopefully those got addressed at later update.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1685664000000}

It's unbelievably un-smart!","reviewDescription":"I was so excited to hear that Amazon was releasing this product I preordered three of them.  I can't get any of them to connect to wifi.  All I can get it to do is say \"SEt\".  It refuses to connect to wifi after about eight hours of trying, power cycling, resetting, rebooting my phone, reinstalling the Alexa app, and all the crazy things support told me to do.  Talking with support was like torture, they copied the text from the manual three times and wouldn't address the issue only attempting basic support techniques.  Turning things off and on about a dozen times seems to be the apex of their technical support.  Don't get me wrong sometimes that works, except when it doesn't.  One support person told me I needed to install a Honeywell skill to make it work and select this Thermostat as a device, but I can't find it anywhere in the Honeywell App.Oh, Honeywell. I wish I had paid closer attention that they were involved in this.  I had a Honeywell \"Smart\" Thermostat once and I swore never to buy one of their products again.  A wireless thermostat that can't connect to wireless is what I would expect from a company like Honeywell (not Amazon until now).  Honeywell may know HVAC, but their website seems archaic and they seem stuck in decades-old ways of thinking when it comes to advanced technology like wireless.After spending so many hours, I think I will run down to my home improvement store and get a real thermostat so I can get the heat back on.  It seems so long ago that I thought this was going to be a fun quick project to kick off the weekend.  I am beside myself at just how awful support was.  It was the worst support I've ever received from any company and usually, my experiences with Amazon support have been great.  I was not expecting to run into any roadblocks.  I've installed lots of other Smart thermostats.  I thought this would be one of my simplest installs but if I did have issues, I was expecting Amazon support to have my back and they didn't.

But this Smart Thermostat product sucks.  And I work in tech, so am not \"tech-challenged.\"Too many things wrong with it to list here.  But the MAIN one is, when you have a problem, you will be in \"customer service hell\" for hours on end, likely with someone who does not speak English well, and possibly never get your problem resolved.  For instance, just now, I spent 15 minutes on the phone.  Someone overseas did not understand my problem, so transferred me to someone in the US.  That took 7+ minutes.  Then the person in the US spent another 5-7 minutes trying to find my account (even though, as I said, I have had an Amazon account with the same phone number for two decades).  Then she transferred me again, this time to a recording that told me their office was closed and please call back during regular hours, then hung up on me.  This particular issue I have been trying to resolve for three days (the thermostat scheduling feature in the Alexa app is down\/inoperative).  (Update: 8 days now without resolution)And the problem may be something as simple as changing the temperature.  Additionally, the thermostat is not even listed as one of the devices to select when seeking support within the Alexa app, so it seems they haven't even fully built out the support functions for it yet.  Further, there are \"gotchas\" upon installation that are not even documented in the instructions (you have to Google off-site advice to find these.  See: \"amazon smart thermostat heat pump reversing valve\")Do you feel like spending hours on the phone in order to change the temperature on your thermostat?

{"reviewTitle":"Not happy I bought this.","reviewDescription":"Scheduling is most of the reason anyone buys a digital thermostat. And what did Amazon and Honeywell do with scheduling for this device? Limited it tremendously.First of all it asks you to set a Home, Away, and Sleep temperatures.I hope these are the only three temperatures you need in your schedule because when you set your schedule up there is no way to set the temperature. You must select one of those three settings.So say you work from home and during the day you want it set to 76. You\u2019d like it cooler but you need to plan for your Electric Companies peak hours.So say around 7pm you\u2019d like it to get a bit cooler. So your only option here is to set a sleep temp that is lower and use that.But say you want it a couple degrees cooler at night because it helps you sleep. Well screw you buddy, unless you want to not have an Away temperature that\u2019s even lower and use that for your sleep time or vice versa and use the away temperature as your evening temperature, you have no other options.The fact that the schedule only allows me to use the three temps I have set for home\/away\/sleep is such a horrible decision I can\u2019t fathom that whoever set up these settings has never used a thermostat with a schedule before.All it needs is a way to set your own temp instead of having to choose from 3 presets.Oh and if you want to change the temp more than 4 times a day you can\u2019t do that either.It\u2019s like they went out of their way to make this as limited as possible without making it completely useless.I should have known better.Don\u2019t fall for the same trap I fell for.

After we bought our new home I was in the market for a new smart thermostat that could seamlessly integrate into home automation.  Since we use Echo devices in most rooms I figured this thermostat would work well especially considering the price.  It worked great for 3 months and then the display would randomly go blank and become unresponsive.  Voice control through the echos was also unresponsive.  If I open the Alexa app on my phone the thermostat would then light back up and begin functioning again.  I tried both hard and soft resets and this did not resolve the issue.  Tonight I messaged amazon about getting a replacement under warranty.  I was surprised when the chat representative told me they would need to call me to connect to the manufacture. Its a amazon device!!??? ok no biggie right?  Well the person who called me told me I would need to uninstall the item and mail it back to amazon and once received they would send a refund.  I wasn't looking for a refund rather a replacement device.  After 30 min I was told the device was sold out even though AMAZON.COM has the device in stock sold and shipped by Amazon.  Again he told me to send the item back as they can't send a replacement.Ok I get items break or have a manufacturing issue but don't sell a item with a warranty if the item is not going to be covered under that warranty.

Set up pictures show black numbers, I hope this is changeable when I finally get access. In the Alexa app, scanned the QR code, with no luck, tried the manual mode a couple of times, unit would not connect.

Tried a couple of times again,  finally tried tech support. Got a person, apparently reading from a script, who after about 15 minutes or so decided she could not help - transferred me to a rep from the company that actually made it, who again started to read from a script. At that time, I had been on the phone for 30 minutes, still had not had my questions even addressed, had to leave.I believe - the issue is that the (minimal) documentation with the unit says that it is a 2.4 Ghz unit. I have a Google mesh network (dual band), and subordinate to that is a 2.4 only network of access points. There is no way I could see to be able to select the network to which it will connect - this was the main reason for calling tech support.Thermostat was for the shop, signal shows fine on my phone, Nest node nearby, couple of echo dots straddling the tstat are fine, couple of Ewelink wifi multi-channel relays are fine, and 4-5 wifi switches (also 2.4 only) are fine in that area.Will try again with support when I have more time to spend on the phone, otherwise, returning.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1650758400000}

{"reviewTitle":"It's inexpensive and it works....UPDATE: I replaced it - FAIL!","reviewDescription":"UPDATE: 04-22-22 - I gave up and replaced the Amazon thermostat with a Honeywell model.  The Alexa app never received any updates that fixed the issue with accessing the schedule or other controls of the Amazon Thermostat.  The app would go to a blank screen and therefore I couldn't do anything remotely to control the thermostat.  On top of that, the app started with a built in schedule that I couldn't access or edit, so whenever I was trying to control the temperature in that space I had to manually change the thermostat back to my chosen setting whenever the schedule would change it.  Very annoying.  Too bad, Amazon, I really love most of the Alexa universe and have a significant investment in your technology, but maybe try again with the thermostat software before selling it to the public.  INITIAL REVIEW COMMENTS: First, I was able to get the Amazon Thermostat to work with my garage heater by figuring it out myself, so I'm glad that it works.  The installation instructions do not include uses like a garage heater, so if that is your end goal it requires experimentation, and hopefully you don't break anything while trying.  I damaged a 24VDC power supply but I accept that was part of the learning curve.  The good news is the Amazon Thermostat controls the temperature as expected and it was inexpensive.  However, I can't access the built in schedule, as the Alexa app on both my iPhone and iPad just go to a blank screen and the app locks up if you select the option to view or edit the schedule.  Good luck getting technical support btw, as there is nothing I could find on Amazon that directs you where to get help with the Amazon app.  It's difficult to even find a phone number to call.  I finally found a chat window but the person (or AI?) that I was chatting with couldn't help me and responded that someone would call me back.  I'm still waiting for that call back.  It is hard to give a better review for a device that I can only turn on\/off from the device itself and can't modify the schedule for.  My 8 year old Nest thermostat that runs the rest of the house is significantly easier to use and, even though it's a Google device, it works better in the Alexa app than Amazon's own thermostat.  Go figure.  Nice try Amazon, but you've really dropped the ball with this thermostat.  Yes, I was able to get it to work....kind of, but it's a real disappointment compared to more than 40 other devices that I have working in my Alexa household that work great.  For my household I picked Alexa over Google for many reasons, but it's a good thing I didn't start with Amazon's weak attempt at their own thermostat.  I would probably have chosen a Google household instead.  Buyer beware with the thermostat!

My home would never be at the right temperature and it would take an hour to come up close to temp.It didn't keep the temperature correctly. It would be set for 67* and the temperature would show as 65* or it would be set for 62* and the temperature read 66*. I didn't set it up as automatic heat\/cool to keep my home between temp ranges.

Everything seemed ok. this one didn't seem to have as many connectivity issues.HOWEVER, now that we have reached warmer temps and the A\/C needed to come on, we started to notice that house was EXTREMELY HUMID. Like 70% humidity, INSIDE the house. Not only was it relatively uncomfortable being in a house where everything felt damp, but it raised problems for possible mold and mildew.The a\/c was running and producing cool air, so we did the usual stuff. Made sure the drain pipe wasn't clogged. Made sure all the air filters were new. Gave the evaporator coils a good cleaning and even had the HVAC guy that installed the unit out to check it..On a hunch, I sent my boyfriend to the nearest hardware store to pick up one of those old analog thermostats. We switched it out with the alleged \"smart\" thermostat, turned the A\/C back on and within an hour, the humidity in the house was reduced to 55%.Being the only thing that was actually done to the system was to switch the thermostat, I think it goes without saying their \"smart\" thermostat was the problem. The HVAC guy said that it was probably preventing the A\/C from completing a full cycle and running the fan all the time. Whatever the cause, he did tell us that we were lucky to have figured it out, otherwise this $80 POS could have ended up costing us thousands in replacement parts for the A\/C eventually and probably all kinds of health problems due to the constant humidity in the house.I stand by my 1 star rating\/review of this product.

Husband checked on a few things and shut off and turned our furnace back on.  It began to warm up so we went to bed.  Woke up to a house in the 50 degrees range and no furnace working.  We did another round or 2 of turning off and then turning back on the furnace and the system would run for about 3 minutes and then shut off.  Of course it is a Saturday of a holiday weekend and we needed to call the HVAC company that installed our furnace.  He was at our house for hours.  He finally thought he had it fixed and told us that the thermostat caused a malfunction in the furnace that prohibited it to heat properly.We had to purchase a new thermostat on the spot and pay almost $500 for the repair.  fast forward to an hour later.  Our furnace shuts down AGAIN.  We had to call BACK the repairman.  Due to the malfunction that was caused by the thermostat, there was major condensation buildup inside the furnace causing the system to short out and quit.I contacted Amazon about my issue and asked if they were going to pay my bill due to their faulty product and since it had been over a year, the answer was no and they don't pay third party bills.My brand new HVAC system should NOT be having issues within 14 months of purchase and install.  This is ridiculous and I am appalled at the response I received from Amazon and the blatant brush off I received.

It didn't want to connect to the Alexa echo in the beginning. It took multiple attempts, but once connected, voice control worked pretty well for setting the thermostat to a set temp. For instance, \"Alexa set thermostat to 72\". But if you tell Alexa to have the thermostat follow the schedule, she would reply \"can't help with that\". Also, after I set up the schedule in the app, the thermostat would adjust the temp to the schedule at the moment and the status in the app would show \"following schedule...\", but once it got to the next schedule point, it would not adjust the temp. The app would show the status as \"hold temp until...\" whatever the next schedule point was and the temp stayed the same. During install, the app walks you through how to set it up, including wiring. However, once it was done, I had it set to cool, but it was blowing hot air. It took some digging through the Alexa app to find it, but there is a setting that asks if your A\/C is blowing hot when it should blow cool, and will adjust the reversing valve to fix this. So if you find yourself with an Alexa thermostat that is causing your A\/C to blow hot when it should be cool, there is a setting buried in the set up to fix that.  Also, the display on the thermostat is lacking some important info. If your phone is unreliable, like my galaxy S22+, and randomly shuts off for 30 minutes at a time, regularly, it would be nice to be able to control everything from the thermostat itself. You can poke around on it and bring up icons, but without the manual you're kind of guessing. Not very intuitive.  Overall, I'm disappointed the Alexa thermostat didn't work out for us. Maybe they'll fix the issues in the next version. But it's a pass for me. I've returned it for a refund & reinstalled the old thermostat for now. So if you're only looking for a voice controlled thermostat and don't care about setting a schedule, this thermostat works pretty good once you get it up and running. But if you want it to follow a schedule, look elsewhere.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691193600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Dumbest smart thermostat on the market. Not worth the constant hassles!","reviewDescription":"I bought eight Amazon Smart Thermostats to upgrade an apartment complex to \u201csmart home\u201d status, but the experience has been disappointing. Here\u2019s a concise summary of the main issues and points, including pros and cons.Pros \u2022 Affordable: Cheaper compared to some other smart thermostats. \u2022 Alexa Integration: Can use Alexa for basic commands and \u201chunches\u201d about your presence.Cons \u2022 Setup and Troubleshooting:  \u2022 Difficult to set up and troubleshoot.  \u2022 App only shows \u201cerror\u201d without detailed troubleshooting steps.  \u2022 Endless loop of resetting the device and following poor instructions.  \u2022 Inconsistent and confusing wiring recommendations from the app. The O\/B wiring sets the incorrect setting, so my cooling was actually heating endlessly and the device has no shutoff. My house reached 113F before I noticed as I was away. \u2022 App Functionality:  \u2022 Slow to load thermostat information.  \u2022 Complicated navigation and buried options (slow to load)  \u2022 Painful to set schedules, especially for multiple thermostats.  \u2022 No current state display (cooling\/heating), temperature history, or usage history.  \u2022 No support for separate zone reading.  \u2022 Cannot automate away mode using routines because Alexa only allows you to set a setpoint temperature but does not allow you to set the mode! Insane. So you can't set an away routine for the thermostat and it will run 100% of the time unless you manually control it. \u2022 Customer Service:  \u2022 Support number is not readily available, hard to find \u2022 Wall Device:  \u2022 Confusing control interface.  \u2022 Must cycle through modes to change the set point.  \u2022 Defaults to cooling settings when in heating mode.  \u2022 Randomly disconnects from Wi-Fi, losing control via the app. One unit consistently disconnects from wifi.No warranty after 30 days so you'll discover you wasted your money after experiencing these issues.SummaryOverall, the Amazon Smart Thermostat is not worth the hassle. Its setup, app functionality, and customer service are severely lacking, and the wall device interface is confusing. Other brands like Sensi and Ecobee offer much better experiences with reliable performance, intuitive interfaces, and useful features. Save yourself the trouble and invest in a reputable brand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"230 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661472000000}

After removing the cover from my current thermostat and going through an extensive Q & A session with the tech support rep, I was ASSURED I did not require this extra wire attachment and was told the installation and set up would be quite easy.  I ordered the product in anticipation of having the pleasure of a smart thermostat.After 3 hours, paying a handyman to assist when it obviously was not going to be a simple process, speaking to an extremely rude and condescending tech support (Sebastian), I was left with having to remove the smart thermostat and replace it with my original.  Sebastian told me there was nothing Amazon could do to determine if the C wire was required and I should contact the manufacturer of the product. He was obviously very ready to conclude our conversation once I pointed out that he was asking irrelevant questions anyway.I called Amazon support again today and spoke to a very articulate, patient and knowledgeable tech support\/CSR named Nathan.I expressed my disdain over being set up for  grave inconvenience and disappointment by the first phone call who assured me all would be fine when I ordered your product.  Amazon made a sale, yet your customer suffered as a result.It cost me $20 to call in the handyman who took the thermostat off, put the new one on, then took it off.Again, 3 hours were wasted trying to power up and install this device.  One main issue was there is NOTHING ON OR IN THE PACKAGE THAT IDENTIFIES THE MODEL NUMBER (WHICH YOU MUST CHOOSE FROM A LIST ON THE ALEXA AND\/OR HONEYWELL APP).Finally,  I reached out to the manufacturer who confirmed that the C wire would be required not only for the model I bought but for any smart thermostat that I would expect to control with any app.I am extremely disappointed that I will have to settle for the old digital thermostat as my budget does not allow the additional $30+ for the additional wire kit and $50+ for an A\/C to properly install the thermostat.Again, I was sadly set up for a huge inconvenience and disappointment.I would suggest Nathan could train some of your staff as he knew better than to tell me something I wanted to hear but could not be certain he was not going to provide a disservice.Joy Najolia","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1655251200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazon is leaving my household without heat due to Incompetent Management","reviewDescription":"Amazon delivered my thermostat to the wrong address. This was immediately identified when I got the notification on my phone and there was no package in the ~1 foot of snow in the \"back patio\" where the delivery agent specified. No image was attached as objective evidence. A refund was issued and Amazon called it a \"lost item.\"One week later, my neighbor discovered the package in their own snowbank and brought it to me on Friday. I had it installed and the HVAC rewired the next day. Customer service couldn't figure out why the thermostat would not sync with the Alexa app. Assuming that there was some sort of hold based on the refund, I paid for a new item. The technicians assured me it was just a matter of switching over the serial numbers in their system. It was then discovered that the item had been \"blacklisted\" and a high-level development team was the only group with access to perform this \"simple changeover.\"After escalation through two managers who had contradictory communication of corporate standards, the path forward was determined to be escalation of an internal ticket to the dev team to un-blacklist the item. Apparently it is impossible for Amazon managers to facilitate expedited shipping of an Amazon product from a major hub in the city that I live in--they supposedly do not even have access to inventory.Now my house is freezing cold and I'm relying on the follow-up actions of a Senior Manager to ensure that the ticket does not get lost in the queue.It is a minor inconvenience when a critical item is a day late; however, when a household is left without heat because of incompetent management that cannot escalate effectively and cannot come up with effective corrective actions, there is little question as to whether or not Amazon inflicted damages. One supervisor explicitly advised \"Purchase it from a local store and we can give you Amazon credit\" but could not even say which stores sold the product, whether the product was in inventory, and what the reimbursed price would be. This supervisor was reluctant to make clear statements on recorded calls and escalated to their manager--who happened to just make it into the office--prior to providing a ticket number and contact information for quality assurance and legal, as requested.Hopefully something positive will come of this; however, I now understand the ideology of those that scorn and avoid Amazon. I would encourage anyone to support local businesses and not to support Amazon stores or retailers.This is a poorly managed company that is willing to let a household sleep for up to a week in the cold as a result of their own initial mistake.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1647129600000}

The first Amazon smart thermostat purchased, continually threw errors during setup related to Bluetooth failure and Connection failure.  After numerous setup attempts with different smart phones I started a return. To give the benefit of the doubt I did a return and replacement hoping the first one was just defective. The replacement arrived and it too was impossible to setup. During setup, Bluetooth would locate it but when connecting to my 2.4 GHz network it would also fail connection. I then tried my 2.4Ghz guest network but it too would fail to connect. I should also mention the thermostat is about 15 feet from the access point and my iPhone and any other device that I tested from that location had no issue whatsoever connecting to both of these networks. In addition I temporarily changed my Wi-Fi passwords on both networks to dumb down the passwords in case special characters were messing with the thermostat setup, but even the most basic of passwords made no difference at all. Honestly I am not sure how anyone is getting past setup with these and my opinion is if you do manage to get it setup you will likely be unhappy with it in the near future because it appears they are using some really poor quality Wi-Fi chip in these devices and my guess is you will have connection issues off and on.

Amazon \"tech support\" are incapable of solving this issue and refered me to the manufacturer, because Amazon can't resolve \"wiring issues\".

I wasn't looking for super-smart features and frankly was a little worried that I'd have to modify the way I prefer to regulate the temperature in my house.  Turns out there was no need for concern - you can choose to run a simple daily schedule (or no schedule at all) if you prefer.  I'm experimenting with Alexa \"hunches\" to automatically adjust the setting when no one is home or everyone is asleep.  If hunches aren't reliable, the ability to manually change the setting remotely is a big plus if I forget to make adjustments before leaving for an extended time, vacation, etc.For me, installation was a breeze as I have a basic low-voltage, forced-air system with heating and cooling.  The old thermostat didn't use a \"C\" wire, but there were 2 spares in the wire bundle and it was just a tiny bit of work to connect a spare conductor to the \"C\" lug on the terminal strip in the furnace.My only complaint is that I wish the \"swing\" setting was adjustable.  As it's late spring, I've only tried cooling mode, but it seems like the temperature only needs to drift about 0.5 degree above the set point before the thermostat turns on the A\/C.  My house is pretty leaky with spotty insulation, so there's a lot of equipment cycling on hot days.

{"reviewTitle":"Good price but the App is really bad","reviewDescription":"The price is right on this thermostat but it is very limited in functionality. Sure, it will raise and lower the temperature, but there are parameters that cannot be set, such as temperature swing, which impacts greatly on comfort and efficiency. Also, the Alexa app completely ignores my home, away and sleep preferred temperatures, so I have to reset the thermostat manually at every point in my schedule. If I let the schedule run, it will raise the temperature in my house to 86 degrees F,(in the Summer!) Accurate scheduling of temperature changes is what \"smart\" thermostats are all about, and I am afraid this one fails on that score, making it no better than a \"manual\" thermostat.  Perhaps there is a bug in the app or I am missing something, but good software should never let the user go wrong. There is an attempt at AI here, with \"hunches\" , that will let Alexa set the temperature; I don't trust it. Amazon really needs to fix the app or create a dedicated app just for the thermostat, that can be present on the phone at all times. Currently, the user has to access the unit through the Alexa app, which is inconvenient.  Here are features that I feel would be useful:Allow adjustment of temperature swingshow the current and set temperatures on the front page of the appfix the temperature disparity between the preferred temperatures and the scheduled temperatures.There are cheaper thermostats that have all of these features and more. Why Amazon did not emulate one of those units is beyond me. I was not overjoyed with this purchase, but I hope that the app will be fixed and features added in the future.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658361600000}

We previously spent $1000+ on repairing\/cleaning the AC unit, which didn't do much. My dad had recommended a new thermostat, so I chose this one because of the Energy Star certification being that it's the dead of summer and my energy bill is now reaching $600\/mo. It's been less than a week, but so far, I've noticed it getting up to temperature MUCH faster. Anyway, there were a few complications.First, the cool setting kept blowing heat. After following a few suggestions online that didn't work, I realized when the prompt asked you if it was on and blowing heat\/cool, I was selecting heat because the icon showed it and I heard the system turn on. This was not the case. It was backwards despite being wired properly, and I was choosing the wrong response due to the heat icon. It solved the problem, but made me feel pretty dumb, lol! It seems like a common issue, so pay attention to that.Second, every time you reset the thermostat, it disconnects it from your Alexa app. This was particularly frustrating because I had to restore the settings to factory, delete the thermostat from the app, and start from square one. I'm wondering if I'll have to go through this every time the Wi-Fi glitches (which happens often with Spectrum).Third, \"Auto\" means it will switch between heating AND cooling. It's not the same as your standard thermostat. It will turn off on just the cool setting as long as you choose the auto fan setting in the app.For now, it's pretty decent.

I can not do this with this thermostat.  SO scheduling temperatures are very limited.  I even tried setting up Alexa Smart Home Routine's to check the temps and set them lower at this time, but they didn't seem to be working as well unless I manually ran them.

Also, once you're set to Schedule and you go on vacation you have to go turn off the schedule and set a hold temperature.  It would be nice to set an Away Vacation temp and just turn on Vacation Mode or something.  My Sensi wifi thermostats had this feature and I loved it.  They also had more temp settings which i could control easier as well.  I may switch back but hoping to see some updates come down the line.Otherwise, the thermostats work with my Alexa very well obviously.  And I've had no problems with them since installing them.

I assumed that the thermostat was bad and returned it to Amazon.I then ordered and promptly received a replacement.  When I installed, it also was dark!  and failed to go into the setup mode.  At this point, it had to be the wiring in my home.  This thermostat was on the 2nd floor of the house and was connected by a 30 ft 5 wire 18 gage  copper cable to the furnace.  A short section of the connection (on the C terminal)  was 20 gage wire (thinner).  What I discovered was that when the head unit was on the wall, the C to R voltage dropped from 24 to 3 volts!

The app also shows the humidity, so we can make sure that is set properly too. Wonderful integration with it. Our only gripe, and the only thing keeping me from giving it a full 5 stars is that you have two separate ways for the temperature to adjust itself: programming and hunhces. Hunches are nice because if we head out, the thermostat will automatically set itself to our \"away\" temperature. We loved that, but didn't like that we couldn't program a set time in for bed and wake-up. Hunches always turned the temp down after we were already in bed and didn't bring it back up until we were out of bed, moving around. We were used to having the temp go down a half hour or so before we went to bed and back up again just before getting up and hopping in the shower.Maybe Amazon will come out with a software update that can also use a hybrid of hunches and programming. For example, something where you can set it to always use the programmed settings between, say, 10:00 pm and 5:00 am and use Hunches the rest of the time so if we happen to leave during the day, the temp will drop to the away temperature.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1645488000000}

Customer service is usually VERY GOOD and so is there shipping and wide array of products. Still, sending used and broken items, not once, twice?They have changed the test on here a bit, before you buy, but the testing doesn't show the true configuration if this product will work with your system. It will ask what wires are connected and tell you it's ok to purchase this.I couldn't get the heat section of the thermostat to work. This time I waited on the line when I called for a customer service rep from Resideo. We did a video chat and he looked at the wiring configuration. We had to make a change and use different codes to select during setup, that are not mentioned anywhere.So finally, I get this to work!

My old thermostat was calibratible as well the drift (how much temperature change has to occur before the HVAC comes on).  It's summertime, and my thermostat says it's 74 degrees when it's actually 73 degrees (so it's off by +1 degree).  The swing appears to be only 0.5 degrees, so balancing your dampers is critical to avoid excessive cycling.  (Tech Support got 2 stars because didn't understand these two settings) You really only have 2 temperature Schedule settings..\"Home\" and \"Away\" .  There's no a in-between setting.  I'm also not sure how the thermostat will work in the winter when using Heat.  My old thermostat had a setting that delayed 'auxillary' heat to assist the Heat pump when it's very cold outside or when you go from \"Away\" to \"Home\".  Again, tech support didn't understand my question.

The app guides you through the setup process and does a good job of it.Con - The Alexa app is terrible as far as managing the thermostat; more specifically connecting to it. On some occasions (very few) when I open Alexa, the thermostat will connect after a few seconds. More often than not, it can sometimes take up to 5 minutes before Alexa will connect. I originally thought it was the thermostat, so Amazon sent me a replacement with the same results. The device is 20 feet from the router and showing as connected with great signal strength. Amazon support was no real help other than sending me a replacement.I also dislike the fact that there is no manual. Sure, you can stumble about on the support site, but it really never covers anything about the manual operation of the thermostat. It mostly focuses on doing everything through the Alexa app. Perhaps I'm old school, but I prefer to have something I can print out and view without having to use my computer to access.I still have a few days before the return window closes and am debating sending this back.

THE PROBLEM IS - the thermostat buttons are so complicated anyone could screw up the settings when trying to adjust it which causes energy consumption or causes me to have to constantly monitor the thermostat during the day even when a schedule is set - BECAUSE the schedule can be turned off by mistake when using the thermostat. ONE MORE THING - If you have schedule on but someone presses the mode button ONCE it automatically turns the FAN ON whilst following the scheudle so the fan will be on forever and never turn off just by someone pressing the mode button one single time, because its the next mode in the toggle","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1694044800000}

I followed all the steps to reset the setting on the thermostat nothing worked. I got aggravated and even started searching for a new thermostat.

Then on the thermostat you hold down the up and down and middle buttons till it resets and then has a 5-0 count down. Release and hold down only the middle for the 5 seconds. It will completely reset to initial set up which is what I had to do since absolutely nothing worked.I hope that cleared up anything that was wrong but I have a feeling it\u2019s only a bandaid for now.

I was able to install the thermostat myself with no issues. However, when temps started to get a little cooler I found my auxiliary heat was running constantly. After calling a technician to come and inspect the system, we found the pump was trying to heat and cool simultaneously because I needed to adjust a default setting within the Alexa app. (We had to go to thermostat settings, HVAC type, and change the reversing valve to B from O).I have two gripes here: the first is that nowhere in the installation process does it warn you about possibly needing to adjust the default settings to ensure the thermostat works properly. Luckily we caught the issue quickly, otherwise this could have caused permanent damage to my system. The second is that there is no way to adjust the system settings on the thermostat, so the technician had to use my phone to find the right settings.

This is quite disappointing that the sensor was inaccurate out of the box.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1719705600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Fantastic product but beware, only one will work if you have Honeywell HZ311 for multi zone house","reviewDescription":"I just got two installed. Installing with the help of instructions from Alexa app was a breeze. I am a novice when it comes to doing any DIY projects and was scared to do anything with a thermostat!But it all went with no problems. I replaced 2 thermostats ( Honeywell) and can't wait to see how this Amazon thermostat works out. I got these because recently on a hot summer week, I forgot to turn the a\/c off when we left town for a week. And that is when I wondered about having a wifi enabled smart thermostat. And when Amazon came out with their product, I got two of these.The units beautiful and much more affordable than others on the market. Plus made by Honeywell!I wish all other smart home products are easy affordable and good as this Amazon Smart Thermostat.UPDATE 11\/13\/2021. For last many days, I noticed that only one thermostat was able to control the furnace. The HVAC was not being triggered by the second one. I chatted with Amazon device support and reset the thermostats (as per their recommendations) multiple times with no resolution. They then advised me to call Resideo Smart Thermostat support line. The gentleman there tried to problem solve same way with no resolution. He then told me that a technician will need to come to check voltage etc from the thermostat wiring to HVAC ( and that will cost me money). Then I did online search myself re Honeywell HZ311 and found others had similar problem with other Honeywell Smart Thermostats. I then removed one Amazon smart thermostat and put back the manual. So now I have one Amazon Smart Thermostat and one manual one and all is working great.I wish this was known to me before I purchased 2 of these and spent hours trying to fix the problem. Also I hope Amazon and Honeywell can have better product support especially when new products are introduced.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"83 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636243200000}

{"reviewTitle":"No Anticipator Settings. Swing settings.","reviewDescription":"First, this is the first Amazon device I have ever given a bad review. I wanted to like it. It looked good and was full of features for the price. The issue for me was that there were no Anticipator Settings. Most people today call this the swing setting.All thermostats in the past had Anticipator settings. It works this way. If you set the temp to 73 and the furnace heats the home to 73, the thermostat turns off the heating system. So what temp does the home have to drop to before the furnace turns back on? This is where the Anticipator settings come into play. You could adjust it for say a 2 degree swing. In this example when the temp dropped to 71 the furnace would kick back on. So if a thermostat does not have this setting, then the manufacture pre-set a fixed one.This thermostat seems to kick back on before temp drops to 72. I would assume that the pre set is 0.5. This basically means the furnace will run almost constantly.I have read where some people like this. If they set the temp to 73 then the home is always 73.If you have a thermostat that does this the furnace will run all the time. This is not good for your HVAC system. It is to much wear and tear on your HVAC.My understanding is there are smart thermostats that have Anticipator Settings that are fixed at a few degree swing. I have only found one smart thermostat that has adjustable settings.You may like it this way. If you do, this is a great buy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670112000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazon Smart t-stat honest review","reviewDescription":"I\u2019m a big Nest fan had it on my old house the problem that I have with them it\u2019s the cost, and even with gas company great rebate didn\u2019t justify the cost especially with my new home having a total of 5 thermostats (t-stat). I was excited when I found that Amazon partner with Honeywell to get this t-stat created as Honeywell has been creating t-stat for years which make me feel better when making the purchase.---COST---Now let go over the details for cost it\u2019s good and I got two of them which at the end of the day will be free due to the electric company rebate for a smart t-stat.  I didn\u2019t get a C- adapter and I will explain later (INSTALL session) why I purchase a 24-volt transformer for my first-floor unit.---INSTALL---Love the package it reminds me of the NEST when it first starts came with everything that you needed the only additional tools, I need was a harmer, and drill but this is normal for these installations.Now the biggest question that everyone has is the C (common) wire. This is where you need to do your research regardless of what company you go with when upgrading to a smart thermostat, due your homework on what you need. For me I have a spill unit (boiler & A\/C) first for my second-floor unit it was super easy I had an extra wire and I use it for Common the t-stat startup and finish within 30 min. Now for my first floor I utilize a 24-volt transformer because I didn\u2019t have spare cables and I didn\u2019t want to run a new cable which drove me to make the purchase again do your homework before and see what option best works for your use case.I connected the transformer to the C wire and the other end to Rc and that works like a champ. This is critical if you have a split unit since Honeywell power their t-stat via Rc only when you have two RED Wire (R (heater) and Rc(cooling)) and the blue tab (internal jumper is down position. If you only have one RED Wire you are fine just keep the blue tab up and your t-stat will turn on without any problems.  I did reach out to Honeywell and explain to them they need to explain this on their site and white papers that when you have split units\u2019 power for the t-stat will come from Rc and not from R this is critical because my house previous owner installed a switch to keep the A\/C unit down through the winter to avoid accident turning on the unit which is great idea. Please keep in mind this is NOT an Amazon problem that is Honeywell they did acknowledge their mistake and agree to update their site and documentation.Running my transformer cable and installing the unit took me about 60 minutes because I wanted to look perfect with the transformer cable going through the wall this make the installation look cleaner.----SETUP----Once all wire were connected the setup of the t-stat was simply and when I say simple it was super didn\u2019t have input the WiFi password or anything else since it automatic joined my account that was amazing and simply just like setting a fire table that was a great experience. Amazon did an amazing job doing this some users this my not be as good, but I look automation the less click I must do the less chances of mistake A+---LOOK---The t-stat looks great after the final install the wall panel (included but optional for install) made it easier for me since I didn\u2019t have to paint (if you had a different color paint I would recommend adjusting before completing the install but that is just me)---Interface (GUI)----For me the GUI is great for some it my but I\u2019m one of those people that like to have one application on my phone or tablet rather than 2 and this is where Amazon did another amazing job. Please keep in mind that Google who purchase NEST is doing the same thing I see the NEST application going away in the future all new NEST is configure from Google Home and they also did a great job The GUI it\u2019s simple and allows you to setup multiple schedules and copy them to different days or week. Huge plus on my book because for the NEST I had to do manually per day I can setup one day and copy to another. You can setup away and home schedule or utilize your current Amazon device to tell the t-stat that you are home or away. Another item that I love from the Amazon you can setup MAX cooling or heating this allows for mistake not to happen and getting your house too hot or cool really go option to have and you can set filter replacements without your assistance (optional) for me this is great no more remembering air filter as they will show up at my footsteps.Energy saving incentives can also be done via the application. The dashboard its great too it tells you how much energy you utilize each day and where you can save.Now the only downside for that I experience is only scheduling session on Android because it forces close my Alexa application all the time, I don\u2019t have this problem with anything else on the application just the scheduling session. This option works perfect on my wife new iPhone and iPad pro and new Android phone. My old Android is the one with this problem, but I experience this kind of thing on and off since it\u2019s an older device.-------Final judgment ----The device is good option for a smart t-stat and would recommend for anyone some of the problems that were reported it was on day one which is expected with any new launch overall I see this t-stat giving Google (NEST) and others a run for their money as now you have a great option for smart t-stat and you don\u2019t require to break your budget to acquire one. In addition, love the one application for everything as previously mentioned all big companies are doing this model to stop the install of some many other applications. In a scale from 0 -10 this t-stat gets a 9 please note that the NEST 3rd gen got a 9 from me. Hope this helps everyone make the correct decision and I will update this review in a few weeks to report back.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"815 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1649808000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Triple check your wiring before purchase!","reviewDescription":"For reference, I\u2019m a 20F that\u2019s pretty good with home maintenance. I\u2019m also a nail tech, so I installed this with long nails. I definitely suggest running a stud finder (Hart makes a good one with live-wire detection) over the area your thermostat is sitting before drilling. I ran into a horizontal beam while trying to drill for the wall anchors and ultimately wasn\u2019t able to use them. If I\u2019d checked with the stud finder vertically before drilling I would\u2019ve known that I didn\u2019t need the anchors- so don\u2019t be like me.Overall, this thermostat was very easy to install. My home is newly constructed, so I luckily had a compatible wire setup where I only needed to remove the wires, label them, and insert them into the base station. It was very easy to insert them once I had a decent hold on them, but with my nails it was pretty difficult. That\u2019s my own fault, but I figured I\u2019d mention that for any other women looking to replace their thermostat on their own. Just please triple check your wiring before purchase to ensure it\u2019s compatible! Some people may also need a C-wire, but I didn\u2019t so unfortunately I can\u2019t review that aspect.Tips:Don\u2019t forget to turn off your power! If you can\u2019t find the A\/C switch, just turn off your main power. It\u2019s much safer than trying to mess with live wires. It takes about an hour to complete and you\u2019ll be working very closely with wires the entire time.If you find that your original thermostat is already installed without wall anchors, you most likely don\u2019t need to drill. Just mark on the wall where the screws need to go and screw them directly into the wall. Wall anchors are only needed when there\u2019s no stud behind the drywall.Best of luck!Edit: I\u2019ve had this thermostat for a few months now and I love it! It works very well at keeping my home at an eco-friendly temperature when I want to save money. You can set preferred temperatures in the app for while you\u2019re home, away, or sleeping and set times for those preferred temps to start. I love this thermostat!

Then I check my thermostat's wiring, and not only does it have a C wire, it is a Honeywell.Under the covers, the Amazon thermostat is a Honeywell.Most thermostats, these days, are set up so that they have a backplate that you wire up, and then you snap the thermostat on.Since I was replacing a Honeywell thermostat of recent manufacture, and since I had a C wire, installing was as simple as unsnapping the old thermostat and snapping on the Amazon\/Honeywell.  I checked the backplate and they were completely compatible.Then I cranked up the app and once I found the thermostat installation in the app (the hardest part), it scanned the barcode on the install book.  Then, after a few minutes of probing and processing, it was hooked up to my wi-fi.  Completely painless if you don't include the part where my wife yells at me because it turned on the heat to test things in the middle of a Florida summer.I especially like the way it controls the thermostat using temperature sensors in alexa devices you already have, and, if I understand the doc, you can decide to use sensors in the bedroom while sleeping, and in the kitchen while working there.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722988800000}

Nothing voice controlled. (Still don\u2019t). But we really wanted a cost effective Wifi enabled thermostat because the old timey Honeywell we had for eons just couldn\u2019t cut it with our travel schedule.We have a Ring security system and I really bought this one because supposedly it was compatible with it.

But I decided what the heck give it a chance.And you know what?  It all worked out. Quickly and easily too. The wiring for our HVAC control board already had the C-wire landed and ready to go up at the T-stat location. The extra plate it comes with was needed due to the old Honeywell\u2019s holes and works great so that was nice.  The Alexa instructions worked fine. But definitely pay heed to all the reviewers who said that the instructions timeout and you have to restart from the beginning when that happens. They do!  So every 15-30 seconds I gave my phone screen a little jiggle to keep it from timing out. Perhaps my Low Power Mode also contributed. Ooopsie. Just be aware and swerve around it and you\u2019ll be fine.In operation it does everything I need. I work from home so I don\u2019t need fancy schedules although it seems ready to do that.

Alexa does go into guard mode when my wife says she is leaving but the thermostat stays at our at home temp and never does lower.

So why isn't it perfect?The bad:First of all I had a honeywell thermostat I was replacing. Newer, as the house was only built in 2012. So all the wiring should have matched directly up. We'll. When I first installed it I matched all the wiring up and it would only turn our heat on (I have all electric ac and heating). Having the thermostat set at 74, one afternoon it heated our house all the way up to 80 degrees and we were now sweating in our home while it was 60 some degrees outside. After a lot of internet looking I broke down and called tech support for this thermostat through Amazon. After a short conversation with the support person in reference to the fact I'd already ensured I reset it it was functioning and the wiring was correct. THey had me switch one of the wires, to a different connection on the thermostat. Magically it worked. Now it functions awesome.My second gripe about this is a complete first world problem, but that is after all why I bought this thing. It is extremely irritating that you can only hook it up to one phone\/device. So our household is all connected through alexa. We've got smart lights smart appliances and a smart vaccum. I have gone through the steps of trying to have a shared household through the alexa app but it just doesn't work. So it is programmed to my wife's phone who is now at work and I just tried to change it with alexa and she didn't have a clue what device I was talking about. Realizing it's paired through my wife's alexa app and not mine which is where everything else is programmed. I guess this is more my general problem with alexa is having a shared household is simply not easy at all.I sound like I'm griping alot but truth be told, this thermostat really is awesome. It can be as smart and beneficial as you want or as stand alone and simple as you want. You literally can control it and it really is smart. It does work great now since I've gotten the wiring changed the way tech support had me do, I haven't had an issue. One word of advice though, if you have a dual band router. Make sure you have the 2.4 and 5ghz networks separate or you will have connection issues. This thermostat works on the 2.4 ghz network like most of our smart items. I hope this helps you and provides you a bit of insight! Have an awesome day.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671321600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazon Smart Thermostat","reviewDescription":"Review of the Amazon Smart Thermostat, based on my personal experience. In this review, I will delve into both the advantages and disadvantages of this product, including the challenges I encountered during the setup process.Pros:1. Energy Efficient: The Amazon Smart Thermostat proudly bears the ENERGY STAR certification, ensuring that it adheres to rigorous energy efficiency standards. This feature instills confidence in the device's ability to effectively manage energy consumption and potentially save you money on utility bills.2. Seamless Integration: If you are an Alexa user like myself, you'll appreciate how effortlessly the thermostat integrates with your existing Echo devices. The convenience of using voice commands to adjust temperature and settings without touching the thermostat adds a touch of modern convenience to your home.3. DIY Installation: The promise of a do-it-yourself installation is certainly enticing, and for many users, it proves to be quite manageable. With clear instructions, even those with limited technical skills can have a go at installing the thermostat independently.4. User-Friendly App: The Amazon Alexa app accompanying the thermostat offers a user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the device directly from your smartphone. Adjusting temperature, setting schedules, and monitoring energy usage becomes an intuitive experience.Cons:1. Challenging Setup: While the concept of a DIY installation is appealing, my personal experience with the setup process was less than ideal. Specifically, connecting the thermostat to the Alexa app was far more challenging than anticipated. It sometimes required multiple attempts and restarts, which led to frustration.2. C-Wire Requirement: Another drawback I discovered is the necessity of a C-wire during installation. Unfortunately, my home lacked this wiring, which meant I had to purchase an additional accessory. This unexpected expense and the hassle of acquiring and installing the accessory added an extra layer of complexity.3. Limited Features: The Amazon Smart Thermostat does offer essential functionalities, but it falls short in terms of more advanced features. For users seeking a thermostat with learning capabilities or geofencing, this product may not meet their expectations.In summary, the Amazon Smart Thermostat presents noteworthy benefits like energy efficiency, seamless integration with Alexa, and a user-friendly app. However, it's important to note that the setup process may prove more challenging than advertised, particularly when attempting to connect with the Alexa app. Additionally, the requirement for a C-wire and the absence of advanced features may not meet the needs of every user.Ultimately, it is crucial to carefully evaluate your specific requirements and weigh them against the pros and cons before deciding if the Amazon Smart Thermostat is the right fit for your home.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"51 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687996800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great price to feature value, but you may want to pay more for more tech.","reviewDescription":"Tough to decide if it should be 4 or 5 stars. I gave 4, but only because it is lacking some tech features. Looking at price per feature, I could definitely make it a 5 star.I have multiple smart thermostats, this Amazon smart thermostat and two ecobee 3 lites. I have had the ecobee's for multiple years, so they are the baseline of my comparison. There are a few features that I like about the ecobee that the Amazon thermostat does not have.The first is that the minimum heat temperature setting is 50\u00b0F. Probably not an issue for 99.9% of the people, but this is located at our vacation home in cold northwest Wisconsin, and in the winter when we are not there I set this thermostat at 45\u00b0F (this thermostat is for the secondary in-floor heat in the basement, there is a 2nd thermostat for the forced air furnace set at 48\u00b0).  I am ok with just shutting off the heat on this thermostat as it won't run anyway (unless the forced air furnace quits working).The second feature that I like on the ecobee is the vacation mode. In that mode I can set a vacation temperature at whatever I want, and can set an end time to go back to the normal programmed modes. I usually set the time 4-8 hours before I anticipate getting home from \"vacation\" to get the house back to desired temperature.  I cannot find that feature on the Amazon Thermostat, but again it's not a deal breaker because I can just pull up the app and adjust the temperature 4-8 hours before I return... but I have to remember to make the change - and hopefully I have wifi or cell service.Last feature that is not available on the Amazon thermostat that is available on the ecobee is \"sharing\". I am able to \"share\" the ecobee thermostat app with others in my family, so they can adjust the thermostat before they take off for the cabin.  Again, not a big deal, they just have to ask me to turn up the heat before they get there.But on the plus side of few features, there are a lot less menus to have to step through to set up the features that the Amazon thermostat does have, which are really probably 90% of what most people want any way.So for the $100+ savings over the ecobee thermostat, the work-around for the features that aren't there are worth it for me.  But if you are one that needs or wants the multiple other features of the ecobee (or Nest and others), you may be happier with spending the extra $'s for the more features.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668038400000}

{"reviewTitle":"If you have an electric heatpump READ THIS!","reviewDescription":"So the install \"wizard\" isn't perfect or even polished at this point.  I've installed wifi thermostats before, Honeywell makes this one so I figured it would be easy enough since I've done those before.  The first mistake was thinking that Amazon would have their act together on this.  Not the case...IF YOU HAVE AN ELECTRIC HEATPUMP SYSTEM IMPORTANT INFO!  In my case my 2010 era Carrier system had one specific wire that caused me an issue:  W\/White with no other identification.  I knew this was heat but was unsure do I hook it up to W?  W2?  The install wizard asked me for what wires I had, and then completely NEGLECTED to indicate hooking up \"W\" at all!  The guided wizard would be amazing if it actually worked... if you pause to long during the process there is no \"resume\" and you start over from scratch which is annoying.Called Amazon support, and discussed the W\/W2 situation with them, they of course can't help with wires but did give me a 1-800 number to call for Honeywell\/Resideo.  They were very helpful and indicated because it was a heatpump system, use W2(aux) - they mentioned the \"gray\" labelled alphabet on the wire hookup guide was for a standard\/classic system and thus because I had a heatpump which is \"nonstandard\" and W was part of the \"gray standard wires\" that is the logic to use W2(aux) instead.  Great info, now why could I not find that in any documentation?So Amazon, fix the wizard so you provide additional resources if the wires the customer indicates they have do not match up with your database, the fact they just ignored a whole wire when they asked for that specific information directly was big red flag on how rushed this product really is.  Also, if you run through setup and during diagnostics they have an issue and say \"call us\" you are exited from the wizard and have to completely reset the thermostat from scratch and start at step 1.  Basically my time spent to install was simply fighting with the wizard and one simple question that I couldn't get answered easily.  Hindsight is to just pretend you are installing a Honeywell instead and look up a real install guide!Overall it seems to work fine, I like the option for the fan to be ON\/AUTO\/CIRCULATE as I love the intermittent circulation option.  I dislike the fact there is no voice command to change this setting.Best part is its a CHEAP thermostat that looks good, and while its no NEST its a better looking Honeywell with Amazon smarts to help learn your patterns so we'll see how it goes!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636502400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good Basic Thermostat; How to Fix a Fan That Won't Stop","reviewDescription":"On the positive side, this is a good basic smart thermostat that integrates with Alexa (as would be expected). If you have a simple system and do not need fancy features, this is an excellent entry-level replacement thermostat.The Alexa app provides clear guidance for the entire installation, so it requires only basic skills to install. Just be sure to confirm that it will work with your system.On the negative side, the thermostat and its in-app options (such as scheduling) are quite basic; but this is offset by the price. There is also a chance you will run into an issue with the fan (this is mentioned by other customers).My first install seemed to go smoothly and I followed the directions step by step. But when I tested the AC, I found that although it would stop cooling at the set temperature, the fan would just keep running as long as the thermostat was on. Turning it off did turn the fan off, but that was obviously not a good solution. I checked the likely causes for the issue (such as having the fan set to \"on\" in the app) but found nothing wrong.Being an old hand at fixing PCs, I did the obvious and factory reset the thermostat to start over. The install did not go as smoothly this time (it failed to set up using the bar code) and would not progress beyond the stage at which I entered the info about what wires were connected to what. But I was able to fix that.The first time I installed it, I put the W wire in the W connector on the Amazon thermostat. This is how it connected on the old thermostat (photo included). But on the second install, this was rejected by the app. It told me to connect the W to the W2 (normally for \"Aux heat\") and not W. I did this, and completed the setup \"manually.\" When I tested it, the fan worked correctly. Since the G wire controls the fan (drawing power from the R wire) it seems odd that changing the W wire from the W connector to the W2 connector did not make a lot of sense, but it seems to have worked (or maybe it was just the complete reset).So, if you have the running fan issue, check that your wiring matches what the app says and try the factory reset.Here is how to do the factory reset:\"A factory reset erases all data on the thermostat, including HVAC configuration and device settings. On the Smart Thermostat, press the Up Temperature, Down Temperature, and Mode buttons together for 10 seconds, until rEs appears on the display. Press and hold the Mode button for 5 seconds, until the device resets.\"","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"164 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669680000000}

It's convenient and integrates with Alexa very well, but some of the LED lights have burned out in less than a year and the numbers just look wonky now. I'm not going to replace it for $70 so it's just dumb looking and disappointing. Search reviews for \"LED\" and you'll see this is an issue for this thermostat. I'd stay away from it.*EDIT 09\/05 - **Dropped my review from 2 stars to 1 star** Here's why: I was contacted by Amazon Customer Service today because of this review. I was contacted to be told that my device was out of warranty and Amazon can't (had chosen not to) replace it. When I asked if the failing display was a known issue as it seems to be on multiple reviews. I was told that it did appear to happen, but some customers had fixed the display by factory resetting their thermostats (didn't work for me). I told the Amazon Rep. (who I don't want to name; they were VERY kind) that if a specific component on their devices failed in a short amount of time for many customers, I thought it was very appropriate for the manufacturer to act outside of the warranty and correct the issue by any means necessary. Again, \"we can't (choose not to) replace the unit as it's out of warranty\". I'm not shaming the Customer Service Rep, he was doing his job, but Amazon the company should be ashamed for not sending out a new $50 thermostat to every customer who's display is failing. Thermostats should not need to be replaced on a 12 month cycle.*EDIT 09\/06 - **Raised my review from 1 stars to 4 stars** Right after the update posted above, I was again contacted by Amazon Customer Service. This time, they informed me that the Device Retrieval Team had taken an interest in my device and they requested I send the thermostat to them promptly for evaluation in their engineering lab. In addition, they offered me a free replacement and immediately credited my account with the cost of a new thermostat. SO, after all is said and done, Amazon DID come back and make it right, AND it's a programmable smart thermostat with good Alexa integration. 4-stars. Final answer.

{"reviewTitle":"Love it, but had to replace it","reviewDescription":"I bought this thermostat 2 years ago. I had no problem getting it up & running with Alexa. Recently I had to travel out of state, so I programed it for \"away\" (temp set to 62 deg). I checked it a couple times while I was away, and it was fine. When I returned to within 50 miles of home, I tried to turn the temp up to warm the house & my app read \"unresponsive\". When I got home, I was able to turn the temp up manually but when I tried to reset it to connect to Alexa It quit altogether. Just the 'set\" light and a orange blinking \"!\" point. went through the set up several times to no avail. Luckily, I found one at Lowes about 40 miles away since I couldn't wait 2 days for delivery, I live in western New York (COLD). So, to wrap this up I love the thermostat but don't know what went wrong and no tech support would give any indication as to what to do except buy a new one, so I just hope this was a fluke and my new one lasts more than 2 years, it's the first time I ever had a thermostat go bad.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705449600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Very basic 1st Generation Amazon Smart Thermostat","reviewDescription":"Read all the reviews as many cover the short commings of this thermostat.Does it work as advertised?  Yes.  It does what it promises but it could be so much more powerful.Pros:1.  Tasteful design.  I do like that it blends right into the wall and isnt visually calling attention to itself.  In a narrow hallway, you will likely walk right past it on a day-to-day basis.  Perfect.2.  Integrates perfectly with Alexa.  Getting Alexa to discover the thermostat was bullet proof.Cons:1.  Installation instructions are horrible.  The reliance upon a phone app to install is the wrong approach especially if you want to hand the job over to a 3rd party HVAC company.  If you are lucky enough to have wiring that is ready to go, you can do the installation yourself.  I really dont believe that everyone fits into that category and having the instructions available fully printed for a HVAC tech would not have been difficult.  Also, the wiring wizard was nice but should also have been available from a website for a HVAC tech.  The wiring wizard also was buggy in that there were optional wiring choices that were on separate UI panels and moving back and forth on the panels unchecked choices.  It was a mess.  The QR code was printed on the manual which can easily be thrown away which is undoubtedly going to happen.  The QR code sticker should also be on the backplate so it can never be lost.2.  Alexa voice control is underwhelming.  If Alexa already knows the daily weather forcast, I would expect a lot more 'smarts' about advising what to do next for scheduling.  I am not interested in the hunch feature.  It should be saying, 'I've noticed the forecast is calling for freezing temperatures.  Would you like to adjust your thermostat?'  Nope. Just dumb old Alexa complaining she doesnt understand or cant because I have selected an automatic range.  The Alexa app is devoid of statistics.  I want to see efficiency charts.  Nope.3.  Local rebates are non existent for where I live.  Be sure to check in advance if you are expecting a rebate of any kind.Would I purchase this again if I had to do it over?  YesWould I recommend this to someone?  Depends.  If they must replace an older thermostat, sure.  If they have a working semi-smart thermostat, no.

{"reviewTitle":"Does the job","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve had this installed for about 2 months and it seems to work great so far. It requires a c-wire for power, which if you don\u2019t have one installed, you can buy separately. I installed it myself, and my furnace just had the old 2-wire line going to the thermostat. Replacing the wire was by far the hardest part of installation; after that, install is a snap. My level of handiness is about 2 out of 5; I like to do things myself if possible, but I don\u2019t have nearly the prowess of an experienced handyman or a professional. This was my first experience with a furnace, but once I got the wire in, it was a really simple process; just follow the steps in the instructions.Note: the app could use some work.

{"reviewTitle":"Great, but...","reviewDescription":"I received this thermostat as a gift from my sister.C-wire:  My old thermostat did not have an attached C-wire.  It did have an unconnected loose wire available.  Inspection of the HVAC motherboard had the C-wire connected BUT the C-wire was capped with a wire nut after it exited the HVAC unit.  I connected the available thermostat wire to the HVAC C-wire.  Next  I connected the opposite end into the \"C\" slot of the Amazon thermostat.I experienced difficulty getting the thermostat to speak with Alexa.  Therefore I suggest you abandon the Alexa instructions and simply hit the \"+\" in the Alexa app to add the new thermostat.  IF you attempted the unsuccessfully connect the thermostat to Alexa, simply toss the \"thermostat\" in the trash can of the Alexa app and begin anew.My concern is that the thermostat works overtime to maintain the set temperature.  It comes on every few minutes.  When a furnance cycles too frequently, it wears out the furnace.  I will monitor this cycling to see if it persists once the furnance and the new thermostat become close friends.Second concern:  For a reason I do not yet understand,  the furnance fan remains ON after the thermostat is off.  I keep clicking  AUTO which means that the fan should only operate whenthe furnance is heating BUT if I manually turn the thermostat to OFF, the fan remains running.  When I take a look at the settings, fan has mysteriously put itself to ON and thus runs continously.The reason I turn the thermostat on\/off manually is to avoid the short cycles which will wear the furnance out.  Thus, in the long run, having a smart thermostat would save me nothing,  rather it would cost me money.As I write, my thermostat is set to automatically cycle.  In the time it took me to type this review it has cycled on\/off three times.  If Amazon put through a software update to tell the thermostat to not cycle until the temperature dropped 1.5 degrees or conversely increased 1.5 degrees for air conditioning,  I would give this thermostat  5 stars.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1674518400000}

It just prefers to use presets for things like \u201chome\u201d, \u201caway\u201d, \u201csleeping\u201d, etc. So you have to set those values, then assign them to times for each day. The design of this isn\u2019t very intuitive.The other issue with this is since it relies on the scheduled presets, Alexa is unable to override when I say \u201cAlexa set the temperature to 70 degrees\u201d for example. Alexa says she can\u2019t and references the presets for the temp zones.

I couldn't just connect it with Alexa.  I had to get the Honeywell App.  But which one ?  There are over 10 Honeywell Apps.  I finally figured out that the App is called RESIDIO, and not Honeywell.  The company gave me a new login name. However, Microsoft doesn't recognize that assigned login name, so I cannot log in.  I got into the Residio App, and it gives me a choice of 5 different thermostats to install.  No clue which one I'm supposed to choose.  It is so complicated that even DTE in partnership with Amazon, refused to install it.  And a private contractor couldn't get it to work either.  Don't waste your money like I did, buying it twice, as I was told I needed the C wire adaptor which is not sold by itself, so I had to buy another Thermostat with the C-wire adaptor.

The icons can be a bit confusing (is it on heat or auto?  Is the fan on, off, auto, or recirculate?)Granted, being a typical male, I didn't read the instructions past hooking it up... >.>However, the Alexa integration is great... and Alexa will not only tell you what the current temperature is in the home, but also the humidity (a pleasant surprise!)As fall hit, I put it on Auto, saying \"Don't let it get below 68 degrees or above 74 degrees\" and it controlled both the furnace and air conditioning wonderfully.  If I found the house was getting \"Stuffy\" but the temperature was all right, putting it in recirculate mode runs the blower fan every so often to \"stir\" the air in the house, which kept the temperature consistent through the house, even if it wasn't calling for heat or cool.Additionally, you can program it to alert you (through Alexa) if the temperature gets outside of a range... great if you're on vacation and the heat stops working...Overall, I'm very satisfied with this Amazon-branded Honeywell thermostat.  Integration is great, temperature is accurate, and it works without thinking about it.  :)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701820800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Already have \"C\" wiring for power","reviewDescription":"I purchased this device for several reasons, mainly because my Google Nest stopped connecting to the WIFI. Now, normally I would just replace a device that stop working. However, this was the second Google Nest (only because the house already had one installed and it was so easy to pop on the other one), that had the same problem, and no matter how much troubleshooting I did they never connected back. The other reason I decided to go with an Amazon brand product was that my home is already having a vast majority of Amazon products (Ring cams, Ring doorbells, Astro, and Alexa) so when selecting the next device to add, was a no-brainer.INSTALLThis was a very straightforward process. Due to my home already being decided with a \u201cC\u201d wire. All I had to do was detach the Nest device and prepare the location for the Amazon device. Now, the only challenge I had with the installation was more on my house than the device. The location for my thermostat used a junction box for the wiring and harness. The Amazon device does not have a junction box adapter, so make sure you verify the location requirement. An easy fix to this was simply moving the housing unit on the Amazon device to the right (or left) where there was exposed drywall for me to mount.WIRINGHonestly, this was the easiest part. Now prior to buying the device I did read another post about not having wiring labels in the box, this was not the case, I did have label with my device. I would recommend before removing your old device, make sure you take a photo of the wiring and where they connect because it\u2019s pretty much detached \u201cred wire\u201d from the \u201cR\u201d slot on the old device and connect \u201cred wire\u201d to \u201cR\u201d slot on the new device. This was the easier wiring I have done electrically. Now, please be advised that the \u201cblue wire\u201d does not connect to the \u201cB\u201d slot (there isn\u2019t one). The \u201cblue wire\u201d is actually \u201ccyan\u201d and goes into the \u201cC\u201d slot. The other colors do align normally.CONNECTIVITYMake sure you already have the Alexa application already installed on your phone. If you do not, just go to the applicable store and download it. Once you have the application, simply go into the application, select devices, and add a new device. From there, the process is very straightforward. As I mentioned, make sure you take a picture of the wiring that you completed, to ensure during the setup process you can recall the color of the wires you connected.OVERALLThis process took me less than 15mins to install and the bulk of this was figuring out how to mount without having a junction box harness. Once I got past that hurdle, it was a 5mins attachment, wiring, and connecting. I recommend this device for anyone that is looking to update their \u201csmart thermostat.\u201d","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669852800000}

My first challenge was to determine if I had a C-Wire.  I THOUGHT I did, but wasn't sure. I ordered a C-Wire kit just in case, but that was taking several weeks.  Coincidentally I had a AC service tech come to the house and he confirmed that indeed I did have a C-Wire.  I cancelled the C-wire kit and waited for some time to do the installation.With two units (not properly marked on my electrical panel) I had to turn off both units and both furnaces.  With 100+degF days, I wanted to do this in the evening, as I wanted to minimize the heat accumulating in the house.  I found some time just before dusk, and started the work.With a drill , plyers and a screw driver I tackled the installation.  The backing plate was big enough to cover the older outline from my previous thermostat.  Downstairs I didn't need the sheetrock plastic screw bases as there was 2x4's beind the sheetrock; upstairs I did.My wiring was already stripped (and color coded) to match the proper locations.  Even so I took picures in advance to make sure I know where they were originally located.Green to G, Red  to R, White to W , Yellow to Y and so on.  Blue went to the C-wire spotI went pack to the electrical panel and turned on all my breakers, thus starting the Amazon Theremostat for the first time.  I went through the process of connecting to it via Bluetooth with my Alexa app. Be patient.  It took a minute or so to establish contact but ultimately connected to my wifi.  I answered t he question and named the device DOWNSTAIRS.  Everything looks to be working so I started the process again with my upstairs.  Even though my old thermostat was different from my downstairs, the wiring was the same colors.  I connected it up and powered it back up...  I was able to get it connected from downstairs!  Had I turned on ALL the breakers it would have been uneventful install.  The house kept getting hotter...  That's when I realized I'd not turned on ALL the breakers.  Restting the breaker, and the temp headed down exactly as desired\/intended.I setup a routine and allowed hunches.  So far so good.Interesting things: There is an option to remind for filter changes, and have them shipped from Amazon.  And there is a section in the app for energy utilization, which will come in handy when talking to solar panel installers, or power providers.I need to learn how to add the devices to my wife's Alexa app (we have two accounts).

Pull, push, click, done. If you have a newer, square-shaped Honeywell (T6, T9, T11...), look up its wiring diagram and this thermostat -- if they're identical, it means you can upgrade to this with next-to-no effort. Bonus if you're a renter or have some kind of HVAC warranty that might be considered void if they saw you have a new thermostat... well then you can just place your old thermostat right back. Click, snap.I've had a Nest Learning unit in the past, and this isn't quite as good. But it's actually pretty close! And it's far cheaper than even the dumbed-down budget version of Nest. If you already have Echo Dots around the house, this is a massive upgrade at a ridiculously low price point (compared to Ecobee or Nest.)The \"hunches\" do seem to act upon those Echos sensing if someone's making a sound. The AI has nailed every time we left the house, and when we're all asleep.Still, it has flubbed a few times, and I think it's for the one thing I miss from my old home that had a Nest: this lacks native temperature sensors. When I'm in the house's south-facing room, I'll ask Alexa to lower the temp by two degrees... then seconds later the \"Hunch\" inserts itself and says \"detected you're at home, so I set it to your preferred (i.e. unlowered) temperature\".  Argh. But this is happening a tiny bit less frequently, so it's learning!We primarily wanted *some* kind of app capability so we could monitor and control the HVAC when away from the house. Switching out a T6 with no connectivity, calling this upgrade a no-brainer is an understatement.

Now I'm happy","reviewDescription":"After I correctly hooked up all the wires to the Alexa thermostat and triple checked everything, the display still did not turn on as it should. So I went to the reviews here and saw that a few customers ran into the same issue. However, everyone just shipped back their device and no solution was provided.I contacted Amazon's\/Alexa's technical support for help, but their help was also useless. They didn't have any idea what the problem was. Luckily, I didn't give up and found the solution on a third party website.Apparently whomever installed our furnace did not hook up the common wire (blue wire in my case; supposed to hook into \"C\" at the furnace and thermostat) to the furnace. Most likely because our old thermostat used batteries, so it didn't need the common wire to work. Interestingly, the common wire was hooked up into the old thermostat anyways... So the problem was fixed by hooking up the common wire to the furnace where it's supposed to go. The new Alexa thermostat then worked as it was supposed to.So in sum, if your old thermostat has batteries, you have all required wires hooked up correctly to your new Alexa thermostat (including the common wire), and your new Alexa thermostat still doesn't turn on, then it could be that the common wire is not hooked up to your furnace.Good luck to everyone who runs into the same issue as me. I hope this review helps, as I saw no previous reviews provide any solution to the problem I ran into.Also want to mention that the thermostat with the Alexa app works fabulous.

What\u2019s been really convenient is that it runs on Alexa\u2019s hunches, so she sets it to a lower temperature when she has a hunch that nobody\u2019s home (it\u2019s winter) and does the same thing when she has a hunch that everybody\u2019s gone to bed. My husband gets up earlier than my daughter and I do so when she has a hunch that he is awake, she sets it to our preferred home temperature. This way the house is warmed back up a little by the time my daughter and I get up.If you have had problems with other smart thermostats and use Alexa to run your home, GET THIS THERMOSTAT. The thermostat\u2019s interface is simple enough that you could use it manually, but the app gives you more control and can help you create routines and use hunches to regulate the temperature in your home.The only complaint I have is that Alexa can\u2019t tell me what the humidity level is in the house when I ask my echo dot but it\u2019s totally fine because I can just go into the app and it will answer my question. Doesn\u2019t even warrant the loss of an overall star for this review because it\u2019s so trivial, but that\u2019s why I only rated four stars for the Alexa integration category. I LOVE this thermostat!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1646611200000}

It was replaced 3 times in 4 years. We were contemplating a nest, when I came across this thermostat. Let me tell you, this thing is awesome!!! With the exception of some wiring issues during the install process, (take a photo prior to removing your old t-stat) this unit performs flawlessly. And the fact that it also works with Alexa app and Dots, it makes it a rockstar!! The alexa app does the entire setup and it worked perfectly.  I set the fan to circulate and this helped with my wife's allergies! Not a single sneeze all day. You can setup schedules and the whole nine yards. It truly is amazing. The other great thing is it is Free!!! The rebate of 75.00 from your local utility company pays for the entire unit in full!! What do you have to lose?? Nothing. This device has the Honeywell name backing it. Honeywell engines are used in Tanks so enough said!! Do yourself a favor and get this awesome t-stat. You won't regret it. And if you are wondering about the optional C-Adapter, just verify your wiring on your thermostat to make sure you have a common wire. If you have the common wire, you dont need the adapter.

This Amazon unit has the input\/output for a 2 stage furnace which I have.  I had to replace my aged furnace with a new one with 2 stage operation.  The instructions are great if you already have a setup you aren't changing but I needed to rewire and redo the whole thing.  The instructions for that were terrible.  And with no way to skip through the process or easily go back to change the wiring scheme it made it absolutely frustrating.  I finally got it to work after several full hard resets and at that point was even less impressed.  Programmed in my schedule and after tinkering with all of the extra \"features\" realized that they were just stupid.  Why even have a preheat feature?  Just change your schedule to kick 15 minutes sooner?  Just why?  And with all the fancy programming on your phone you're limited to a 5\/2 schedule.  Seriously?  WTF?  I can tell Alexa to turn up the thermostat but can't have a separate Monday schedule?  Alexa says \"go to H....\"  At the end of the day you barely ever use the app, never change your schedule that much and don't ever want to dig through all the app menus to get to the thing.  And as for the rebate they advertise.  Check specifically with your fuel service provider.  This model wasn't covered.  So goodbye $50 back.

So far it has stayed connected and seams to be workingHowever, the set up process was far from easy as the instructions advise. It would help tremendously if the Alexa app or the thermostat itself would show the status of firmware\/software updates. At one point in the set up process the Alexa App advises that the thermostat needs to update its software and to continue the process after. There are two buttons at the bottom of the screen, the one on the right says next to continue on with the process. This would be great, but the app resets and exists out of the process well before 30 minute window the app advises it will take to update said software is completed. From there you cannot continue the process and have to start from scratch.Original 1 star review thoughts : I would love to give this device an good review but I just can\u2019t.

{"reviewTitle":"Scheduling can be fixed; thermostat section of Alexa app is awful","reviewDescription":"We received the thermostat a week ago. Installation was a simple enough, the app and instructions were very clear, took about an hour. Initially the thermostat works fine, set the temperature and it cools\/heats as intended. Changing the temperature and modes in the Alexa app works fine. We didn't try Alexa hunches because I work from home, so we wanted a fixed schedule for the thermostat.Setting up a schedule was painful, mainly because the scheduling feature in thermostat section of the app doesn't work. Also, setting it up caused the app to crash constantly. Once we set up the schedule, nothing would happen at the time changes, and the thermostat would have a flashing exclamation point indicating a problem but giving no explanation for the issue. The tech support documentation was useless as well, only 3 short web pages telling you how to reset the thermostat (or pull it off the wall lol).There is a way to set up a schedule, but you have to do it through Alexa routines and not the thermostat section of the app.Instructions:1. Go into the thermostat section of the Alexa and set it to heat\/cool mode since routines can't only change the temperature and not the mode of the thermostat.2. Tap to the more button on the bottom left of the app which brings up a menu and tap routines.3. Tap the plus button on the top right4. Enter a name for the event, such as \"get colder at sundown\"5. Tap \"when this happens\" and tap \"schedule\".6. Tap \"time\" to set a time for the event, or use sunrise or sundown as the time of the event.7. Once this is set, tap \"Add Action\" --> \"Smart Home\" --> \"All Devices\" --> \"Thermostat\"8. Tap set temperature and choose the temperature that you want to use at your chosen time.9. Set up Alexa routines for all of the daily temperatures changes you desire.Once we got through this convoluted process, the thermostat works well. Only issue remaining is it can't switch modes on a schedule, but this probably won't affect too many people.Hope this helps some of you that might have the same issue.Also, Amazon should remove the scheduling part of the app and just instruct people to use routines, would save people a lot of trouble (also also introduce them to the more versatile smart home features of Alexa).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658016000000}

The AC seemingly could not keep up with the heat (the temp would creep to 80 and above) and the humidity continued to rise (sometimes up to 75%) in my home. I know you're probably immediately saying something is wrong with my upstairs AC unit...BUT I replaced this thermostat with an ecobee thermostat and this issue has immediately stopped. I don't quite understand why the amazon thermostat was unable to get my upstairs below 80 degrees on hot days but the unit was literally running all day when it was over approximately 85 degrees here in Georgia. I don't know if the thermostat was running the fan too much and not the condenser because unfortunately the variables that users are able to control are very limited. I have seen an approximate 15% reduction in our energy usage since installing the ecobee upstairs on a day with the same average temperature. Not only is my upstairs cooler but the AC is running less. We do not have issues with our second amazon smart thermostat for our downstairs AC unit, it seems to cycle normally and we do not have the creeping temp or humidity issues downstairs. Also, until amazon allows this thermostat to overcool in order to dehumidify your home I don't really consider it \"smart\" compared to its competitors. Essentially the only \"smart\" feature this has is you can geofence with ONE thermostat in your home. If you have two of these amazon thermostats installed at home you're SOL because the geofencing will only work with one of them. Yes, the competition is more expensive but I can assure you a 15% reduction in my energy bill is quickly going to pay for itself.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1692662400000}

Update 12\/07\/2021 Fail !!!!!","reviewDescription":"Thermostat itself works flawlessly, but the guided setup in the Alexa app needs a little work. My heat pump uses the wires R,C,G,B,Y,and W1. At the point where I put in what wires I had, it seemed straightforward ,until it told me what wires it hook up and where. It left out the W1 wire completely, this is the auxiliary heat. Good thing for me the wire hook up plate had auxiliary heat clearly marked. After hook up and install I tried firing up the system and it ran backwards(heat was cool and cool was heat). I went in the configuration and it still had selected \"O\" Even though I clearly told it it was a \"B\" mode heat pump. Took a few tries to convince the app to change the configuration to \"B\". Once all this was done the thermostat worked flawlessly. Alexa actually had a hunch that my wife had gotten up early and turned the heat up this morning, cool beans. We really love the fact that the thermostat actually will dim when inactive, you can set that up in the app. The display is easy to use and see. All in all a great product, just the guided setup needs a little work.....Update 12\/07\/2021: I checked my energy usage after about a month of use. It was using my Aux\/Emergency electric heat more than I was used to seeing. I started watching as closely as I could. This thermostat was turning it on with just a two degree increase with it 45 degrees outside. I called support and found out that the setting for this is not configurable. I was also told that it was my system, nope.. the thermostat was calling for it. I replaced a Sensi with this thing. The Sensi would not call for Aux heat unless you really cranked to heat on a 35 degree day or more than fives minutes with no temp increase. So with the setup flaws and increase in my energy usage, I say forget the bells and whistles with Alexa...this thermostat is a fail.Update 03\/26\/2022: So I gave this thermostat another try about Jan 10th 2022. I reconfigured the controls back to having no W1, which is the Aux heat. So now the system(my heat pump) controls the AUX heat and calls for it when needed. Cutting out the thermostat from controlling Aux heat with a few mods to the heat pump has lowered my electric bill and it is working as it should.  So, we are at three stars....the install should have been easier or just as easy as my former Sensi or another \"Smart\" thermostat choices.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"216 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636156800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Works with Hot Water Boiler and Cast Iron Radiators but....","reviewDescription":"My old Honeywell programmable thermostat worked just fine for over 15 years. When I saw Amazon had a new smart thermostat made by Honeywell I thought, Alexa controls everything else in my house, I'll give it a try.I went into this knowing the original thermo wiring was going to need to be upgraded. My house was built in the '20s and the fabric-coated 18\/2 wire wasn't going to work.  Replacing it was easy enough, I just tied new 18\/4 wire to the old and pulled it down through the wall into the basement and down to the boiler. While the boiler isn't all that new, it's new enough to have a control board plug for the C wire that's required to run this thermostat.Other than that the installation is simple if you can match colors.  Took about 10 minutes to install the new thermostat.Once installed I accessed Alexa on my tablet to activate the app that controls the thermostat. That took about two minutes. I selected boiler\/hotwater heat as my default setting. This is because it takes some time to bring the heat up to the desired temperature with the radiators and the app anticipates this by turning the boiler on before the set times.  Also, the radiators keep emitting heat long after the thermostat shuts off the boiler something I assume it anticipates too.  I also let Alexa guess when to turn off\/on with Hunches but disabled that after two weeks when she basically just kept the house at the same temperature all the time.  I manually set the schedule instead.Which brings me to why I'm only giving it three stars.......It's way too sensitive to temperature changes and is constantly turning my boiler off and on!The thermostat is located in a high-traffic area of our house. It seems just walking by it is enough to lower the temperature a fraction of a degree for it to turn on the boiler.  A few minutes later it'll reach temp again and turn off. It will do this 2 or 3 times within 30 minutes when actively walking through the house.  If we're just sitting in the living room or anywhere else it will run normally. Not only is it annoying because it's a fairly loud click when it senses a temperature change, click-on then click-off again but it has me concerned about the extra activity it's putting on my boiler.  While there aren't too many mechanical parts to a boiler there are only so many cycles you can run through the circuit board before it finally wears something out.  My best guess is this doubles the number of times the boiler cycles off and on throughout the day. Now that may not seem like much but it basically cuts in half what life is left in the boiler.My old Honeywell never did this. It would cycle on maybe once an hour or two, that's it. At the moment I'm debating whether or not to put the old Honeywell back up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644278400000}

Easy to install and the app functions well. Now the bad- this thermostat tries to maintain very tight temperature control. For example, if you set the temp to 70, it tries to maintain 70.5. It will trigger the AC to come on at 70.75 and will shut it down by 70.25. This may be too tight of control for your household. In my house, this was too tight of control and since installing this thermostat, my compressor cycled on and off every few minutes, once it hit the set temp, unless I adjusted the temperature up or down manually. I believe I might have had difficulties with my system related to this. My previous thermostat only cycled about 1-2 times\/hour. An HVAC technician said this was not a normal operation for the single-stage AC I had in my house. FYI...the swing temperature and\/or cycle rate cannot be adjusted on this thermostat. If you have high ceilings or more air volume in your home you might not have this issue. I just replaced this Amazon product with a black square competitor and my system finally went back to operating normal. BTW\u2026I typically keep my thermostat at 70 in the summer\/winter. I did not buy this for the artificial intelligence. I travel away from home about once every two weeks for a night or two. I turn the AC up to 77 when I am away and wanted to be able to adjust it back to 70 prior to getting back home. I figured it could save some money and the environment.

{"reviewTitle":"UPDATED:  Sleek and Easy to install but some issues after several months usage","reviewDescription":"UPDATE after several months of usage:While I still like the thermostat overall, after several months of usage I wanted to update my original review.  First off...the thermostat has NEVER updated its firmware since I have installed it, almost 5 moths ago.  The app indicates the thermostat has older firmware but there is no manual way to have it update.  Amazon customer service unfortunately knows very little about this thermostat or any technical issues as I have contacted them for help about this.  I don't know if the newer firmware would help but I'll never know it seems.The other big issue is the VERY short cycling time so far this winter for heating I have noticed.  My furnace only shuts off for 5-7 minutes before the thermostat kicks it back on.  I live in a VERY poorly insulated house with many cold spots, but the temperature on the thermostat only needs to change 1 degree and it cycles back on.  I would like to be able to adjust this cycling time or temperature range but it does not allow for this.  I assume I will have a similar problem in the summer with the Air Conditioning on so I'll have to see as I may purchase a different thermostat model before then.Original review below:First off, I have tried several other \"smart\" thermostats, most were much more expensive or had a colorful \"busy\" display that while nice isn't necessary.  Given this thermostats price point, features and built-in Alexa integration it seems to be a good choice.For those having trouble installing...I don't know what to say.  I found the installation a breeze physically and then the configuration and setup through the App worked easily for me.  I would though also like an easier way to access the thermostat setting via an app on my phone as going through the Alexa app requires you to dig a few levels deep to get to it but that is not a deal breaker.The only odd thing I have found so far is the thermostat's display has a light sensor that detects ambient light for setting how bright\/dim the display goes.  What I found is during normal daylight or evening hours, the display is perfectly fine and stable.  However, when the room is dark instead of the display staying dimmed it cycles from dim to bright, back and forth all night (see my video for example).  If there is more light in the room then this stops but when it is dark enough it does this every time.

In Texas there are several months at the change of the seasons where I need to put it on \u201cAuto,\u201d but that limits me on what temperatures I can have for the highest heat setting and lowest AC setting. I still have not been able to hook it up to my Echo Dot, although I can use the Amazon Alexa app to control it. However, I have to push several buttons to get to the thermostat, and with recent weather I have to do this several times a day. Instead of making my life easier, it\u2019s making it more difficult. I\u2019ve been dealing with it and figured that there is a learning curve, but right now it is 64\u00b0 inside, the thermostat is set to 67\u00b0, the app says it is heating, but it is not. Apparently there is also an \u201cEco\u201d setting that is turned on right now, and I am unable to turn that off in any way. I just hope it starts heating soon because it is currently 16\u00b0 where I am in Texas right now! \ud83e\udd76In short, the thermostat works (most of the time) but it\u2019s kind of a pain to deal with.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705363200000}

My home has Alexa (not Google) everywhere so it was great to see a thermostat made by Amazon. I read the reviews and everyone was talking about how difficult it was to assemble, or they were getting getting error messages, or something else. I paused before buying it because of the reviews.

I just popped the old one out and popped the new one in and followed the prompts. Like everything else Amazon, Alexa walked me right through it. Super easy and works like a charm. No problems at all! Utilize it and do your own review. The only reason I did not give it five stars is it could be a little more colorful and graphic filled. To be Amazon technology, it looks kind of vanilla.

{"reviewTitle":"A good choice, but would benefit from advanced settings","reviewDescription":"Update 2023-05-05: I have been pleased with this thermostat, but after about a year of use, one of the segments of the left-hand digit is starting to fade.Bottom line: This is a good choice for a smart thermostat if you don't mind being limited to Alexa for voice control.The thermostat set-up UI only allows for simple configurations where you define heating-mode and cooling-mode target temperatures for three scenarios named \"Home\", \"Away\", and \"Sleep\". You can schedule these scenarios to kick-in at specific times on specific days of the week. That's probably enough flexibility for most people, but I think some people would appreciate the additional flexibility of scheduling any target temperature to kick in at any time on any day.I followed the installation instructions, which guided me through the process of connecting an unused control wire to the unused \"C\" terminal on the HVAC control board. I'm handy with electrical projects, so I had no problem following the instructions. But if your HVAC control board doesn't already have its \"C\" terminal routed to your current thermostat, or if you're not sure, you might need to spend some time with tech support during installation.I had a little trouble at the point where you're supposed to insert the control wires into the thermostat's terminal blocks. I initially failed to notice the terminals' horizontal insertion holes, so I kept trying to insert the wires into the front-facing holes, which are intended for a completely different purpose, and don't latch onto the wires to hold them in place. I eventually noticed the horizontal holes, pushed the control wires into them, confirmed that the wires latched successfully, and was able to proceed. The instructions should clearly state that the control wires must be inserted into the horizontal holes, and not the front-facing holes (a diagram would help).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1651276800000}

It's clean, sleek, modern and really easy to install.  If you've installed any thermostat in the past 10 years or more, you won't have any problem with this.  I replaced a wifi capable Honeywell unit that would not connect with my new mesh router.  I liked the appearance of this one much more anyhow.  My only issue - and it could just be something about my house - is that sometimes the thermostat takes 30 seconds or so to connect w my wifi ( using the Alexa app ).  Not always . . . just occasionally.  Seems odd given that I have a mesh router no more than 10 feet from the thermostat.  But when it is connected, I notice that this thermostat activates my HVAC system much faster than the Honeywell did.  It's instant.  With the Honeywell, it would always take about 5 seconds before the HVAC turned on.  I also find that the temperature displayed on this thermostat is more accurate than with my old Honeywell.

{"reviewTitle":"It works like a charm, for a fraction of the cost of a Ecobee","reviewDescription":"My cents (I hope Amazon reads that and also considers it...):\u2022 There are no external sensors, like other brands. I assume Amazon might be building them, to sell them by 15 bucks each. I need at least one. HOWEVER, if they can be flagged as EXTERNAL or INTERNAL sensors, I guess the external can help the thermostat to understand what to do. That silly +-3\/5 gray area between cold and hot can be mitigated. Since outside is COLD, just heat it up to 73. So the only gray zone would happen IF outside temp is casually the same temp as your goal. But 95% of the time, it will just work. My family likes it 73. Because of this \"OMG should I heat or cool\", it can drop to 71, or go up to 75. I would like to put it on AUTO and forget about its existence. But I cant.\u2022 I don't know what I did, but I guess I started with Celcius, then moved to F, it went crazy setting the upper and lower limits, in a way I simply cannot use the feature.\u2022 While my #1 doesnt get fixed, please add a \"when external temp from the city drops below my limit, switch to hot\" and vice versa.\u2022 It takes TOO LONG to open the app, find thermostat, to only them make a small change. Almost as quick as going downstairs. On Android, a widget would solve it.\u2022 The fan circulation is \"automagic\", but I would like to have it more frequent. There is no way. Or it is all in, all off, or \"automagic\".\u2022 Setup was pretty much easy for someone that had NO IDEA how to do it. Living here for 2 years, never had the change to do something like this. After some reading, I got it. I was a little cumbersome to understand the jumper on the bottom-right corner.\u2022 A nice energy dashboard on the web would rock.

The HVAC company installed a new thermostat with the system, a plain Honeywell thermostat.  It was the exact model that replaced the old thermostat with the old system.I was kind of spoiled with that thermostat because looking at the display I could see what exactly it was doing.  Heat or AC, and whether or not Heat On or Cool On.  As well as when the unit was pulling Aux\/Emergency Heat.I installed the new Amazon Thermostat last night and so far it is working as expected.  I had the unit installed in 20 minutes or so.  Wiring was super easy, and with it being a new setup I knew it was compatible (C Wire was used on the old\/new thermostat).Features I wish it had:1.  I woud like the LED  to activate when it's heating, fan is on etc.  As of now, I see the current temp on the display, nothing else.  If i press the mode button I can see that it is in Heat Mode with the fire symbol, but I wish when it was actually heating, the heat symbol would light up as well as the fan symbol being on.  When the unit cuts off, both of those LEDs cut off.2.  I haven't had to really go into Aux\/Emergency Heat yet, but I wish it would send me a notification in the Alexa app that it's currently in that type of heat mode.  As of now, theres now way to see it's using that with the LEDs (That i'm aware of).  I know it's going in to Aux when I make a huge desired temp increase, I believe the default for any thermostat is 3 degrees.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1638403200000}

It arrived nearly three months ago, but I was travelling and kept putting it off.  I am sorry I did.  The installation was fairly easy if you know how to use a screwdriver.  Getting the old one off was a bit tricky.  I didn't want to damage the wall.  There are videos out there on Youtube about removing Honeywell and other brands, I suggest you look them up if you have problems.The other thing to watch for is the need for a \"C Wire\".  This is not clearly explained.  It basically is an extra wire with low voltage that most newer homes will have with their HVAC setup.  If your home is 40+ years old, and your thermostat is as well, you might want to hire an electrician to determine if you have one or need to add one, as that is not simple.  It will also incur some added cost.I did not have any of these issues.  The install was spectacularly simple, just putting a few small wires in some tiny slots, and then \"presto\" the SET indicator turns on, and you can use your Alexa app on your phone or tablet for step-by-step instructions from there.We can now say \"Alexa, turn on the AC and set it to 73 degrees\", and that is exactly what happens. The thermostat will even flash a blue snowflake to let you know it heard you (it doesn't have a voice or speaker, but Alexa\/Echo takes care of that and confirms.My only concern is I may have created a monster.

Needless to say, I got the combo set just in case. This is our first smart thermostat and we like that its modern, sleek and fresh looking. I like that I can access it via the Alexa app whether we're home or away by push buttons. I've got to work on the Alexa integration more bc when asking to adjust the temperature, Alexa can't do it by voice. We've only had it up and going for about a week so we're still learning all it's functions. We already see a difference in how and when the air comes on and off and it's usually on 77\u00b0 now. Previously, we could never sit comfortably with it set on even 75\u00b0 with our old thermostat. We love that it was well within our budget. (Both thermostat and Honeywell c-wire adapter under $60) The only problems we ran into are 1.) it's very difficult to install for regular folks even after watching videos over and over. 2.) Customer service for this product sucks bc I don't think they really know how to either. It might be more simple to install on a newer house, but not ours. It was like asking me, a 49 year old woman, to install a car engine. We got our HVAC neighbor to install and all is well.

The best mode is 'hunches', where alexa will set your different modes based on if you are home, sleeping, awake, etc.  Once alexa detects you got up from sleeping for the day, it turns on the day routine.  This is particularly useful, especially as it saves electricity.CON:Alexa does not actually give you the ability to set your temp range for 'other' modes than normal daily.  For example when she senses you are going to sleep for the night, she turns on sleep mode, but you get no choice in what that is exactly.  For example I would like to be a tad cooler at night when I am sleeping, and I cannot set that function.For total manual controls, it is rather confusing what you are setting when tapping on the thermostat itself.  There is a variety of icons that pop up, but no indication on what they mean or function, so you are never sure what you just did.  Better to use the APP to control this unit.Lastly, this unit is dependent on your internet to function, without it you lose the hunches and alexa cannot control the thermostat at all, so you are left with whatever it was last set to, unless you take your chances poking the buttons on it...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713484800000}
{"reviewTitle":"An elegant look smart thermostat without breaking your bank","reviewDescription":"Replaced my old Honeywell thermostat with this smart device. My old thermostat was tested to be not accurate in sensing the current temperature and usually triggers start\/stop of my furnace or AC at +\/- 2 degrees of current room temperature. This amazon smart thermostat may not be as smart as others on the market (such as Nest, EcoBee, etc) but it does the job well, easy to control from your phone thru Alexa app and it does not break your bank with a reasonable price. Btw, my local utility PG&E company is giving me a rebate making this purchase completely free.My house does not have a 5-wire cable connection from my furnace\/AC to the control location in the hallway. Instead of ripping it out to put in a new 5-wire cable and all the extra work of patching up the walls etc, I decided to install it with the G (green) wire to be the C (central) wire and short connect the G (green) and Y (yellow) terminals at the control board of the furnace system. You may search for this method on Youtube as there are lots of video clips showing this method. CAUTION: Note that you must be comfortable working with the wires at the furnace system control board, and make sure that you switch off electricity at your main control circuit panel to avoid damaging your furnace\/AC system components. If you are not comfortable, you can hire a professional to do the job for you.Installing the thermostat over the existing location is quite easy and straightforward. The package provides everything (a face plate, the screws and anchors, mounting bracket). You will need a drill to properly put in the anchors for the whole assembly. The wire connection to the assembly is made easy using the connectors spring clips (instead of the old screw methods of connection). The amazon web link for the installation will walk you thru all the steps, connecting it to your home wifi, and testing it out the furnace\/AC system once done.Connecting the thermostat to the Alexa app on your phone is simple as it is quickly detected once your thermostat is connected with your home wifi. But navigating the Alexa phone app can be quite intimidating since there are so much more option and setting to set up. This is due to Alexa being a hub to allow control of many other smart devices that may exist at your home, such as smart outlets, smart bulbs, etc.I only give 4 stars to this device since it only allows 3 setting profiles: Away, Home and Sleep. For most usage, 3 would be satisfactory but I need more than 3. As this is a software function, it can certainly accommodate your individual creation of your own profile with your chosen name and integrate them all into the control of your furnace\/AC system. Other than this little inconvenience, I am happy with the product and would highly recommend it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"30 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667088000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Workarounds for manual temperature hold bugs","reviewDescription":"IMO this is a great result for a Version 1 product. I don't have much to complain about except for the manual hold temperature\/override logic is currently broken - it lets you manually set a temperature that overrides the scheduled temp but it never returns back to the scheduled temperature after the hold is over.For example, if you've enabled the scheduling function in the Alexa app (Devices -> Thermostats -> <Your Thermostat Name> -> Gear Icon -> Thermostat Schedule -> Use thermostat schedule) but then manually set a temperature, the temperature is supposed to revert back when the next scheduled event occurs but it never does - instead it permanently holds the temperature at the manual value.For example, if it's 7:05 PM and you say \"Alexa, set thermostat to 78\" and you have a scheduled event for 7:30 PM that sets the temperature to 75, it will change the temp to 78 as expected but then hold it there forever and never go to 75. The thermostat is supposed to switch to 75 at 7:30PM. The expected behavior is described in the \"Tip\" section here: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=GTWEDLQS8MQ8F3M7&ref_=hp_GMCQK6C7JTCG6NCA_c_Adjust-Your-Home-Temperature-MTo work around this issue and force Alexa to return back to schedule, say \"Alexa, resume thermostat schedule\"This bug also affects the manual override with duration command. For example, you can say \"Alexa, set thermostat to 75 for 30 minutes\", to which Alexa responds \"Holding the temperature to 75 for 30 minutes\". The thermostat immediately changes to 75 as expected but never reverts back to the original\/scheduled temp thirty minutes later. To get this working I had to create a routine. Here are the instructions; these assume your thermostat is named \"thermostat\" (default name):1. Open Alex app, go to More -> Routines -> + to add a new routine2. Set routine name to something like \"Hold at 75 for 30 minutes\"3. Tap \"When this happens\" then \"Voice\" then enter \"hold at seventy five for thirty minutes\"4. Tap \"Add action\" -> Smart Home -> All Devices -> Thermostat -> Set Temperature -> Set to 755. Tap \"Add action\" -> scroll down to \"Wait\" -> Set to 00 : 30 : 006. Tap \"Add action\" -> Custom -> Enter \"resume thermostat schedule\"7. For \"From\" tap \"Choose Device\" to specify which device hears Alexa's responses to the above actions. Note that if you specify your smart phone (aka \"this device\") and the Alexa app is not the active (foreground) app for the entire duration of this routine (30 minutes in this case), then the routine will stop running as soon as you switch away from the Alexa app. For this reason I specify a different online Amazon device to hear the responses, like my Amazon Fire Stick. That way the routine will run to completion - you just wont hear the responses unless you have that other device in earshot.8. Tap save. Wait about 30 seconds for AWS to properly save the routine in the cloud.To run the routine, say \"Alexa, hold at seventy five for thirty minutes\". Or, if you prefer to not have to vocalize the command, go to More -> Routines and tap the blue play button to the right of the routine you just created","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1641168000000}

I figured this would be the perfect time to set up the newly awaited Amazon Stat.  Mind you I been using all the latest Stats with all the same terminal wiring for years now and they all have worked perfectly fine once its adjust the room calibration your pretty much ready to go.  I use Ecobee currently and have no issues with them at all. But recently being bought out by Generac Corp... I dont know what the future is going to be for them. Ecobee stated on there site they just couldnt compete with Nest and now the Newly cheaper option the Amazon Smart Thermostat pretty much cutting down all previous companies pricing.I couldnt get this POS working correctly at all, calling Amazon was a waste for tech support... finally I was told I had to call Resideo Honeywell for Support since they manufactured the unit.  After being on hold for more than 3 hours and still freezing in my home, I couldnt get through tried some more trouble shooting myself,, the Stat would not get to the appropiate Setpoint and wasnt calling for Heat at all.  Maybe this one unit I received was faulty im giving it the benefit of the doubt.  Put back on my old reliable Ecobee everything came up and within 1 hr my home is now warm and comfortable.I will update a posting once I can reach out to Resideo Tech Support, ,,to find out why the unit is not heating when the terminal W is connected. As a first impression of this first model im really not impressed.Update 11\/7\/21Finally today got a chance to talk to Honeywell Resideo Home,, and they got the Stat working I find that it is very stupid that the system doesnt recognize the RC so I have to plug it into the R Terminal and then flip the jumpers up to Wire 1,, blocking off the RC Terminal completely to trick the system to power on... finally worked but very very cumbersome.  Once I set up my smart home completely i usually dont go back into the Alexa App for much except to change a routine or a skill.... The app is very very slow to nagivate and for me to have to go into this to change the Stat... I dont know.. as of now the Alexa commands are not working properly.11\/7\/21 Evening time..

{"reviewTitle":"Sharing is Caring and This Need More Caring","reviewDescription":"I installed several of these at my church to help control our multiple HVAC units. As such, my experience is not a typical home with 1-2 thermostats but rather wanting to control many units in unison. Also, I use Ring and was hoping that this product was designed with similar user experience in mind. Sadly, it was not.The initial install was rather quick and easy once I got the C-wire installed. However the issue is control and that where I found the limitations of this device. The manual controls are very limited which is actually better as we want people to just adjust the temperature and not get confused with all the settings something like an Ecobee or Nest would have. Smart presence control would not work in an organization environment as only a handful would have the app.First, there is no account sharing for different people to have access. Even if I were using this in a residential setting, it would be nice to share control of this device with other Amazon\/Alexa accounts. For example, I have housemates that I don't share my Amazon account with but would be willing to share common area smart home devices. Coming from Ring, I was surprised that Alexa devices lack a similar sharing feature. Google Home has the ability to share devices with others in the household.Second, each thermostat has individual temperature preset and schedules. Thus the more devices, the more tedious it is to control. There is no option to group them to use the same schedule and\/or settings. I understand in a home setting that different thermostats are usually different zones \/ floors. For a church or office use, grouping would be much more preferred as multiple HVAC units be for one large room. There might be some need for groups like office vs. chapel space. Furthermore, it is possible a large home may have multiple units for a single floor so some grouping would still be a benefit in residential setups.Third, I would like timer functions. For example, I've had Hive and basic Nest thermostat and each had someway to heat\/cool\/fan for a set duration. This is very useful for users with well insulated homes who want to run it a limited time. There is a fan schedule in the app for auto\/on\/intermittent but it's nice to set the fan to run for a few hours or for temperature. I think it possible to make a routine but that feels like tedious for something simple.Fourth, it seems in the past that Alexa had a feature called Guard that allowed for security system integration beyond normal skills. Per a Q&A from another user, it would have allowed Ring Alarm status to update Alexa Guard status which also updates the thermostats. So when someone disarms the system, the thermostats go into Home temperature preset and if they arm it goes into Away. This would have been especially useful in an organization like a church. However, it is now gone and Alexa has a replacement paid feature called Emergency Assist that does not seem to have security system integration.Fifth, Alexa devices including this thermostat can be linked to the Ring app. However, the controls are very limited - just mode (auto\/heat\/cool\/off) and temperature. Furthermore, it cannot be shared to other Ring users as native Ring devices can be.Sixth, the actions that Alexa can do with thermostat are limited to set target temperature, adjust brightness, and control fan. It does not have selecting modes or temperature preset as an action. I found that Alexa voice\/custom commands can control modes but not temperature preset. Combining with Ring skill to trigger arm\/disarm, I could partially replicate the missing Alexa Guard control of thermostats. However, it takes time to setup and requires an Echo device as Alexa custom commands seem to require it to speak a confirmation. Also, it can only target a temperature and not a temperature preset range.I plan to try out an Echo Show device to see how the smart home integration is and will update when I get a better feel.Final score is:-1 for lack of sharing access \/ user accounts.-0.5 for lack of grouping \/ zones.-0.5 for lack of timer functions.-1 for loss of prior existing integration with security setting that needs a workaround.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702857600000}

{"reviewTitle":"not as smart as my old thermostat.","reviewDescription":"We bought this to replace a previous thermostat that we had had for 15 years made by Honeywell. That particular thermostat could be programmed and then basically we just left it alone. If we had to turn the heat up or down we would go over and push up or down buttons. The thermostat would automatically go back to its regular schedule at the correct time.We bought an echo dot and since our other thermostat was older, and sometimes the buttons were getting harder to push, we decided to replace it with this  smart thermostat. I thought it would be great to just be able to tell Alexa to turn the heat up or down.You have the option of having the thermostat go to a certain temperature at the time you request or preheat ahead of time. Our old thermostat learned how long our furnace took to get to a temperature and came on according to that. I assume this one would do the same if I set to preheat. So far it comes on an hour before every day so it reaches the temperature way sooner than the time I want it to. We have two basic temperatures 68 during the day and 65 at night.For the past two days we\u2019ve looked over and it says that it\u2019s 70\u00b0 on the thermostat. We look in the app it says that it is set to 68 and the temperature is 70.  There\u2019s no reason for this other than the furnace is continuing to run after it reaches the set temperature.Between turning on the furnace too soon to heat up to the temperature we want and then heating over the temperature it is supposed to, I am very annoyed. I work really hard to keep my utility bills under control  and I think I may have to replace this thermostat with another.Today I set the temperature 2\u00b0 lower to see if it would stop at 68 where I want it.

{"reviewTitle":"I have a 'hunch' Alexa has no idea what she is doing","reviewDescription":"Installation was a simple breeze on this device.  Alexa immediately found her and gave me access to all the settings through the Alexa App.  Initially I decided to use Alexa 'Hunches' to control the thermostat automatically based on whatever she thinks about us.  The 3 choices to choose from are Home, Away, Sleep.  That's it.  You can select a temp for each of the three and then let Alexa try to decide which of the 3 she believes is happening.  After about a week of complete non-sense hunches being made, I gave up on that feature.  She was consistently saying we were going to sleep at 11:46pm each night when we had been going to bed around 9:30 each night.  Clearly her hunches are made up since her hunch each night was exactly the same time no matter how many times I told her in the app that her hunches were wrong.  We have MANY Dots around the house so if she is listening, she is failing.  I found myself manually asking Alexa to lower my temp to my sleep temp from bed via voice each night.  Then I went on vacation and enabled the feature that could track your phone to make decisions about if you should be in Away mode.  Each day I would log into my Alexa app and found she was just going ahead and heating the whole house even though I kept having to override her back.  To solve this problem I just lowered the max heating temp to my away temp and that allowed her to stop making dumb decisions.Once I returned home from vacation I ditched the Hunch feature and went to a schedule feature.  These features are mutually exclusive (makes some sense).  The daily schedule feature only allows 4 setpoints and times throughout the day and each day can have their own up to 4 temps\/times.  4 is not enough for me and my 10 year old dumb Honeywell thermostat allows up to 8 per day even.  (I like to heat the house when my wife is getting ready for work and then again when I am getting ready for work 1.5 hours later in addition to having the house heat up when either of our schedules are having us come home and then drop back down for bedtime).The schedule feature was equally broken.  I consistently found the thermostat heating to a temp that was no where in the schedule.  I had it set to start heating at 5:15am for my wife and it never did it without her hitting the up button.  I played with the 'preheat' toggle and that didn't appear to do anything.  Each night it was supposed to drop to the sleep temp at 9:30 but I found it cooking us away at 10:30 many times.Couldn't trust this device to do a single thing it was intended to do aside from wifi\/voice control and remote administration.  Definitely not worth the money since it couldn't seem to tell time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1639699200000}
{"reviewTitle":"I really wanted to love this one - but couldn't!","reviewDescription":"A thermostat is a pretty simple device. It closes or opens a few contacts based on environmental conditions, or intervention from the user. The 'Smarts' in a thermostat is how, or rather 'when' it opens or closes those contacts. It is truly 'digital' as in On or Off!The problem with the Alexa Thermostat is that the hysteresis (the temperature swing) is way too tight. It wants to keep temperature at let's say 70 (good). But if temperature just drops briefly, furnace turns on, raises the temperate back and turns it off, only to turn on after a short while again. As the 'swing' is too narrow, it results in short cycling and in my case turning the furnace on 5-7 times PER HOUR where furnace with old thermostat only ran TWICE A DAY (once in the morning and once in the evening).Short cycling is BAD (and pretty annoying), especially if there's an AC and compressor involved. But it can easily be corrected by having a larger hysteresis (or one that is adjustable). A new firmware load for the Alexa thermostat could have easily addressed this together with a slight modification in the app.An example for better operation with a wider temp swing: Set temp for 70, furnace heats up until 71 and shuts off, but does not come on until temp is back down to 69, providing for longer run times and also much longer standby times. Another way of doing this is to set a timer so furnace cannot come back on until X minutes have elapsed since last run.In my case, the thermostat was up for about two months before being returned. The short cycling was just horrible. I 'managed it by running furnace fully manually by setting temp way up, and when I felt it was OK inside, turning it off by setting it way down to a low value and hence fully controlling furnace on\/off.My old non-smart - but programmable - Lux thermostat from 2002 did a better job (as it had an adjustable hysteresis) in keeping house comfy and utility bills low.  Of course w\/o the cool benefit of being able to read and adjust settings from afar.This year, the trial will be with a Nest 3rd generation I got from my utility for $30. Still fear that hysteresis might be too tight on that one as well. Time will tell...BTW, the Alexa had run time reports, but they were a bit funky to get to. I have recorded run times per month since 2002 and know pretty much exactly how much or little furnace should be running during 'normal' weather. Been able to reduce gas consumption over time with about 50% by managing this 'run time' better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666137600000}

I had previously set up a very specific schedule and everything was working fine... until NOW!  I've looked at forums online and found out a LOT of people of having this same issue.  The problem does not seem to be with the thermostat itself, but with the Alexa app... which is required to control anything but the most basic of features.  I can no longer adjust the schedule... it is there, but whenever I try to access the schedule to modify it the Alexa app crashes.  Consistently!  I currently have NO way to adjust the schedule.  I've tried rebooting phone, clearing app cache, restarting thermostat... NOTHING has helped.  Perhaps there is an issue with the Alexa app and Android 11.  My phone updated to Android 11 over the summer and I hadn't used the app for heating since last spring.  Amazon customer service has yet to be any help, simply directing me to a 3rd party company that deals with installation issues.  They tell me they have nothing to do with the app.  Apparently I'm going to have to buy another thermostat (and hopefully one with better customer service.)Update:  After posting my review I had a phone call from an Amazon Customer Service rep.  He was very nice nice and helpful to the point he could be.  He took down information that he was going to share with the tech team and we went over all the things I had tried to resolve the issue.  Unfortunately, nothing has been resolved and I don't have a solution from Amazon and now not only can I not CHANGE my heating schedule, but the heating schedule itself does not work at all.  I can only adjust the temperature through the alexa app or with an Alexa voice-enabled device (which both DO work.)  I have decided to move on and try another smart thermostat. (My power company was offering instant rebates on certain models and I have ordered a Nest thermostat.  Hopefully I will have better luck with that.)

I had an outdated Honeywell thermostat\u2014 my furnace runs with a heat pump. Was excited about the price on this compared to others and the fact that I could use the Amazon app and our devices to control it.Installed may 2022 and for the most part it seemed to work over the summer. I live in CO and it did seem like my AC had a hard time keeping up. We had some hot weeks so I chalked it up that that. It\u2019s now Nov 2022 and I have had my heat running for the last month or so.I use the schedule option and it it set to auto. I started to notice that after I began running heat it was making a audible double click, lose power and attempt to start the cycle again. Sometimes it would do this over ten times until I finally decided to remove the wall unit and reset it. I thought doing a hard reset .. deleting it from my app would fix it. It\u2019s a temporary fix.I finally called into Amazon tech support bc I was having to reset all the time. It would lose connectivity and wasn\u2019t operating as it should\u2019ve been. Amazon transfers you to a third party who verifies the wiring. My decide had passed the return date so Amazon didn\u2019t want to allow a return or exchange.With some haggling and at the advice of the third party\u2014 they sent me an exchange. Worked again fine for about two weeks until it did the double click, turned off, tried to cycle again tonight. It did this none stop for about 10 minutes.

I feel like an idiot for buying it and you will too. I spent over an hour and a half trying to find out how to adjust the hysteresis (or dead band) of the thermostat to stop it from cycling so quickly. It seems to be set for less than a single degree, Which means it will turn on your heat and immediately think that's enough heat and shut it off within a minute or two. This causes your heat system to turn on and heat up far more frequently than it should... Wearing your heating system immensely. I have used several other thermostats and have other zones in this house none of which have this problem. Amazon support staff are useless of course, because they are foreign and because they don't actually manufacture the product. I spoke to six different people and no one could give me an answer. They told me to call a company called residio, which apparently is the actual company making these thermostats. The chat person ended the chat immediately causing the number to disappear, So I had to spend another half hour to re-explain myself for seventh time in order to get the number again. Once I called the number Honeywell told me that they do not support this thermostat and I have to call Amazon.

Installation was easy and everything seemed great until I started trying to set up schedules for each of my thermostats. Each time I would set a schedule on one thermostat in the Alexa app, that schedule would get applied to every thermostat. I spent over an hour discussing with support and was transferred to seven different Amazon product support representatives before one confirmed that this was the intended behavior and there were no plans to introduce the ability to have a unique schedule on each thermostat. If you have an upstairs and downstairs thermostat for example, they must run on the exact same schedule for home, away, and sleep. This doesn't really make sense in many cases, and makes these pretty much useless for me.UPDATE 11\/18\/2021Amazon has sent out a mass email stating that the scheduling issue I described above is a \"temporary app display issue\" that will be fixed in a future release of the Alexa app. Given that this directly contradicts the information a device support representative told me, and the fact that the support process was so painful, I am leaving my review at 1 star, but maybe at some point you will be able to set and see separate schedules per thermostat.

Anything more complex than that and amazon says we don't support that.  Unfortunately I waited too long from purchase to install to figure out how worthless these are.

Around the 3 week mark I noticed it was cutting itself off on its own and I'd wake up in the middle of the night sweating cause the ac was completely off. Then it stopped taking voice commands. When I try to ask it to change the temperature it just tells me \"Thermostat doesn't support that.\" And now, the schedule is broken. I can't set a schedule cause it just is forever loading with a spinning circle. I have restarted it. I have done a partial reset. And I have done a full factory reset. Nothing helps. I could still operate it from the app, but last night even though I had it set to 74, when I woke up it was set to 85. So I don't know what's wrong with it. It's past the return window but I'll be contacting Amazon for my money back because this is unacceptable.For years I've wished I could change the thermostat from bed at night. I have an inflammatory condition that causes night sweats so sometimes I HAVE to get up and turn the AC down. Then I wind up not being able to get back to sleep and it's a whole mess. I've looked into different smart thermostats and while cool, I hadn't felt like spending that kinda money on it. But for a $45 prime day deal (including tax), I couldn't resist. And it's perfect. It's simple but it does all I need it to do -- set a temperature schedule and allow me to change it from bed. And the install was a breeze. It took me less than 30 minutes and part of that was my ADHD ass tracking down the tools I needed lol. But I have installed a thermostat before. So I knew what I was getting into. The Alexa guide was nice though to make sure I got everything right.

It talks about running a new C wire from your furnace\/boiler blah blah, it is a waste of time and too much effort.  All you need to do is bring in a new C wire, which is simply a 24V power supply.  You can do this easily with a 24V power supply plugged into the nearest outlet.  There is a C wire kit available separately (many actually) right on Amazon, like this one: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07MT5VWQN.  All you have to do is plug it in and run the wire to the thermostat.  Don't get the C wire kit that comes with the thermostat.  It's a little tricky getting the 24V (Cwire) behind the plate and into the thermostat, but it's not rocket science, you can just tuck it behind the plate.  I used a razor to cut a little groove in the drywall so the wire doesn't get pinched.I came back to change it to two stars because after a couple days of using this I found it does not show the red heat (flame) indicator when it's heating.  this is a big problem.  I'm sure it could be fixed with a firmware upgrade but it is insane that they could send these out without realizing a problem as big as this.  every thermostat shows you when it's heating or not.  This has a red flame light on the front that is designed to do that.  It just doesn't work.  When you press the button the light comes on for a few seconds and then it turns off, even though it is in heat mode.  You can check the app, or ask Alexa, and you'll find it is actually heating, but the red light on the front of the unit is not on as it should be.  this is ridiculous.

A word of advice - use a better screwdriver because the included tool isn\u2019t great. You\u2019ll also need a drill with a 3\/8\u201d bit to assist with the wall anchors.Some of the reviews I read mentioned that people had trouble with the app recognizing two thermostats, that was not the case at all with me. It was extremely easy to differentiate in the app and just as easy to control each one.Another review that made me worry about buying this thermostat was that you couldn\u2019t simply tell your Alexa device to adjust the temperature, and that you had to open the app to make adjustments. This problem must have been resolved or a solitary issue because ours works just fine with voice commands.This thermostat does not offer a sensor option to monitor a particular room or area, so if you\u2019re looking for that, you may need to look at other options.As far as smart settings, you have two options. Alexa can learn your routines and track your phone\u2019s location to adjust the temperatures accordingly when you\u2019re home or away. This works best when everyone in the household connects to the app and consents to tracking. It will even adjust the temperature to your desired settings when you\u2019re within a certain range of your home.If this option isn\u2019t for you, it will allow you to set schedules and desired temperature ranges throughout each day of the week. But you\u2019re still able to log into the app and make adjustments when needed.My last tidbit of information is regarding the second unit that I bought, it was a \u201crenewed unit\u201d and priced at $40.

I'm coming from a Nest thermostat that worked fine, but since i use a lot of echo devices I wanted to stay 100% amazon.

I get it all hooked up, it says SEt, I go into the app it connects to wifi, i think good, good.  Then it has me pick my heating\/cooling sources and it says its finishing setup, and just craps out.  Hangs at that point for like 2-3 minutes and comes back with something went wrong, Attemp retry or reach out to customer service...tried it with 2 diffrent thermostats on an android phone and fire tablet, all the same....getting an actual error message would be useful...something went wrong....so discriptive.11\/13\/21 Update.  Tech support has reached out to me several times to try a few things, still no luck,  It gets registered in the alexa app, tech support can see it get added, they still dont know why it fails at the final configuation step, tech rep said he will reach out again monday.01\/22\/22 Update.  So tech support called me probably 15-20 times over the past 2 months.  I've never bought a product from a company that didnt work as it should where they were so persistant in helping me, thumbs up for that.  In the end it would seem they pushed an update that finally made both of mine work.  After that it was a 2 minute install and setup, very easy.  I'm going to update my review to the full 5 stars from 2....it wasn't a great start, but the constant communication from amazon was a welcome change from what most customers experience elsewhere.  I'm also confident that if this wasnt a launch product in a new category it would have worked right away.  Scheduling is easy, having 2 thermostats in the same house works fine, and it works flawlessly with echo devices.  I've used Nest in the past, but I use amazon echo\/ring devices for everything else so having everything seamless in one app is what I was after.

{"reviewTitle":"Room for improvement - UPDATE 1\/11\/22","reviewDescription":"UPDATED REVIEWI have switched back to my old Ecobee smart thermostat. The Amazon thermostat is short cycling my HVAC system which could eventually cause excessive damage and higher energy bills; I don\u2019t even have a complicated system.So I have to warn everyone that you cannot adjust the swing temp \/ set point of this thermostat. It will constantly cycle on\/off as it tries to maintain your temperature; it won\u2019t let your furnace \u201crest\u201d. For example, in the morning the set temperature is 70, and due to our weather here in MI it can take up to an hour to reach that temp in the morning. As soon as the temperature is met, the thermostat will turn off the furnace, then turn it back on SECONDS later after it had been running for an hour. YOU WILL WEAR OUT YOUR HVAC SYSTEM with this behavior. The Ecobee in the same scenario will wait until the ambient temperature is 69.5 before it calls the heat again, and even on Ecobee the user can adjust the swing temp if they choose to do so.Also, as many have mentioned, the \u201cHunches\u201d feature is hit and miss and not reliable enough to use. It won\u2019t even recognize that I\u2019ve left my house even though I have geofencing turned on. A ticket was placed into Amazon weeks ago for this issue and I\u2019ve never heard back.I\u2019ve waited for Amazon or Honeywell to address these issues but so far there have been no credible software updates since this thing launched. How disappointing.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is a version 1.0 product and it shows. Hopefully Amazon will actively listen to customer feedback and make the following improvements:1. Allow Hunches and Schedules to work together2. Allow user to modify the temperature \u201cswing\u201d setting3. When using hunches, Alexa has only noticed I was \u201cAway\u201d once during my usage and should work accurately EVERY TIME being that I have geofencing turned on (this is something every other smart thermostat gets right out of the box).4. Illuminate the appropriate system icon (flame, snowflake etc) when system is running.5. Allow Alexa to state the humidity % if asked6. Let us set routines based on said humidity levelIf Amazon is quick to make these (software) changes; this device could definitely become best in class.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1639440000000}

Liked the way it looks and operates, but then I noticed how my AC was running.  Good thermostats have a swing temperature setting of at least 1 degree meaning if you set your AC to 72, the AC will operate until it reaches 72 then turn off but won't turn on again until it hits 73.  This helps reduce wear on your system and also reduces continuous run time thus saving energy.  This thermostat must have its swing temperature set to around a half degree because it turns on when the temperature setting is still at the same position.It's very hot right now where I'm at and the AC would run for approximately 10 minutes then shut off.  Within about 5 minutes it would turn on again and it was starting and stopping continuously!  This is very hard your HVAC system and your energy bills.  It's not supposed to work like this and you cannot change this setting like other thermostats. I looked in the Alexa settings app and on the unit itself.  People have complained about this but the manufacturer and Amazon haven't address it.

I can't understand why Amazon is limiting me to only 4 \"mode\" changes per day and that these MUST be done in the schedule section of the thermostat. I base my life around routines. Routines that even Honeywell's cheap schedule based thermostats allow you to set. Those modes by the way expect you to be in automatic mode.Now here's the hilarious part. You could setup Google Home on a schedule to say \"Alexa, set Thermostat to heat.\" then \"Alexa, set thermostat to 72.\" That's how you must setup custom routines. The company the brought us routines to setup our lives now won't let you setup a routine.Why must Amazon limit my ability to set the thermostat up how I want?Why must I be limited to 4 max mode changes?Why must these mode changes be exclusively in automatic mode?Why can't a smart thermostat allow me to set my own schedule?Just get a Emerson Sensi ST55. It allows you all the freedom you'd expect from a smart thermostat. It does everything this thermostat does and more for $80.

It appears the developers of the thermostat app or ALEXA  app are not smart enough to distinguish between two homes 100 miles apart when using hunches.  Note, the ALEXA app does permit the designation of multiple residences.  The developers said that the ring devices at the two homes have to be on separate Ring accounts.  Okay, so I try to do that.  However, when I try to link my second RING account to my AMAZON account, I get an error message, that account already has a RING account associated with it.

{"reviewTitle":"UPDATE: STUPID > Smart Thermostat","reviewDescription":"UPDATE (after 1+ months): I fought this thermostat for a long time. (Cf. comments below.) I could not find any way to access support. I finally posted the critical one-star review below. 2 days later I received a call from Amazon who connected me to Resideo which is behind the thermostat. The support person walked me through a complete reset. Now it works! Does what I want it to do. Scheduling and adjusting on the Alexa Android app is easy. I think I had properly set it up the first time, but going through the complete reset somehow made things work. I recommend it now, especially if you can get a rebate from your energy supplier.INITIAL POST: This thermostat has potential, but it is too stupid.It is in the 30s outside. I set the thermostat to AUTO with a temperature between 67-72. It heats up the house to 72... and then it turns on the air conditioning to cool it down. That's no way to save money.So, I set it simply to HEAT and ... it heats up to 77 and would just keep on going if I didn't turn it off.Getting technical support has been impossible for me to find.I joined the Amazon digital services forum and posted my question there. Apparently others have had the same issue, but no one from Amazon has responded, and no one from the community has been able to offer an answer.

Preordered after first hearing about them and was excited for the features, direct connectivity with the Alexa environment and of course, the price.Simple to install (disclaimer- I am an engineer and know HVAC systems) and I only had to make one small wiring change to my existing HVAC system. Hooking up a thermostat is not always as simple as moving some wires - you actually need to understand what those wires do and your original system might not be quite \"standard.\" In my case, there were some \"extra\" wires hooked up to the old Honeywell smart thermostats that were in the house when we bought it.Amazon and Honeywell have made a valiant attempt to consumer-proof this item but it is still a bit tricky to get working. Multiple configurations and settings have been integrated in to the \"which wires are connected\" wizard in the app and Amazon could do a little better on offering compatibility information before the purchase. I will say this, I have had absolutely dismal experience with Honeywell smart devices and am thankful that the Amazon layer is in place between them and Hw. That said, it's a new item and Amazon is assuredly still learning and developing their support for it.I am a bit frustrated with manual control on the device. It's a bit confusing what you might be changing when you press the circle and then start pressing the up\/down arrows. I keep turning the fan mode from \"auto\" to \"on\" at the device. Easy to set in the Alexa app but not intuitive on the wall. Voice commands work OK. We just use \"set the temperature\" and as long as we remember to say \"upstairs or downstairs thermostat\" is all works fine. In auto-changeover mode (heat and cool set to automatically switch) the voice command is a bit tricky and Alexa likes to argue with us about it. I generally just use the app though. We're not much for \"schedules\" with our HVAC and generally run the systems manually in this new \"we're-always-at-home world.\"Definitely like the units. Best price-point and simple design win. And it works. None of the complex front panel features of the $300 competitors do anything for me and in this world of integrated design, paying more than $100 for a thermostat (literally $15 of parts!!!) is just dumb.

The old thermostat required me to manually switch from heat to cool and was a PITA to program. Also, the LCD screen was hard to read.This new Amazon thermostat is sleek, the faceplate is easy to read, and installation and programming was a snap. We like that you can set the fan to circulate, which we couldn't do with the old thermostat. The Alexa app walks you through the installation, and setup was accomplished in very easy to understand steps. A third-grader could do it. Easy-peezy.I first turned off the power to the furnace. After I detached and removed the old thermostat, I pulled the wire harness out of the wall, including the unused blue \"C-wire\". At my furnace, I found the other end of the unused blue \"C-wire\". I stripped and attached this end to the \"C\" screw terminal in my furnace. BTW, there was already a white wire attached to the \"C\" screw terminal in the furnace, but my research suggested that was normal, it was just a 24V supply terminal that could support multiple lines. So I attached the blue wire to the same \"C\" screw terminal as the white wire was attached to. I then replaced the furnace panel. I returned upstairs to the thermostat and stripped and attached the other end of the blue wire to the thermostat receptacle, along with the other orange, green, red, etc. wires that were already there. Plugged in the thermostat, turned the power back on, and viola! the thermostat booted up. After accessing the programming functions in Alexa, we were good to go. We've been very happy with this thermostat.BTW, don't listen to the negative reviews. These are either coming from trolls or from people who don't know how to use a screwdriver.

This does NOT work to get the device working, as the initial setup will be saved locally to the thermostat. I tried to install it with the existing wiring, and that caused some issues.

It allows you to name them but that is all. Alexa only controls one of them at a time either upstairs or downstairs for example. The other will run on the set schedule.Another note, disable Alexa hunches if you have a heat pump and aux coil. It's become apparent that Alexa doesn't understand that aux heat is less efficient and she will not smooth temperature transitions. As a result if your sleep and awake low points are greater than 3 degrees apart she will turn on the auxiliary heat to waste your money.The app will be getting a update to address some of this.I wish they had a standalone app for the thermostats that was lighter and easier to get to the settings, I favorited them but it's still a bit clunky to click so many times for a thermostat then back out and get to the other.Device ui is basic but works, it's intended to be paied with the app. It might be nice if they had a fancier model with a actual touchscreen so you don't need the app to set schedules and stuff.The auxiliary heat needs a option to turn it off unless the heat pump is not keeping up or going slower than expected. The constant of 3 degrees is just not friendly to smart thermostats and goes against the entire point of themIt would also be nice if they had room temperature sensors like the competitors.Update to include photos of how much the aux heat issues are costing me.

I would've preferred paper instructions but that's just my preference. Uninstalled my dumb thermostat and got this one installed no problem.I had three main issues with the thermostat itself. I used it for about 4 days.First, it struggled to figure out the internal temperature of the house. It would be running and running and I'd think to myself \"It feels warmer than the display is saying.\" I would turn it off, then about a minute later the temp on the display would bump up a few degrees.Second, the fan was on much longer than it had ever been before. I double checked the settings about a dozen times and confirmed the fan was set to AUTO. It would stay on so long after a heating or cooling cycle ended that it would run into the next cycle, and by the time that next heating cycle started then it was just circulating cool air, making the temp in the house feel cooler when I wanted it warm.Third, and most importantly, is the thermostat never once engaged my heat pump. To heat the house, it only ever used my auxiliary heat, which is a big, expensive problem. I double and triple checked my wiring and settings but everything seemed to be correct.After the fourth day, I uninstalled this thermostat and reinstalled my dumb one. Immediately, all my issues were cleared up. The internal temp was being read correctly, the fan was shutting off shortly after a heating\/cooling cycle ended, and my heat pump was being used for every heat cycle. I've already returned the thermostat and got my money back.

Setting a schedule is easy to do, but if I wanted to do that I could have spent a lot less.We recent sold and built a new house. I needed new thermostats and we really liked the simple look of the Amazon thermostat, unfortunately that\u2019s the only thing we like about it.The integration with Alexa also falls short. Sure you can tell her what to at the thermostat to, but that\u2019s about it. Was hoping it would display the temperature and other information on my echo show in kind of a smarthome mode, but nope.When you select climate on Alexa half the time you have to wait for close to a minute before the thermostat responds.Anyway, I\u2019ve installed several Ecobees and Nests for friends, used a Nest for years myself and they all work better.Oh yeah, almost forgot, one of the thermostats has already failed. Luckily it was still new enough that Amazon is sending a new one. I guess the Amazon customer service would be another positive for this thermostat, but I would still skip it for a Nest or Ecobee if I were to buy new ones.Came back after having the thermostat for a while now and deducted another star. The Alexa system is just way too slow and clunky. You have to restart the app repeatedly to get it to refresh.

Switching from \u201cAuto\u201d to \u201cHeat Only\u201d or pulling the thermostat off of the wall to restart it have been the fixes. I expected much better software from an Amazon product.Additionally frustrating, the \u201cAuto\u201d mode has a fixed FIVE DEGREE temperature deadband, e.g., if I tell Alexa to set it to 71, it will only actually keep the temp between 68 and 73 .. which means it doesn\u2019t start Heating until the temp is 67 or start Cooling until the temp is 74 \u2026 that\u2019s 7 whole degrees of hysteresis on the temperature control of our bedroom. No, not okay.There seems to be no way to change this setting to tighten the tolerance. If you set it manually instead of telling Alexa, you can bring the Heat\/Cool to within 4 degrees, so then your potential temperature swing is 6 degrees instead of 7 (yay?). The only reason I can imagine they fixed this is to force or meet some Green Energy spec, otherwise this wide of a band in a household setting makes no absolutely no sense. I\u2019ll decide if I want to blow my money on my Utility bill, Amazon, that\u2019s not your decision to make for me.I\u2019d give it 1 star, but it did integrate with Alexa very well otherwise and was simple to set up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707609600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Really disappointed, does not meet my needs","reviewDescription":"First of all I will start by saying I should have done more research before purchasing, because if I had known the issues I\u2019m about to detail then I wouldn\u2019t have bought it.The only good thing about it is installation was a literal breeze. I\u2019ve included a picture of my existing thermostat, I believe it\u2019s the Honeywell T6 Pro. When installing the Amazon smart thermostat, you open your Alexa app and are guided by pictures and videos along with text which makes things super easy. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one of the 4 or 5 Honeywell thermostats pictured in the setup instructions then all you have to do is take your thermostat off the wall, select your existing wiring configuration in the app, then snap on the new thermostat. Took maybe 5 minutes or less.I got this thermostat because I\u2019m lazy. I hate having to make the choice of either leaving the air on at bedtime so I\u2019m not burning up while trying to get to sleep but then waking up freezing because it gets down to 64-66 at 7am, or having the heat on at bedtime but then I\u2019m too hot to sleep. My existing thermostat did not have an auto function where it could switch back and forth from heat to cool on its own to maintain the set temp. I really wanted this auto function but also the ability to set different schedules for M-Th, F, Sat & Sun separately. This device appeared to have all of these functions but after I installed it I realized that it\u2019s very limited.For example, you can only have 3 temperature preferences. Home, Away and Sleep. I really need one more, Wake. And you can\u2019t make them different temperatures on different days like other smart thermostats. Also you are forced to have a difference in 3 degrees from heat to cool. Which means I can\u2019t make my home presets 69 for heat and 68 cool. If heat is set to 69 then cool has to be 72. Right now it\u2019s 70 degrees and I have set the temp to 69 so my thermostat says it\u2019s cooling to 69 and will maintain a temp of 66-69 but I don\u2019t want it to get down to 66 because that\u2019s too cold! It\u2019s just super frustrating.

I considerer it a one off issue for now unless it happens again.Update 1:  The thermostat will no longer connect to the Alexa app.  See new picture.  My previous review was 3 stars because while it was working ok it had some frustrating flaws in that you can't set separate heat and cool modes properly.

The DIY guide on the phone is great and easy to follow for installing it.  But I've given it 3 stars for now because of 2 Issues I've found so far.  Hopefully they are addressed in an update so I can make it 5 stars.1) The preferred temp settings in the Alexa app.  There are 3 modes you can choose.  Heat mode, Cool mode and Auto mode. (see pic) However, if you change the Sleep temp to 68 for Heat mode you cannot set a sleep temp lower than 71 in Cool mode.  If you try and change the Sleep temp for Cooling to 68 then when you go back to Heat mode it will have changed the Sleep temp to 65. It is linked to the Auto mode's settings.  You can see in my screenshot that the temps will always match and thus it is applying the 3F min range of Auto to your settings in Heat and Cool.  It should be 3 separate modes.  The 3F min range should not apply to Heat and Cool.  And there is no way to disable the Auto mode.2) There does not seem to be an Alexa command to turn the Fan from On to Auto.  I can only change it from the app or the front panel.  I can change the temp, the mode and such, but not the fan.

{"reviewTitle":"Problematic, limited programmability","reviewDescription":"I really wanted to like this thing. I bought the C-wire adapter to install it, which took a little over half a day. I was on board. But... There are some major limitations that are making me wonder if I should just return it (without a box) and get something else:1) Maximum of three temperature settings. If you want to set a daily program that runs automatically, there is a limit of three temperatures: home, away and sleep. I need a fourth. I work from home on several weekdays and, when I'm just sitting at a desk, my body temperature drops and I need more heat to be comfortable. When I'm not working, I'm usually moving, and a high temperature is uncomfortable. I need to be able to set a temperature for \"Awake and moving\" and set another for \"Awake and not moving.\" And the temperatures I have for sleep and away won't work for that. And even doing so would be a workaround, not a solution.2) Automated temperatures for heating and cooling at home MUST be within 3 degrees of each other.  For example, if you set the heat to 68 for \"at home,\" then you can't set cooling below 71 for \"at home.\" If you try, it will decrease your heat temperature to the 3-degree offset. E.g., if you set cooling to 70, your heating goes down to 67, and vice versa. This is stupid. Let me control the temperature however I want to, so I don't have to reprogram my thermostat every summer and winter.3) Alexa integration. I get that this thermostat should be integrated with the Alexa app. And, if I wasn't constantly needing to adjust the temperature because of the reasons listed above, that would be fine. But since I do have to change the temperature manually almost every day, I wish I could access the settings for the thermostat with just one click, instead of having to navigate to it every time.There are other limitations that I just don't have the time to outline. I've turned off the hunches feature, for example, cause it just won't work for me. (Maybe I use my phone in bed and want the temperature set to \"Sleep\" before I actually sleep.) And so forth.As it stands, with the limitations of the user interface, best I can give this thing is two stars, and I don't think it deserves categorization as a \"smart device.\"","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646006400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Dumbest \"smart\" thermostat available, but its cheap","reviewDescription":"Does this control the heat? Yes. Can you change the setting from an app? Yes. Does that make the thermostat smart? No.This is the cheapest, most limited version of a smart thermostat possible. If that's what you're looking for it may be right for you. My gripes with it are primarily all the things that it can't do that other smart thermostats can. My biggest complaint is the inability to decrease the temp when you're away on more than one thermostat. Alexa's \"Hunches\" lets you use geo-fencing to lower the heating temp when you leave the house... but only on one device. I have 3, so I have to manually go in and set the other 2 back when I get the alert about the Hunch.Next, lets talk about controlling it. The thermostat itself only allows you to control On\/Off, and set temp up\/down. Using voice control from an Alexa device is infuriating. Only half the commands I tried actually worked. Using the app is a little better, but overly complex. It uses the Alexa app, so you have to navigate to the device you want which is at least a few clicks. Compared to the Nest interface, this is incredibly clunky and hard to use. Schedules are hard to see, every change takes twice the taps that should be required since the app is shared with the entire Alexa ecosystem.Overall, if you only need one thermostat, and just want to change the temp and schedule from your phone but don't mind the clunky interface, this may work for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend paying a little more for one of the more mature thermostats that is actually smart.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1673049600000}

You can set the temperature and fan mode, but you cannot set the mode to off, either via a schedule or Alexa routines.  Of course it can manually be turned off, either at the thermostat or via the app, but only manually.

On the Alexa app we have to be signed in as the same user in order to use it. BUT, there's an even bigger problem with that. One of the big features that's a money saver with smart thermostats is that they detect when you're gone and raise the temperature to save money\/energy. This claims to have this feature. But, because we're signed into the same account, when it notices that one of us has left it automatically raises the temperature. My wife and I are both self employed working out of our home. So, one of us leaves and suddenly the house starts getting hot. Then you've got to cool the house back down all over again. I've spent several support sessions trying to get this figured out with no real solutions. This is my biggest frustration.Second, it randomly changes settings on me. You have the option to have the fan on all the time, off, or auto where it comes on with the compressor. I have mine set to auto.

After finally getting the new AC system installed, I treated myself to a smart thermostat, which is something I have always wanted. It was an impulse buy, so I went out and got mine at Best Buy so that I could have it and install it that same day. It was working well for the first four weeks. It\u2019s a very simple, no bells and whistles thermostat, though there\u2019s a little bit more you can do with the Alexa app. We didn\u2019t worry about that. I just wanted the ability to adjust the temperature from anywhere in the house. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth mentioning that we have a thermometer in the living room on a table below the thermostat which consistently read about 2 degrees cooler than the Amazon thermostat, but I think that\u2019s pretty typical. Anyway, this evening we started to feel really hot. The room thermometer was saying it was about 73 degrees inside, so we attempted to adjust the temperature on the thermostat and it started flashing with a yellow warning symbol that immediately filled us with dread. You can say we\u2019ve been burned before. I checked the Alexa app which said our system was on a \u201cdelayed start.\u201d There was no way to bypass this. Some research online and an Amazon help thread for other users with this same issue didn\u2019t reveal any helpful or effective tips for fixing this, though we tried them all.

{"reviewTitle":"Very basic smart thermostat","reviewDescription":"This is a very basic smart thermostat that actually lacks most of the features you'll probably be looking for. Having said that, the price is right. For those looking for Alexa support, this thermostat fully supports Alexa as you would imagine. The downside is, it fully supports Alexa. Meaning, the app and manual controls are very weak as the thermostat is expecting you to use the Alexa app's voice control almost exclusively. An example? Try to get the thermostat to stop following a schedule (the \"hold\" function on most other thermostats). It doesn't exist. You have to completely disable schedules. Do you want to quickly change thermostat settings via the app? Nope - you need to click at least three different times in the Alexa app to get to the actual thermostat. Want to create an app widget to control the thermostat to avoid this? Sorry - that doesn't exist.Do you want to see your usage? Sorry - not available. Do you want to set a reminder to change the filter? Add that to a standard Alexa reminder list. Want to have the temperature stay within a specific temperature range? Sorry - that doesn't exist. Do you want to get notifications of any sort? Sorry - that doesn't exist.The manual controls are also highly annoying. The thermostat has no presence sensor, so you have to click the front button to wake it up. Then click it again to get it to respond. 8 times out of 10, you'll now have the thermostat in the wrong mode.Is it worth the cost? If you have never had a smart thermostat and this is your first, then maybe. There are better smart thermostats available for just a little more money (ecobee, Sensi) that you might want to look at before this.BTW, the thermostat is nothing but a rebranded Honeywell basic smart thermostat with the restriction that you can only use the Alexa app to control it. If you don't need\/want Alexa, you might be better off just buying the non-Amazon version.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1643414400000}

For example; You can't set Sleep mode, for either Heat or Cool, between 68 degrees and wake at 73 degrees. It also won't allow more than 3 degrees difference between Home, Away, and Sleep modes. If you change the degrees in the Sleep mode it will automatically reduce the Home and Away modes. Temperature nazis want to control your comfort the way they think you should live. I should be able to cool to 65 for Sleep and heat to 75 for Home if I want. Nothing is more aggravating than someone trying to control your life through their product limitations. F-OFF Amazon!You have to use the app or Alexa to change the temperatures twice a day, therefore once you're awake and out of bed you'll have to deal with a cold house for the first hour it takes to heat to a comfortable temperature.

It did accomplish the first two.  Still learning after one week how to control temperatures by hunches; may revert to using a schedule.  I have a heat-only system.The installation ultimately required a powered C adapter separate from the furnace controller.  My furnace controller has no wiring point labeled C (for common); perhaps it is labeled something else.  I bought the Honeywell C-wire adapter that is offered alongside this thermostat, just in case, but without a C connection on the furnace control I gave up on that adapter. What did work was a different kind of C wire adapter plugged into a wall outlet near the thermostat.  The two wires from that are connected to the C and RC connection points of the thermostat, and the W and R wires from my furnace controller are connected to W and R of the thermostat.  Bingo!I am trying Alexa \"hunches\" for presence detection but that is not working yet.  When I am not home during the day, such as at work -- indicated by my cell phone not being connected to home wifi PERHAPS -- I would like the thermostat to be at 62F and when I am home I would like to have it at 68F.  That is how I thought I configured it, but the 68F setting persists long after I have left for work.  The problem must be in how the algorithm in Alexa decides whether or not I am home.  It seems to change from 62 at night to 68 in morning adequately.  Not sure yet if it changes from 68 to 62 at night consistently or how its hunches work for that.

Amazon reached out within a few hours and redirected me to a local technician who walked me through step by step the installation. It turns out the electrician had incorrectly added the C wire so that the C wire and the R wire were pulling from the same source, so when the heat turned on the thermostat would not have enough power. The support directed me to where I could get a plug in transformer that solved my problem, and both thermostats are working flawlessly. It's so nice to be able to modify the temperature at night from my bedroom.PSA if you have an old honeywell thermostat with a W wire, an R wire, and the R wire is also connected to RC, then the easiest solution INSTEAD OF THE C WIRE ADAPTER is to get a 24 volt C wire plug in adapter charger. You can purchase one of these for around 10 bucks. The solution I chose was just one you plug into the wall and then you can use those wires for your C and Rc. YOU CAN DO THIS INSTEAD OF HIRING AN ELECTRICIAN (just remember to turn your power off before doing anything with the thermostat). It will save you hundreds of dollars.

I tried to call support through the app, and then the support page said they were \"experiencing technical difficulties\" and to \"come back later\".

Setting it up and connecting it to my Alexa-enabled devices was a breeze, and I was able to control the thermostat effortlessly using voice commands. The integration between the thermostat and Alexa is seamless, allowing me to adjust the temperature, set schedules, and monitor energy usage with very simple voice prompts.In terms of functionality, this thermostat has exceeded my expectations. I have a central AC unit of the Trane brand with a heat pump, and the Amazon Smart Thermostat works flawlessly with it. The thermostat accurately senses the temperature and maintains the desired settings consistently, ensuring a comfortable indoor environment. The ability to control and monitor the thermostat remotely through the Amazon Alexa app adds an extra layer of convenience, especially when I am away from home and want to adjust the temperature settings before returning.Another notable aspect of the Amazon Smart Thermostat is its energy efficiency. The thermostat provides insightful data on energy usage, allowing me to make informed decisions and adjust settings to save on electricity bills. The ability to create custom schedules and set different temperature preferences for various times of the day has significantly contributed to optimizing energy consumption in my home.The sleek and minimalist design of the thermostat blends well with any decor, and the touchscreen interface is intuitive and responsive. The installation process was straightforward, and I appreciate the clear instructions provided with the device.Overall, the Amazon Smart Thermostat has been a reliable and efficient addition to my home. Its seamless integration with Alexa, flawless performance with my Trane heat pump, and energy-saving features make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to upgrade their home's heating and cooling system.

Ridiculous because ALL our other Amazon devices and non-Amazon devises reconnect to Wi-Fi without issue, but the thermostat won\u2019t.Went to check the app while on vacation and we had a power outage, power was restored and of course the device was UNRESPONSIVE. Had to have someone go to the house, remove it from its cradle and reinstall it, false since of security. As far as I could tell, it didn't retain the set temperature, making that heat zone inoperative. NOT GOOD IN FREEZING TEMERATURES!And of course, it's past the return date so I\u2019m just going cut my losses, buy a decent one and toss this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705449600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Worked for AC, then come winter, heat didn't work","reviewDescription":"Bought it in May, installed it myself.  Yes, the wires were right, I've done this before.  Worked well for AC for the summer but come October, it wouldn't turn on the heat or emergency  heat (even though it said it was on).  In fact, it would turn on the AC initially when you turned on the heat.  Checked the wires, lots.  Reset the unit per the instructions.  Still chokes when you try to turn on heat.  Old thermostat worked fine just wanted to add the Alexa app to control the heat for my wife.I bought another one just like it as its likely not going to be covered after being used for 5 months.  I just don't want to rip out the wires again and redo it for another model.  If the new one doesn't work, i'll just return it and get a different one.UPDATE: I bought another unit and it did the same thing.  Traced it down to the Y wire engaging for heat when it should only engage for Air Conditioning.  This looks to be a code thing as it is sending the wrong signals to the furnace.  I need it to engage the 'W' wire for heat.  Still working the problem.  Amazon did call me to try to resolve.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1665360000000}
