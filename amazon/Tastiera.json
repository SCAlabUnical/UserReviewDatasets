{"reviewTitle":"First time spending money on a gaming keyboard.","reviewDescription":"I always just used my K120 Logitech Keyboard, its 10 bucks, I can use up to like 5 keys at once and never had trouble with how many keys Im allowed, its quiet when typing, the keys are easy to press and find, and it did the job well.However, after 5 years of use, it broke. (Finally, I know right?) and I decided to spend a whole 7 dollars more on a keyboard.Then I bought this, its terrible, the buttons are clickey, the cord is flimsey, the lights are so shiny it hurts my eyes.Just kidding.The buttons are amazing, what become easy to click, became easier, everything feels so smooth, the keys are fairly quiet but its probably just because I am a light typer. The lights allow me to turn my lights off and not have to guess where my keys are when I type. I found my WPM went up by 10 words per minute, originally it was 60, now its 70. Much easier to type because of the smooth and easy transition for my fingers and how open, easy, and strong the buttons are. Each button feels distinct and easy to find for my muscle memory.The buttons are tough as nails, I can easily tell this keyboard will last a while, its easy to clean under them due to how the keyboard was made, literally can just blow the gunk off with a can of ultra duster.As for the gaming part, every single key I press reacts, I can press as many damned keys as I want and they all work perfectly. The best part is how the F1 - F4 is set up, each F keys are lined in 4, this means in games that require me to use F1 - F4 are much easier to play because of how the intelligent designers set this up. For instance, in SC2 I need to press the F keys to set up my camera hotkey so its easier to move from location to location, I am CONSTANTLY pressing these keys as Zerg and before I always tended to hit ESC or F5 but because of how these keys are set up, I never make those mistakes again. And due to the distinction of the F keys, I never accidently hit the wrong F key anymore either. Dramatically improving my capability to play.Whats more, sometimes even with my K120, I have to press more than 5 keys and that 6th key wont go through. This means if I have to run and turn, which is A, D, Shift, and then jump, space, and then press Capslock to talk, and then ult which is `, my ult wont go off because thats 6 keys. In Overwatch this is incredibly common. You need to constantly run, jump, talk, and sometimes ult at the same time. Many times I make this mistake, I will wind up dying or causing someone else to die. However, no longer does this happen with this keyboard!The LED keys are great, not too bright. I wish I could have a only blue option but I dont mind.I only have one negative thing to say: The space sucks balls, its loud, and... well its just loud. I am a very quiet typer because of how my fingers have to move quickly accross the keyboard and every time I have to press space I cringe a little. I found out why its like this, the springs arent tightened, whoever made this keyboard made the springs on it very loose however thats also another great thing about this keyboard: You can fix it because you can see the springs, which means with a knife or tweezers, you can easily push the springs apart a bit to tighten up the spacebar. I just havent gotten around to it.This keyboard is a work of art, for the price, I'd say its 100 percent worth it. I'd say this is worth 60 bucks in my opinion but I'll go with 19, I aint complainin.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1538092800000}
{"reviewTitle":"I'm insane for this membrane","reviewDescription":"Great and solid keyboard, fun times. Logitech and Razer must recognize the NPET! This keyboard is thin, not bulky, and has a solid METAL baseplate. It feels sturdy and heavy, doesn't slide around on my desktop. There are dual springs on the space bar and the keyboard includes a red key puller tool. The keystrokes are deep, precise and quiet. My typing\/keystroke accuracy is much improved on this keyboard. No drivers were needed, and you can adjust the colors and effects just how you like them using the Function key on the keyboard. There is a Windows key lockout.  The keyboard backlight turns off after a few idle minutes, and I am not sure if the time-out can be adjusted. The media keys work.

{"reviewTitle":"Solid budget level setup","reviewDescription":"Was looking for a cheap and easy setup for a secondary PC that children would be using for general web browsing, homework, and occasional gaming.  This combo fit the bill and then some.  The feel of the keyboard is smooth and responsive with functional feedback and resistance in the keys.  The only downside is the audible noise you get from keystrokes.The Mouse is pleasantly smooth with good button engagement and response.  The DPI switch is a very nice addition and performs flawlessly when needed.The winning tick for this combo is the RGB quality at this price point.  The keyboard provides an impressive array of colors that are not overly bright or distracting, but not so muted that they regress out of sight.  The Mouse has a nice fading array of simplistic lines that adds to the ambiance of the lighting package.Overall, I think it's a great package for light general use.  The RGB features really add to the value and provide an impressive overall package for the price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695168000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Solid build.  A real keeper.","reviewDescription":"Pro:Nice feel.  The stroke is a bit long compared to my last keyboard but the feel is excellent.  Just while writing this review I have gotten used to the longer stroke.Heavy back plate.  This puppy is not sliding around without me intending to move it.I am not sure if a mechanical keyboard but it sure feels like it.Very inexpensive for a mechanical keyboard.This will probably be the easiest keyboard to clean since when you used to unplug them and take them into the shower with you a 2 or 3 decades ago.  There is no tray the keys are sitting in to hold dust, bits of potato chip, cat hair (my cats like laying on keyboards for some reason), ...  I do not see even a reason to remove the keycaps except to put on different ones for different languages.Con:Tabs for raising angle of the keyboard, like so many including expensive keyboards are cheap fragile plastic and will probably break within a few months.No macro keys, programmable or otherwise.  To be honest this might be unfair.  A great many keyboards have abandoned using macro keys but they really help with a lot of programs including productivity software but gaming especially.  I think programming them gives people fits.  Oh well.  Also this is a very inexpensive keyboard with a mechanical keyboard feel.Other:The lighting schemes are nice but I would personally prefer just a straight white lighting behind the keys.  I am retired.  I am a vampire as to my sleep wake cycle.  I am up usually all night long and up only in the daytime if there is something I have to do.  I however do not wish to waste electricity so I tend to keep the lights off.  This means I cannot see my keyboard and with my aging eyes, I really want as much contrast to make it easy to read what the keys are at night.I am considering purchasing another couple for backups for when this eventually (hopefully far in the future) fails.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1618358400000}

As a gamer\/streamer, I sometimes get caught up in the moment and lose track of my drink and\/or hands and the next thing you know, your keyboard is soaked.  With this keyboard, it's not an issue.  I have actually spilled multiple sticky sugary drinks on it and it keeps pluggin' away. I have not gone so far as to intentionally spill large amounts of liquid or submerge it to test it.  My experience is based on actually accidentally knocking over a drink and spilling a small-ish amount of liquid.The feel of the keyboard is good.  It's much quieter then a mechanical keyboard, but louder then a membrane one. The keys have a nice click with decent finger feedback.  I'm a gamer, but not a professional by any means, so I don't need a super expensive keyboard with Cherry Switches, etc.  This style works great for me.The only downside is that in the time I have had this keyboard, the paint on the S, A and D keys have worn off and the Left Shift, Space Bar, C and W keys are wearing off too.  But the function is still 100%!The RGB is limited to Four modes, 3 different sets of static rainbow colors and off.Overall, a solid keyboard at a great price.

{"reviewTitle":"Lights Out After 7 Minutes","reviewDescription":"As strictly a keyboard? This product is...fairly good.  Keys have a nice feel to them.  No false key clicks, no excessive pressure required and so on.  Would be nice if the letters were solid and didn't contain spaces in them like they were printed using an old stencil but, hey, so what if my \"B\" key looks like a palm tree growing out of the ground if viewed sideways? And my \"O\" key an omega symbol without the loops on the ends?Where this product really fails is with the backlight timeout.  If you don't press a key, it's \"lights out\" after 7 minutes and 11 seconds.  No way to adjust that or turn it off.  You've got to find...in the dark...because your backlit keyboard isn't lit...and press a key to turn it on again.Oh, and I'll save you the effort of using a search engine for a hack or solution: There isn't one.  Any ones that you find apply strictly to the cordless version.  If you're using the USB version like I am, none of those work.  Which is kind of silly because, seriously, how much power are you going save by turning off the backlight after 7 minutes of keyboard inactivity...pennies?So, if you want a continuously lit keyboard, this isn't the one for you.  If you want keys without strange gaps in the lettering, this isn't the one for you.  Other than that?

{"reviewTitle":"Well Loved, but Only Lasted a Year","reviewDescription":"Purchased this keyboard a little over a year ago (October 2022), and I truly love it! I am not a gamer, or anything fancy like that. I use the keyboard for my workstation (I WFH).I am a fairly quick typer, and for whatever reason, last week, the keyboard started skipping letters as I was typing. It wasn't the same letter (I checked), and it wasn't consistent. So, I made sure to charge it over the weekend, and sure enough, Monday morning...still skipping random letters as I was typing. Haven't made any changes to the way I was hitting the keys. I am going to say that after 13 months of using it (on average) 6 days a week, for 9 hours (avg) a day, the keyboard is dying on me.I get on Amazon to look at purchasing another keyboard, and sure enough, I am a sucker!I truly love this keyboard (see image of well-loved keys).I appreciate having the backlight (I get migraines, so sometimes my overhead light is off). I am a big fan of the auditory feedback mechanical keyboards give me, and the \"clacking\" is JUST. RIGHT on this one.I don't have to worry about battery replacements (thank goodness), just charge it once or twice a week at this point, and I am good to go!But how can I make it last longer than a year??

I switched to the keyboard that came with my HP computer, and was pretty dissatisfied with it.  I always use the CTRL key on the left.  My hand can reach ^W, ^E, and ^R, all of which are very important keys in emacs, but the HP keyboard kept not registering the CTRL key so instead of those control characters I was getting 'w', 'e', and 'r' respectively.I bought a Logitech MK120 keyboard on Amazon.  It turned out to be far worse.  I figured it would be good, because the photos look as if, unlike the more modern keyboards, the keys travel a significant distance down.  The keys do travel, but the behavior on difficult CTRL keys was even worse than on the HP keyboard.  Even when I was very consciously pressing down really hard on the CTRL key, sometimes, instead of getting '^W', or 'w' I got weird, illegal characters transmitted which would make emacs hang and I've have to kill the process from another window.40 years ago, before the IBM PC was introduced, most computers had the CTRL key where the CAPS LOCK key is now.  There are these \"Happy Hacker\" keyboards you can buy like that, but they're hundreds of dollars, and I don't want to get used to a keyboard like that because when I'm using a computer other than the one at my own desk, like when I'm at a co-worker's computer, I won't be accustomed to the layout.This keyboard, which hardly cost anything, REALLY solves the problem.

Typically on budget keyboards not from the big-brands have some odd formatting on their keyboards.  On this, every key is in it's standard spot.The ergonomics are great, it's a minimalist style full keyboard, low footprint.  If you wanted a wrist rest, you might need to look elsewhere.Wireless works great, no issues with connectivity at 10+ ft.  No noticeable issues with latency, but you shouldn't be using a wireless keyboard if that was a big concern anyway.Keys are very responsive, nearly mechanical in feel.

Seeing the colors on the keyboard sometimes, not always, but at least sometimes keeps me from wanting to stab myself when I am dealing with a customer from hell.  Anyone with a stressful computer job should consider this keyboard. I haven't tried the blinking lights yet, because I think that might be a bit too distracting, but I have been having fun with changing the color theme. This certainly beats the blah, dark, non colorful keyboards I had been using in the past.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1624406400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Edited-- 5 year update","reviewDescription":"Updated again again in 2022:Still going strong.  Some of the black is wearing off the keyboard, but it's still very legible, and everything is functioning beautifully!!Updated again in 2021:It's still going strong.  Colors are great, it's durable.  The only thing is that a few of my most frequented keys are showing a bit of wear on the paint-- but I haven't had a single problem with this keyboard.  It's definitely my favorite, and for the price?  I've never found better.  Color me surprised.Updated:Replacement keyboard arrived.  I had no problem returning the non-working one.  Replacement works fabulously- no dead keys, no problems.  Despite the first broken one- I am terribly happy with this keyboard. Feels super sturdy.  The lights are wonderful (but not too bright to cause problems seeing what you're doing), the keys have a great response.  It sounds nice.  I like everything about this keyboard and am really surprised at the low price.Previously:  It's gorgeous.  It has a great feel to it.  The lights are great for people who need lighted keys- the colors are pretty.. it even has a nice \"not too clacky\" sound to it... but mine arrived with several dead keys.  The D, H, W, ', and Enter keys didn't work.  Don't know what else didn't work, as I packed it up and sent it back.That said though, I'm willing to give it one more try.  Aside from the crappy keys, I liked everything about it.  I'll update my review if the second keyboard is faulty as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1540771200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Cheap, but good","reviewDescription":"My original review didn't do this key oard justice. This was the first gaming, mechanical, keyboard I ver bought. I originally went for it because of the price and the fact the lights looked cool. I'm glad I bought it. There are only three selections with the lights and it gets boring, but what I paid attention to most was the feel of the keyboard. I originally bought it for my desk at work and sometimes took it home for gaming. It was responsive enough for gaming, but when it came to work this thing increased my typing speed. It's comfortable for my fingers to move nimbly over the keys and with the design I've never had the issue of my fingers pressing two keys at once. The key that I press would be the key I wanted. It helped greatly with wrist pains as well. The old dell keyboard I was using made my hands tired over time, but I could comfortablely use this keyboard for long periods with no issues. The noise to me isn't so bad though my coworkers could tell I was in when by my typing, lol. Over time the black paint comes off but not in a drastic way and it's a sturdy keyboard that doesn't feel cheap. I gave it to my sibling since they were having pain in their hands and even though it's a hand me down my sibling loves it. They said they felt relief. Would recommend to buy and would have zero issue buying another.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1590105600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good keyboard at an amazing price","reviewDescription":"I'm just your regular type of guy.  I surf the web,  play some games, and occasionally write a review.  During a moment of game induced rage, I slammed my hand into my old keyboard and snapped the space bar in half.  It still worked, but it wasn't reliable and I could see more rage coming if I wasn't able to use my space bar properly.  That is when my search for a keyboard began.  I found this bad boy for under 20 bucks and thought it would be ok... you know, do the job.  Well, it does.  It even has features I don't care about.  Like LED lights under the keys.  It has 3 different color schemes + 1 more to turn them off.  They are also dimmable with 3 different levels of brightness.  The keys feel nice under my fingers.  They aren't clicky loud like the keyboard my kid uses.  So far i'm happy with my purchase.  For the price, I feel it would be hard to beat it.UPDATE: So, as of November 2022 (so about 3.5 years of use) this keyboard is still going strong.  I have successfully worn off the letters from the S and D keys, with the A and C keys barely still displaying the letter.  The cat knocked the keyboard off my desk and the space bar flew off.  After a bit of trying I was able to get it back on and it works fine again.  I feel like at this price point, this is an absolute bargain gem.Final update: I have now started experiencing some functional issues. The usb plug needs to be held in a certain way when plugged in to work. I have decided to retire this budget winner. I got 3.5 years of heavy use out of this inexpensive keyboard. I'm not mad that it broke, just sad. RIP budget goat.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1558569600000}

You can slow it down, but it still does it.- The LEDs don't just shine through the keys. The light shines up under the keys too. This is distracting. I just want the light to be under the keys so I can make out what the keys are in a dark room and I want to be able to dim the LEDs down to the point where I can still make out the symbols\/letters\/numbers, but not blind me. Its similar to the effect of turning the light on in your vehicle at night.- The LEDs have a sleep function which could be nice, but you need the ability to turn it off.

This is awful for work as I need to type pretty fast and the \"r\" makes an appearance 50% of the time. With a boss whose pet peeves includes typos and inaccuracy, this sort of stinks. It's also very loud (not sure why the description says quiet) - I don't have long nails and I don't pound my keys...maybe quiet for a gamer who punches the keyboard? I don't know but during virtual meetings, the mic just amplifies the loudness of my typing making taking notes distracting (and, no, I can't mute my mic as I am running the meetings). Unfortunately, I already discarded the box so returning would be a pain too. At least the price wasn't bad and I got same-day delivery - and the colored lights are pretty.

However, there were some combinations of key, multi-key, pressing issues with certain games.  Such issues are seen when playing some games, but absent when playing most others.  I only had an issue with the keyboard when playing two of many games.  Moreover, such issues may also arise when using the keyboard for general use programs that require three or more function\/hotkey combinations.

It's not that I'm surprised I'm having issues, it's more that I'm having such severe issues so immediately. Since the first day of using this keyboard I've had issues with random, inexplicable, constant key-presses that require fiddling around in weird ways to correct (holding the key down, yoinking out the key in question, prodding the key input pad with a knife, etc). The most recent was my E key deciding to spam itself ad infinitum while I was in the middle of some rather urgent conversation. I haven't gotten the keyboard dirty; the issues were in fact present on the first day of usage, so I can't blame that. Aside from the random infinite key press issue, though, I'd say it works pretty great; the lights are wonderful (though I wasn't exactly focused on those when purchasing the item) and the keys type smoothly. But I did nearly send a 4,300-character message consisting entirely of the number five because of this keyboard, and it has a fondness for randomly activating my browser's bookmarks shortcut on loop until I press the activating keys hard enough to convince it to stop. I'd say it's a great purchase if you're waiting for the funds to buy a keyboard that isn't as frustrating.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1665964800000}

I wanted a keyboard with RGB backlit keys and a palm rest. This one shipped with those features plus included a mouse and even mouse pad. What's more, it was priced at a mere 25 dollars.I should have known something was wrong, but when I researched the product on Amazon I saw hundreds of glowing reviews and\/or 5-star ratings so I thought it was safe to buy this product. Unfortunately, I was duped.This keyboard was sold as new, but as soon as I opened the package I saw it had clearly been previously used. The space key and a spring were completely detached from the keyboard. There were scratches and other signs of wear on the logo that sat atop they keyboard. What bothered me most though were the disgusting grease spots that were still present on the keyboard from whomever had previously owned the thing. I shoved this piece of trash back in the box it arrived in and requested a full refund within 10 minutes of receiving the delivery. This was by far the worst condition of any product I've ever purchased on Amazon. I will never buy from this brand again.Edit: On June 4th the seller shipped a free replacement of this item to me. Although I had already purchased a new keyboard I did agree to update my review if\/when the replacement item arrived - if it warranted an updated review. I am happy to report it does deserve a second chance. The company rectified its mistake and I am sufficiently satisfied with the keyboard I received. It's a basic 20-dollar keyboard with LED lights that breathe, although you can turn the LED's off, lower their intensity or slow their rate of breathing. The mousepad and mouse are nice additions to this package and make this a great value. I had to order another keyboard because my initial order shipped defective, so this keyboard won't be the one I use on a day to day basis. However, I will admit you can do a lot worse than this Npet offering and for the price, I am not sure there is a better value readily available as new.

It works as intended and has a lot going for it (see original review below). However, the black paint on the keys is wearing off so that I can't read the characters anymore. It's disappointing that the company made such an otherwise great keyboard but because they cut corners with the design of the keys, the keyboard STILL ends up being disposable. And this after JUST THREE MONTHS. So here I am, back on Amazon looking for another keyboard. :(If you can afford it, spend your money on a premium product that will last years. This, sadly, isn't it.***ORIGINAL REVIEW***In the past five years, I've gone through two dozen keyboards. Most of the wireless ones just don't work reliably. BT cuts out. To conserve energy, they turn off after a couple of minutes--leading to mistakes when you start typing again due to the re-connection lag. Batteries die at the least convenient times. Etc. This keyboard offers the reliability of an always-ready wired connection. And the back-lighting means I can work in any light conditions because the light turns OFF or I can adjust the light intensity up\/down. While the springiness of the keys isn't as sharp as, for me, the gold standard--the Lenovo classic Thinkpad keypad--it's far better than most other keyboards' anemic, wishy-washy , did-I-actually-just-depress-that-key? feel.  The feel isn't as sharp as that of other gaming keyboards', though--if that's critical to you. It's quiet enough to be used in a room with other people without being a nuisance, and springy enough to give you an immediate \"feel\" that each key has been depressed.Another huge plus for this keyboard is how intuitive it is to change the lighting. You just use the clearly designated FN key and the PG UP\/PG DOWN keys. These latter have the light-icons with either \"-\" or \"+\" also printed on them. And unlike other keyboards, all these keys are illuminated--not just the letters but the symbols too.For the price, this keyboard can't be beat. I'd even buy these for others for gifts--a solid, reliable, no-nonsense product. If you're sick of dealing the the prima dona wireless keyboards but sill want to be able to work in low-light conditions, this is a terrific keyboard. I'll update my review if anything major changes.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663891200000}

But after about 2 weeks with it, the charge no longer wanted to last a full 8 hour work shift, and I had to plug it in just to finish out the last hour of the day. The following days, the charge lasted shorter and shorter, such that I now just keel it plugged in at all times. It's a shame really.I have issues also with some of the keys sticking, for example I will press space, and it will give me about 10 spaces.Lastly, I just want to point out that the glowing colors look best in the dark. Every once in a blue moon, we keep the office lights off, but for the most part, everybody seems to always want the lights on, and then I hardly notice the beautiful colors. Not the keyboards fault really, but food for thought for anyone who is considering this keyboard for similar office use. I will be replacing this keyboard very soon.

But is miserable to type on and the LEDs lack adjustability.  Ok for your 10 year old to beat on.Looks OK, and for under $15 what do you want?  Well, I for one would LOVE to be able to change the rainbow brite backlights to one single color.  Blue, red, etc, something.  I have not discovered a way to do this.  The instructions say (and comments on reviews are the same) that FN+Page UP changes LED modes.  This did nothing for me, as far as I can tell FN+Page UP = brightness UP, FN+Page DN = brightness down.  The \"LED\" light key (directly above the HOME key turns the LEDs on or off, or through one of 3 rainbow modes.  Note, these are STATIC rainbow modes, it doesn't shift or change colors.  If you FN+LED or FN+HOME, it enters a \"breathing mode\" where the lights pulse in and out.  THAT IS IT.The printed and online instructions are wrong, or maybe for a different model keyboard.FN+\u2191 =light up = WRONG, this is actually FN+PG UPFN+\u2193=light down = WRONG, this is actually FN+PG DNFN+HM=7 constant colors (7 modes) = WRONG, enters breathing modeFN+PD=turn off the light = WRONG, this dims the LED lighting brightnessFN+INS=LED colors cycling = WRONG, this does NOTHINGFN+PU=Customized led lighting =  WRONG, this increases the LED lighting brightnessFN+DEL=Running RGB lighting (2 modes) = WRONG, this does NOTHINGFN+END=7 colors\/1 colors breathing (8 modes) = WRONG, this does NOTHINGFN+\u00ab=LED spreading\/breathing speed down = I don't even know what key this refers to.

If so, does nothing.LED lighting aside. ... there is no height adjustment at all.  Even $10 keyboards come with little legs in the back to heighten or lower the keyboard typing angle.  NONE here.These keys... SPRINGY and SPONGY are the best words I can describe them.  Not predictably mushy like an OEM HP\/DELL\/ETC keyboard... but... bouncy?  Anyway... not great.  Oh, so many many typos I made while typing this.  Not enjoyable to type on at all.  And the keys are... raised?  Tall?  I don't know the best description, but they sit a lot higher than you would expect.It sort of looks like a mechanical keyboard, but with zero of the feel.All I wanted was an inexpensive, mediocre, backlit keyboard to use at work in a dark room.  Just typing this review.... no way I'm taking this junk to work.  So uncomfortable to type on and you're locked into rainbow mode.

I cleaned the keyboard, turned it upside down and shook it out, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers. Nothing worked. The keys don't have any obvious physical issues. They're not sticky.

After much frustration and and a trip across the room into the wall, I discovered how tough this thing really is.The bottom line is you MUST have your computer on with the USB receiver \/ \"dongle\" plugged in for the keyboard to function. Must be a battery conserving feature or something  but manual never mentions this. I give it 5 stars for toughness, zero for all the brain damage it caused me, 3 for cool looking but 2 for lighting as the keys on the top 2 rows are more dim than the rest. Even after trying to destroy it, it works perfectly now that all the keys are back in place. Hey, for 18 bucks, why not! I'm keeping mine. If it breaks, Best Buy recycles E-waste from China too.

It can't be to save battery, given that the battery is already awful, dying after two-three days of use.Got this keyboard because I'm going to be bedbound for a couple months following a major surgery, so I needed a wireless keyboard since my go-to (PICTEK RGB Gaming Keyboard) is wired and will not be able to reach the bed. Part of the appeal of this one was being able to see the keys in the dark on nights when I'm in too much pain to sleep. Problem is, the backlight goes out if you don't tap any key for 2 minutes.This might seem like a long time, but if you're watching a movie, what this means is that you end up struggling to see the keyboard any time you pause to do something else. This totally negates the point of a backlight.Also, the black paint on the keys was already flaky the moment I took it out of the box. I have had it for less a month exactly, but you can see from the pic attached that there are spots where you can see the light through breaks in the paint.The keyboard is very heavy, too, but at the same time doesn't feel very sturdy. I'm a big dropper of keyboards, and my usual is light enough that doing so really isn't a big deal, but this one feels like if I dropped it, it would break immediately, and dent the floor in the process.It's a functioning keyboard so 2 star rather than 1, but I plan to go back to my regular keyboard the second I can sit at my desk again.Oh, also!

When using WASD controls, if you want to move diagonally you press two keys at once (\"W\" and \"D,\" perhaps) and they both work.  With some ancient keyboards, if you pressed multiple keys at once, only one or two would actually get passed from the keyboard to your PC.  The anti-ghosting on this board works most of the time, but there are a few common key combinations that simply don't work.  The one that bothered me most was that Ctl-Shift-Esc would not bring up the Task Manager, which should always work on Windows.

I wanted a keyboard that is plugged in most of the time but can be disconnected and used wirelessly when needed. The description says, \"Two working modes, wired and wireless, enjoy the freedom of being wireless while still not compromising performance by going wired\".There is only ONE working mode: wireless. There is no \"wired\" mode. The wireless USB receiver (dongle) has to be plugged in at all times. But you can still use the keyboard while it's charging. Keyboard data isn't sent over the USB cable. It's only transmitted wirelessly to the USB receiver. The problem with this is that you have to use two USB ports if you want to use it in the so-called \"wired\" mode which isn't actually a wired mode. It's just a \"you can still use it while charging\" mode. My mouse takes up a third USB port. Now I have to buy a USB hub for the three ports for the keyboard and mouse.Here's a suggestion: include two USB-A ports on either side of the keyboard to connect a mouse for left- or right-handed users so the keyboard and mouse only use one USB port on my computer.By the way, Chinese businesses, would it be so hard to contract an actual native English speaker to write your product description?

I bout this to use while Playing an MMORPG on my PS4 from the couch in the living room. If there is absolutely anything between the keyboard and the USB receiver, the signal is blocked. And I mean anything, a person, an object, your own knee or feet (while sitting reclined)... Is this thing actually wireless, or just infrared, like old TV remotes? It was driving me nuts trying to figure out why it wouldn't work, until I figured out the problem.I'm sorry that it took me so long to use it that I'm not likely to be able to do anything about it. I'll reach out to their support and see if there's anything they can do, but I've already seen one review saying that they stopped responding after a single email. \/FingersCrossed","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669593600000}
{"reviewTitle":"At least it glows...","reviewDescription":"At least it looks nice and 'spiffy' on my desk.  It also uses metal and has some bulk to it which feels nice while typing.There are 2 main problems.The first is that it only has 3 preset LED settings.  You can't change that at all, so hope you like the presets!The second issue is what made me return one keyboard, and finally decide to write a review.The key finishes wear down WAY too fast, like in days, not months.  I had to return the first keyboard after a few weeks because the major keys A,S,D,W,E etc, were already at the point where half the paint had worn off of the keys.  Even the paint on my cheap $5 keyboards lasted over a year before they got to this point.My 2nd keyboard is already starting to show signs of the keys wearing away, so it apparently wasn't a flaw with my original keyboard, sigh.I'm probably going to keep the keyboard since I like the weight and feel, and can touch type (thankfully).

No better than the Dell, except the Dell with the cheap printed keys lasted a year before rubbing off, not a few weeks. And, instead of sending a replacement key, their remedy is mail the whole thing back, and wait for repairs.

I don't think I type that fast and have never had this issue with other keyboards. The battery also dies very quickly. Doesn't last for more than a day or two before I have to plug it in to re-charge, which defeats the purpose of making it wireless if I'm constantly having to use it plugged in.

Can't press right+up+O, right+up+N, or right+up+P at the same time and many other 3 key conflicts. Otherwise the keyboard is pretty nice for the price.I just picked up this keyboard as a replacement to my last keyboard that broke during a move. This keyboard looked nice and small, there's no large useless plastics like my last keyboard, the keys are a lot quieter than my last keyboard, print screen is a dedicated key, overall I liked the keyboard and felt like it was an upgrade from the one I had before.The downside is that it has major problems with registering multiple keys being pressed at the same time. I haven't had any 2 key problems but the minute I try and press 3 keys at once there are bunch of conflicts all over the place that cause major problems. The biggest one that makes the keyboard useless to me is control+shift+enter. The text editor I use has a lot of functionality bound to control+shift+... and I use control+shift+enter constantly. I also found that I couldn't jump or dash while moving down+right in a multiplayer game that has jump mapped to comma and dash mapped to period (weird mapping but it was so you could play 2 players on 1 keyboard easier). You also can't press N while holding down right. You can't press O, P, N, comma, or period while holding up+right. You can't press Y, O, or P while holding up+left. You can't press Y, left bracket, or right bracket while holding down+left. You can't press control+alt+shift+U,K, or P at the same time.I've had keyboard that have key conflicts before but I've never had any combinations that actual cause problems during normal usage. Obviously this conflicts probably won't cause problems if all you do is write documents or browse the web but if you are playing a game that uses the arrow keys it's not uncommon that you might need to move in two directions at once and use a third letter key to perform an action. In my mind this keyboard has no place calling itself a gaming keyboard with conflicts like that. In my case, I am a programmer who uses a bunch of long hotkeys in a text editor so anything that restricts any combination of control\/shift\/alt and any letter key is a no-go for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1602374400000}

And the coloured lights are useless but kind of interesting.However, one reason I bought this keyboard was its claim (that you can see right in the product description) that \"the characters never fade\".Well, this is an outright lie. I received my keyboard on May 27th. Yes, I use it extensively; and the picture accompanying this review was taken on June 7. You can see the N key is already going fast and there is growing wear on the A, S, and D keys (all of which are used extensively in gaming). That's less than two weeks for those of you who are counting. Two weeks is a long way from never...don't you think?The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because most other keyboards under $100 also fade very quickly, so this is not worse than the others, but it is also definitely no better. Other than the ensuing and inevitable fading of the key characters, the feel is still really nice.UPDATE: Reverted to 1 star. DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD! I have attached an updated picture with keyboard wear for exactly 1 month of daily use. In addition , the keys sometimes go crazy and start repeating. In one case, with no keys depressed at all, the keyboard started inputting infinite space characters into my documents until I unplugged it and re-plugged the USB cable. Also, the \"W\" key seems to double for a left and right arrow key, which makes playing a game like Minecraft impossible, since, as you move forward, you will switch items in hand (beating on a creeper with a map is not a good idea!).I have now ordered a new Dell keyboard.

For the price, there aren\u2019t many RGB keyboards around this range. It\u2019s also in a metal frame, I personally like the added weight, and it makes it more solid and feels more secure.The one amazing feature is that the cord is braided! (Something that other companies like Corsair or razer don\u2019t do for their cheaper keyboards).The cons:Typing would be good enough, if it wasn\u2019t for the space bar not always working as intended. A good 60-70% of the times I pressed the space bar whilst typing it wasn\u2019t registered(?) it made the sound, but it didn\u2019t always work, unless I pushed harder than what do with my thumb, I almost always ended up going back and having to separate words whenever this happened, I ended up wasting about as long as it took to type, if not longer, correcting the spacing errors.I even gave it a about 2 weeks, thinking it might be due to the keyboard being new, hoping it would adjust. I also checked if the space bar was loose, and tried to secure it, but sadly that wasn\u2019t the case.The other issue, but this is a minor one, is the fact that the keys are wobbly, and I think the layout of the keyboard, plus the keys being wobbly make it so that you sometimes press the wrong letter when typing. This didn\u2019t happen as a often, and for the price this keyboard costs (17.09$ at the time I bought it) , I could live with it.In the end, you get what you pay for. If it wasn\u2019t for the space bar being faulty, I would like this keyboard, it looks nice thanks to the RGB, it has a braided cord, but when it comes to its primary function, it fails.I wouldn't recommend buying this keyboard if you\u2019re going to use it for typing (it\u2019s the main function, I know\u2026) but if you\u2019re ONLY going to use it for playing games that DON\u2019T require typing, then this is good, I played  Skyrim & Fallout and it worked just fine.I already returned the keyboard and ordered a (hopefully) higher quality one, it\u2019s the Corsair k55.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1558828800000}

I also needed a keyboard with number pad and mechanical.  So this seemed like a cheap, quick buy to serve a one time purpose.It's only a few days after using it and pretty much out of the gate I noticed this keyboard has absolutely poor input delay.  I'f you type fast there is an incredibly high chance that your words will be missing letters.  It also randomly will take a random key you pressed and input it randomly over and over for no reason what so ever.Even from the aspect of being mechanical, it's very poor.  Also the RGB lights arnt even one single static color.  They give you several different lighting options and configuration, but they can't give you the most basic function of a single static color?  That's bare minimum in my book.I won't be using this keyboard long enough to encounter the other issue that almost everyone encounters, the paint on the keys will fade.  And apparently this happens rather quickly.  So also take that into consideration.So here's my point, you here because you are obviously looking for cheap, wireless keyboard, maybe with with RGB and maybe you want it mechanical, and in here to tell you that there are Def some good options out there for $20-30.

A few days later, the n key wouldn't work for a few minutes but started working again too. Then yesterday I had trouble with the n, the period, and the comma twice in the same day. Today, I immediately couldn't get the same 3 keys plus the 0 in the numpad to work.  I also realized the space bar issue wasn't my fault either, since it had been sporadic, and now the space isn't working either. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in and it still didn't work. I managed to get it to work just long enough to get logged into my system for work thankfully, but then I had to copy and paste the characters I needed that stopped working for the next hour. On my break, I chucked it and went back to my old 15 year old dell keyboard and started my return. I was so happy to find a rainbow backlit keyboard with a normal enter key, but I'll put up with the stupid double sized key as long as all the keys actually work!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1521676800000}

The scroll wheel works fine but feels just a tab sluggish when scrolling.My first issue is with the forward and back buttons located on the left side of the mouse.

It become such an issue that I permanently removed the buttons (see photo).My second issue is with the sides of the mouse being so slick that the mouse was darn near impossible to hold onto if you picked it off the surface for any reason. I constantly found myself picking up the mouse, only for it to drop 2 inches back to the desktop.I actually had to add a small strip of traction tape to either side of the mouse (see photo) to alleviate this nuisance.Other than those couple of minor issues, this setup is very nicely made and easy to use.

{"reviewTitle":"For a budget price a good keyboard that both a general purpose or office and gamers  should like.","reviewDescription":"NPET K10 Backlit Gaming Keyboard, Black, Purchased 10\/22, Reviewed 10\/22\/2022I purchased the K10 budget membrane faux mechanical keyboard. I was searching for a backup budget keyboard because my main PC keyboard gave up the ghost after 7 years. I needed a backup so I could continue working from home, while I waited for the new replacement keyboard to arrive next week.1st impression: when I grabbed the Amazon package at my front door, I thought, \"Wow, this is a heavy keyboard.\" Opening the package, I was impressed with its mechanical keyboard look, and it looked like a quality keyboard but at a budget price of $20. Of course, as soon as I set the K10 on the desk, I started testing the keypress feedback, noise, and how typing felt. Key travel felt a tiny bit stiff but still good for this price point. Any keying noise was surprisingly low.Plugging in the K10's braided USB cable, the first con is revealed: the cable is too short at 67\" long, another 6 to 12 inches would be better. The board's RGB lights lit up, and my Windows 10 Pro PC had no issues with the new K10. The next thing I noticed, which is not necessarily a negative, is that the keys are smaller than typical full-sized keyboard keys.\u00a0 [Update \"edit\" 4\/12\/23: I later compared my full size keyboard and the new replacement keyboard I had ordered, and the keypad surface area is the same. (What was different was the K10's top surface has a slightly deeper concave indentation, so the feel is slightly different.)] I am a touch typist capable of 60+wpm so the size of the keypad felt a little off; however, with use, it would feel fine. With nearly 40 years of using and owning many computers and their keyboards, touch typing resulted in some initial missed direct keypad hits, but adjusting was easy. One additional observation: right after startup, a distinct odor was coming from the board, sort of an electrical and plastic overheating smell (note, I had the RGB lights off). After about 20 minutes, it faded, and I haven't noticed it since.\u00a0 [edit 4\/12\/23 I have been using nearly 5 months most days on my Hosting Music pc and no issues at all.]What does a touch typist think of the key typing on the K10?\u2022 Sore fingers. My fingers were tired after 1 hour, and after 2 hours, they were sore. The problem is how I type, pushing down slightly harder than the average typist, who maybe learned to type on a mushy membrane keyboard. I learned on IBM Selectrics, which required a slightly heavier key press. The keystroke travel is higher or longer on the floating keys of the K10 than on most keyboards at 3.6mm, so I have to push further down for it to bottom out the key travel, and if I am typing hard and fast, my fingers are sore. I tested where the action point in the key travel seemed to be; it's either halfway or slightly higher. So if I type with a lighter keystroke and try to avoid the key bottoming out, there should be less soreness. A lighter touch is possible, and the keys feel good as you type along and shouldn't cause sore fingers. I would like the stroke to be a little softer or less stiff. [edit 4\/12\/23\u00a0 \u00a0After some practice, I haven't had any soreness issues.]\u2022 \"Noise,\" a comment about YouTube reviewers Any YT review doing their keyboard review on a wooden desk or a hard desk surface with no large mouse pad that cushions and accommodates both the keyboard and mouse is only testing the keyboard's resonance with the hard desk, and that is likely 2x or 3x louder than typing with a keyboard on a desk size keyboard - mouse pad. Typing noise on the K10 sitting on a 32\" x 12\" x 2-3mm thick pad was very low.\u2022No movement, the K10 on my full-size keyboard\/mouse pad does not slide or move at all. The K10's weight and three rubber grip pads on the front bottom of the chassis, plus the two pull-out feet, securely hold the board with no movement.\u2022 Key wobble was not noticeable, very slight on the space bar.\u2022 RGB lights, are not my thing, but if there was an RGB selection that lit only the key letters and numbers, that would be ideal. However, it's not an option.I have about 27 days to decide if I should keep the K10 or return it to Amazon. I'm pretty sure it's a keeper.[Update: 4\/12\/23, I kept the K10 and use it almost daily. For the price and for my type of usage, I would recommend the K10. Would it be a good gaming keyboard? I do play games, I tried it for one game, and it was fine, I have never owned an expensive gaming board or typed on one, so I cannot compare. ]","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"55 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666483200000}

I do however enjoy how tactile it does feel... typing feels quite nice with this keyboard, and it has a nice sound too. The space bar is the loudest key on it, but I don't mind. The light modes was a little weird to figure out at first. So to cycle through the different colors, just press the LED button. You can also make it fade in and out by pressing FN and LED. You can change the brightness with FN and Pg up\/Pg down. One downside to the keyboard is it doesn't have a wrist rest, so if you don't have one already, it might get uncomfortable. I also noticed, if you take off some of the keys, you can see some overspray from the painting (though it only really affects the keyboard cosmetically). Overall, I'd say that this is a pretty good gaming keyboard for the price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1609891200000}

The way it's set up is you get a selection of I think three rainbow color patterns, and you can make them pulse slowly if that's what you want. Or have steady and then able to dim up and down.

The braided USB cord is flexible enough to be routed around easily, hard-wired to the keyboard so you won't lose it, standard connector and no drivers needed. Thin profile with some rubber feet that try to keep the keyboard from shifting, depends on what surface you place it on. The LEDs are a nice touch, but definitely not fully utilized. There are 3 built-in color schemes , several brightness levels and a \"breathing\" mode that fades in and out. It's too bad there isn't more to it than that, or at least the option for a solid color across the keyboard.Note, the LED control key takes the place of scroll-lock, scroll-lock has been remapped to FN+F11.It's a good cheap keyboard if you're looking for something you don't mind getting banged around.

I've had this keyboard for about half a year and have had no issues with it. I am starting to see a tiny amount of wear on my D and F keys which makes some light peak through around the edges of the top surface of the keys.

I communicated with the company through the amazon message system and they promptly sent me a couple replacement pads. I guess quality control left a little something to be desired, but customer service was great. Just be prepared to wait a little while as I'm pretty sure it came from China. (Probably took a week or so, so not too bad).Concerning the feel of the keyboard, I personally think it's great. It's sort of an in between a mechanical keyboard and a membrane keyboard. Hard core gamers might just snub their noses at this keyboard but honestly it's been my favorite feeling keyboard (compared to the keyboards that usually come included with a mass produced computer). I remember reading some reviews that complained about the comfort of the keyboard but it's been great for my average sized man hands. The keys do tend to feel taller than an average keyboard so if they feel too tall, I would recommend one of those gel keyboard pad dealies to raise your hands up a bit.Anywho, overall I'm very satisfied with the product and customer service over at NPET.

I WONDER WHY?Let's talk about the actual keyboard that I purchased for ~$17.00 on August 25, 2018. The date today is October 13, 2018 and already the ENTER Key and the Left SHIFT Key have failed. Meaning, pressing those keys will NOT preform a desired action, ever. It was a gradual but quick failure ( 2 days). Ohh, It's a pretty looking Keyboard but underneath the skin it's full of nasty surprises.The last time I checked, the entire premise of buying a KEYboard is when you press a KEY, it will preform a action. That is its primary function. Really, other than slight ergonomics and how they (KEYS) 'feel', NOTHING else really matters!In the matter of less than Two Months, 2 of the most essential keys required have already failed!I am not the first or last person to complain about this.

Only chargeI've been using this keyboard for about a month now and I have to say I was very surprised at how much I actually like this. I was looking for a wireless keyboard that didn't include a mouse since I already have so many mouse and I didn't want another one. I came across this keyboard and it appeared to be the best for the price. I really like the way it feels when you type. There's a good amount of feedback but it doesn't have that super \"clicky\" sound that Cherry MX Blue keyboards do. Though there is a softer tactile sound which I like.In terms of RGB, there's a few presets on the keyboard but there's no software to customize them. You can choose different led presets by pressing the LED button on top of the \"Home\" button (see pics). Also try pressing \"FN\" + \"LED\" buttons and the keyboard will add a  cool breathing theme to the lights. You can turn the brightness of the lights up or down by pressing \"FN\"+\"Pg Up\"\/\"Pg Dn\". There's only three levels of brightness though. You have the option to turn off the RGB all together if that isn't your thing by pressing the \"LED\" button a few times which is what I usually do. If you really like RGB there's other keyboards out there that are better if you are willing to pay more.I also really like the fact that the battery is rechargeable via any USBC cable. They provide a USB A to USBC cable in the box which you can use to connect to a charger. The charge from what I can tell lasts a long time. I've never had to charge it after a month.They missed a great opportunity here where they could have made the keyboard work both wired and wireless but they only made it work wirelessly. I think this was a missed opportunity because it would have been beneficial to gamers who care about response times and also the reason why I'm taking off a star.Also to linux users that are wondering, this did work for me wirelessly on Pop OS without having to do any kind of driver installations so it should work fine for any Ubuntu based distros. I can't confirm for other distros but I would think it should work fine.All in  all this is a very good keyboard. I would recommend it to professionals trying to get their work done.

My U key starting sticking immediately, but it was off and on and I don't use that key a crazy amount so I didn't worry about it. But now I have only had this since keyboard since September and it's already crapping the bed. Multiple keys are not working and it randomly flashes on and off (fully charged). As long as you're keeping in mind that you're getting a $30 keyboard then you're definitely getting what you pay for.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1654041600000}

{"reviewTitle":"good keyboard to upgrade from a cheaper one","reviewDescription":"The keyboard is great, Nice looking and all the keys sound good except the spacebar. It sounds metallic, unlike the rest of the keyboard. The reason for the 4 stars is because of the LED's and the lack of functions. all you get is a breathing affect and you can change the light color but not position. would be nice to have some different functions and affects, Lke having the colors wave over the keyboard from either side or rotate around it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1674172800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great for its price","reviewDescription":"I've had this keyboard for a year and it's still functioning perfectly. There is some noticeable wear on the paint in frequently used areas. The keyboard is relatively quiet but also sounds nice.After a lot of use, the paint will wear. I have used this daily - for several hours at a time - for a year. I've attached an image that shows the scratches in the paint. I have never spilled anything on it. You can use that as a measure of the paint's quality.Overall, this keyboard is extremely good for its price. Although the cosmetic aspects of the keyboard aren't the best, its functionality is great. Despite the cheap paint, the keyboard feels high quality when typing on it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661126400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Nice, but... (updated)","reviewDescription":"Just got it today.  The keyboard has a really nice feel. The backlight is nice - just the right brightness, and has an \"off\" feature. There's a separate key on the board for that. Price is good for what I got.  But.....  there's a problem with the \"k\" key. Any key I press on the keyboard adds an extra \"k\", so .com becomes .comk. I've emailed the company. The phone number (in China) they list was busy every time I tried it. I also contacted Amazon and they'll take this one back and issue a refund. I'll order another. I'll update when I have the replacement.Update. I returned the defective keyboard and purchased a new one. The new one arrived quickly and (so far) appears to be working perfectly. The company also contacted me about sending me a replacement. Great customer service! As for the keyboard itself, it has much better tactile feel than what I'm used to. Keys feel solid and the lighting is a nice touch. I'm not a touch typist, so I don't know how well this would hold up under heavy use, but it should work well for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1597449600000}

{"reviewTitle":"packaging wasn't great","reviewDescription":"Overall I think the keyboard is really nice BUT the packaging it came in would be the worst part. I was expecting it to actually come in a seperate box but instead they just put a label on the keyboard box. I'm not sure what happened but the box was dented on the sides and nothing much happened to it but there wasnt any protection around which worried me most.As for the keyboard, I think the typing sounds nice and its like a regular mechanical keyboard. The key caps are a bit wobbly especially the space bar but it doesn't really affect the typing sound (except for the space bar, you can hear it in the video I included). For gaming, I think its good, theres not much wrong with the keyboard that would make it hard to play with or anything like that but then again, I just started using it today so if anything goes wrong I will. update the reveiw.  For $20 its a pretty good keyboard considering the other keyboards with the same functions as this are around $30-50 average so I think its definitely worth it if you are thinking about buying it.

{"reviewTitle":"A nice little keyboard","reviewDescription":"I originally gave a 2-star rating stating it was slowing down the activation of my mouse and keyboard when i brought my system out of sleep.  The number and caps indicator lights weren't working. Turns out it was my new 4K monitor refresh rate.  For that, I apologize and have modified my rating and comments accordingly.This is a nice inexpensive backlit keyboard. I like the feel and action of the keys, and it takes up a small footprint on my limited desktop.  My only gripe is that the lighting is very dim at the top of the keyboard where the function keys reside. Especially on the left quadrant (ESC F1 through F4).

{"reviewTitle":"Great value but exactly what you pay for","reviewDescription":"I really like this keyboard, I really do. It does exactly what i need: responsive buttons, built in short cuts that i did not have in the past and it lights up. All around it does the job i need it for and it does it well. I have it hooked up to a KVM switch so i can seamlessly switch devices. so I use this keyboard on my work laptop, my gaming PC, my personal laptop, and probably my game console if i feel like plugging it in. It works great and I am actually very comfortable with using this keyboard for an assortment of tasks.My gripes are with where the manufacturer cut corners to keep the price where it is. the keys are all transparent keys that are colored to be black, which is fine but tiny dots of the black have faded off and i have had this keyboard for 3 months. the keys at the edge that touches the board when you press down, those are sharp to touch. granted not many people will touch those but i like feeling around and for a person with sensitive or soft skin,they could probably cut them selves.All in all, give this keyboard a chance, but keep certain things in mind.

Two things: the first time I ordered it, one key was broken, and I had to send it back for a replacement. Not sure if anyone else had this issue, but it may be indicative of broader quality control issues. The second thing is that turning off the keyboard disco required me to look here, in the reviews, as the method for turning off the lights (or changing them) was *NOT* what the instruction manual said.

{"reviewTitle":"It's fine.","reviewDescription":"I've not had any major issues with it.I've had the keyboard for 16 months.  I'm an enterprise software developer - so while i use the keyboard every day, i'm not straight up typing all day long.The key caps are cheap and mine have started to deteriorate.  This is not an issue of functionality, though - the black paint is wearing off, exposing the translucent material of the caps such that more light is let through, and you can no longer read the letter.  The space bar now has a huge blob that lets light through.Recently i've seen an issue where Windows seems to think the Windows key is constantly pressed, and i have never encountered this using any other keyboard.  Even with the ability on this keyboard to lock out the Win key, it continues to happen.  I've turned off sticky keys and all of the related nonsense in Windows, but the issue randomly continues to happen.  Unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in doesn't correct the problem - only a full reset will fix it.  It's certainly possible that this is not the fault of the keyboard, but as i've never once seen this in the past 30 years i've used windows, i thought i should mention it.My only other gripe is that i find the colors a bit annoying.  I wish there was just a regular white backlight option.  For the first few months of use, i just had the lights off.  But the key caps are very shiny, and although i'm certainly able to type without looking at the keyboard for 95% of the time, there are still a few symbols and F keys i need to look at.  The shininess means that there's enough glare to make the keys unreadable.So overall, it's fine.  It's better than the $10 keyboards i've used most of my life.  It's easy to clean, feels fine to type on all day, and hasn't completely disintegrated over the past year.  Given the price, it's hard to argue with it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1629072000000}
