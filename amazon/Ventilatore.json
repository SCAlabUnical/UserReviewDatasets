{"reviewTitle":"It's just ok","reviewDescription":"I had a small fan sitting on a bench to help me stay cool sleeping.  It worked great.  I bought this one thinking it would cover more area since it's bigger and osculates, and it would look better.  It does look better.  I like the remote and the noise level on the sleep setting is almost perfect (but unfortunately to get the noise just right - there's not enough air flow).  Even on high - this does not put out as much air as the smaller fan did.  Reading other reviews, maybe I don't have it situated perfectly.  I will try moving it around, but I don't have high hopes.  I threw the box away since I was sure it would be perfect and it came on cardboard recycling day.  If I still had the box, I'd return it (if it had been cheaper it would be worth keeping, putting it somewhere you didn't need as much air, but for the price, I think I could have found something that fit my needs much better).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1721260800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Hope you can see like a bat","reviewDescription":"I like the fact you can insert the remote in the fan while it spins. Not a fan of This Fan.  Solely because you cannot 1. Find the buttons on the remote because there's no Brail.  Just a flat picee of plastic . Once the fan powers up. The remote does rework and fan spins properly. It's a challenge then to get to know the fan. Because you can't tell whether the fan is spinning on or off. Because it shuts off and on so the interface of.  The module is itself also has same issue as remote control. The face of the fan has a touch screen. However, when you go to press one of the keys, it's very convoluted in the sense that you do not know which button you are pressing and how hard to press it because the screen itself is black.  So there are no indicators as to what button you're pressing or vibrations. Anything of those matters? All in all, I give this fan. A 3 out of 5 just for the simple fact that.  It works, however, it took me a long time to set it up and was very expensive. But I do not recommend this for anybody unless they have a cat that likes to play mouse ball. This fan is just not worth it because the remote is not programmable. Unless you know you're doing with it and then.  In that sense, you don't need the remote because it's more like a novelty to have something that you can see in the dark. Thank you very much. Needs less options \ud83d\ude0c the programmable remote buttons make this a waste.

{"reviewTitle":"Average at best","reviewDescription":"I had to buy 2 fans since my central air unit went out last week. I read reviews of many fans and this one seemed like a real winner because of all the 5-star reviews. I did see that many gave 5 stars and still had some complaints but overall said the fan was excellent. Well, don't believe the 5-star reviews. This is a 3-star fan at best. Its cooling power is minimal at best, and the air flow is weak, very weak. I have my fan about 8 feet away from the foot of my bed and I barely feel it on the #3 setting. The features are okay but nothing that I will be using, and the remote is what is it is, a remote, nothing fancy. The best thing about this fan is that it was EASY to put together and unlike other tower fans you can actually take this apart and clean it inside and out!

{"reviewTitle":"Overhyped but good for what it is.","reviewDescription":"The good. 4 settings with a remote so you don't need to get up to adjust it. It oscillates if you want it to. The air travels far on the 4th setting. Although people saying it's quiet mean it's quiet on setting 1. It otherwise is louder than a box fan. Takes up a little less space than a box fan although it can't be put into a window like a box fan. It's also 5x or more expensive than a cheap box fan.The bad. The air it pushes out goes to a very slim area which based on the design makes sense. This however means you need to have this pointed perfectly where you want the air to flow. It is also very loud if it's set on higher settings. The stand\/base feels very flimsy. It's held up so far but the \"Locking\" mechanism is non-existent. You turn this thing slightly, and it will come off the base. The gap for the chord to stick out is really bad. Moving this pretty much guarantees it will sit on the chord pinching it with all of its weight.Overall - I wish I didn't buy this one. There were similar models of this on a different website cheaper by up to 20 dollars but honestly I could have lived without this. The box fan I was using did the trick, and cost significantly less. It is what it is though.

It's quiet and the 90 degree oscillation is a plus for rooms where the a\/c doesn't quite reach.  The downside for me is honestly the remote.  The genius that designed the remote was going for that 'sleek' look and made the buttons the same colour as the rest of the remote, so in low light, it's impossible to see the buttons themselves.  You need to memorize the layout of the remote so you don't press the wrong button, which is annoying at times.

{"reviewTitle":"Checks the Boxes","reviewDescription":"I like this. I live in a small home with A\/C and ceiling fans so this fits my needs. It doesn't take up a lot of space, it is pretty quiet, it moves enough air around that I am more comfortable leaving my A\/C on a higher setting, it looks nice, and seems to have good functionality.Could it be a bit stronger? Yeah, I would love at least one higher fan speed. This fan doesn't even get air into my kitchen that is open to the living room (total house is <700 sq ft) but it does makes a difference in the one room that could use a serious ceiling fan upgrade. To be HONEST, if you do not have A\/C and\/or ceiling fans, if you are really depending on a floor fan to keep you cool, then you will be better off with one of those noisy, turbo box fans. You probably won't be happy with this. If you are enhancing existing air temp mgmt then it may be just the bit of extra you need.I also love that they gave consideration to cleaning. I have windows open 3 out of 4 seasons and I can't count the hours I have spent with a toothbrush trying to clean box fans that look horrible. That counts for a lot.Update:Still very pleased with this fan.  It is really saving me AC $s in conjunction with my ceiling fan. And it is almost completely quiet until you get to speed 4 (and not what I would call noisy even then).Also, 90 deg oscillation is a lot in a small room so I tend to leave it off. Get more constant breeze that way. The natural setting option is kind of neat, also, but it\u2019s been so hot this summer I have wanted it full on always.As regards a couple comments I read about the remote:1. Yes there is a storage slot for the remote in back of the unit.2. The remote and\/or the unit sort of go to sleep so don\u2019t be surprised that you have to click a couple times to change fan speed, set timer, etc. It does make it feel a bit clunky but probably saves energy\/battery.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"101 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718668800000}

Power 3 & 4 are a bit louder, but nothing that is going to bother you with the noise. Really enjoy the \"Natural\" setting as it makes for a natural breeze with various air speeds in this setting. The remote is very useful, too. Can store it in the fan itself. The fan also is a breeze to carry around and place it where it's needed most. All and all, this is a wonderful fan for a smaller space to cool down. I liked it so much, that I bought another one in the silver\/black color. Definitely recommend Dreo Nomad Bedroom Fan.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724025600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Of any fan this has best user experience in features","reviewDescription":"The fan blows air well, and it's quiet.  But this thing is truly a pleasing experience to use.  The control features of this are engineered like Steve Jobs might have - give them the features they don't yet know they want. I was surprised by several modes and behaviors of this that I never knew would be helpful on a fan. Some examples- When you turn it on it goes to higher speed for a second and then to whatever level you had it set to before. This lets you know that you actually turned it on successfully when it might not make a sound at a low speed level. The white LED lighted controls automatically turn off after a few seconds.  The remote has a really nice modern, sleep button design and feel.  The remote and sensor are so powerful that the fan can be pointed away from you and it still responds to the remote. You can turn the button press beeps off! And of course it's really quiet and oscillates as designed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723420800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very Nice! Love it!","reviewDescription":"Dreo vs Lasko Tower Fans--Which Should You Buy?Summer is coming, and everyone could use a little more cooling on hot summer days. Gone are the days of box fans or awkward top heavy circular oscillating fans. Today, when people need a little extra air flow, they go for a tower fan with a remote.As you might expect, there is a dizzying array of choices available. In this article, we\u2019ll compare the Lasko 2511 with a new option on the market, the Dreo. 36\u201d tower fan. Both of these fans offer a quality experience, but which should you buy?Air FlowAs you would expect, fan speed, or more specifically, the wind speed of the air leaving the fan, is probably the most important consideration when selecting one. You want something that will move air! Both the Lasko and Dreo tower fans offer multiple speeds to customize your cooling comfort.The Lasko has three speeds, the lowest bing really gentle, with the highest being significant enough to be felt 8 feet away. The Dreo, on the other hand, has four speeds available. 1, 2, and 3 are pretty comparable to the feel of the Lasko. However, speed 4 is noticeably more powerful than what the Lasko offers.It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the Lasko oscillates over a 45\u00b0 spread, while the Dreo has a 90\u00b0 oscillation. So overall, the Dreo is going to move air over a larger area, but ultimately it seems like this difference is going to come down to a matter of preference.NoiseThe noise level of both fans is pretty comparable, with the Dreo being noticeably quieter at lower speeds. From three feet away, at speed 1, the Dreo registers at a whisper quiet 34 dB, while the Lasko is 44 dB. You have to get the Dreo up to speed 3 to hit 44 dB, and at that speed, the Lasko only goes up to 47 dB. Basically ,the Lasko doesn\u2019t add much more noise at the different speeds.The Dreo does have that extra speed 4 that cranks up the noise a bit with the wind speed. At speed 4, the Dreo runs at 48 dB.The Dreo has an extra feature that Lasko is lacking. You can mute the button sounds. This is handy if you want to make adjustments without interrupting the quiet.DesignThe design of these two fans is similar, but also so markedly different that it\u2019s hard not to remark on it.Lasko, as with many of their products, has opted for a functional, utilitarian design that gets the job done. It doesn\u2019t look particularly bad, but it\u2019s not great either. The light indicators let you know what your settings are, but they're just dots of lights next to numbers. In the case of the sleep timer, they even require you to do math to know what the timer is set on. And the numbers you\u2019re looking at are printed on the fan, not backlit. So you\u2019re going to have to turn on the light to check your settings if you\u2019re in a dark room.The Dreo, on the other hand, looks like a work of modern art, with its all black design, and the big LED screen. You won\u2019t have any problem knowing what speed the fan is set to or what the sleep timer is set on. No moving closer to inspect tiny numbers printed on the casing.The design differences carry through to the remotes. The Lasko remote is functional, if unsightly, while the Dreo is beautiful and sleek (and the Dreo remote also comes with a battery; the Lasko doesn\u2019t).Ease of UseTo be honest, any fan is pretty dead simple to use, but some are easier than others.In the case of these two, the Lasko comes with fairly simple instructions: push the power button to turn on, adjust the speed, etc.The Dreo has similarly simple instructions, but also has some additional options (mute, auto mode, natural mode, etc.).Also, the Dreo instructions are delivered in a much more appealing and professionally polished package, which I can\u2019t ignore. Providing an instruction booklet like this sends a message to your customers that you take their experience seriously.One feature of the Dreo that isn\u2019t included in the instructions is the easy to remove and clean back panel. If you\u2019ve ever run a fan for any amount of time, you know that you\u2019ll be dealing with dust buildup. With the one screw panel removal, the Dreo makes that much simpler. The back panel on the Lasko looks like you\u2019ll have to remove six screws, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really designed to remove and clean.ConclusionChoosing from a wide selection of very similar products can be daunting at the best of times. For something like a tower fan, there\u2019s really just not that much to the hardware to differentiate one from the other, but Dreo does manage to bring a more compelling product to the market. With quieter operation, a large and bright LED display, more features, a more appealing design, and a better user experience, the Dreo 36\u201d tower fan really does offer a better product than the Lasko 2511. And you\u2019ll pay $10 more for that difference, as the Lasko only costs 59.99, while the Dreo retails for 69.99. Whether or not the upgrades are worth the extra expense is really up to you, but for a product that will last for years to come, my money is on Dreo.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"1,788 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1648080000000}

I now stay in Southern California where heat is no stranger to those that already reside here, except me, cause I\u2019m not from here. So in order to keep from melting I turn this thing on as a nightly ritual. First, it doesn\u2019t get as cool as the picture would have you to believe it does. I looked at the picture and saw \u201clittle portable AC cold\u201d but really it\u2019s just a cylindrical fan that gets cool enough to remind you of a late night breeze. You can control how intense you want it to be though and it can get a bit strong. It\u2019s fairly easy to use with an oscillation button, a timer of how long you would like it to be on for, and it comes with a remote, which I keep right next to my pillow. There\u2019s even a setting for the air flow or how you want the air to blow out.  From the floor it\u2019s probably slightly taller than a toddler but very light weight,  and easy to move.

{"reviewTitle":"Wonderful Value!!!","reviewDescription":"I purchased three Dyson Tower Fans in 2018 and used them in my bedroom, computer room and front room.  I then purchased a fourth Dyson Tower Fan for use in my dining room\/kitchen in 2022.  I have been extremely happy with the Dyson fans, but this month when one of the fans I bought in 2018 started making a high whining noise, I decided to replace it.  I, of course, being very satisfied with the Dyson fans, checked out the pricing on Amazon and found that the price had increased by over $200 from when I bought them in 2018.I therefore decided to check out other tower fans and was impressed with the Dreco Tower Fan's price, style and customer reviews so I ordered one.  I received it on 7-23-24 and have been VERY impressed with the fan.  It is extremely quiet on the 1 and 2 speeds, and even on 1 provides so much air that I have never had to increase the speed, and that is saying something with the HOT July weather western Washington has faced this year.  Since August is expected to be just as hot, I know I am really going to enjoy this fan.  And perhaps best of all, the price was over $200 less than I would have had to pay for a new Dyson, which for an elderly person on fixed income, is especially appreciated!.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722470400000}

I have seen and used other, similar fans that have cooling capabilities. Nothing like an air conditioner, of course, but just something that gives a little coolness to the air coming through the fan. A nice option on days that are warm but don't call for full AC. If I could, I'd return this & look for another product but I didn't realize it until we assembled it.

On speed 1 it feels like a cool mountain stream across your skin. 3 and 4 are louder but also more than enough to cool down a living room, nearly AC quality. There's a timer and a sleep function (which from what I can tell only turns off the bright LCD display in 2 seconds instead of 5). A slight annoyance is when pressing a button, the first press will only wake up the display. You then need to hit it again to actually perform your action, but I can live with this. I'm very glad I went with Dreo (again)!Update:  Okay, another slight annoyance.

{"reviewTitle":"Great fan, good value!","reviewDescription":"I received my Dreo Tower Fan for the bedroom today, just in time for a spike in our outdoor temperature.  I immediately cooled my room to a very comfortable temperature.  I am very happy with this item for several reasons.  First, it fits into the decorum of my room beautifully.  It doesn\u2019t take up a lot of room; nor does it stand out as an eyesore, as many big, round pedestal fans do.  This is a very slim tower with the fan(s) hidden from plain sight.  It is very quiet, and doesn\u2019t drown out the television.  This is important to me, as I have a small bedroom in a residential care facility.  I have to keep the volume of my TV low so as not to disturb the other residents living here.  The fan immediately started cooling my room, and within a relatively short period of time it had my room at a very comfortable temperature.  The fan has many features that I am sure I will enjoy using such as a sleep feature, a timer, and a variable oscillating function.  Best of all the fan is controlled by a remote.  This is important for me, as I am disabled, and pretty much confined to my bed.  With the remote feature, I won\u2019t have to jump in and out of bed, or call upon my caregiver to help me operate this appliance.  For it\u2019s price, it is well worth every penny.The only negative thing I can say about the fan is there were no detailed instructions included with it.  Having an instruction booklet would have made it easier to learn the use of its many features more efficiently.  I have had to learn by trial and error, which hasn\u2019t been a major issue for me, as it might be for other purchasers of this item.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"83 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718064000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty good fan. Read complete review to understand more","reviewDescription":"Complete review:1. Assembly and Structure - 5starsThe fan is very easy to assemble no tools required, just snap the two base pieces and then snap the tower on the base. The power cord in 60inches(5feet) long. Comes with nice small remote that operates with CR2025 3V battery(included). Easy to carry handle provided at the back top. And also below the handle there is holder for the remote. Touch panel allows to change options on the fan directly with out the remote and the dislay turnsoff after 30seconds automatically.2. Noise - 4starsThis fan is promoted as quieter fan and see lot of reviews even suggesting the same. But i dont agree to that comparing it to my previous tower fan, i feel the noise level is almost the same at high speed. But the noise really wont disturb your sleep unless your very sensitive to noise. Just place the tower fan on the other side of the bed or TV so that noise doesnt disturb.If placing on carpet ensure the base is almost flat, generally tower fans if they are slanted can make noise over the long run.3. Performance and consumption - 5starsAt max speed(4) it really blows plenty of air which you can feel upto 12-14feet, so it might be good for large rooms too.At max speed(4) it probably consumes 42W and it will be little lower at lesser speeds. Use the timer function to turn off automatically that surely saves money.4. Features: 5starsRemembers all the settings except timer when turned off.i) Timer - This is a must have feature commonly found on these tower fans. Can set timer from 1hour to 8hours. Generally i set at night before sleep so that it automatically turns off in the morning. This really helps in saving costs, because some day we can always forget to turnoff due to other distractions.ii) Speeds - there are 4 speed levels(1-4).iii) Rotation - It does make a perfect 90 degree rotation and the movement is smooth and silent.iv) Modes - There are 4 modes. but really sleep & normal modes are generally used.a. Normal - Probably most used mode. Fan runs at constant speed.b. Sleep - Fan speed decreases every 30min and max reduces two speed levels.For level 4: 4 -> 3 -> 2For level 3: 3 -> 2 -> 1For level 2: 2 -> 1 (reduces only one level)For Level 1: 1(no change)Its a nice power saving feature but i felt instead of 30min should have been every 2hours.c. Auto - Its says the fan adapts to the ambient temperature but not sure how its possible in this model since it doesnt have any temperature reader. Some models have temperature reader which may be possible in thosed. Natural - Says fan runs in alternating speeds but really not sure on what basis.v) Remote Volume - A beep sound will be heard on changing optionsvia the touch panel or the remote. We can turnon\/off this beep sound.5. Safety - 5starsThe gap in the grills are very small on all the sides and the rotating wheel is an inch inside, so i feel it should be safe with kids and pets around.The power plug has an inbuild fuse which would protect the fan from against any overload or short-circuit.6. Cleaning - 5starsI believe this is the only tower fan that has the option to open the rear grill and the rotor wheel, so that we can wash it. Previous tower fan i used to use the vaccuum with less success. This is one of the best feature.7. Warranty - 5starsComes with a default 1year warranty and it can be extended to 5 years if we register in dreo website.

On the Dreo's lowest setting, however, I don't hear anything--just a very quiet air whoosh which doesn't bother me. And the air flow of the lowest setting provides enough coolness with the quiet that allows me to fall asleep. The next highest setting is quiet, too.

Another complaint is this thing makes a LOUD beep EVERY single time you plug it in, turn it on, turn it off, etc. Not a brief beep either, but a full second at least. One more thing that is worth mentioning, even if the fan is on speed 1, when you turn it on you will get this blast of full strength for a brief moment before the fans speed down.

I wanted to trust what I saw with reviews for quiet, quality fans. This one seemed like one of the best. Reviews said it was quiet and it worked extremely well. It was priced higher than I wanted to pay, but I hoped it would be worth it for the improved quality and sound.So the verdict for me? It is indeed quiet, in that, the primary air it breathes isn\u2019t loud on the lowest setting. But\u2026the fan does make an annoying high-pitched whiny noise in the background. This is the very thing I hoped it would not have, and now I have paid a lot of money for a fan that is definitely not perfect for me. But, because of all that money, I don\u2019t watch to ditch this fan just yet. I do feel I will be back at the drawing board in the near future.On the plus side, the fan does work well and has a nice variety of settings, more than other fans I\u2019ve had, both for mode and speed. It uses a touchscreen-style format that doesn\u2019t shine a light from the display constantly when it is on, which is another thing I like.Bottom line is that, it is an overall good fan, but I might not keep it for more than a year if I cannot get used to the whine.

My room is small so I needed something that took up less space and I didn't hit with my hips on the way out.Great settings, quiet oscillation(EDIT: Semi-quiet - the cheap base creaks as it turns), and overall I like the features it offers. It has a slot in the back that holds your remote, but I find that is pointless if you want to control it from where you are. Good for storage when away, though.There are some cons, though, that I noticed right out of the box:Cheap base: It's easy to tumble this thing if you hit it. After assembly I noticed it's a little shaky on the base - definitely not solid, which makes sense since it's plastic. I was carrying my old fan out of my room after setup and hit it - it immediately went down. Thankfully caught it before it could hit the ground, but that's where I noticed the next issue:Damage: Not sure if this happened in the box or some time when I set it on my bed  - I could not find the missing piece anywhere - but there is a hole on the top? Does not look part of manufacturing and the manual doesn't mention it. I'm assuming it's damage from the factory. Bit of a bummer to get a damaged product considering the very first issue I had with this purchase -Shipping: I ordered this two weeks or so ago. It got delayed and eventually just didn't show up, so I requested a refund. Got it, thankfully, and when I ordered it again it arrived just fine. Not sure what the hold up was with the first order . . .just something to note if you order this.

{"reviewTitle":"Not as tall or as good or as versatile as the Black one.","reviewDescription":"I decided to buy this in a different color since i had already bought a black one that I keep in my bedroom. I was thinking this one would be the same height as the Black one but it isn't . Its smaller and has four speeds to it instead of six like the black one has. I was thinking and hoping this would be equal to the black one that I already owned. Anyway it's gets the job done for now and I can get away with having it because i have central air in case it gets humid in the upcoming months.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714694400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not blown away","reviewDescription":"I got this fan after Amazon says this is the best selling quite fan. Well I can tell you the term quite must be subjective because it has an annoying and very noticeable motor\/bearing noise. The noise is most noticeable on the lowest setting aka sleep. When it gets to the high speeds it disappears.Does the fan put off good air absolutely does it feel good yes. I do like the fact that the fan has the ability to turn off the beep ment to wake a deaf person. The screen is easily visible with even one eye half cracked when waking to feed the baby.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713571200000}
