{"reviewTitle":"First impressions, should you buy one, and how to save money","reviewDescription":"OK, I fouled up with my Kindle Paperwhite 11th edition purchase. It was Prime Day and the Kindle was marked WAY DOWN, and I opted for the bundle: Kindle + Charger + fabric cover. Now don't get me wrong, the Charger is nice and the fabric cover is very nice, but for a device Amazon says you only need to charge 5 times a year, getting a premium charger doesn't really make much sense. I already have plenty of chargers, and the Kindle will charge overnight whether I use their super-fast premium charger or something else. And while the case is undeniably nice, you can get one for less than half the money from other sellers on Amazon.I did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still \"suggestions\" on the Home screen that they  consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited \"Free\" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The \"10 weeks\" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My \"Experimental Web Browser\" turned into the \"Web Browser\" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet  Archive), and error messages still mention the \"Experimental\" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4,713 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658534400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Worth it for those who love the experience of reading","reviewDescription":"I touted on for ages how I was a \"true\" reader who wanted a physical book in my hand, the smell of the paper, turning pages, yada yada -- and I do still enjoy all of those factors to physical reading! But after actually experiencing using an e-reader I can say with certainty that I prefer reading with my kindle over a paper book now. Are you reading because you love stories or are you reading because you like the idea of being a reader? There's the key.First and foremost, using my kindle is so much more comfortable in every aspect. I do most of my reading before bed and having the screen backlit with adjustable brightness and warmth is a game changer, and the screen really does view\/read the same as paper. (I tried reading off my tablet before dishing out the money for a kindle and the eye strain is nonexistent compared to a tablet. There's also no screen glare which is something super annoying about reading on a tablet in the sunlight.) That alone makes it a win compared to trying to balance a little clip-on light on my books.I also read a lot of fantasy and romance, and the books just seem to keep getting longer. Hefting around a 500+ page book is annoying. It's heavy to hold and bulky. Trying to hold your page can be irritating, it's nearly impossible to prop up a bigger book and read if you're not using your hands. A kindle changes all of that. It's crazy lightweight and thin. You can prop it on a stand if you're eating. You can carry thousands of books for a tiny fraction of the space and weight of a paper book. Your whole library can be at your disposal at any time, so if you catch yourself bored with what you're reading or finishing your current read, you can instantly start on the next without planning ahead.And there's just the ease of acquiring your books. Did your book end on a cliffhanger and you're ravenous to know what happens next? Two minutes later that baby's downloaded and you're ready to read again. E-books are also typically less money than the physical counterparts. If you use the included kindle unlimited you're even better off. The fact of the matter is I pick up a lot of trashy books that I'm happy don't take up room in my home and that I didn't pay much, if any, for.I think the bonuses of a kindle that I wasn't even expecting are the actual abilities. I never used to notate my physical books. I know a lot of people do, but I have always been someone who wants them to stay in as good a shape as possible, and I also don't need people reading my intimate feelings and thoughts when they want to borrow my copy of something. The kindle allows you to highlight passages, bookmark pages, make notes. Now I have my own system of appreciating books in a way I never allowed myself before, as well as easily finding passages I loved or want to refer to again. There are also dictionary and translation functions if you don't know the context of something, which is such a simple but appreciated feature I didn't know I needed. And of course you can customize font, size, and layout to fit your personal preferences.The kindle is waterproof which will be wonderful for poolside or bathtub reading, as well as just general clumsiness. And while I don't believe the battery is quite as good as they claim, it does last an impressive amount of time, even with regular daily reading. This is especially nice because I like to carry it with me in my purse and have yet to worry about it dying before I want it to.My one complaint and the reason for four stars is I do feel like they're pricey for what they are, and only suggest buying on sale (they happen often enough on amazon it should never be a long wait). The processing system is irritatingly slow sometimes. When you're trying to scroll through the store the lag can be an eye twitch, and every now and then it'll jump multiple pages. You can buy a tablet for the same price if not cheaper and have more function and a faster output. But I really believe if you're an avid reader there's no denying what a kindle offers you compared to a tablet. A kindle is truly meant for reading; I'd buy another if this one went kaput tomorrow. If you're only an occasional reader? You enjoy a best-selling novel here and there but mainly prefer tv or whatever else to fill your downtime? Maybe not worth the money for you! That's your own financial consideration.Last but not least, some tips when you're buying. DO get the version with ads. I don't even know if I'd consider them ads, they only show up when you're not using the device, and they're literally just like a pic of a book and maybe a quote. It's not like an irritating pop up you'd see online. It's totally noninvasive, to the point where I wouldn't even be bothered to try and get rid of them for free... I barely even realize they're there. Also take advantage of the included kindle unlimited! There are a ton of great reads on there if you're willing to look. If you want to cancel after the trial go for it, but it's worth perusing while it's offered. Three months included is a good deal. Honestly I also think it's worth it if you are someone who goes through phases with really specific niche tropes... power through seven mafia romance novels+ for the price of what you'd pay for one, LOL.I know this is a ridiculously long review, but I'm emotionally attached to my kindle in a way I did not expect. It goes everywhere with me and provides me all the convenience and comfort I need as a reader. If you want to go on about the pleasures of paper pages, by all means! But if you're curious about the kindle and why someone would want it, here we are. I used to think part of the romance of reading was the book itself... you never know better 'til you know better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"133 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698883200000}
{"reviewTitle":"a lot nicer than 7th gen...but a bug exists. NEW UPDATE 1\/13\/24","reviewDescription":"PROS: Well, I REALLY like the 11th Gen over my 7th Gen.  I'll do it in 4 points:1-Larger Screen.. Nice2-Color Temp adjustment for the screen.  My background is photography so to me the new screen goes from say 8000 degrees Kelvin to about 2500 degrees Kelvin.  I'm happy around 4700-50003-LONGER battery life.. like 2 months vs 3 weeks4- USB-C!! YES! (my old microUSB was always getting wobbly.I did not mention the increase from \"4\"GB to \"8\"GB..because ..well. in the 7th Gen  the 4GB  is actually 3.1GB  with the rest taken up by the OS  on the new one.. it's actually...wait for it.. 6.25GB! Yep  the OS went from .9GB to 1.75GB!  A bit piggy for me.  I made a joke with a few of the Kindle Tech people that they got ideas from Windows Vista!.  Most got the joke.CONS: Now  onto issues..several which are really for how I use my Kindle:1- ok  the not quite 8GB issue.  Hey  I understand the increase in size..but how about making Audible a CHOICE.. you can add it or make it optional.  If you take away Bluetooth support and Audible..maybe we might gain some space back.  (Personally I use nice plug-in headphones.  I really only see Audible BT when on a long drive in the car..like music.  But then again, you can just put it in a format like MP3 and play it thru the car.  I have the entire Hitchhiker's Guide Radio Broadcasts like that)2- BIG (to me ) BUG  the issue?  as in the photograph.. I use Amazon Cloud Collections.  I organize my ebooks (most I got before I got the kindles)  using Calibre.  So  when I set up series, I use the Series name, or I use the Author, or Subject as a title for the Collections.  sometimes, (as in the case of the Dune series), books are added that happened in-between earlier books that came out.  So when that happens I will add the book. And when you have a series of say 11 books, 9 of which came out years ago, I'll add the book as the following:  01-Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of Dunethen 3 books were added.. Tales of Dune. Paul of Dune, and The Winds of Dune.In my older 7th Gen PW it showed like this:  00-Tales of Dune  01-Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  02.5-the Winds of Dune  03-Children of DuneBUT, As the photograph shows, the new 11th Gen PaperWhite has a bug!  00-Tales of Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  01-Dune  02.5-the Winds of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of DuneThis should REALLY be addressed!3-This is not so much a Kindle PW issue, as so much it's an Amazon issue.  and it deals with the Amazon Cloud Collections.  As I use Calibre, and I have a LOT of books that were originally Epubs, I used Calibre to convert them and organize them into series.  And after various different methods, including sideloading from the computer, I decided to use the Cloud Collections.  So I sent ALL of my converted epubs (now mobi files) to Amazon and used the website to organize them into the collections.  Which went very well ....at first.First..about 2-3 years ago, Amazon removed the ability to send the Collection to Device.  So now I HAVE to use the actual PW to get my Collections onto my Kindle.  Recently, Amazon changed the display format on the pages  on how they show books and doc files. And if you want to add a book or doc to a collection, it's now incredibly tedious! Formally when you did  a box would open that would let you start typing the name of the collection, or make a new collection.  All in one box.  NOW, a box open which shows 2 or 3 collections.. not in any order other than Recent..with a check box!  You can't find the collection by typing the title.. you can only scroll..and it only shows 2 collections at a time.  That's fine if you have 6 collections.. but I have 49 page of 5 COLLECTIONS EACH!!!  PLEASE PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD WAY OR ADD A SEARCH OPTION!!  You've actually found a way that is so much more tedious than the actual Paperwhite!!!!! you can't even make a new one on there.. you have to go back to the collection Tab.. THEN go back to the doc or book tab and start all over!  Please go back to the old way !!!4- the new Library Series option.  It only works for purchased books, not docs.  also, I had to call up because it grouped two books together, in a series..(nice), but then stuck on e of the GRAYED OUT, above the first collection.. only in Download.  I found out I had to do a Reboot after turning Library option off. (I ended up putting the two books in a collection.. like I like.Well  that's about it.  btw  I  ALWAYS use the LIST vs GRID option.. and using HOME is no longer a nice choice.  I prefer when HOME was the same as LIBRARY .. in my case..the first collection, and all the collections after which comes the books in Recent ordernow... waiting for a dark brown cork case.______________________________________Slight update or comment on the software version.  My wife and I both upgraded to the 11th Gen.  Her's came with her case..Amazon Black Leather,  while I wait for the cork.  Her 11th gen came with 5.14.1 1,  while mine came with 5.14.0 .  I was a bit surprised since both were ordered at the same time. And arrived together.  But, not a big issue, since eventually all units will be on the latest software.  So? What to do?  I've read a LOT on here about complaints  it's so hard, I know.Since my \"update\" was grayed out,  I just downloaded the latest version and put it on my 11th gen,  and rebooted..and BINGO!  No problem,  I now have the latest software.Now fix the real BUG I addressed and fix the \"Manage Your Content\" pages regarding using Cloud Collections.  Oh, while you're at it, fix the damn Amazon Android App so I can work with Cloud Collections via the App. And not just my tower.  ThanksUPDATED 1\/13\/2024Well..woth the November 2023 Firmware,  v5.16 5, they FINALLY  got List to work with the Collections!BUT.. with the January 2024 ipdate, v5.16.6,  they updated the system menu...and the SYSTEM FONT SHRUNK!!!!  Making the system menu almost unusable.  PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!!!  If you have to scroll up for the complete menu, fine.  Yes,  it's vetter than multiple sub menus, except due to the font size reduction,  it's incredibly hard for people with vision issues to use.  I know you were working on a way to adjust system fonts, but never completed it.  Please get that working, or just release a 5.16.5.1 with increased  font size for the system menu.PLEASE!!!!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"462 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636502400000}
{"reviewTitle":"I read 58 books this year because of the accessibility opposed to my normal amount of 30","reviewDescription":"As someone who is an obsessive book reader and always wanted the physical books, I wanted to give the kindle a try because I wanted to read in places like floating on a pool raft, the sunshine, at night with no lights on or eating, and because I couldn\u2019t afford the amount of books I wanted to read anymore. And now I don\u2019t think I could go back to physical books if I could afford them. It\u2019s just so easy to hold, the amount of books accessible to read right away and pretty much for free, either through Kindle Unlimited (which has an insane amount of books\u2014at least in my fave genre of Fantasy\/fantasy romance), or your local library through the Libby app (when you borrow an ebook it gets sent to your kindle.) I very rarely have to actually purchase a kindle book and it\u2019s not as expensive as a physical copy. I also barely ever have to charge it when I\u2019m always reading, which is amazing. I love it and it\u2019s one of the best purchases I\u2019ve ever made.I also am obsessed with the way all your notes and highlights can be viewed on your goodreads account, and shared too. I love having mine available for others to read and comment on. Plus even when returning the book (whether KU or Libby) GoodReads keeps the highlights and notes available to you which I was worried wouldn\u2019t be the case but it is.While I love my kindle, I also I have a lot of issues with it too that are very annoying and disappointing to say the least. It makes me wonder if maybe there was a better choice of kindle. I do not like that it\u2019s only in black and white and I know that it\u2019s like that for a reason but the part of that which annoys me is the highlighting colors, I would like to at least have a way I could categorize my highlights if color isn\u2019t an option. I\u2019m a big highlighter\/annotator, I always did that with my physical books too (highlighting, annotations, and color coded tabing). I do it because I read a lot of fantasy series that have important information like theories or worldbuilding, but I also like highlighting\/noting because I\u2019ll just love the emotional reaction it has for me or the quote and want to save that. I would want to be able to label my own categories and organize my highlights\/notes.One of the worst things for me though is the EXTREME lag and no option for emojis when annotating? When you\u2019re typing a note which is something I do A LOT, the amount of time it takes to type it out because of the lag, is unreal it\u2019s like I\u2019m in the year 2000 using my family\u2019s first desktop computer again waiting for a computer game to load for 45 mins lmao. The note taking experience needs to be updated and fixed to be just as quick as it is to type on a phone. It\u2019s about to be 2024, don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t find the technology for this. Even the highlighting without notes is a ridiculous feat.The inability to use emojis REALLY irks me because why not?! I don\u2019t care if they have color or not, I just want them. And If I add the emojis into my goodreads notes through my phone, then I can\u2019t look at my notes and highlights on my kindle, they simply won\u2019t load.Lastly they need X-ray on every ebook, it would be extremely helpful since fantasy books have so many names and places and it can be difficult to keep straight. I get when it\u2019s not on older books but new and popular books have lacked the ability to use it.Regardless of hating those things very intensely, I still find it to be my best purchase in a very long time and I will not be going back.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"34 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700784000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Paperwhite v. iPad Pro reading","reviewDescription":"I've had several iPads, including an iPad Pro, but I find reading in bed and traveling with the 11\" tablet uncomfortable. After staring at a laptop screen for 40 hours a week, my eyes get tired when I try to read for fun. So, I considered getting an iPad mini because my main issue was the tablet's size. Instead, I tried the Paperwhite, and here's what you should know if you're switching from an iPad:What I don't like, which might be a deal-breaker for you:\u2022 Sometimes, the Paperwhite is slow, unlike the seamless experience of an iPad.\u2022 There's an occasional flicker - in dark mode, the screen flashes white; in light mode, it flickers black. It takes some getting used to.\u2022 If you use Libby or Hoopla through your public library, borrowing books is easier on an iPad. With the Paperwhite, you have to borrow books through the Libby app and then send them to the Kindle.What I like, and you might too:\u2022 The black and white screen feels less like a device, and my eyes appreciate it.\u2022 I read faster and enjoy customizing font type, size, and margins.\u2022 It's easy to travel with.\u2022 It's convenient to use in bed, especially if you're lying on your side.\u2022 The battery lasts a long time. You won't be charging it nearly as often as an iPad.The bottom line: The Paperwhite isn't as fancy as an iPad, but for the price, it's great for what it's designed for: reading without distractions. In a world full of notifications, it's nice to escape into a book on a device where no one can interrupt you.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707523200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good product occasionally marred by deliberate design","reviewDescription":"I like libraries. Do you like libraries? If you do, you too may find yourself wishing that your Kindle Paperwhite played more nicely with library e-book loans.My intense distrust of Amazon's tendencies with digital purchases led me to the Barnes and Noble Nook many moons ago. Why? At the time, I knew that I could get epub and pdf files to open easily on the Nook. If I were to purchase a digital publication from anywhere else - I happen to buy a lot of book bundles from Humble Bundle, for example - I could easily read them with my Nook. Additionally, out of the box Nook supported the library apps like Overdrive, Libby, and Hoopla. In short, the Nook didn't close to door to other sources of ebooks like the Kindle did.Of course, in the ensuing decade Amazon's Kindle came to dominate the market and the Nook nearly destroyed Barnes and Noble. After several years of adding a Kindle to my shopping cart and then refusing to buy it, I finally caved and got one during this year's Cyber Monday deals.Of course, you still can't use Hoopla books on your Kindle. However, you can connect your Kindle to your Libby app on phones and push loans over. It's not as smooth as one might like, but when the alternative is the incredibly flawed Nook GlowLight you'll take the small victories. Getting epub files on a Kindle is still an arduous process - especially if you're not particularly tech savvy - but at least Kindles now allow for said transfer of files and supports reading them.Do I love my Kindle? Yes and no. It's an impressive product, and I don't mind the ad-supported rest screen - because Amazon has so much data on me, it's quite good at recommending books I might like. The battery life is excellent, and the device itself is quite durable - a huge plus for a klutz like me. The touch screen is very 'meh', with a tendency to hitch just long enough at times to make changing pages a disjointed affair. But the biggest knock against this product will always be how reluctant Amazon is to let you read book purchases or loans from other sources. They want you to exclusively use their store and subscribe to Kindle Unlimited, and it's clear they've begrudgingly added these other methods for accessing e-books so as to quell complaints from folks like me.If they really wanted this to be a top flight, best-of-all-time product, they'd support Hoopla. They'd add on screen, easy-to-use tools for importing a wider range of file types onto the device. They won't, of course, but hey a fella can hope.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703116800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Wonderful way to read your books.","reviewDescription":"I really like the battery life on this product. I bought myself one a few months ago and I ended up buying one for my husband. The newer Kindle Paperwhite has a slightly larger screen and the screens load faster. The older one sort of looked glitchy when you turned the page or attempted to use the internet. This one is much more practical in size and functionality. I enjoy reading my books on Kindle because I can buy them with one-click on the store and then read them anywhere without WI-FI (Internet) connection. It also shows the percentage of the book you\u2019ve read and an estimated time it will take you to finish the book. I do not like how it is difficult to tell what page you are on. It will give locations by a random number or page number based on the font and formats you select. It would be nice to have the option to switch to the publisher\u2019s formats to have the same page numbers so I could tell a friend exactly where I am in the book, if they have a tangible copy. There is, however, no need to bookmark anything. It saves the progress and when you open the book later, the page will be right there for you. I love that I can buy a book on Kindle and share my library with another Kindle user so they can read it at the same time for no extra cost! It is a great option for those traveling, riding transit, or those who read at night because the screen gives off just enough light to read everything comfortably. In the last few months I\u2019ve probably charged it a couple of times. The battery life is phenomenal, especially when you turn off WIFI and set the screen light below 7-8. I am trying to purchase many of my books on Kindle, but I still purchase some in paperback. I feel like no matter how much you like Kindle, you\u2019ll always still turn to a paperback occasionally. Still yet, I highly recommend Kindle! You can\u2019t get this kind of battery life out of an IPad. You really can\u2019t beat the price either.

{"reviewTitle":"Mostly good compared to previous model.","reviewDescription":"The warm light feature & the ability to have white text on a black background are both great. The waterproofing hasn't been needed yet, so I can't speak to that. Battery life is excellent. For anyone who thinks they didn't get a cable, it's under & inside the little cardboard \"block\" in the packaging. The adapter is not included, but, for me, that isn't an issue because I have too many of those around already. The smaller bevel that allows for a bigger viewing surface is nice. I was afraid I'd accidentally advance pages when holding it, but that hasn't happened very often. The power button is still on the bottom but I've never inadvertently turned it off like some reviewers have reported. I'm not sure, but I may have used the Bluetooth feature when I set it up using the phone app. If so, the Bluetooth works, but beyond that I'm not sure. Being able to listen to Audible audiobooks is a good feature too. Unlike on the phone app, you do have to choose between the audiobook or the e-book.You can't do both at once.The one thing I don't like is that there's an annoying glare when sitting indoors with a light behind you. I tried holding it at all different angles but it persisted. I now compensate by brightening the light on the e-reader, but then it's not as comfortable to read. It's not always possible to turn off the light or move, especially when there are others in the room.Lastly, a suggestion. I'd like to see a white noise feature\/track incorporated into the device. Something that can be streamed over headphones at the same time I'm reading. I was able to do this on my Kindle Keyboard via wired headphones because it let you add the track yourself. It often came in handy in noisy places & was easier than having to use a different device.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706486400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nice device, but some drawbacks.","reviewDescription":"I love ereaders. I use both a kobo and now a this kindle. The reason I got the kindle paperwhite 11 was so I could listen to audiobooks at work. I can't have a device with a camera in it so I needed the kindle for 'only from audible' books since I can't use my library or other device for them (as a librarian, don't get me started on why I despise 'only from audible'). Now, audible plus comes with the subscription so I can get these books, but you can't listen to audible plus books on the kindle which, in my opinion, is a waste.

{"reviewTitle":"Bring back page turn buttons","reviewDescription":"My first Kindle was a second gen with they keyboard.  I am not new to Kindle.  I've owned several at this point.  The last one(s) I bought were Kindle Voyage versions.  Both of which I actually bought as refurbs.  One last me me 6 years.  The other I've only had for a year or so.  Unfortunately both are starting to have issues.  I've replaced the battery in one, which was a bit of a pain but doable.  Since both are probably not going to last much longer I decided to suck it up and look at a new one.I'll be honest, the PW doesn't impress me.  At all.Cons:1.  It's bigger than my Voyage.  It doesn't seem like it should make much of a difference, but it does.2.  It's also heavier.3.  Unfortunately I hate the touch screen as much as I thought I would.  If I want to advance a page, I don't want to only have to hit the right side of the screen.  If both my hands aren't free, or I have it positioned a certain way, then I either can't forward the page or I have to reach over it for every page turn.  If we have to do a touch screen (BRING BACK REAL BUTTONS AMAZON!!!  NOT THAT OASIS BS BUT AT THE VERY LEAST THE PAGE TURNS LIKE THE VOYAGE HAS), then why can't it be set up like the voyage and have the top half of the screen go backwards and the bottom go forward?  At least then you could touch it on either side to move it forward.  I'd actually give it another star for this.4.  Because it's a touch screen and you HAVE to touch it to do ANYTHING, there's fingerprints.  So many fingerprints.  I'm going to have to wipe the screen off constantly just to make it readable.5. The power button on the bottom is annoying.  Why not put it back on the back like the Voyage (And other models before it)?  It's so easy to hit there.6.  Why is it when I hit the power button it has to boot up THEN I have to swipe it to bring it up?  So many steps.  Stop making the Kindle something it isn't.  I only want an Ereader.  That's it.  I don't need another tablet, phone or other electronic device. (Scribe anyone?)Pros\/draw?The text is crisp.  Not sure that it's any better than what I have already.They have finally decided to charge with USB-C.  It's about time.In the end the special features the PW comes with: waterproof, warm light, etc don't mean anything to me.  TBH had they not been so close in price thanks to the holiday sale, I'd have bought the Kindle basic instead.  The Oasis has so many complaints about the battery life, and frankly the idiotic buttons are a total run off, that I don't want to go there.  I plan on finishing the book I started on the PW, then I plan to send it back.  I'll have to limp my Voyage thru a little longer I guess.  And hope like hell Amazon will come out with a Kindle that has basic buttons again.  Sadly there are many of us out there who keep asking for buttons but Amazon continues to ignore us.  I guess if there isn't a viable option when the Voyage died, I'll have to look into a different reader in general.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672444800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very annoying and aggravating","reviewDescription":"Purchased this new Kindle Paperwhite as I had a previous Kindle that was well over a decade old.  While this new Kindle had some nice features, it did NOT have some that my previous Kindle had, which made it very aggravating.  For example, when viewing your library, you have the choice of viewing in grid mode (ie, the b\/w covers of the books), list mode (miniature cover with title), or the collections you have created.  OK, fine.  But when you create collections, you are not given a choice and the only view available is grid mode.  Many titles are difficult to read in b\/w.  Also, when assigning items into your collections, you have to go through the FULL list of titles -- even those that have been previously assigned to another collection.  There is no way to delete old, outdated, expired subscriptions to previous periodicals (even from your online account), so EACH ISSUE shows up as a separate item in your list.  The screen is super-sensitive (thank you for ordering that -- and that -- and that), except when you are trying to manipulate the scroll bar \/ arrows.  Then you have to tap the screen in PRECISELY the correct location, or it won't respond at all.  Seriously -- I would really rather have my old Kindle back.  Though it was one of the first generations of Kindle, it was so much better and had a number of features that this 11th generation Kindle is sadly lacking.  Why would Amazon go BACKWARDS and ELIMINATE handy, useful features?  I was so aggravated and annoyed with this device, that I sent it back the day after I received it.  By far the most annoying and aggravating product I have ever purchased.Amazon claims that the battery lasts 10 weeks.  I received my device with 54% charge and burned through more than 5% of the charge in little over an hour of use.  Not sure how that works out to having it last for 10 weeks.Oh, and by the way -- the stupid thing does NOT turn off.  It goes into \"sleep\" mode, where the slightest touch wakes it up.  And ads keep popping up while it is \"sleeping\" as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693008000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Kindle device vs. Kindle app","reviewDescription":"I've been reading on the Kindle app on an Android tablet for years, so the majority of my opinion is in regards to how the Paperwhite device compares to using the app. When my latest tablet died, I took the advice of lots of people and bought a Paperwhite, but I'm pretty disappointed. Is it handy for reading? Sure. It's lightweight, you can read outside, it can hold tons of books, the battery lasts a long time, and it integrates easily with my local library. But its deficiencies seem to stand out more than anything else.Lighting: I prefer to read on a black background. Using a black background, I have to turn the brightness up really high to get a decent contrast. There's just not enough difference between the background and the text when the brightness is at a normal level. Reading on the Kindle app on a tablet was much easier on my eyes.Goodreads interface: For the life of me, I can't understand why this interface doesn't work correctly on my device. Others say they have a toggle switch to \"mark as currently reading\" and if it's on, it automatically marks a book as currently reading when you open it. My device has a link I have to click for each book to manually mark it as currently reading. Other people say they have an option at the end of the book to mark as read. I do not have this option at all! I have to go into Goodreads on my phone to mark a book as read. The fact that the Kindle app does this way better is rather disappointing. I would expect the software\/interface on an actual Kindle device to be superior to the app used on other devices. And yes, my Goodreads account is properly linked.Software: In general, I find the software sluggish whether it be turning pages, going to the home screen, scrolling, or changing settings. Scrolling is my biggest pet peeve. In the app, I was able to use my finger on the scroll bar to actually see what page I wanted to land on if I was looking for a particular section. On the Paperwhite, scrolling is so slow that I never end up where I want to be. I have to turn pages individually or else I end up at some random place in the book. Sure, I know I could search for a certain word, but sometimes I'm looking for something more general than a specific word.Overall, I can read on it and it's light enough to drop in my purse to take with me wherever I go, but if I had to make the choice again I'd buy another tablet instead. I don't read outside enough to make screen glare a deciding factor, which is really the only benefit I see to this device over a tablet.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711497600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Home screen illegible, scrolls in jerks, runs slow","reviewDescription":"Comes without an instruction manual - it guides you through the setup, but a proper instruction manual would be nice.The Home Screen is illegible - the font and pictures are far too small, and you have to strain to make anything out.  I have to use my magnifying reader to make anything out on the Home Page.  And guess what - you cannot adjust the font and image size on the Home Screen!  How did they even release a device with such a fundamental design flaw?  Did they only test it with people under 30 years of age?  In fairness, I note that the font size is adjustable for books, otherwise the device would be completely unusable.There is apparently no Amazon-supported way to replace the battery when it inevitably dies - an absolute environmental disaster, because in theory you'll have to landfill a perfectly good device and replace it when the rechargeable battery inevitably fails.  Indeed - Amazon admits that the battery only lasts five years.  One of the main advantages of a device like the Kindle over a reliable paperback is to avoid all of the waste of paper resources.  If you've got to landfill\u00a0the device after only five years, that kind of defeats the object.  I own paperbacks that are fifty years old - they still work as well as the day I bought them, and I do re-read them from time to time.  I would expect a device like this to last at least 20 years and have a replaceable battery.  I do understand that there are third-party solutions to a dead or dying battery, but it's not acceptable that Amazon does not support a de facto life of more than five years.Scrolling is awful - there's a tiny razor-thin scrollbar that is difficult to move.  Pulling down on this or the page causes the page to move in a series of jerks.  Suddenly the page jerks and you have no idea where your place is - you have to relocate the spot that you had reached. It should be able to scroll smoothly and continuously.  Luckily, this is not an issue with reading a book, as that works on \"pages\", which are \"turned\" by swiping sideways - it's quite a good system and is some compensation for the fact that the screen is tiny and you can only see a paragraph or so at a time (I have the font set to large).A further problem is that the touchscreen ignores you about half the time.  And it doesn't respond immediately.  When I press a button, I expect it to respond instantly.  It doesn't, so I press a second time while nothing is happening and then end up then selecting an option that I didn't want with the repeated button push.  Even worse, often when you do touch the screen, it doesn't respond at all, and it requires you to touch a button a second time before it will take any notice of you. So when you push a button, you then have to wait a while (how long?), before you know whether it has registered or not.  When reading and turning pages, about half the time swiping the page turns the page and about half the time nothing happens.The device comes with a charging cord which terminates in a USB plug.  I don't have any USB outputs in my house, so it's useless at home (and I don't have any spare accessible mains sockets into which I can plug an adapter).  I can recommend the charging device (an optional extra), on which you stand the Kindle - it is excellent for home use.Because it came without an instruction manual, it took me a while to figure out that if you want this thing to even remotely resemble reading a book, you have to actually turn the brightness down to zero.The on\/off switch is located on the bottom edge, where naturally you accidentally turn the device as you read, holding it in the natural place - the bottom edge.The Kindle is quite lightweight, so from that point of view it mimics a book quite well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"35 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703030400000}
{"reviewTitle":"So should you buy one of these","reviewDescription":"did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still \"suggestions\" on the Home screen that they consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited \"Free\" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The \"10 weeks\" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My \"Experimental Web Browser\" turned into the \"Web Browser\" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet Archive), and error messages still mention the \"Experimental\" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"88 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691020800000}

It says: \"When reading, you can change the screen orientation by tapping on the Menu button and selecting Portrait or Landscape Mode.\" (Guide p6)  There is no 'menu button'. All there is at the top of my screen are 5 icons starting with \"Aa\" and ending with bookmark and magnifying glass icons. There is no option to select portrait or landscape there.  What you don't know and WHAT THE GUIDE DOES NOT TELL YOU, IS YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE \"Aa\" ICON. This gets you to a dialogue box giving you a choice of \"Themes\", \"Font\", \"Layout\" & \"More\" where you must choose \"Layout\" to reach the screen that gives you that choice.  I never would have chosen \"Aa\" on my own because that looks like what you would press to adjust font size. In fact the graphic and text on p 9 of the Guide in describing the function of the \"Aa\" icon fails to say it's to be used to select \"Portrait\" or \"Landscape\" modes.  USER-UNFRIENDLY, NOT INTUITIVE and perhaps abusive.  Makes me think we consumers are being used by the company to help it write its own product guide. If so, maybe I should be paid.  Even updating my Kindle's firmware from v.5.16.6 to 5.16.7 was a hassle because you have to search to find the correct software to download. This should be straight-forward and easy.  All of these frustrating experiences costs the company time and money because its digital customer service personnel have to spend a lot of time on the phone explaining functionality to customers.

{"reviewTitle":"There are some things I really like about it, and also some things I really dislike about it","reviewDescription":"I got this last year as an upgrade to my Kindle Paperwhite 3.  After having used it for a year, I think I have settled on most of my opinions.  So, here's the breakdown:Pros:++ The screen is larger+ The resolution is sharper++ The warm light option is excellent, and one of its biggest selling points+ The internal software for calculating my reading speed is more accurate and more reliable.  It often glitched out on my Paperwhite 3 and got stuck believing that I read at god-level speeds.  Nothing like this has ever happened on my Paperwhite 5, although it still seems to generally underestimate how long it'll take me to finish a chapter.+ USB-C connection rather than micro-USB: this makes for delghtfully fast charging.+ It can store audiobooks and has bluetooth capabilities.  However, I have yet to take an interest in either of these functions.Cons:- It's actually a little bit LESS responsive than my Paperwhite 3.- The bezel is flush with the screen, which I suppose makes it waterproof, but it also makes the device harder to grip.- The bezel is too narrow for my tastes, since it again makes the device harder to grip without touching the screen.  Though, this issue can be mitigated by increasing the margin size.  The Kindle doesn't do anything with touch inputs that are sufficiently long and don't touch any words, so you can safely rest your thumb on the margins while you're reading.-- It takes significantly longer to wake up than my Paperwhite 3.  Part of that is because my Paperwhite 5 has ads on the lock screen, meaning I have to always swipe to unlock, which I don't have to do with my Paperwhite 3.  But even with this under consideration, when it's my first time turning the device on after a while, it usually takes around 1-3 seconds to prompt me to swipe to unlock, and another 1-2 seconds for it to actually load up my reading spot again.  It's especially bad when the Kindle is cool, e.g. under 60 degrees.  But my Paperwhite 3 was also a lot slower in cold air too, so this isn't too big of a gripe.-- I'm pretty sure the screen bleeding is worse in this model than for the Paperwhite 3.  Stray artifacts will sometimes stick around even after the screen refreshes, leaving traces of the previous screen state lingering on the device.  I've attached a photo to show you what I'm talking about.  In it, my Kindle is set to sleep mode, but you can see the words in the current book that I'm reading.  The Paperwhite 3 does this a bit too, but nowhere near as badly, and the screen refreshes are always successful.  This is a somewhat minor inconvenience, but it is a distraction sometimes.Overall, I'm not entirely sure if I can even call this an upgrade to the Paperwhite 3.  It has a lot of extra features that I love, and I guess at the end of the day, it's this model that I'm reading now and not my old Paperwhite 3.  But when I look back at my old Paperwhite 3, and consider the fact that it still works perfectly fine, I can't help but feel like I really didn't need this upgrade.So, if you're looking to pick up a new Kindle Paperwhite ... yeah, get the NEW Kindle Paperwhite.  The USB C charger, the larger screen, and the warm light are all major conveniences that make using the device a lot more enjoyable.  But if you are in the position I was in back in 2022, and you want to upgrade the Paperwhite that you already have, then save yourself the money and skip this.  You're not getting that much more, and you'll probably be trading off some features that you like in the process.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"120 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679616000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Know a book shouldn't be judged by its cover but I'd rather kindle not skip past it automatically","reviewDescription":"I'm one of those folks that prefers a book to open to the front cover upon first reading instead of the opening chapter. Feels more like a book that way to me and lets you appreciate the cover art, acknowledgements, etc.  It seems kindle wants you to skip that part which is kinda presumptuous.  I know you can always flip back to the beginning after a few clicks but it's kinda a pain to start every book out that way.  Yes, I know some folks prefer it the other way and don't see this as an issue, but that's why an interface option in the settings menu would have made more sense.Touch screen seems a bit insensitive and built in light tends to run to the dim side for me, despite adjustments through the settings menu.Book purchases directly by the kindle seem a bit problematic so far but perhaps it's a temporary issue. Web based purchase seemed to work ok even when kindle based purchases failed.Made the move from nook to kindle and honestly prefer the nook at this point except for the occasional reboot I'm forced to make and the slightly limited B&N library.  Hopefully my impression improves.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710892800000}

It was so useful for reading all of my preferred books without having to have a place to store them all!

However, just after the warranty expired, the screen froze and we have researched and done every step possible to attempt to salvage it but it is stuck no the screensaver permanently. This is unfortunate, because I ended up having to cancel my kindle unlimited membership and will continue to just borrow books from libraries rather than pay for another device to just go out after a year.

Everything about the device is optimized with that goal in mind. The user reading experience is not what they optimize for. Every time I pick up the device and I see their ads, I want to put it back down as this is a huge turn off.I just figured out how to pay Amazon 20$ so it would stop showing me those ads.

{"reviewTitle":"Purchase at your own risk","reviewDescription":"I am an avid reader, with over 1000 books on my kindle. I read for at least an hour a day. I've owned all versions of kindles since they first came out, with the exception of the Oasis, which I purchased and returned due to readability issues. My favorite kindle ever is the Voyage, which I still have - several years old and still working fine. I say all this to give some perspective on this particular kindle.I purchased the new kindle paperwhite in November of 2021, and loved it. It's the most similar to the Voyage that I've found, with the exception of not having actual buttons to push to change the page. The paperwhite is light, has a large screen so page turns  are lessened, easy to hold in your hands, and has rapid and invisible page changes with no delays. The e-ink is deep and dark and easy to read. I'm not a fan of the new software and find it hard to hunt for books in my library, but was willing to put up with it as I really liked the product. For avid readers, the charge does not last for more than ten days in regular mode, but overall I was very pleased with it.Fast forward nine months later... A line across the text started to form when the kindle was on the Lock Screen. I turned it off and on, checked for updates, and continued using it. The line then began to show even on the page I was reading. After an online chat with Amazon customer service, they agreed to exchange it for the refurbished kindle paperwhite. I take issue with this practice of replacing almost new, under warranty, defective merchandise with something that is not brand new, but I asked for new and was told no, I had to take a refurbished item. After receiving the replacement kindle, I noticed the plug in port was difficult to get the plug in, and got gradually worse. I called in CS in November as now the replacement kindle was not charging even when I could get the plug in. I had to speak to three people, explaining the problem each time over the course of an hour. I was told I'd have to pay to ship my kindle in and get a replacement, that I could only get a refurbished item again, etc, etc. I finally, after insisting, got transferred to a supervisor who agreed to make an \"exception\" and send me a new kindle. However, I wouldn't have a warranty on the new one, so if anything didn't work on it, too bad.Why does a loyal customer with a legitimate issue have to waste so many hours to get an in-warranty product replacement, and then have to accept a replacement with no warranty on it? Amazon, get it together. This should be an easy fix from the customer standpoint.In conclusion, I like the paperwhite, but am, with good reason, wary about the longevity of the product. If Amazon can't stand behind their signature e-reader with better customer service than I got, I can't whole heartedly recommend it.Purchase at your own risk.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"156 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670976000000}

The \"Remove this Sample\" button actually works and it's no longer necessary to go into Settings and click through six screens to \"manually\" remove samples.At least once a week I have to hard restart the device because it has frozen or material won't load, a problem I seldom had with earlier Kindles.Reader reviews are important to me in assessing what books to buy and it has become considerably harder in the last few years. The option to search reader reviews by rating has been removed from my Kindle, so it's necessary to scroll through all the available reviews ~ and the scrolling is extremely sluggish ~ to try and get an overview of other readers' opinions.But, only a fraction of a book's reviews is now available on my Kindle. A book may have 60 reviews, but only 10 are shown, which begs the question of what criteria they use to pick the ones they allow you to see.This is not directly related to Kindle, but on the Amazon website I look at the Public Profiles of other readers to see what books they recommend. This has now been hampered by Amazon's new format for displaying the reviews, which compresses them into little boxes and makes it hard to see what's being reviewed. Further, the Public Profile reviews seem to have been limited to about 16, now, no matter how many reviews a particular reader has written. There's no apparent way that I know of to display all a particular reader's reviews.***This is my third Kindle Paperwhite and, unlike the preceding two, it sucks.Screen responsiveness is sluggish. I often have to tap it repeatedly to turn a page or activate an icon.Books don't automatically download when you purchase them anymore. Only the book cover shows up in your library, and you have to tap on that to initiate the full book download. If you fail to do so, and find yourself somewhere without Internet access, you will be unable to download and read your new books.The \u201cRemove this sample\u201d option in the book-cover menu seldom works. In order to delete those samples, you have to go to through six screens in Settings to access Manual Removal in Storage Options. Good luck remembering which sample you wanted to delete by the time you get there.\u201cRemove download\u201d used to remove the item from your device. Now, the book cover remains on your device. Downloaded items have check marks to distinguish them from the downloads you removed, but the book covers remain in either case.

I wasn't worried because I thought newer would be better, but it's anything but. The lack of buttons was a terrible idea as was the flush screen that covers the bezels. The fingerprints that this thing accumulates are horrendous. You can't really hold it without leaving fingerprints around the part of the screen that covers the bezels and the touch controls are finicky. I'll touch the right side of the screen which should trigger a page advance but it often goes in reverse instead. This often causes multiple taps to get what you want, leaving more finger prints. You basically have to bring a cloth with you everywhere you go to wipe them off.The lack of buttons for page turns is a much bigger deal than I anticipated. I really miss the precision of the buttons and the ease of being able to hold the Kindle with one hand, thumb over the advance button. All it took was a bit of pressure to turn the page. I initially looked for a Kindle Keyboard when considering a new purchase, but discovered they had stopped making them. I really wish I had purchased a used one or had seen the Kobo Libra 2, as it also has physical buttons and bezels you can actually touch without leaving fingerprints.My old Kindle is also faster. It starts up and navigates the menus faster than the new one. The new device also occasionally lags. You'll go to turn the page and nothing will happen. You'll tap it again thinking the first tap just didn't register. Maybe you tap it a third or fourth time. Then all of a sudden, it lurches back into action and registers all of the taps launching you forward several more pages than you intended. That may make sense in an app like Lightroom where you may be trying to adjust multiple files at once and have to wait for the device to catch up, but this is a book. You read a page, turn the page, and then take time to read the next page. You never get going fast enough to explain why the device lags so bad.

I currently have 4 e-ink Kindle readers that my family uses (different modes) and we used to use the Fires. I\u2019ve traded in old versions to upgrade.  I read about a book every two days on a Kindle.  I  feel qualified to make an accurate assessment of the usability of them.I got the latest version to take to the beach- I wanted one that was a bit more rectangular (I have the Oasis which is more square), water resistant, and smooth edges so that sand wouldn\u2019t get stuck along the screen edge (ask me how I know that can happen\u2026.)What I like:  it\u2019s relatively light, and it\u2019s bright (no need for a reading light at night).  It\u2019s adjustable light too. Sand did not get stuck in it. Long battery life.What I didn\u2019t like:  the power button placement. With the power button on the bottom, I found how I tend to hold the kindle means I inadvertently turn it off while reading.  My pinking rests right on the button area.  Maybe it\u2019s how I hold it? Maybe I\u2019m weird?  But it\u2019s a flaw.  If the button was on top, this would not be an issue.  The page swipes are too sensitive\u2026. I go turn a page and sometimes it turns like 2 or 3 and I have to turn them back- annoying.  I have to say that due to these annoyances, the Kindle Oasis is still my favorite. Due to the way it\u2019s shaped, it\u2019s easier to hold, and I love the page turning buttons- you can swipe to turn the page if you want to, but the page turning buttons are right there by you thumb where you are holding it, so super easy to turn the page, with out the annoyance of it skipping a couple of pages.  The Oasis won\u2019t accidentally turn off on me too.  I do find that because the oasis is more square, it doesn\u2019t always fit in a typical small purse or bag, where as the paperwhite seems to fit better.  Also, since my Oasis is a few years old now, I have to charge it every day if I heavily read that day.  All in all, I use them both, but prefer my Oasis.  The button on the bottom on the Paperwhite is actually getting to be more of an annoyance the more I use it.

It\u2019s been perfect for travel, reading in low light, carrying your entire library with you anywhere. It\u2019s so lightweight. A single charge can last me more than a week if I\u2019m reading a couple hours a night or 5ish days if I\u2019m reading heavily throughout the day everyday. It also charges extremely fast. The books on there are much cheaper than in store. I also love that you can hold down on a word to get the definition of it.I DO recommend paying to get it without ads so you can avoid embarrassing ones like the one pictured above. I thought maybe the ads would eventually learn the kind of books I like to read but it didn\u2019t and it was just such an eyesore. But tbh I could only last a week with ads on so maybe eventually it would give you better recommendations? But if you do decide to buy with ads and get sick of it later, know that you CAN still pay to remove ads through your Amazon account but it is like $20 which sucks but imo worth it. Now I can just see the cover of the book I\u2019m reading and it\u2019s so much nicer.I bought 16GB but I saw on Reddit later that 8GB can still hold thousands of books so 16 is pretty unnecessary\/excessive, so save your money there.I do recommend getting some kind of case (I bought a clear one so I can still see the Agave green) because it does help with gripping the kindle better.I was hesitant to buy because I didn\u2019t really want to look at yet another screen at the end of the day but it\u2019s very soft on your eyes and you can adjust brightness\/warmth and even have it do that for you automatically based on the time of day.

It is so well designed and intuitive. Excellent. I have spent many an hour engrossed in my Kindle.My only issue, and it is a big issue in my mind is the battery life. I have always read that the battery in a kindle will last weeks, even with heavy usage. I am on my third Kindle and,, trust me, that is not true. For example, I used my Kindle last night and the battery life showed 67 per cent. I keep my wi-fi off and the brightness is on the low side.When I went to use it tonight I had zero battery life on my Kindle. This is not the first time either. I get that problem all the time.Another thing that is annoying is that when you go to recharge it you get a message that you have to dry out your Kindle before you can recharge it. This is false. The Kindle has not been near water and I keep getting that message. I know that it is not true because if I restart the Kindle then all of a sudden there is no problem with moisture.Actually that was two issues I have had with my Kindle.

If you take the adapter plug out of your cart, Amazon takes the Kindle out as well. No Kindle for you, if you don't buy our adapter plug.You know what, Amazon?

{"reviewTitle":"great for travel","reviewDescription":"I used to be a snob about paper being better than digital. But, my husband has a kindle that he loves and uses all the time. I started to want my own for travel and camping trips. It is really handy to be able to bring a LOT of books with you for a long plane ride or something. I also like that it's water resistant. I brought it to the beach a few times and didn't have to worry about splashes getting on it. I have had books get a little damaged on camping trips (cover bent or torn, pages wrinkled from high humidity) but didn't have to worry about that happening to the kindle. It's very lightweight and comfortable to hold with one hand. It's also a great option if you have a small house with limited storage for hoarding a lot of books.I like the way you can adjust the display as necessary: font size, brightness, white\/amber spectrum for reading at night, etc.The screen doesn't have glare when reading outdoors and refreshes quickly when tapped to turn the page.So far the battery life has been amazing! I have had this device since May 2022 and I haven't needed to charge it yet. I keep the Bluetooth and wifi off unless I need to use those functions. That seems to conserve a lot of battery juice. When I first got it, I brought it on a trip, reading for several straight hours on airplanes and then about an hour or two per day for a week long trip, then lots of time reading on planes while traveling back home. Since I have gotten back home, I read for a few hours per week. At the time of writing this review, it is July 7, 2022 and I have now had the device for nearly 2 months. The battery hasn't gotten lower than 70% yet! Your mileage may vary, but I have been very impressed.My only real issue with this device is that is was a bit hard to figure out the navigation at first. There's no instructions in the box, and no tutorial when the setup has been completed. A lot of the navigation functions are hidden unless you tap on a specific area of the screen. As a millennial who is not as tech savvy as some other people my age, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't figure out how to use it. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to learn where to tap to see the different menus! I can imagine someone like my mom or grandma really struggling to figure it out on their own because they are even less tech savvy than me! But once I knew where to tap, getting around the settings and navigating back to my library is not a problem anymore.I haven't tried using Kindle Unlimited or ebooks from my local library yet. But, I do check the \"kindle daily deals\" and sites like BookBub for discounts on ebooks. Generally ebooks are cheaper than paperbacks. So unless you are someone really thrifty who only buys used books, you are probably going SAVE money on books, instead of spending more. And, I just realized if you set up Amazon household so your account is linked with your spouse or parent who lives at the same address, you can then share ebooks between your accounts. After you purchase an ebook, from your Amazon account you can \"add to household library\" and then you can both access the same ebook. Which is great if your spouse or parent is also a book lover!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"33 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657152000000}

It's going to make those decisions independently every single time and when I look back, it is not scheduled for any kind of different light and it's all the way on blue.Another thing is that I always like to see the location in the book, which gives me a percentage of the book that I have read. It reverts back to no progress settings at all every single time in less than 24 hours. It's the most annoying thing in the world. I mean can they not make that persistent?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689811200000}

I waited a while to see if this was normal but a friend said no, so I contacted Amazon support. The woman I spoke to made me go through a series of steps before putting me on hold. When she came back, she told me that they were aware of the problem, that it was some software issue, that I wasn't the only one to experience it, that tech was working on it and that she'd give me a call in about three days to let me know it was fixed. That never happened. I waited and waited. I called back before the time ran out for returning and was asked if I wanted to go through the steps again. I said no, I had been through all of that and wanted to know more information about the content of my prior call. She told me my two options were returning the kindle or replacing it, and did not provide more info on my last call. I chose replacing it. At first, the new kindle was fine, yet still a little glitchy. It seems to have gotten glitchier, with the pages still sometimes acting up and functions freezing as I try to use them.

{"reviewTitle":"I'd give it a better score if it had better battery life...but I can live with it for now.","reviewDescription":"This kindle would be great....but for the disappointing battery life!NEGATIVES:Battery: The battery drains on me after a few night's readings, give or take. Amazon's claim that it lasts \"weeks\" without a charge is pure exaggeration. Even if I keep the wifi off, the bluetooth off and the backlighting as dim as practicable, the battery life still disappoints. It's still better than the battery life of a tablet or iPad, but nothing to write home about.The warm light: I really do not get the point behind this feature. Consequently, I haven't used it much. It doesn't seem to help my eyes at all, one way or another.POSTIVES:Screen responsiveness: The screen is very responsive. I had a 10th gen Paperwhite I wanted to hurl through the window every time I attempted to follow a footnote and it instead caused the page to turn. It actually distinguishes between my desire to look up a footnote or highlight something, rather than turn the page. Kindles take a little getting used to as far as the fact that you have to tap something a little longer or shorter to get a desired reaction (dictionary, footnote, page turn, other...) but it is not the nuisance on this one that it was previously.Waterproof: Oh yeah, it's WATERPROOF! I have yet to deliberately throw it in the bathtub and see what happens, but I like to read in the bath at times and am not keen on electrocuting myself! (Yes, I read in the bath, no judgment please.) Very cool.Screen size: I love the larger screen. It is just large enough that I can set it on a size 5 text without having to turn pages every five seconds. On my smaller 10th generation I had to set it to size 4 text to get the same effect. The text can be resized or the font changed with great ease and speed.Weight: Its weight is just fine, very lightweight despite its larger screen size, even with an off brand cover\/case.VERDICT:I like this Kindle Paperwhite a bit better than the 10th generation I traded in for it.

{"reviewTitle":"Poor ergonomics mar an otherwise decent product","reviewDescription":"This is my second e-ink device, after my B&N Nook. Having used it for about a month, I can state that the ergonomics of the Kindle are a definite letdown from those on the nook. The device has a flat back and very tiny bezels, which makes it difficult to hold anywhere except the bottom. Which is where the power\/lock button is located! As a result, I have on countless occasions now accidentally locked the device just by readjusting my grip. I'm also not a fan of having no physical page turn buttons, since that requires awkwardly reaching over with my thumb, or using my other hand.The backlight is fine, although the warm colour is very yellow, and not orange, which bothers me enough that I keep the light off, choosing instead to use a bedside lamp with the appropriate colour temperature.Page turns have a noticeable flicker, which is a bit bothersome, but turning on page turn animations, while slowing down the actual page turn speeds makes the experience much more pleasant and helped me read faster.The best reason to go with a Kindle instead of other options like the B&N Nook or the Kobo is the availability of Prime Reading, which has offered me a decent collection of books with my Prime membership. I don't buy ebooks with DRMs, so that rules out using the Kindle store. I was able to quickly load up my ebook library of DRM-free ebooks from HumbleBundle and other sources using Calibre.My Nook had a simple option to require a password for any purchases. However, the Kindle doesn't have such an option.

{"reviewTitle":"I always wanted a Paperwhite, I procecessed a return the same day I received it...","reviewDescription":"Quick backstory, I bought a first generation Kindle Fire HD back in 2013 and it was great for a few years until the battery no longer charged and it only worked while plugged in.Fast forward nine years and I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite. I always wanted a Paperwhite, the reviews were always great and it had this simple and clean look to it, so I gave in and bought it. Now, I know that the Kindle Fire and the Paperwhite are two completely different devices, designed for different purposes, and most likely different target audiences, but my god this new device is slow for today's standards!I understand that it is designed to be as simplistic as possible, for the simple purpose of just reading eBooks and nothing else, but come on, it is 2022 (about to be 2023). Kindle is in its 11th generation and the Paperwhite is in its 5th iteration, there's no excuse for it to be this slow. The scrolling in the home page is just horrible, the screen flashes weirdly when scrolling up or down, and the album covers seem to superimpose each other when you switch from one page to the next. You can't do a continuous scroll either, when you swipe up or down it moves one whole page and then you have to lift you finger off the screen to continue to scroll another page, lift finder again, and... you get the idea. The album covers are low resolution, for obvious reasons, and when you move from page to page everything loads up slowly. I know it's not a defect because I did a hard reset and made sure I had the latest firmware, the device was designed this way and it's honestly annoying. It is beyond my comprehension why 10 years after its initial release, the newest Paperwhite has the look and feel of an Apple Lisa II text document from the 1980s.I've always loved reading eBooks, and since my original Kindle Fire HD died I've mainly used the Kindle app on my laptop and the app in a 7-year old Samsung Galaxy S7, which is ironically still faster than the Paperwhite. I know most people love this version of the Kindle, but I just can't let the lack of progress slide, so I went ahead and returned it.

Yes, it is a Kindle.Is this device perfect? Far from it...it's a Kindle. My main beef is the smaller bezel that every tech reviewer seems to go nuts about. I am constantly turning pages on accident because if you even imagine you're holding this thing with your thumb near the edge of the screen, the pages will turn. Amazon should add a feature that creates a user customizable dead zone on the edges so that accidental page turns are a thing of the past. This would rock my world. Or, you know, they could just make the bezels a little wider to make the device easier to handle.Another thing I cannot stand is the placement of the power button. Just resting the end of the device on a table and tilting it up is another to turn it off. This happens all the time. It also happens just holding the device...this power button would be better suited where it was on my older 2015 Paperwhite or, better yet, on top of the device, out of sight, out of mind.I am glad to see the direction they have taken this update. However, the OS is still laggy, the bezels and power button, due to the design, are FAR from optimal. I think they need to hand these out to employees during the design phase to do a LOT more testing before settling on the final design.But, who am I fooling?

Why didn't they make it out of the same plastic as the paper white?  Likely a cheaper price too.  The Kobo has a great screen because they haven't added an extra screen layer to make the face flush with sides.  However, as I started out here, none of them compare with my ancient Voyager which has best screen, lightest to hold etc.  It does not have a great battery life but I pit up with that.  Who designs this stuff I ask myself?  Sure isn't an end user.  Build an Oasis or Scribe in plastic, I buy iit even if screen not quite as good as the Voyager.

I was excited to receive it, but couldn't load the Libby app onto it that I used on my Fire tablet to borrow books. I contacted CS & was told in a fairly snotty way \"tablets & Kindles are very different \". Ok, I know that. He told me I cannot borrow books from my local library to read on the Kindle, so I boxed it up, resigned to returning it and maybe buying a different tablet with better battery life than my Fire tablet has (very sucky, btw). I happened to mention it to a family member and she said the rep was WRONG. Then she proceeded to tell me in under 5 minutes how to borrow books from Libby for this Kindle.  Easy. (In case someone else needs to know: you can borrow the books via your phone; after you borrow, you will be prompted to \"Get the library book\" and will be asked to select WHICH  device you want it sent to. Stupid easy). I'm really disappointed in the epically bad tech support I got from Amazon today. The device is ok. I'm not loving it yet, but I hope I do eventually. Amazon usually has great customer service,  but today they let me down. (I was not sent an opportunity to review my tech support call, so left it here - perhaps Amazon will care & see that support staff are better trained and can help others with a similar problem).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689465600000}

I was originally going to get another one but the Oasis went up $80 from when I got it at first and I wasn\u2019t really interested in paying almost $300 for a new one.First things I noticed a few differences that make me a miss the Oasis.1. The on and off button is on the bottom of this kindle which I\u2019ve come to use my pinkies on the bottom of my kindle to rest on. So I\u2019ve turned this kindles screen off a few times not a huge issue but still annoying.2. This kindle doesn\u2019t change orientation like the Oasis does, this I\u2019m finding to be my least favorite thing. The Oasis you could turn it upside down and it would switch the screen orientation so you could hold it with each hand easily and comfortably using the physical page buttons to switch back or forth. With a cover on this one it can be a bit awkward to hold with my left hand and the page buttons are only on one side so either way you have to click the right side to change to the next page.Is it worth the extra money the Oasis now is ehhh probably not but still feels like a loss.

I have a complaint about this Paperwhite bought in 2022. Because the bezel is smaller than previous versions and flush with the screen, I am CONSTANTLY inadvertently flipping pages. I cannot hold or rest the darn thing in my hand without triggering an unintended page turn. It's really driving me nuts and I don't use it much as result. I think Amazon made a mistake in going for an aesthetic flush look that actually does not work well -- form over function. I find myself scrounging the Internet looking to buy a previous model. I'm probably going to abandon this one and replace it with an old one!EDIT: I have now done this -- just bought a used 7th gen Kindle (6-in screen) to replace my 11th Gen Kindle (6.8 in screen). And exactly as I thought, I have no trouble holding, gripping, propping the old Kindle because its bezel is just big enough to grip with my thumb and fingers without inadvertently turning pages, and the screen is recessed. No problems. The new one has a bigger screen (not necessary) and a smaller, flush bezel (absolutely fatal flaw).

{"reviewTitle":"\u201cTime remaining\u201d is infuriating","reviewDescription":"This is a great device for reading. It is maddening, however, how half-assed some of the features are. The length of a kindle book is determined by \u201clocations\u201d. Not pages, not word counts: locations. Because the (often five-digit) location number means nothing, you can switch the display to show how far you are in a book by percentage. Which of course only changes every dozen or so pages for long books, which doesn\u2019t give much sense of progress.And so we get to one of Kindle\u2019s big features: estimated time remaining, in either the chapter or the book. I\u2019d still love to know the word count of books\u2026but this sounds great! The trouble is that Kindle never remembers your reading speed. By design. Even though I\u2019ve read literally hundreds of books on this device, every time I start a new one the \u201cestimated time remaining\u201d jumps around wildly every time I turn the page. And if you flip through a book\u2019s front matter quickly, it assumes you\u2019re just an inhumanly fast reader, and for the first few *hours* of reading a book, every time you turn the page the estimated time remaining gets *longer*.This is particularly irritating because it means that Kindle has no way to answer the obvious question when you start a book: \u201chow long will it take me to read this?\u201d No word count. No page count. And the \u201ctime remaining\u201d is just completely arbitrary until you\u2019re halfway through a book.The \u201ctime remaining\u201d feature is usually excellent for the second half of a book.

{"reviewTitle":"Overall Nice Investment","reviewDescription":"Have had the Kindle for a while now and still lives up to expectations when first buying. Not hard to do with the technology it uses, but good to note that it still goes strong. Battery life seems to deplete even without use nowadays, nothing too dramatic, but still noticeable enough for a mention (has become more dramatic over time). Must use charger cable it comes with, otherwise transfer and charge speeds are very slow, and cap off unexpectedly, for instance, only being able to charge up to ~68% when not using the Kindle-provided cable. Simple fix, no longer a bother. Green color is really nice, back does get sticky and dirty if leaving on a wooden table for too long, perhaps dealing with the moisture in the air and preferring to stick and coagulate on the Kindle plastic than wood. Shame Dark Mode doesn't have the flip page animation, should receive an update to have it do so, makes the kindle that more enjoyable. Lockscreen ads are nothing, only show up when the kindle is asleep and never when turned on or reading. Storage is very plentiful, not afraid to ever get close to maxing out full capacity. 8GB well more than enough. Do note, Kindle roughly takes 2GB-3GB for its own system usage (my case was 3GB).  Nothing too WOW worthy, but Amazon does hold the major E-Screen market, so no competition to force improvement upon their technology. Kindle will last quite a while based on present experiences.

It was delivered on 9\/19\/23. I immediately began setting it up. It seemed like an easy process. I discovered within one day, certain audiobooks on audible would not download. Despite calling customer service for Audible and for Kindle multiple times last week, I was not able to get any assistance. No one could explain to me why I could not download the Amplified Bible the Old and New Testament which I had purchased from Audible months previously and had been listening to on my android phone and my iPad. The customer rep did a ticket for me and said someone would email and or call me.  I was never contacted by anyone.  Despite restarting the Kindle numerous times and doing 2 factory resets, I still was unable to download this one audio book.  Each time I did a restart I would get the message \u201cThere was a problem loading the home feed. Explore more content in store or library.\u201d Customer reps couldn\u2019t explain why I was getting this message either.Only yesterday 9\/24\/23, after calling customer service again, I was informed that because of the size of the audiobook (82hrs), I will never be able to download it on any kindle device. I can\u2019t even listen to it on any Kindle device. I can only listen to it on the app on my phone or on my iPad. That defeats the purpose of me getting a Kindle, which I expected to be more convenient to carry and use for my purposes. The main audiobook that I wanted to listen to in my leisure I can\u2019t download. I am returning the Kindle for a full refund.This is clearly a major flaw in the Kindle devices that needs to be addressed. If an audiobook or Kindle book is over a certain size, the Kindle will not be able to download it because there is no setting to download in parts as there is on an iPad with the Kindle app. Shame on you Amazon for not doing full disclosure.

I haven't had the funds to get one and have been content with my phone, until I upgraded phones and was forced to borrow books from KU by computer only.I chatted with Amazon Kindle support for a solution, so I could borrow books on my phone, but it seemed there was no solution. I didn't have my previous phone, so I couldn't just revert back to that. I tried multiple times to borrow a book, and it would say I borrowed it, but wouldn't show up in my library. Weeks after my chat with Amazon support, I heard there was a Kindle sale, so I bought the latest Paperwhite in hopes I would have access to KU.I ordered the 8gb version, and was excited to finally have a Kindle again. I received the device a week earlier than expected and immediately after set up, there wereproblems left and right. Right away, the device was continuously freezing and glitching. As I was trying to download books, it was deciding to restart itself for a total of three times and reset my download progress each time. Over the course of three days, I finally got all my books downloaded, but yet the device was still freezing and restarting itself.One day, though, the Kindle was close to being dead, so I decided to preserve the battery and not read until I could get it charged. After putting it on the charger, I went to read and it immediately froze.. again. This time, I couldn't do anything with it. It wasn't dead when I put it on the charger, it was working just fine before, but nothing was happening. I was trying to power it off and on, but it still wasn't working. I Googled the problem and came across directions for a soft restart, which I did. Upon restart, it wouldn't get past the kid and the tree screen, no matter what I did. Eventually I just gave up and left it there for an hour on that screen. It finally got past it, but the device was still glitching and freezing continuously three days later.Besides those problems, I'm also not impressed with the battery life. After a day of reading with it being fully charged, it drops to 20-30% remaining. It defeats the purpose of having a Kindle, when it has to remain on the charger at all times. Recently it's been more so on the charger than not.With the amount of problems I've been having, it's strange there's not much out there about them. This is a brand new Kindle, but with the amount of problems I've been having, you'd think it'd be the first generation. I don't know what to do with it. I want a Kindle so I can finally use my KU, but is the multiple problems worth it? I've been thinking a lot about possibly returning it and trying the signature edition, but what if it's the exact same? I don't know what to do. I'm not at all satisfied with this generation and I'm hoping something will change, like an update and it'll be usable again, but that might be too much to hope for at this point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1645660800000}

{"reviewTitle":"My Paperwhite Is A Vampire","reviewDescription":"I have an 11 year old Kindle 3 with Keyboard that is still working perfectly. I decided to trade it in on Prime Day for the Paperwhite to test out the new features. Big mistake.One of the biggest differences is supposed to be the improved screen resolution. That might be the case for illustrations, magazines, or comics, but I don\u2019t use a Kindle tor that. I could not see any significant improvement when it came to books. One nice addition is the lighting range where you can go from the brightest bright to a reverse darkness with white lettering on a black screen for late night reading. I will miss that but the old black lettering on a grey screen has always been a good middle ground for me. The Paperwhite screen is also bigger for fewer page turns and that was nice but it also shrunk the border bezels which caused other problems.  But page turns were a mess.A light tap on the right side of the screen would often jump ahead two pages and the same could happen going back. It happened enough that I couldn\u2019t trust I was on the correct page. Two times a single tap advanced close to 40 pages. There is an option to turn off the touchscreen and just swipe to advance pages but when I did that the screen would freeze up and not respond to swipes. Well this is an enjoyable way to read.Regarding the thinner bezels: if you have large hands, reading can be a bit like whack-a-mole. If you are holding it with one hand, which I do most of the time, it is easy to inadvertently brush the screen which results is a page turn you didn\u2019t want. At that point you just feel lucky if it only advanced a single page. My old Kindle 3 is a bit larger and a few ounces heavier but I find it much more comfortable to hold in one hand, especially with the page buttons. The Paperwhite really needs a screen sensitivity option.So I decided to return the Paperwhite and keep my old Kindle. The battery will eventually stop working but I can replace that for $15.00. So I deregister the Paperwhite for shipment and now it would not power off. I tried everything short of a hammer. After wasting a half hour I called Amazon for assistance as I didn\u2019t want to pack a powered device and at this point I knew it was not going to turn itself off. The rep was great and it still took 75 minutes on the phone to shut it off. At one point I asked the rep if I could bash it to death with a hammer and use our recorded call as justification for the exchange. Or drive a stake through its Kindle heart. I believe she gave it serious consideration.There were some other nice menu options but who cares if reading a book is so dam frustrating. I could have exchanged it for another one but in those cases Amazon may replace it with a returned\/refurbished item. Not a new one. I know the vast majority of people are very satisfied with the Paperwhite but they don\u2019t know how great the Kindle 3 still is, even with the physical keyboard that takes forever to enter anything.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1659484800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Kindle is good, but trade-in process is disappointing","reviewDescription":"I was offered the trade-in which gave me a $15 discount on the purchase of the new Kindle.

The system did not identify receival of this trade-in Kindle and then charged my credit card those $15 that I had earned with the trade-in. So at the end of the day, what happened was - I gave my old Kindle to Amazon for $15 dollars, and did not actually earn it, meaning that I handed them my old Kindle to Amazon for free. I'm writing this so you are aware that this can happen and can be disappointing.

I\u2019ve been using it for about 6 months now.  This one is inferior.  The biggest problem is there are shadows on the screen between the lines.  It is as if the previous or next page is showing through the current page.  Also since there is not a frame around the front of the screen it makes it harder to hold.  Yes, the lack of the frame allows for more readable screen space but it also means that it is more slippery to hold and that I am regularly inadvertently turning the page because I am touching the screen.  Also I HATE the new interface.  What used to be a clean simple library where I could easily find my books is now overly busy and is designed to always be trying to sell me books.  As with my previous paperwhite, the battery life is awesome.  With Wi-Fi off I can go a month of daily reading without recharging.  But this version is not up to the standard I\u2019ve come to expect from Kindle.  If you already own an earlier paperwhite keep using it as long as you can.

{"reviewTitle":"TLDR: If you want a reliable kindle, look elsewhere. Not worth the time.","reviewDescription":"Almost loved it. I thought that this would probably be one of the best iterations of the Paperwhite ever. I had the 2012\/2013 version and loved that one! I had it by my side all the time, used it for years without issue (though I will admit it did lag occasionally). But this new one, despite its glowing features that led me to buy it, including the warm light and waterproof\/water resistant nature (not that this second feature matters -- because my old Kindle Paperwhite and my standard Kindle handle splashes just fine), was an utter disappointment. I bought it mainly for the warm light feature so that reading before bed doesn't disrupt sleep quite as much, but given that I have bought it for such a feature, it had limited use (staying in the bedroom and only used for times when I read immediately before bed). Well, I bought it in October, only finished a grand-total of one full novel on it and only used it for roughly a hand-full of times, and it already has an issue. Stuck on the boot screen, unable to fully boot in or turn off (holding the power button for however long (40 seconds, 5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) doesn't work, neither does charging). The customer service is okay... if you get the right person... but to be honest, at this point, I feel that the replacement device isn't worth my time. I am not looking forward to dealing with the problem a second time and I can read hours before sleep instead with much more reliable Kindles.Do not recommend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646265600000}

It\u2019s a beautiful, snappy device with a bright, clear large screen. Unfortunately, poor quality control makes this almost perfect device, not so perfect.Purchased: 27 November 2021Review written: 30 November 20211. ResponsivenessScreen is very responsive and snappy. There\u2019s not much load time when scrolling, selecting, or page turning.2. SoftwareNice user interface. Very easy to use, especially to transfer over library books. There were some issues when opened out of the box, but a reset fixed the issues.3. Battery\/chargeUSB-C may be a winner for some. I have no opinion.4. Quality ControlKindle is known for having hit or miss quality control. The new 2021 Paperwhite is no different. For me, my Paperwhite has tiny pinhole light also known as a dead pixel. E-readers are prone to this issue so it\u2019s not a surprise, BUT a defect is a defect regardless. Quality control should have found this issue so it doesn\u2019t fall into the hands of customers.The pinhole is negligible but it is annoying when my eyes stray towards the small light hole. Plus, I paid for a defect-free new device.5. Amazon Customer ServiceAmazon online CS used to be unparallel, second to none. I contacted Amazon online CS about the pinhole light and I was willing to send pictures of the issue. I expected to be sent a new replacement device. Some unlucky customers have to go through 2-3 devices before they find a \u201cperfect\u201d device free of defects\/issues. I went into buying the Kindle knowing this.The best Amazon online CS could offer was to replace my defected device with a certified refurbished device delivered 2-3 days. I asked if a new device could be sent out, CS said no. I asked if I could exchange for another device in store, Amazon CS said no.I called the Amazon store and the supervisor told me that I can return my device and buy a new device. They will do a price adjustment for me so I pay the same price as I did during Thanksgiving weekend. That was a nice offer\u2026 except it makes the process for a new device inconvenient.Anyhoo, approach Kindle with some caution. It\u2019s not a flawless device. It has the potential to be, though. I\u2019m going to try to ignore the dead pixel as I read before I get a chance to return it for a (hopefully) defect free device.UPDATED REVIEW - January 6, 2022I returned the defective Kindle unit at the Amazon 4Star and purchased a new Kindle unit. The Amazon employee did a price adjustment for me so it matched sale price from my original purchase. Right from the box, the new Kindle unit has a very small black dot at the top right of the screen - very minor cosmetic issue.  Another dead pixel. This defect is not noticeable compare to the white light  spot (pinhole light\/dead pixel(s) as the returned Kindle unit.I expected this. A few lucky Kindle users get Kindles with flawless screens. Some customers have to return\/exchange 3-4x to get a perfect unit. Since the cosmetic issue is so minuscule, I accept it. The new unit has an almost perfect screen.Customer service at the Amazon 4Star store is above average.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1638230400000}
{"reviewTitle":"A little more buggy than previous generations","reviewDescription":"I love Kindle!  I've owned one almost since they were introduced (remember the keyboard Kindle!) and they have literally changed the way I read.  No more locked onto so called best selling authors because now I can discover the absolutely amazing talent that exists out there in the independent world.  It also lets me tote as many books as I want on vacation without needing a separate suitcase for reading materials.And, every generation of Kindle has seen an improvement, some dramatic, some subtle.  This one is on the subtle side if you own a 2018 version.  Yes, the screen is bigger but so is the whole unit (marginally but still bigger) which is not necessarily a check mark in the plus column.  The screen shows fingerprints badly, just like the 2018 version so a screen saver is helpful if you can get it installed properly.  I really like the USB-C charging - a small idea but one I can appreciate.Where I have some issues with this generation is that it seems buggier than any version before.  Sometimes the page forward doesn't work until you do a page back first and then all is well for about another twenty pages and then the behavior repeats itself.  It doesn't always turn on\/off with the cover close and I've tried two different covers so think it's the unit itself.  The first thing I did when I took it out of the package was to update it but it has since, on its own, gone into that update screen when there wasn't actually any update to download.  It doesn't wipe anything out, just prevents use for a few minutes.I may have a faulty unit or it's some of the non-Amazon books I'm reading (Gutenberg mostly so they should be malware free but who knows).  It's not enough to return the item since Amazon tends to replace brand new purchases with refurbished ones.If I had but one suggestion for Amazon, it would be to build in a circuit that would allow you to plug a device into the USB port that would have two buttons on a pod and on a longish cord that would let you remotely turn pages.  It would be really helpful in the gym while on the cardio equipment like an AMT.  You could attach the pod to the handles of the AMT and just tap the page turn button to read.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658361600000}

{"reviewTitle":"All good except I miss dedicated page turn buttons like old Kindles or Voyage","reviewDescription":"Everything is good in this new Paperwhite model, I like the bigger size and the backlighting with variable \"warmth\", plus the optional dark mode of white text on black background for night reading.I don't like the lack of dedicated page turn buttons -- I've always had older Kindles with buttons, most recently a Voyage, and I find it distracting and annoying to have to touch the screen carefully somewhere on the righthand side to advance forward one page, especially if I'm trying to hold the device in just my left hand, as I would often do with the older models having dedicated page turn buttons along the left edge. So I can't use this Kindle entirely one-handed like I used to with older ones (even holding it just in my right hand, it's awkward having to extend a finger carefully to touch somewhere in the righthand side of the screen to advance the page forward instead of just having a nice button to press).Oh one other thing that's sub-optimal is that in the new OS\/UI there's no more generic\/universal \"Back\" button\/link icon. Most noticeable when I'm reading a story in a magazine; with older models and older OS\/UI there was a \"back\" button, either hardware or software, so I could use the \"home\" button\/link icon to jump out to the \"library\" listing, and then use the universal \"back\" button\/link icon to jump back directly to the page I'd been reading in the story in the magazine. Now I have to go through several steps, thinking about what to do\/touch next, to go through this cycle, and it annoys me each time.Plus, one more thing I don't like in the new OS\/UI is that in the Library listing when I have some Collections, previously in the overall view it would only show collections and individual items that weren't in any collection. So I could \"hide\" a bunch of books inside collections, not having to scroll past them in the main library view of items not in any collection.But now, in the overall view, it shows collections and ALL downloaded individual items, including ones that I wanted to hide from this view by putting them in a collection. What's the point of adding them to a \"collection\", if they're still just going to all be visible in the main library list?Other than these few things I don't like about the new OS\/UI and the lack of a physical page forward button on the left or bottom edge of the device, I do like this new Paperwhite (it's my first Paperwhite; I had the original Kindle when it first came out, then some years later I had one with no keyboard but still having physical buttons along the bottom and sides, and then I had a Voyage for a few years, before deciding to upgrade to this new Paperwhite).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1651190400000}

I chose this paper white as it promoted font changeability and accessibility options. Well, it does offer them but they are not sufficient. The screen size is small (smaller than what I anticipated from the description) the font size does not get very large, certainly not large enough, and the font options are terrible, all with a script, no sans script (which is So much easier to read with vision problems) and they are all hard to read with poor vision.  I am very disappointed, and may have to return.  I will give it a try to see if I can make it work.  I do think it could be a good option for someone else, without visual impairment.  I want my old Kidnle to work!Update:  I wrote the previous in frustration, which I still have, albeit waning.  They do, actually, have sans script but it  (clearly) was hard to tell the difference., and only have a few style options (maybe 8).  Directly following this review, I received a phone call from Amazon. They sent me info on how to change font, etc, which I already had done.

Kobo and nook single tap book mark. I bought my first kindle in 2010 a 3rd gen with keyboard it died last year and I hate all the kindles after the kindle touch because of the cheap build and rotten OS. the thing making this the end for me is the minute plus download speeds of books when nook and kobo take 2 to 3 seconds. I bought a Kobo clara HD 3 weeks ago and between its easy to use picture perfect operating system and in the library section you can hit 3 dots pull up a menu that says download all. Kindle makes my life hard and makes me want to pull my hair out, so I'm going to Kobo where I enjoy  picking up their Reader and using it.

You lose the photos, not in color, doesn\u2019t format correctly and refresh speed on page turns is too slow.The web browser is for absolute emergency use only.

{"reviewTitle":"A couple of steps forward","reviewDescription":"I have owned two Kindles prior to buying this one: Paperwhite (2015) and Kindle 4. Kindle 4 still remains my favorite all around e-reader. In retrospect, I really liked having a non-touch screen. The downside of Kindle 4 was that it was slow and I couldn't read in the dark. The Paperwhite (2015) was an improvement over that mainly because now I could read in the dark. The touch screen added a bit of ease of use but annoyance with every touch being an interaction. Still, I told myself that if Amazon added warm light and a USB-C to the Paperwhite, I would buy it. So I bought this one.And really, those two features are the two big steps forward for this device. It also feels faster than my Paperwhite 2015 so that doesn't hurt either. The downside for this device is that now with the flush screen and smaller bezels, the touch sensitive area is even bigger. I had too many unintended touches on this device. It's also a little bit bigger; so with small bezels all around, it's just generally less uncomfortable to hold. This was the least comfortable kindle I have had.I also typically keep my device on airplane mode unless I need to connect to my Amazon account. This device froze frequently while I was reading. I suspect this has to do with telemetry and ads being pulled to the device. In airplane mode, the device just freezes and lags if it can't communicate with Amazon servers. This is just my guess but I have seen this behavior in games in both iOS and Android platforms where if you block their access to the internet, the games lags heavily and once you restore internet access, the game play is smooth again.So generally, this is a good step forward for Amazon. I suspect that Amazon is expanding its ads business and the integration of that into the kindle OS is causing lags on the device when in airplane mode. That's definitely a step backwards. Add to that a bigger device that is less comfortable to hold and the choice was clear for me.I am sending this device back and keeping my Paperwhite 2015.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1639353600000}

I\u2019ve been using a prior version of paperwhite for seven years and absolutely love it. It\u2019s just the perfect size and weight for me to hold on one hand to read at bed before sleeping. My old kindle unfortunately broke down and I didn\u2019t think twice before buying a new paperwhite. However I was sad to find that paperwhite is not the same anymore. Its bezel gets so thin and with the flush screen it\u2019s just very hard to hold it tightly on one hand without accidentally touching the screen. I know we can lock the touch screen but that doesn\u2019t solve the issue for me as when I\u2019m holding it on one hand I can\u2019t make a long enough swipe to turn page - I don\u2019t have large enough hands! Then I try to use landscape mode to hold the thickest bezel while reading but that can\u2019t be done either - the landscape mode only allows one direction, and it\u2019s the wrong direction - meaning, if I want to hold the side of the thicker bezel with my right hand, the words would be upside down. After so many attempts I just got so angry with Amazon. Why do they have to do this to my fav paperwhite. Why I does every digital divice HAVE TO have larger screen? I just don\u2019t see the point. Now I have to return this uncomfortable to hold kindle and buy a new one and just lose all the prime day discount  (I made my original purchase on prime day, I should\u2019ve purchased a smaller kindle that day ugh).

I've had an older Kindle Paperwhite since 2013, but the battery now needs to be charged nearly every day, so I decided it was time for a new Kindle.I'm not particularly fond of the flat surface of the new Kindle, which makes accidental page turns too easy. The power button on the bottom also makes it easy to accidentally switch off the Kindle, but I'm used to that since the old Kindle has the same setup.  I presume this design will always remain, despite a myriad of customer complaints, because it helps to sell Kindle covers which enclose the power switch.I went nearly a year without registering my new Kindle, and the trouble started when I did register it.  Instead of the lovely pencil \/ pen & ink \/ wood block printing screen savers, I started getting Kindle Unlimited ads for books that I'd call the \"junk food\" of the literary world.  Maybe it's just me -- I consider almost everything published after, say, 1960, to be not worth reading (there are exceptions, of course, most notably Norman Maclean, Simon Winchester, John McPhee, and Bill Bryson, to name a few favorites).The other trouble after registering my new Kindle was the Collections.  I found I could set the Collections to appear as lists, but books within the collections were large-ish icons and I found no way to display them as lists (maybe I'm just missing something here . . . )  Most of the books within the Collections have little \"NEW\" banners across them which obscure the titles.Since 99% of what I read is in the public domain and available for free at sites like Gutenberg.org and Fadedpage.com, I did with my new Kindle what I've done with the old Kindle:  I reset it, deregistered it, and set it permanently to airplane mode (my old Kindle has been permanently in airplane mode for nearly 11 years now, and it has worked perfectly -- much more perfectly, I'm sure, that if I had allowed Amazon to meddle with it, with updates and other nonsense).  I download public-domain books in .mobi format, connect my Kindle to my computer via USB cable, and simply drag the new books into the Kindle's \"Documents\" folder.HINT:  sites like Gutenberg.org and Fadedpage.com offer for free, thousands of e-books that are in the public domain.  If you're shopping at Amazon and see a \"classic\" that you'd like to read (i.e., something by Mary Shelley, Mark Twain,  Emily Bronte, Alexander Dumas, Victor Hugo, Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, etc.), chances are you'll find it for free at one of the sites listed above.To summarize, my new Kindle's physical aspects (screen resolution, screen brightness, battery life, etc.) are just fine.  Since everybody at Amazon apparently gets a gold star, I won't mention that I think the new interface (compared to my 2013 Kindle) is entirely unsuitable for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710460800000}

Now, after working fine earlier in the day, it suddenly wouldn\u2019t start. Again, I tried rebooting several times. The screen brightens like it is going to open, then goes dark. I wish I had my previous 9th gen, instead of trading it in. No savings is worth this frustration. Now I have to contact customer service and see if I can get another.

Customer service assured me I wouldn't have this problem with it freezing again so cross your fingers.Update:The customer service is a joke. I am on my 3rd Kindle Paperwhite Gen 11. The first 2 froze and would never restart. My 2nd only lasted about 5 months before the problem. My 1st one lasted about 11 months. I chatted with support about returning the 2nd one for repair and when I never saw anything about it being repaired and returned, I started a chat. I was told by Anup it was lost in transit and to order a new one, pay for it and when I received it, contact Amazon for a credit. Same story as the 1st. Only this has turned into a nightmare.

Update: June 12, 2022  Note:  I seldom write such a negative review but feel other people purchasing this paperwhite should know what they are buying.  3rd replacement 8G paperwhite\/box says refurbished even though I originally purchased a new one.I received a third replacement 8G paperwhite (apparently refurbished) from Amazon because the other two units went to a frozen white screen after having it for a short period of time.  I've have had this unit for approximately three\/four weeks and was working fine until last night when it started to reboot it's self for no reason and failed to bring up a book or wouldn't go from page to page....once again reverting to the 3rd unit's slow down. The entire device was in slow motion. These are the same things that have happened with the previous two devices eventually leading to nothing but a frozen white screen.Today this unit has been a frozen white screen all day.  I am not able to try and reboot it due to the white screen and turning it off and on does nothing to fix this unit.  I will be calling Amazon and asking for a full refund.  Amazon has been good in replacing this paperwhite (3) times but I am done getting  replacements that keep doing the same thing the previous ones did. There must be something internally wrong in this paperwhite's structure and will research that further on some other web sites since Amazon would not allow me to turn this model in for a different model type the last go around.  I don't want a replacement of the same product at this time.  I am done with this paper white and greatly disappointed that this unit is such a \"lemon\".My other devices which include a five year old Kindle and a newer I Phone are not experiencing any of these issues with either the kindle app or kindle unlimited.  I even changed the charging plug to the new unit with no change to the frozen white screen.  How does a five year old refurbished Kindle still work while this one doesn't?.  Checked my WiFi strength and all is well...no other issues with all the other devices using a WiFi connection.  My I phone and my older kindle are not experiencing the frozen screen or connectivity issues that this Kindle is experiencing.  They both come up without any issues with my Kindle library and Kindle unlimited.I'm not sure how Amazon is going to react with my request, but will update this review once I speak with someone from their helpdesk. They have been very helpful in the past but I wasn't asking for a refund...I accepted a replacement.  I had hoped that the third paperwhite would work as expected and am greatly  disappointed that it did not.  Be thorough in your research before purchasing this paperwhite, or better yet....get a different model.I use Amazon quite a bit and have never had issues with a product such as this reader.  Returns have always been seamless and customer service has always been helpful.  It's very disappointing to be having these issues with a company that I have grown to respect over the years for their efficiency in dealing with  these kinds of issues. I take care of all my electronics and purchased a leather\/type protective book cover  for the very first unit. I've used that cover with each of these readers.

Called customer service and they said they would send a new one, but it was on back order.UPDATE 2 MONTHS AFTER THE LAST UPDATE: Well, received what I thought would finally be my new Kindle after almost 2 months. No joke, another refurbished one. Called customer service again and maybe they will figure this out this time around. How hard is it to get the NEW KINDLE that I paid for???","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"926 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1637971200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Defective item","reviewDescription":"I received a defective item from Kindle. I did not know at the time of receipt that it was not normal to see the lines from previous pages and after struggling to read on my Kindle and multiple troubleshooting attempts I called kindle for a replacement. They told me I would receive a refurbished item as it is short of the return window time. I paid for a new item (which I am not sure that I even received) or I would have to return my item and pay a restocking fee - I the consumer have to pay a restocking fee to a billion dollar company for their defective item. I never write bad reviews but I feel this time I have been failed. I will be reporting this issue. How a company that makes so much money can let there consumers receive defective items and then make them pay to return it is beyond my comprehension. I was so excited to receive this item but now I believe as a consumer have no way of knowing if you are receiving a new Kindle product or a used product (as I was told by the Kindle supervisor there is no way for the consumer to know). Better just to buy them used or actually better not to buy them at all.

{"reviewTitle":"Do NOT BUY! This operates LIKE IT WAS MADE IN THE NINETIES","reviewDescription":"MAN, what a disappointment this product was!  Seriously, if you've never gotten a Kindle, SAVE THE MONEY and--I don't know. Buy literally anything else. Here's why!MIGRAINE-INDUCING FLASHING SCREENThis was the dealbreaker here. I had many issues with this, which you'll see below, but this was the one that broke me. See, whenever I pressed the screen to turn a page, it flashed this \"photo-negative\" image EVERY TIME. I figured out how to solve that issue by turning off the settings button that makes the page refresh, but the issue is still there on every other function--it flashes when you move from function to function, it flashes when you go back from one function to another, and so on,. It's horrible and there was no way to stop that part.NIGHTMARE TRYING HEAR MY AUDIBLE CONTENT - wouldn't recognize Bluetooth!I have a ton of Audible audiobooks. As one does, I like to listen to them, and I was promised that the Paperwhite would easily do this, which made sense since Amazon owns Audible.BUT NO! It wouldn't sync with my phone even after multiple restarts\/resets, and then when *one time* it happened, the Paperwhite froze up the minute I took out my Bluetooth headphones and wouldn't move from page to page.SCREEN SIZEOkay, so they touted this product as having a bigger screen size, which is great, and I kept hearing about how it was like a paperback, blah blah. What it's really like is like HALF a paperback. This is annoying, because I'm actually a pretty fast reader and this would double tne number of page turns. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but over time, it gets very annoying.NO COLORS FOR COVER ARTThis is a real slap in the face for the artists who construct cover art for books, and it's also a pain for readers, because let's face it, that's a way we quickly scan a bunch of books to find one specific one. Like, \"Oh, it's the green one!\"  The other thing is that the cover art and color *are part of the book's message and theme,* which is why those elements were chosen. Without the colors, the covers are actually hard to read--not a surprise, because *they're easier to read when they're in the colors they're designed to have.\"HARD TO OPERATEIt's literally a pain to operate. How  you get from X to Y to Z is by no means intuitive -- I was having to do a lot of poking, random swiping, etc.SLOOOOWWWW PPPPPAAAAGGGEEE RESPONSSSSEEEYeah, slow as heck. Half the time, I'd click on something and then click on it *again* because it didn't respond the first time. Then I'd get those delightful migraine flashes from the screen twice, because once wasn't enough, apparently.WELCOME BACK TO THE NINETIES; WHERE'S MY PAGER?Bottom line, this functioned like some really bad flip phone from the 90s. If this actually *were* the 90s, I guess I'd think this was cool, but not as cool as an actual paperback with the real cover art, and that didn't give me migraines when I turned the page.Seriously, save your money.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"131 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665619200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Device froze after only three months and won't restart.","reviewDescription":"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my wife, who enjoyed it.  For about three months.  Then suddenly it started giving her an error message that it couldn't \"find\" the application.  After a few times of this, she looked up what to do on Amazon, and tried to restart it.  For a moment it restarted, but then it just went to the start-up screen and stayed there.  No matter what she does, the device won't go past the opening screen, it stays frozen on that screen doing nothing.It also won't shut off completely, though she's tried several times. Again, it will restart (rather than shut down) and then stay frozen on the start up screen.She's now left it sitting there, on, for two weeks, hoping to run it down until the battery dies to see if that has any effect on being able to reboot it completely.  She figures if it just runs out and she then has to recharge it and reboot it, maybe it will help.  I've gotta say, the battery on this thing rocks.  It's still sitting there stuck on that home screen after two weeks.We're past the return window so trying to replace it, but the online help just keeps sending us to articles telling us to do things we've already tried several times.  Next step is to get on the phone with Amazon and try to get this resolved.  Until then - it's getting a one star review from me.

{"reviewTitle":"Waste of money, customer service abysmal, BATTERY LIFE FANTASTIC","reviewDescription":"Was informed by amazon that my product would be quite late in arrival and they offered a refund. Device arrived but locked me out. Called customer service, they explained because I was given a refund the device would have a \"banner\" on their end, not allowing it to be registered. However, if I paid for it again it could be lifted. Was transferred to finance, repaid for it. Said banner was not lifted, transferred me to device support help. Now, I'm usually a patient person, I too work in IT and Customer Service, so I get what it can be like. But, the gentleman I spoke to was of no use and just repeatedly told me to turn on\/off the device for an hour. When I requested to be transferred to a different customer service agent because we weren't understanding each other and I didn't want to be a * KaReN *, he insisted \"But, Ma'am I'm here to help you!\" and refused to transfer me. I wish I was joking... I hung up. I just couldn't.So, while I have not yet been able to read a book, I assure you I'm well familiar with the ON\/OFF button and the \"register your kindle\" page. The registering with your app seems cool and quick, IDK if it works or not. Wasn't for me for the reason mentioned above. Anywho, this is how I feel about the performances Amazon asked me for:The TOUCH SCREEN is ok. I have no issues with the sensitivity and the grey\/white takes some time to get used to but delivers on its' \"no glare\" claims. I rated the touch screen as a 1 star review though because it shows your keystrokes and remembers them for 2.5 - 3 seconds after clicking. So, if you're typing a password, even with a \"Hide Password\" box checked, if someone was over your shoulder, they'd know what your password is, definitely a security issue IMO.2 stars for the EASY TO READ section. If its just your book page, its fine, probably a little lesser quality than what you envisioned but nothing to b*tch over. HOWEVER, coinciding with the touch screen thing.... If you type quickly between CAPITALS or !@#$%^ the letters overlap each other and it becomes hard to read. Think of old time TVs, where if you left it on a single image \"paused\" it'd burn into the screen and be there for a while. It's like that but without needing to take the 30 min to set in and it all happening at once so your keyboard could be reading with 3 letters on top of each other instead of 1.The BATTERY LIFE is amazing, 5 stars, no cap as the kids say. This thing stayed turned on\/illuminated on the 3 different screens I have seen thus far for the entirety of my 2.5 hour customer service call along with 30-40 minutes attempted set up time and only went from 98% to 95%. So while, I can't attest to 10 weeks in a single charge. The 3% for 120 minutes did strike me as quite impressive.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"65 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665964800000}

I purposefully selected the ad supported software, as I have no problems supporting the ads or them being present on my device; however, upon receiving my Kindle today, in ONE day, I've seen an ad for a title with bold print profanity, as well as a description of a terrorist attack.  I have two young children who are able to read, and I reached out to customer service to see if there was a way to control the ads to make them family friendly, or in the least, simply lacking profanity and triggering topics.  I was told that I could create a child's profile (which I'm not doing, because the Kindle is mine, not my child's - despite my child visually seeing my Kindle and the ads that will present on the screen), reset the software (which is ridiculous, as the Kindle is literally hours old), or pay a $20 fee to have ads removed.  Again, I'm not asking for ads to be removed entirely - I'm fine with ad supported software; however, I AM asking that ads not contain explicit profanity and triggering topics that I refuse to expose my young children to in my home.

{"reviewTitle":"A great update marred by a soft\/fuzzy screen","reviewDescription":"While this Kindle Paperwhite 2021 finally brings a whole host of long needed improvements, the likes of which competitor Kobo has offered for years and at various price points, it\u2019s not without its flaws.For starters the overall footprint of the device has increased despite room enough to fit the larger 6.8\u201d display within the footprint of the former body. While it\u2019s not a deal breaker it hurts portability and single-hand use that little bit. The latter is especially noticeable because, unlike it\u2019s pricier sibling the Oasis, it lacks an asymmetric grip and page turn buttons.While the resolution of the new display is the same 300 PPI, I encountered noteworthy issues with display sharpness when compared to the 2018 model. As pictured (to the best of my ability) my new model lacks sharpness and contrast all around the edges and in particular on the left side which results in a soft almost fuzzy lack of crispness to all text or images.To make matters worse the consistency of this issue varies wildly across the display. In the image you can almost make out the random diagonal plane of sharpness towards the center of the display. This means that you find yourself consistently reminded how soft the fuzzy portions are compared to the properly sharp portions.I\u2019m thrilled to see Amazon finally include USB-C and warm-light adjustment, but I find it especially hard to look past the display issues on a device expressly built for reading. If you have the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis I\u2019d recommend holding off for now or consider a Kobo equivalent model with native OverDrive support for library borrowing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"400 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1635379200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Piece of junk","reviewDescription":"This is a great reading device - when it works. As a few other reviewers mentioned, it will often freeze up. You get a warning that it\u2019s going to happen because the page turns get slower and slower; there\u2019s a palpable and annoying delay before the page finally turns, which then leads to a complete freeze up. There is absolutely no choice except to reboot it entirely. This would be great, but this problem is it\u2019s fatal flaw.UPDATE:  The very next day after this review was posted, I received a call regarding my negative review from an Amazon Outreach Support Representative. She patiently and professionally guided me through performing a factory reset and creating a new Amazon account. This took awhile due to my continual errors in doing so. The representative was very polite and kind and was dedicated to resolving the problem. Now my PaperWhite is functioning flawlessly. Not only do the pages now turn easily but I noticed that now the battery lasts significantly longer. Thanks to this representative and the now perfect functionality of my Kindle, I find it reasonable to upgrade my review to five stars.Update number 2:  I now must return to my original review. It IS a piece of junk. I was just in the middle of reading a book when the entire screen went blank. I had to restart it twice and went to a different page rather then the page on which I was reading. I would give this one star except that it works most of the time; nevertheless, this is extremely annoying, frustrating, and interferes with the joy of reading. There is no reasonable explanation to why this happens.Update #3:  I had previously mentioned that the Paperwhite was freezing frequently again. That is no longer an issue because it just died. Nothing I tried worked. So now it\u2019s a Paperweight. This is truly a cheap and pathetic ereader. Amazon should be ashamed of itself but I know that they couldn\u2019t care less, I.e. too big to fail. This Kindle gets stellar reviews but just wait until you\u2019ve had it awhile. If it doesn\u2019t crap out eventually, consider yourself lucky and buy a lottery ticket.

The device is great, don't get me wrong. The material its made of makes holding it feel natural, the screen is excellent (although the voyage remains the sharpest screen to date) and I enjoy the size increase. But many small things have just come together to really annoy me.For starters, the device freezes on a regular basis usually after adjusting font\/brightness and returning to the book. Sometimes it unfreezes after a bout 20 seconds sometimes it never does. I've had the device a few days but its happened almost a dozen times. I thought my issues would be over when I updated the firmware but that not only didnt help, but introduced a new bug where the backlight does not turn off when locking the device, and made some nonsense changes to the interface. List view went from 7-8 books to 5. For those with a big library, that makes it very painful to view everything (and nothing has been added to the value of the list view, same data just unnecessarily bigger. Why not leave the option for fitting more books in the list?)The power button is on the bottom. I've accidentally turned my device off while reading many times considering that the larger form factor requires cradling on my fingers at times. Curious placement. I've tried to remove special offers but for three days now it just says \"sorry something went wrong, please try again later\". My kindle is a place where I go to get away from everything else, not be advertised to. After this bug I researched the issue and other people are being told that they aren't allowed to remove ads. That's disappointing.I know it sounds nitpicky, but a great device has just been crippled with strange bugs, unusual design choices and software updates that don't really add value and seem to just be changing things for the sake of changing things, or changing things for the wrong reasons.

Finished my book and had some other stuff to do so I plugged it in to the charger and walked away. Purchased a new book from my desktop computer around dinner time, but didn't pick up my Kindle again until around 11 pm tonight. Hmm...no new book. Hit the sync button. Still no new book. Hold the power button and wait for the dialogue box to pop up and select \"Restart\". And that's the last thing it ever did.The screen flashes like it's attempting to reboot, but the only thing it displays is the Kindle logo with the boy reading under a tree. Every so often it'll flash again, but it never progresses further. Support tells you to hold the power button down for 40 seconds to force a restart, but there's no different result. Then they tell you to try it again with various options for plugging it in (try a different charger, try a usb port on your computer, nope...plug it back into a wall charger.) Nothing makes it respond differently. I can't even shut it off. There's another review posted by Nishan with a video of the exact same thing happening. Amazon is sending a replacement, but it's going to be a refurbished model which I'm not exactly happy about. It's probably going to be one that somebody sent back that's got the same exact problem.This worked beautifully when it worked. My favorite Kindle by far, and it did respond a lot better than my 2018 version. But if I only get 6 months out of it, it's hardly worth the purchase price and the hassle of needing to return it. If it weren't for my raging insomnia I'd swear off Kindle all together.

{"reviewTitle":"Perfect for travel...and the rest of your days","reviewDescription":"So I came into possession of this little guy due to a late night Amazon impulse buy a few days before leaving for vacation. I was going on a weeklong  trip with my family and didn't want to have to bring my ipad (what I usually use to read) or any actual books with me on the plane. Let me preface this by saying I am an avid reader, spending the majority of my free time reading...and have been for most of my life. My siblings lament to anyone listening about the horror of summer road trips, riding in the back of our family sedan, fighting for leg room because I always had at least 5-6 books at my feet to read during our travels. You should hear the way my sister grumbles at even the mere mention of a car ride with me (She horribly dramatic) but I digress. I also used to have a nook e-reader, an original model Kindle from way back in the day that no longer works, and have the kindle app on my ipad which I use to read most days. So I am familiar with e-reading. This kindle is quite possibly the best purchase I've ever made. It's basically pocket sized so it was extremely portable. I brought it with me everywhere; On the plane, in the car, in my bag to restaurants...I even managed to fit it in a particularly spacious pocket of an oversized jean jacket I wore on cooler nights. It's amazing. It was comfortable enough to hold in one hand, or two, depending on what I preferred at the time. The various light options on the kindle, including the warm light feature makes it easy to read regardless of where I was and what kind of lighting is available, without eye strain. I shared a room with family for a couple of nights and the dark mode feature barely emits light past my immediate person, so I was able to read into the wee hours of the morning if I wanted to without disturbing my family sleeping in the same room, or sacrificing my precious reading time. ( I get particularly sassy if I'm interrupted in the middle of a discovering a plot twist in a juicy novel, i'm just saying). You are able to customize lots of the settings, such as the fonts, size, spacing and layout, so that the books look however you want them to while reading. (I definitely used that feature to make the font smaller and more compact while I read an embarrassingly cringleworthy, but suprisingly emotional and fantastic, harlequin romance novel while on the plane. It's nobody's business why I was practically sobbing into my complimentary pretzels after the protagonists romantic interest declared his love to her for the first time, thank you very much) I also may, or may not have had a TINY accident in which I spilled my entire 32oz water bottle full of water all over my pants and my kindle. After squealing in alarm at how cold the water was, I was able to get my bearings, wiped the water off the kindle, changed my pants and continued reading. I have noted no damage whatsoever to my kindle and that was at the beginning of my trip well over a week ago now. After reading every day for at least 4-6 hours per day\/night for 7 days straight I had 57% battery left over. I think the battery is supposed to last for 2 weeks maybe? IDK. Basically it lasted a long time, long enough for me to be impressed. Also, I downloaded at least 15 new books on there, not to mention the impressive collection of books I already owned and was able to sync to the device, and I still have over 4GB of space available to use. I have since named the kindle Kurt, as I feel emotionally connected to the device after our adventures together these past weeks. If you are a super bookworm like me, or are just trying to finish a whole book for the first time, I highly recommend this device for purchase. I think it was worth the money a thousand times over.

{"reviewTitle":"Good Buy for my Very First Kindle buy","reviewDescription":"I'm an avid reader & always wanted a reader for all my books - just my books.  Bought this for my introduction into Kindles as I never had one before and I decided why not try it out.  Can't say it was a bad one - actually it was a very good one.  Took the Paperwhite Kindle 6.8\" locked ad 16gb for my first and I appreciate it. Got me the Kindle + Kindle unlimited subscribtion.What I like about the Kindle:This reader is wonderful and saves my eyes from the glare of the phone or tablet I once used.  Apart from the glare free screen, I like that I can be on a bus reading, with the sunlight pouring through, or sitting outside in the bight environment of day light and I have no problems reading the screen.  At night, I can set the screen and read comfortable as well.  Yes, its easy on the eyes.  The ads run when the screen is closed and isn't a bother while on & reading.  The kindle goes on for days without having to charge.  YES!  I had to test out that particular line \"up to 10 weeks of battery life\".  10 weeks is a stretch if you're a reader reading daily - If you're a reader who reads off and on or every two days or so, it could probably last up to 10 weeks.  But as long as you're a frequent user reading - it can last up to about 10 days (almost or 2 weeks).  The battery life is great!  I also decided to try the waterproof theory but not too much (lol)  I was reading one day while at a funeral, and rain decided to pour down a bit.  I stood there under the light drizzle but not the pouring rain - so, i'll say the screen is waterproof, not sure about the emersion theory.  Definitely good on storing books.  Before I received my kindle, as an author new to the Bookstagram community, I found some good deals such as \"Stuff Your Kindle Day\" or other free books download and began downloading to my account.  When received my E-reader, and got it set up, had about almost 3000 books.  So, the storage is pretty okay.  I don't have Audible nor a subscription for audio books - so, I can't exactly say that the audio hands free is a go.  I have to give this a try as I have a audio book trial to listen to and will give an update on this later.Perspective:The device is great, easy to use, great for traveling with.  It's thin, lightweight and battery life last long (not the whole 10 weeks) like I explained above (rolls eyes).  Definitely can use at the beach, river, waterfalls, springs (bodies of water) as long as you're careful not to lose it (lol).  Shades of pages can be changed, or you can schedule the light changes,  Can adjust the size of the font you wish to use to read. The screen is black and white - as in the colored cover of books won't be seen.  But I'm good with that.  This is only for Amazon Kindle reader - No other books apps can be used on the kindle.  You can read, pdf files (don't really like how some of these pdfs read on it & I more prefer the epubs), epubs.  Haven't bothered to try other files...I do know that on my app on my phone, png, jpeg would be seen.  I think it's good for the price I got it for.Recommend or Not?Why not?  If you're new to the books e-readers like me, I see nothing wrong in giving it a chance to see if you're into having just a kindle or if you'd prefer a tablet e-reader where you can have the Kindle app and other ebook apps as well for your reading.  (If you looking for a reader to host kobo, bookfunnel library, booksprout app, etc then buy a tablet this won't do).  If you have no problem with having a read that shows your book covers black & white, sure get it.  There are other kindle that cost more with the colored cover display.Other than that, Yes I recommend it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"238 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697587200000}

{"reviewTitle":"A Book Believer Converted","reviewDescription":"I am someone who believes that there is something profound and special about a physical book. My favorite part about a book is its smell. It's not wrong to describe the smell of walking into a Barnes & Noble as pure euphoria. New books smell like potential, beginnings, and the possibility of something grand. Old books smell like legends, ancient wisdom, or forgotten secrets. Books have a weight to them as well. It's reassuring to know that this book you're holding is real \u2014 it takes up physical space in the world and this makes it undeniable. It's as if the power of the stories and ideas within are so strong that they have materialized into matter out of the aether. It's hard for me to hold, say, a Bible without a sense of reverence and awe. Even today when I walk into a large library I can't help but feel like I have walked into a holy place \u2014 a place of worship. Being surrounded by books has the same effect on me that a Xanex has on others. Books have an impact on me. I love them.This is why, when I started reading on a Kindle over a year ago, it felt like I was committing adultery. This nasty little plastic screen inspired none of the feelings that books gave me. It took the magic of books and sacrificed it on the altar of consumer electronics. Despite these feelings, I continued to use it.Now I have read a little over fifty books using my Kindle. I still believe that the Kindle kills the magic that physical books have, and it does. But for the first time in a year, I decided to pick up a book in paperback and read it. This experience of going back to real books has made me realize a few things about the Kindle and myself.First off, I realized with horror that I am addicted to my Kindle and its features. The people who designed the Kindle did so with intent. The Kindle's sole purpose is to read books \u2014 there are no other apps on it, there are no intrusive ads, and there is nothing to distract you from reading. Honestly, the device is relatively primitive compared to other consumer electronics, but that is a design choice and not a flaw. I would argue it is even easier to get lost in a book using the Kindle than it is with a physical book.And then there are the features \u2014 the glorious features. My favorite feature by far is the built-in dictionary. When reading a physical book and coming across a word I didn't know the meaning of, assuming I couldn't intuit the meaning from context, I would have to mark my place in the book, put it to the side, pull out my phone, and Google the word. This is tedious. It also breaks my train of thought and forces me to use my dreadful phone with all of its notifications and apps and stuff that sends me into a panic and introduces into my reading time the potential to sidetrack myself. I hate that. With my Kindle, all I have to do is touch the word and a popup with the definition appears and is dismissed just as easily, and then I'm off reading again \u2014 an interruption that is barely even noticed and my attention remains intact. Even better is the fact that my Kindle keeps a list of all these words that I've looked up over time, and I can review them anytime. I look at it occasionally and quiz myself \u2014 this is my idea of 'fun'.Now I'm a big fan of writing in my books \u2014 I underline, highlight, and write in the margins constantly. If I ever need inspiration or if I'm trying to remember something I've read, I will thumb through the book I found it in until I eventually find it. Sometimes when I get bored I will sit in front of my bookshelf and go through the books I've read looking at all the passages I highlighted to refresh my memory on all those inspiring things that I read in years past. It's a little tedious but not too bad. This habit of highlighting is not lost to me while reading on my Kindle. You simply press and drag your finger across the passage which will highlight it. But that's not the best part: Kindle will keep up with everything I have highlighted and organize it all for me by the book it was found in. So at any given time, I can see all of my highlights in any of the books I have read, and I can even share them to my Goodreads profile! This gets me visibly excited.The last feature I want to talk about is the backlit screen. If you do any of your reading in bed then you probably have a bedside lamp or a flashlight or some other novel light source designed for books. Maybe it's just me but I find it difficult to get comfortable in bed and read a paperback at the same time. Either my spouse is annoyed by the light while she is trying to sleep or I can't find the perfect position that makes it both comfortable and easy to read. The Kindle has a backlit screen with adjustable lighting and a \"warm\" light setting. This means all other light sources in the room can be extinguished and I can still get my reading done. No book-light required. The Kindle is so lightweight that I can lay or recline in any position comfortably. No more fighting with those books whose binding is stiff and unyielding.So now we come to the point of this post. A confession. It's a confession to myself and the world. As much as this pains me to say: The Kindle offers a far superior reading experience over books. I said it. I don't like it any more than you do, but it is simply true. The onboard dictionary, the highlights, the backlit screen, the insane battery life (I charge this thing once a month), all of it together creates the most consuming and productive reading experience available. I still feel subtle pangs of guilt when I look at my bookshelf. I don't think that will ever go away for anyone who truly loves books. But now my bookshelf has become a kind of \"greatest hits\" display. I still buy all the best books I read, and I now consider my bookshelf as a place of honor for all the greatest books. But I think of my Kindle as another appendage on my body \u2014 I never go anywhere without it.I love books. I love my Kindle. To my fellow book lovers out there who are still opposed to the idea of a Kindle, I say that you can love both. It will be okay. The Kindle isn't evil after all.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"1,654 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693526400000}
{"reviewTitle":"a must for anyone trying to read more\u2014","reviewDescription":"bought this on an impulse because of a prime day deal that was too good to ignore. but i\u2019ve been meaning to get the kindle paperwhite for a while now anyway. i\u2019ve heard from friends that it\u2019s a worthwhile investment and, now that i\u2019ve had mine for over a week and a half, i can fully attest that it is a must buy for anyone who wants to get back into reading.with my combination adhd, it\u2019s been really hard for me to enjoy reading, as it\u2019s difficult for me to stay focused for a long time in one sitting. however, i\u2019ve had no problem reading on the kindle! i think there are a few reasons for this:1. the ease of reading on a kindle has made my reading experience much more enjoyable due to the advantage of having a screen. with adjustable brightness levels, font sizes, font types, etc.\u2014 i can customize my reading experience for maximum comfort.2. the ability to look up words\/phrases mid-text and be able to reference past searches has been incredibly helpful and interesting. as someone with adhd, i like this feature since it offers you a definition, a wikipedia search on the history and usage of the word, and examples of how it can be used. it makes the learning aspect of reading fun and engaging.3. the progress bars at the bottom of the text gamify reading and make it fun to track your progress.4. battery life is absolutely insane. i charged it to full power the day i received it and over a week and a half later, i\u2019m still at 70%. i probably read thirty minutes a day at minimum.5. as someone who is constantly looking at a screen (via phone or computer or tv), moving from reading physical books to digital books has actually made me read more. while i still appreciate the sentimental value of holding an actual book, i have to admit that making the switch to an e-reader has definitely made it easier to read more. maybe because i\u2019m so used to absorbing information from screens already that it\u2019s a natural transition? also, have not experienced any eye strain while reading on my kindle as opposed to when i try and read on my phone!overall, really happy that i bought the kindle on a whim because i have read more this week and a half than i did in the past few months combined. since it\u2019s so sleek, i can carry it in my purse and read a bit whenever i\u2019m waiting in-between appointments or on a break at work. def recommend you all to try it because it\u2019s always a very classy hobby to read!!PS: DO NOT BUY THE AD-LESS VERSION UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN. it\u2019s really not a big deal considering the \u201cad\u201d only is visible when you\u2019re NOT reading the book anyway. why would it matter what the screen looks like when you\u2019re not using it? \ud83e\udd28 it doesn\u2019t bother me at all and actually amazon does end up suggesting some interesting books through these ads. anyway, if you really have money to burn, spend it elsewhere and not on the ad-free version. get another book with that money instead.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"129 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698019200000}
{"reviewTitle":"A great companion to physical books!","reviewDescription":"For anyone like me, who loves physical books, this is the ultimate alternative to books that youmay not want to lug around (think Pillars of the Earth, Infinte Jest, or any other massive tome with 1000 pages). I love the feeling of turning pages, but I can't deny how convenient this thing is. Don't know a word? Simply tap\/hold on the word and the definition is given to you (and it adds the word to your \"vocabulary builder\"). Need to search for something? Go for it. Want to read in a dimly lit room? No worries; the backight and warm light are perfect for any situation.I just can't speak highly enough about this (11th gen) kindle. I recently gave away my 7th gen in anticipation of receiving this and have had one previous and also one of the earlier Nooks. I shied away from eBooks for a while, but they just make SO much sense for some kinds of books (trash novels that you may never read again, gigantic hardcover 1st editions that you may not have room for in your computer bag, etc.), so I've come back around full circle. I will be buying many eBooks; both ones that I plan to only own digitally and ones that I will \"double dip\" on so I have the digital, searchable version of a physical book that I love.Finally, it's a great feature to be able to sample any book you like. You can generally read the preface and the first couple dozen pages. This is more than enough to know if you want to read\/own the book, and you can't really do this with physical books unless you go to the store.Quick note about the touchscreen: it's not great, but it works. It's slow to respond\/refresh, but better than in the past. However, you'll spend most of your time just looking at a static page of words, and for that, it looks and works great. Just be deliberate with your touching and holding, since it's not nearly as sensitive and responsive as an iPhone or whatever.Buy this!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708905600000}
{"reviewTitle":"So much better than my 2018 Paperwhite - it is worth upgrading","reviewDescription":"I have had this Kindle for a month now and this is so much better than my 2018 Kindle Paperwhite.  My 2018 Kindle had a problem not going into Sleep Mode properly and being able to wake it back up. It would not give me the \"Swipe to Unlock\" screen and the on\/off button did not work very well.  I would have to press super hard (trying several times) and holding it to finally get it to restart so I could actually use my Kindle plus the long wait for it to restart. Before shutting the cover, I had to press the button twice to get the \"Swipe to Unlock\" screen before I could close the cover or else it would be frozen again when I opened the cover.This new Kindle goes to sleep with I close the cover (I bought the RSAquar Kindle Paperwhite Case for 11th Generation 6.8\" and Signature Edition 2021) and gives me \"Swipe to Unlock\" screen when I open the cover.  I really like the adjustable light settings - one for Brightness and one for Warmth - it makes it much easier to read on the eyes - I keep a light brown tint to the screen so it is not so bright and harsh.-  Brightness 18 and Warmth 19.Before with the 2018 Kindle, I use the Dark mode all the time to so it was not so bright.  The Dark mode on this new Kindle is easier to access to switch on for Night reading from the pull down menu.I have not had a problem of multiple pages being skipped like I had with the 2018 Kindle.Even though I am a very good Amazon shopper, I tend not to buy replacement items until my previous item is broken or lost as was in the case of the 2018 Kindle. Even though I did finally find my 2018 Kindle that had fallen behind and underneath my chair after I had bought this new Kindle, I am super happy with the new version of the Kindle Paperwhite. It makes reading so much easier on the eyes with the Brightness and Warmth settings, the Kindle wakes up and goes to Sleep Mode like it is supposed to, the button works as it should, and I no longer have to find my place when my Kindle skips forward any more.If you have an older Kindle, this was a worthwhile upgrade.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711929600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Every aspect improved over previous (6th gen) Kindle Paperwhite","reviewDescription":"I replaced a 6th gen Paperwhite with this 11th gen model.  The old unit was 10 years old (even I was surprised how long it served me well) and its battery was finally becoming short-lived between charges. Also, the firmware had grown in size and functionality over the years (most of it welcome), leading to anemic performance and responsiveness in the end.  All in all, it had served me well but was now falling short in every day use.This new(ish) model improved everything over the older model:*  larger screen means fewer page turns (it's now closer to a traditional paperback page in size)The slightly larger unit size ends up distributing a similar weight over a larger surface, which i find more comfortable to hold, especially in one hand.*  higher resolution (ppi) e-ink screen makes for event better reading*  the screen lighting is much better and is free of the edge spotting that the previous unit suffered from*  the warm screen lighting at night and the ability of scheduling it is a most welcome improvement*  faster page refresh is more responsive*  the interface (ad free for me) is close to the android app version, making for a seamless reading experience for me*  battery life so far has been very good (expected, no big 'plus' there).  Note that I activate airplane mode while traveling to avoid the unit fishing for Wi-Fi while away from its home network.TIP: when traveling, I use my phone hotspot feature\/network if  want to sync my kindle, avoiding unknown or open networks (like at hotels)*  the touch screen is very responsive yet not 'trigger happy', for predictable behaviour and comfortable reading*  Of course, the newer and faster processor makes everything easier.  From operating menus, setting, to turning pagesAll in all, even though the time had come to update my kindle, this 11th gen is better enough to represent a positive upgrade beyond the expectation that a newer model should provide.I am very glad I upgraded to his model.

{"reviewTitle":"Practically Perfect","reviewDescription":"As you probably know, the kindle paperwhite is black and white and is used as a dedicated e-reader for books and other reading material. This device acts like printed media rather than a tablet -- once your book is open there are no ads and no distractions, simply fast reading on a comfortable device.I've upgraded to several generations of kindle paperwhites over ten years. This review is for the 11th generation that came out in 2021. The idea of within a minute retrieving any book in my library or getting a brand new book is simply irresistible.The kindle paperwhite is a great e-reader. Note that it frequently goes on sale so try to time your purchase so you can save $$. These are the things I like about it:* PORTABLEThe kindle paperwhite is small and light and fits easily into my purse, even with a cover.By the way if you get a kindle definitely get a cover as well to protect it. As an added bonus, the cover makes the kindle feel like a slim book while you're reading. There are many attractive covers in addition to the official amazon ones.* WATERPROOFThe kindle paperwhite is waterproof. Indispensable for the pool or bathtub.* EASY ON THE EYESThe screen lighting of the kindle paperwhite is adjustable and reading is pleasant. I prefer to read with black background and white letters. (Settings > Accessibility > Invert Black and White). You can change the brightness by swiping down from the top and finding the \"Brightness\" setting. And don't forget you can change font and text size as well. When your book is open simply touch the top of the screen, select Aa > Font then adjust as you want.Print on the screen is quite clear both in bright sunlight and in a dark room. You can even make the lighting warmer (more yellow) for nighttime reading by swiping down from the top and finding the \"Warmth\" setting.* READ TO YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE AUDIBLEThe text to speech (TTS) feature is my very favorite :-) I love having my kindle read to me so I can do other things like needlework or driving at the same time.TTS works even if you don't have audible books, alexa, or a phone app. Simply connect your bluetooth device  to the kindle (Settings > Wi-Fi & Bluetooth > enable Bluetooth > select your device) then turn it on (Settings > Accessibility > VoiceView Screen Reader). You can adjust the volume and speech rate to your liking.* LONG BATTERY LIFEYes, the battery really lasts for days or weeks. Things like bright screen level, wifi on, and TTS may drain the battery at a faster rate. The kindle uses a C adapter.* PLENTY OF SPACE FOR ALL YOUR BOOKSThe standard kindle paperwhite has 8 GB storage which can store at least 2000 or 3000 ebooks or roughly 35 audible books. You can also get a kindle paperwhite with 16 GB or for even more space for audible books you can get a Signature paperwhite with 32 GB.______As I've gone through several generations of the kindle paperwhite I've noticed that while the physical device continues to get better, I don't like the software as much as previously. Here are three things in particular:* NO GAMESI really really miss the games. These were so fun to play for me and to entertain young ones. Please can we bring supportive software for games back?* KINDLE DEVICE HOME AND LIBRARY SCREENSI hate the Home screen because most of the screen is taken with book recommendations rather than your own library. The top ribbon shows the book covers in order of last opened. You can only see three and a half books so you'll be doing a lot of scrolling if you're looking for a book you read a while ago.The Library screen is a bit better because you can list your books by title or author (three lines at top right screen give you \"Sort by\" screen), but the listings still include book cover thumbnails that take up room. I admit I'm fussy but I like to have a compact list that I can scan quickly rather than needing to scroll through page after page and\/or removing books from my device. (The books are still accessible in the cloud but will need to be reloaded if I want to read them again).* COLLECTIONS IN AMAZON CLOUDSince the beginning until now, Amazon cloud storage uses only one layer of folders. If you have, say, science fiction books and mysteries, you either jumble them together in \"Fiction\" or else you have to make two separate folders that don't link. Please, Amazon, fix this._____Overall while the kindle paperwhite isn't *perfect* it's pretty darn close and lovely to read for books with plain text and images\/photographs. PDFs and more complex images like maps are difficult to see on the small screen and may do better with the Kindle Scribe which is larger. If you want a reader with color and web browser capabilities you may want to consider getting a kindle Fire rather than paperwhite.The kindle paperwhite is a great device for what it is meant to do -- read books -- and for that I will give five stars, although I am keeping my fingers crossed for software updates to make the experience even better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"112 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698278400000}

The Paperwhite feels more book like especially with a book like cover.The reason I\u2019m not giving the device a 5 star review is the disappointment over the TTS.  Had  I known the Paperwhite VoiceView feature (the text to speech) has an annoying click with change of EVERY page I\u2019d have most likely kept my Kindle Fire rather than do a trade in. The TTS feature of the Kindle Fire 8 is seamless between pages. There is no way to turn this click off the Paperwhite which sounds like a click of a ballpoint pen.This clicking disrupts the flow of the page being read and is hard to adapt to for listening to a book initially. I physically cannot hold a book or a heavier reader due to disability. I prefer TTS and use the feature often to fall asleep but not with this clicking. Perhaps I will get use to it. IDK.I feel this is an irritation to get ppl who enjoy the audio feature to invest in Audible, a subscription I can\u2019t afford and does not come will all books.Do better Kindle developers.

{"reviewTitle":"Hardware - Great.  Software - Awful","reviewDescription":"I have buying Kindles since the Kindle 2 back in 2009.  I\u2019ve purchased the K2, K3, Voyage (the best offering IMHO), Oasis (worst offering in my POV), the original Paperwhite, and the 2018 Paperwhite.  This Kindle is a modest improvement over the 2018 Paperwhite.  It starts MUCH faster.  The lighting is great.  And, it\u2019s a little bigger.  The placement of the power button at the bottom has never been an issue for me, so I don\u2019t mind it.  Hardware is fine.My only complaints are related to the software.  Amazon has gotten MUCH more aggressive in pushing content.  Each software \u201cupgrade\u201d makes it worse.  (Same reason I couldn\u2019t stand the Fire tablet & recently ditched the 4K Fire Stick.) I have never really minded ads on the Kindle before because they didn\u2019t interfere with getting to my content and sometimes I found a book I wanted to read.  But recent software updates annoyingly push Amazon content to the forefront, something I resent in a device that I\u2019ve purchased.  I strongly believe the \u201chome\u201d screen should be configured by the customer, rather than  consisting of advertisements!  I paid to have ads removed, but that only impacts the screensaver, so certainly not worth $20.  Let me get rid of ALL ads, and I\u2019d pay three times that!Another complaint is that Amazon randomly pushes updates, and it\u2019s annoying that they can\u2019t be delayed or scheduled!  One more issue \u2014 for heaven\u2019s sake please turn off auto highlights!  They are SO annoying, and the feature is buried, so not intuitive to turn off.  I bet that the percentage of customers who want this feature is tiny, but Amazon continues to default to it.I still love the Kindle and think it\u2019s the best device for reading.  But, I my reservations grow, and I fear that aggressiveness in pushing content will soon ruin it.  If this continues, I will be looking at other options and don\u2019t mind paying more if I can be rid of ads and simply enjoy reading.  If you\u2019re going to charge for a device, then let customers have control of it.  If the device is merely a way to push content (as the Kindle is fast becoming), then give it away to prolific readers.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1639267200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Save your money, use the Kindle app on your phone","reviewDescription":"I upgraded to this device from the 6\u201d Kindle. Nothing wrong with the old one, I just thought this one offered more bells and whistles than the last iteration. Spoiler Alert - it does not.Recently, I finally bit the bullet and began taking advantage of my Audible membership. I like using my Galaxy Note20 Ultra phone to read on because it\u2019s easier to manage, size-wise. The Kindle app for Android is fantastic! It loads in seconds, and it\u2019s very versatile and responsive. And when I use Audible, I can read along with the narrator.When I got my new Paperwhite Kindle, I was excited to do the same thing. However, on the Paperwhite, not only can you NOT read along with the narrator (you\u2019re given the choice of text with no audio, or audio with no text). I\u2019m baffled as to why an app performs better, and has better options than the device itself.Also, there is no speaker on the Paperwhite, so, you\u2019re forced to use a Bluetooth device to enjoy your audiobooks. On my phone, I don\u2019t need to use.an ancillary listening device. With the Paperwhite, you have to touch the very top of of the screen to access an unimpressive menu; on the app, you can touch anywhere on the page, where you can bring up a menu with several more options. With the app, I can also color-code my highlights. I use one color for words I\u2019ve just learned, and another color for key phrases, another color for foreign words, and, yet another for names I want to look up later. You get none of that on the Kindle device.Honestly, the Kindle app has this thing beat in every category. It makes me wonder why I even bought the thing, when the free app is decidedly better in every way, other than screen size.All in all, I actually like the Paperwhite Kindle. However, after forking over $150 (including tax), I still find myself reading on my phone quite a bit. There are times when I\u2019m going out, and carrying two devices can be cumbersome, I obviously opt for my phone over the Kindle as the device I\u2019ll take with me.Dear Amazon, on your next Kindle iteration, please:1) add a speaker to your Kindle2) Give users the option to read along with the narration.

{"reviewTitle":"Easy on the eyes, but slow speed and ads are annoying","reviewDescription":"The flaws are minor compared to the primary benefit\u2014I am able to read much longer before experiencing eye fatigue. The page is easy on the eye\u2014more comfortable than the pages of a book; more comfortable than pages read on the iPad\u2019s shiny surface. In addition, the software is easy to navigate; not too loaded down with features few people would use. You really can read it outside.UPDATE: After using the device for a time, I've downgraded my initial rating a bit. There are quite a few negatives:1. The ads are pointless and endless. They appear on the start-up screen and on the home screen (the latter apparently don't go away, even if you pay for ad removal). They only frustrate and distract. And the very reason many people choose a device dedicated to books is to avoid the distractions posed by modern technology.2. I've repeatedly been sent ads without a swipe option, effectively locking me out of my own device!!! This causes a forced reboot in order to read.2. The font for the note-taking is tiny. It would be helpful if the note-taking font matched the size of the reading font.3. Typing notes is a slow process. The keyboard lags as it searches for predictions. I would like to be able to turn the predictive feature off.4. After highlighting, you must tap the screen to remove the menu. This is okay, except often one highlights, and then taps the side of the screen to advance to the next page. But before one can advance, they must then go back and release the menu. This makes for a lot of unnecessary screen tapping. Can't the device be programmed to realize that, if you're advancing to the next page, you're done with your highlight?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669852800000}

Apparently they didn\u2019t take human factors into consideration during design. In addition, it is very slow and tedious to try and purchase books on the device. Also, the touchscreen sensitivity seems variable; sometimes you touch it and it does nothing, while other times it goes forward several pages at once.On the positive side, the screen has a nice contrast and is easily readable in most lighting situations.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent product but retains one key flaw from previous versions.","reviewDescription":"This is my 9th Kindle since the original, as well as a few others I have gifted. One of the most common negative comments on the previous Paperwhite form factors was the placement of the power button on the bottom of the device, which causes it to shut off when propped up on a table for reading purposes. Relocating this button to the side or top would solve the problem, as would allowing screen rotation 180 degrees. Oddly, although almost every aspect of the Paperwhite has been improved, this remains.My workaround is to purchase a case, such as the inexpensive SFFINE clear case (make sure to order the correct one, as they have several different sizes). This case has a plastic nub that interfaces between the external environment and the Kindle power switch. To be extra certain, you can use a boxcutter or x-acto blade to shave off the protruding part of that nub. You can still turn it on or off with a harder push, but it no longer switches itself off when you prop it up (or turn itself on when you cram it in your backpack). As a bonus, the clear case gives a little more friction on those hard top tables.I have little to add to other reviews in terms of the Kindle device itself. The screen is improved, I like the lighting better, touch seems to work better, and the form factor remains pocketable though pushing the limits there (please don't make this line any larger, Amazon!)Although I find myself reading more Kindle material on my Galaxy Fold 5 (in landscape mode it is able to show two-up pages on the main screen though it will not in portrait mode), the battery life and sun-friendly display of the Kindle still keeps it in my travel bag.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692835200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not as good as my previous Kindle Voyage","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve read about 10 books on this Kindle and have come to this conclusion: the Kindle Paperwhite (PW) is a step down from my Kindle Voyage so I am returning it. If you\u2019ve never used the Voyage, then you will probably love the PW. It is easy to read and the operating system has some nice features that my Voyage does\u2019t. The screen is a slightly larger which most users will see as an advantage. However, it seemed huge to me at first because I was used to a smaller screen.On the PW, you press the page on the right side to turn to the next page, and press it on the left side to return to the previous page. On the Voyage, you can press either side to move forward or backward, which is great if you hold the Kindle with your left had while reading, as I do. On the PW, when holding it with your left hand, you must tap the screen with your right hand or stretch your thumb across the screen to tap it.The response to tapping is still slow. As far as I can tell, there is no speed improvements since I bought my Voyager in 2016.One feature the new PW has is Audible integration. I\u2019m an Audible junkie and enjoy the Whispersync technology. Sometimes I enjoy listening to a book while reading it on the Kindle. Unfortunately, if you use your PW to listen and want to read along, the PW \u201chighlights\u201d the words. It is very distracting and I could find no way to shut it off. Also, if you are listening while reading along, and you flip back a page to glance at something, the narration will jump to that page, which is frustrating. In addition, if you like to listen to Audible and 1.5x, the PW does a terrible job. All in all, I think it is best to avoid using this PW for audible.I purchased the bundle which included the case. The case is nothing to brag about. My Voyager case folds so the Kindle will be slightly slanted if you sit it on a table to read.Also, I see no reason to pay extra for additional memory. Kindle books take up very little memory and it is quick and easy to download them when you are connected to WiFi.If you\u2019ve never used a Kindle or only use to the low end Kindles, this is the Kindle for you.

{"reviewTitle":"A little disappointed with the Kindle","reviewDescription":"Mixed feelings concerning my purchase of the Kindle Paperwhite. I find the Kindle to be transportable and easy to read. The screen is functional, but clumsy. Battery life is still under evaluation since I\u2019m a new user of Kindle\u2019s. And the book cover I purchased works well. The physical human factors, i.e., ergonomics, of the Kindle are quite nice.What I find clumsy with the Kindle:The major disappoints are based on my personal needs - the reasons why I purchased the Kindle.I require the ability to reference a lot of technical material, e.g., books. Which is why I purchased the Kindle. It allows me to transport and access more reference books easily.Unfortunately, too many of my math books couldn\u2019t be downloaded on the Kindle. That\u2019s a major disappointment and defeats the purpose of the buy. It is my hope that that deficiency is corrected in the near future. All Amazon purchased ebooks should be compatible with the Kindle. If not, that incompatibility should be easily communicated before purchase.Book downloads appear to be manual. When the system sync\u2019s it should automatically download and load the books. My Paperwhite doesn\u2019t do that automatically. I had to literally download each book individually. Add that to poor screen response and you see the problem. It\u2019s a pain for users with many books, repetitive, and time consuming.Screen response is slow and clumsy. Too slow for, supposedly, the latest generation Kindle. Moreover, touch screen response is fickly. May I suggest the designation of specific spots on the screen to activate certain commands like bookmarks? You have to hit the screen just right. Add to highlight and dictionary function is very clumsy with poor response.Overall, Out of five I give the Kindle a 3 rating. I am a little disappointed with its functionality considering the length of time the product has been on the market.

{"reviewTitle":"Adjustable Bold Font Is A Fabulous Feature!","reviewDescription":"14 months review: Mine works perfectly. I also gave one as a gift. Newest model in Aug 2022.If yours has ANY problem, exchange it promptly. I'm writing this after hearing about a problem device.I am immensely pleased with the PageTurnerz Grip, an additional purchase, see the notes for why I needed this grip.Usability notes for Amazon:* The adjustable BOLD in the font settings is FABULOUS. I set it to 4 in the first few days and never looked back. I've never used the alternate Amber light.* The bezel or frame width on the sides simply does not allow laying in bed holding it, a thumb will inadvertently flip the pages, it's impossible for me to read laying down without the grip I purchased extra. You CAN try to hold it with the thumb on the bottom, but the need for page turning will become inconvenient and \/ or monotonous.* I don't know why the awake switch and the charging port on the \"bottom\" are arranged this way, with the awaken switch being off-center but the charge port centered. The switch is used every single time to awaken this device, so that should be centered. Conversely, the rarely used charging port does not need to be centered. This is weird logic in usability.* The reading settings for Layout \/ Orientation only rotates in one direction, a quarter turn to the right, placing the wide bezel frame under the left thumb, unless Amazon can improve this in the software. The reason it should rotate in both directions is that the bezel space on the \"bottom\" is wide enough to hold it under a thumb without flipping the pages by accident, see my first issue. If I wanted to hold it ONLY with my left hand, the thumb won't be turning the pages by accident. However upon my first trial, I realized that I hold my readers in my right hand nearly always, hence this observation for Amazon.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697932800000}

I\u2019m lucky she didn\u2019t break off and swallow any pieces.Knowing Prime Day in July was approaching, I impatiently waited thinking I could get a new kindle for a better price than was listed.I wasn\u2019t disappointed. I bought it with ads and 3 months of Kindle Unlimited for $50 off the regular price.  Readers who are afraid of a Kindle with ads don\u2019t need to be.  The ads appear when you open the Kindle and appear on the bottom of the page. Once you open a book, all ads disappear and DO NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR READING.  I stress this because it seems people unnecessarily pay more for a kindle without ads when they don\u2019t need to.I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I have a different internet provider or if it\u2019s the new paper white, but books download in less than 5 seconds, which is great because I have hundred of books on it.One thing about the old paper white I didn\u2019t like was that if you made a collection, the books still remained on the list in the main library, so they\u2019re on the kindle twice taking up unnecessary storage space. I haven\u2019t made any collections yet as I\u2019m still downloading the hundreds of books from my Amazon account that I\u2019ve collected since my first kindle many many years ago.While I\u2019m a lover of real books, I had to stopbuying them because I have no more room. I have one bookcase with a complete set of Stephen King books in hardcover, and another bookcase with various books I\u2019ve kept - science, bios, history - but everything now is on my Kindle.  I love it because I can stick it my purse and it doesn\u2019t really add any extra weight.  This is important because I\u2019ve had 2 surgeries on each arm following a car accident, so my arms are not as strong as they used to be.I also use my kindle to borrow library books. What\u2019s great about it is you don\u2019t have to run to the library in the middle of a snow storm to return a book that\u2019s due. If you don\u2019t return the book yourself, kindle returns it and it disappears from your kindle.And then there\u2019re the free books offered by Amazon. I downloaded the complete set of Dickens\u2019 works - for free.  I can\u2019t even begin to tell you the number of classics I\u2019ve downloaded for free as well. I\u2019ll probably die before I read everything on my Kindle!One thing I would never do is leave my kindle unprotected without using a cover.  I have no intention of using my new kindle until the cover comes tomorrow.  I\u2019m notorious for carelessness  - my second iPad was only 18 months old when \u201csomehow\u201d the screen cracked - and it had a protective case.

{"reviewTitle":"Kindle 8GB versus 32GB","reviewDescription":"Kindle Signature Paperwhite plus Charging StandI own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here\u2019s some of my particular findings in use.Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don\u2019t like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device.  I purchased the \u201cMoKo Case for 6.8\" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear\u201d from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off.  Thus, having Qi charging is helpful\u2026not mandatory but helpful.  Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS.  The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded \u201coff-line\u201d reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.Auto-light adjust: I can\u2019t even detect that it\u2019s doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature.  Even those that wouldn\u2019t pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as \u201cicing on the cake\u201d for the price difference.  I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the \u201cwith ads\u201d version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model.  And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly.  It does work with my \u201cMoKo Case for 6.8\" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear\u201d., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I\u2019m watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand.  I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model.  I find no issues with the size of the \u201cwall wart\u201d or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge.  A \u201cwork around\u201d for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.I\u2019ve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I\u2019m a \u201cpower user\u201d. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers.  If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better\u2026that is, darker text, whiter background.

{"reviewTitle":"Best investment ive ever made!","reviewDescription":"I was never one to jump on the kindle bandwagon. I have friends who are in book clubs and sometimes they recommend books for me to read. I dont have a lot of space to hoard physical books so I would read them on my phone or get the book from the library if available. Until one day my one friend got me thinking HARD about a kindle. My birthday was quickly approaching and what a great excuse to get myself a gift. I did my research on all the different kindles. Ive looked around different places, Ive watched some youtube videos on different ones, and I even talked to different friends who had different ones or had used different ones throughout time. I settled on the kindle paperwhite and I havent put it down since! Ive had this thing 4 months now and still havent even made a smidge in the memory. I got the bigger GB because i know I have a lot of digital book doc's as well and wanted to upload them. Currently have over 200 books on it (thanks stuff my kindle day) and hasnt even made a dent in the memory! im impressed!-You can changed the font and font size (you can also upload your own fonts too to use)-There are ways you can even add a background for when its asleep (youtube it). ive done both.-When you start a book itll ask you if you want to update your goodreads to \"currently reading\" and when you're done with the book itll ask you if you want to rate it! (1-5 stars).-You can create categories to organize your ebooks.-When you have a book AND the audible for the same book, itll keep track in your book if you listen without reading or vise versa. It keeps your current spot!-The light and the warmth are perfect! You can adjust either to your preference and even set a time for them to change. so for example, if you wanted the light to be a little dimmer and the warmth to be stronger at 8pm, you can set those changes to happen automatically daily!-Battery life is astonishing. For someone who reads every day sometimes both in the morning and at night (for hours straight sometimes) and I like to have the brightness sorta up so i can read better in darker areas, i can go weeks without charging it. it says up to 5 weeks without charging but with how much I use it, I would estimate maybe once every 2-3 weeks i gotta charge it. and it doesnt take very long to charge either!-Perfect size too! I love how thin it is and light weight. I get cute cases for it and just looks like the size of A5 notbook. its only roughly 6\" and its so perfect to bring along on trips or outback in the hammock!-Oh another thing about the light, since its not an LED scree, when you go out in the sun, the screen looks lighter! Like its not dark like your phone would be when you step outside. the sun lights it up like it would be if you were holding a physical book!-P.S. its waterproof. have fun reading in the baths, floating in the pool or with your feet in the sand at the beach!I could go on and on about how much I love it. I just wanted to tell you all the things that sold me on a kindle all together. Its honestly the best! Even came with 3months free of Kindle Unlimited which I too am a huge fan of now! worth every penny!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"237 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706400000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Perfect upgrade","reviewDescription":"I got the Kindle Paperwhite - Agave Green about a week ago and I LOVE this thing. I am upgrading from a 2015 Paperwhite (7th gen) that I used the 20% trade-in credit promo for to upgrade to the new Paperwhite. This new one is soooo much more snappy so the CPU and RAM upgrade alone was worth it. The Agave Green is an awesome color and I definitely recommend, I feel like it hides dust and fingerprints more than Black anyway.It took a bit getting used to larger size going from 6\" screen to 6.8\" but I'm glad to have the bigger screen. I bought a set of 'Sage Green' Strapsicles and they match the Agave Green Kindle perfectly and make it a joy to hold. I only use one of the straps but even with my small hands it made the 6.8\" Kindle Paperwhite easily usable one-handed so I definitely recommend it.Having Warm Light and Dark Mode over my old Kindle are huge and my eyes thank me. 16GB is probably more than I needed since that's many thousands of books but it was only $10 more than the 8GB model so why not.Custom fonts work great, just like the 2015 Kindle. Atkinson Hyperlegible Pro is my favorite at the moment.Works slick with Calibre for side-loading and you can use \"Kindle Oasis\" profile to get the closest resolution on Output.Very happy with this new Kindle and glad I went with this. Basic is a nice size and all but the Warm Light is a deal breaker on losing to me after having used it.

{"reviewTitle":"Reducing eye strain for the win","reviewDescription":"I owned a Kindle WAY back in the day - when they first came out. It died because I forgot about it and its screen froze (poor thing). I have been reading on iPad, phone, or computer but that has been causing eye strain and the weight on my forearm was becoming an issue with my newest phone.I researched the different Kindle types (really want to be given a Scribe version but that was not the answer to resolving my concerns). Looked into Paperwhite and chose this version because of the C-type charger and a few other features.I waited impatiently to receive. The first thing I did was put a screenprotector on it so it didn't get smudged. There was a 57% charge. It was fairly easy to pull over my existing account using QR code on screen to link. There are certain things that are different from app - lack of color (which is fine) and some functionality.Overall I like it. These are the things that I have concern over - not sure if it is THIS one or all of them or user-error. The charge seems to go much faster than I remember was it because I used it for an hour before fully charging? I like the Dark-mode. sometimes when I change pages it flashes regular mode, why? The highlighting feature sometimes irritates me because it is always giving huge banner of options - I think on phone it just doesn't seem to overwhelm the screen as much. I thought on the kindle EVERY book could read to you (not fancy voices - just AI) but I can't seem to find the option. I remember it from my old version. I am having to learn where to press or slide to get action want since this is simpler than options you have on a phone but I am getting the hang of it.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I am hoping the battery will sort itself out because I would never get weeks out of it and if I can get it to quit flashing white.-----------------------------------------------------The Collections option is okay but it doesn't show all of the things I have in the collection. I have a HUGE library so maybe it didn't pull them all over? I wish that Amz would create an export list for all books - like Title, Author, pub date, purchase date $ paid - one so you could import into goodreads or bookbub as owned (not want to read but Owned) or have as records to add notes when you have a massive collection.I also wish that there was a way to ARCHIVE BOOKS (NOT DELETE FOREVER) ones that you did not want to download on any devices. Like ones that you have read but are 99% sure will never read again or ones that you are currently not interested but don't want to see. Then if you ever need the book and do a search in Content\/devices, you could find it and send to a device that way.Also, it would be great if there were some default collections. Read, Archived (see above), Samples, Nonfiction, Fiction. Also would love if screensaver had time and battery down by swipe up. Would be great. and a search function for ADD collections (like in app).(msg for Amazon) - thanks. :)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697932800000}

I\u2019ve had 3 in the last 10 years. I never had any issues with any of them, just took advantage of Black Friday and trade in deals. The easy to access books is by far the greatest pro with a paper white. I receive a year long subscription for KindleUnlimited every Christmas and that alone has saved me THOUSANDS of dollars every year. Reading 2-4 books a week, even if buying used physical books, that cost really adds up. After the 5th or 6th book read on KU, you\u2019ve justified the cost for the year. Taking advantage of \u201cstuff your kindle days\u201d is also another great way to get free books. When ordering from Amazon, if you check the shipping options, you often have an option for a slightly later delivery date to receive a digital credit. I use that option to save up and buy books that aren\u2019t available in the KU library and has a ridiculously long wait time on the Libby app. My kindle goes everywhere with me. It\u2019s a necessity just like a cellphone, keys, and water cup to me. It\u2019s extremely lightweight, has tons of adorable, sturdy cases available, and you can have dozens of books downloaded when you may not have internet available to download a new book after finishing one.

This is the largest Kindle--and I have the smallest hands--so holding it with one hand, I've always been able to simply use my thumb to advance to the next page by tapping near the right margin.

As of this moment, regarding the current product I am using, the same repeated shut down problem has occurred so many times since receiving it on February 9, 2024, as had happened with all the previous units I received from May, 2023 and October 2023 and the one just received.  I cannot believe that since started using it, this most recent unit has proved no better than the other two.  I am sending this review in hopes that someone will explain why others have had this or other issues with this version of the Kindle but nothing seems to have changed.  Why should a Kindle fully charged shut down after 5 minutes or 10 minutes of reading time?  I haven't left it open unattended....I am just reading and it suddenly shuts down!!  Someone please pay attention as I close to the month since purchased and need to find out what is the next step!  Where is the quality so often touted by Amazon for their own products?  PLEASE RESPOND NOW!!!!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708646400000}
{"reviewTitle":"I have 2 older ones and was excited that they finally updated it.  But I'm extremely disappointed.","reviewDescription":"Hi everyone,so I'm a voracious reader and have at least a thousand books on my kindles.  I actually own 3, all synced together because I travel a ton and keep one in my travel bag. I stays on my nightstand and one is at the office.  All 3 are the paperwhite models.  I really have loved them.  Anyway, I get this model as soon as it came out.  It has some strange hang ups, like when I step away for a bit and it goes into sleep mode or close the cover, and when I return and swipe to turn it on, it goes to a page between 50 and 100 pages back, so then of course I have to search for where I was.  It's extremely annoying and my 2 other kindles have not done this. There is no option that says return to the last page read or something like that.  This is driving me crazy.  Anyway, yesterday it completely froze.  So of course I pushed and held the power button to restart it.  I did this and it came back on eventually but frozen to the scene with the boy reading against the tree.  I can't get past this.  I tried to restart it and it does nothing.  I tried plugging it in to the power cable and still nothing.  It is charged to about 40%.  I called customer service and after about 30 MINUTES trouble shooting,  they said they would process the return and exchange for a new one, but that it would come in 3 days.  I don't understand why the delay.  I'm in the hospital and literally have nothing to do because I only love to read in my free time. I don't watch tv and can't read on my phone for hours because it's not comfortable, which is why I have 3 kindles and also it depletes my phone battery.Anyway, after explaining all this to the rep, they said they would ask a lead about giving me some kind of compensation (anything) because of the inconvenience. He then said he would have to get back to me the next day.  I got an email from amazon regarding the issue but it didn't say anything about the resolution, so I  had to call them again.  And finally they said they can't do anything because they had processed the exchange, as if they were doing me a favor, when it has a year warranty and I got it at the end of october.  Thus it's totally under warranty and therefore they have to replace it because it's defective.  Honestly this whole experience has left me with such a bad taste that I'm actually considering canceling my prime membership.  Stay clear is my recommendation and avoid both Amazon and their products because they are not what they used to be, both in quality and customer service.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"78 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1645056000000}

That Kindle broke within three weeks. The screen just went half black and you could no longer read on it.  Finally, the replacement Kindle came and we used it for less than three months before it also stopped turning on.  Now, Amazon is telling me it is out of warranty and can't be replaced.

{"reviewTitle":"Too big for one-handed use, hair-trigger power button, though warm screen is nice","reviewDescription":"This is my 3rd kindle over ten years, and I've been a long time fan\/user. In short - if you carry your kindle everywhere with you like I do then the bigger size of this unit and the hair-trigger power buttons are both net problems.For size: this is constantly falling out of my pockets and is uncomfortable when holding with one hand. The smaller legacy devices for the Paperwhite\/Voyage\/etc. all comfortably fit into the back pocket of my (men's) pants. That's out the window now. Best case I get about 2\/3 of this unit and then it feels like I'm carrying around textbook wedged in there. It also no longer fits entirely into most of my coat pockets (side or breast pockets), so I have it hanging out on pockets where my old devices fit fine. As a result - I've had this for about two weeks and have dropped it a dozen times just sitting on a chair or in the car.For the power button: this is constantly turning on in my pocket despite my efforts to not press the button. The screen sensitivity is also such that I have had to walk back 10-20 pages in whatever book I'm reading. I've been reading a book or two per month on kindle for 10 years and, though this has happened to me once in a while, it is frustratingly common so far with this new one.Lastly - both of these issues combine to make single handed reading for right-handed folks a cramp-inducing mess. For better or worse there's not much bezel area to pinch to hold the device up without accidental page turns. The side effect is that I naturally start to prop up the device with my pinky finger, which then hits the power button and turns off the screen. I have to hold much of the weight of the device on just the tip of my pinky finger (which gets painful) or otherwise use it two handed \/ propped up.I really wanted to like this device for the warm light, and that feature is a great relief, but I'm having trouble overcoming the discomfort\/inconvenience of not being able to throw it in my back pocket and then pull it out to read one handed while waiting in line or laying on the couch. I don't know if I'll keep it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679270400000}
{"reviewTitle":"I don't like it","reviewDescription":"I do not like the new kindle white as compared to my old kindle that will no longer be able to receive new books.  What is wrong with having page turners that you click forward or backward as opposed to touch screen.  I am used to being able to switch hands on my kindle.  Now if I need to turn a page forward with my left hand, I have to cross my body to do so.  And as long as we are on the subject of turning pages, what is with this new kindle white with going either forward or backward several chapters every time you power down.  When you get back to your book, you can't tell where you are.  Plus I used to be able to move my books into different categories, like  Already Read, Good Books, Save for Next Books.  If I add a book to the Already Read category now, it still sits there in my \"Library\".  I do not delete books for any reason although some do end up being archived to Amazon's cloud.  And what is with this nonsense of purchasing a book, but it doesn't download to your kindle.  Instead of downloading a new book, just the title downloads and you have to manually check the internet connection, then check the airplane mode.  Even then any other books you have just purchased do not get downloaded at the same time as the one you are wanting to read.  I think my last rant is the way this thing lists your books.  Either it is a picture with the title and author, or a list with the title and author and some other stuff that just takes up space that I would rather have for the list of my available books to read.  This darn thing downloaded every title I have ever bought.  All 596 of them.  I am sure that most of these were archived.  Is that stupid or what!  What do I like about the kindle white?  I can adjust the size of the letters to what I prefer.  Other than that, I can not find anything else I like about this thing.  oh yes, it also eats my battery power because either I left wi-fi on or I left airplane mode off or some stupid thing.

{"reviewTitle":"Great looking Kindle with serious reliability issues","reviewDescription":"Quick summary: This Kindle provides a lovely reading experience, but has software issues; I'm on my second replacement.I\u2019ve been reading on Kindles since 2009. The 6.8\" version of the Kindle Paperwhite is my 4th Kindle, so I typically have Kindles them for about 2-3 years before getting sucked in by a shiny new model. Usually, my old Kindle is still functioning fine at that point, and I hand it down to one of my kids.The 6.8\u201d Kindle paperwhite has been a stark departure from the reliability I\u2019m used to. I received one as a Christmas gift in 2021, and was initially very happy. I love the design updates, the wider screen, and the warmth screen features. I wasn\u2019t crazy about the size (a little too big to hold comfortably), but that problem is easily solved with a case or a pop socket.After about two months of reading, my book froze. I went to the home screen to discover my library had disappeared (still in Amazon, just gone from the Kindle). I attempted to reboot, and the Kindle got stuck in an endless reboot cycle. It would load up to the screen with the tree, freeze (it never showed the progress bar), shut itself off, and try to restart again\u2026 until the battery ran out.I called Amazon customer service in late February and had outstanding help. I returned my broken Kindle, received a replacement, and was once again happily reading. The replacement worked for about 1.5 months until one night my book froze and\u2026 I had another endlessly rebooting Kindle. The exact same problem.I contacted customer service again in May and asked to return the Kindle, planning to buy an older model with the refund. I was told I was out of the 30 day return window, and all they could offer was a replacement.I appreciate the second replacement, which is on its way, but now every time I\u2019m reading I\u2019ll be wondering if this is the day my book freezes and I'm on the phone with customer service again...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1651622400000}

The hand-model's thumb while holding the Kindle is in an awkward position. Your thumb will normally be at an angle in line with the angle of your index finger behind the Kindle, not straight up and down like the hand model's thumb. But you CAN'T PUT YOUR THUMB AT AN ANGLE BECAUSE THE BEZELS ARE TOO THIN AND IF YOU DO THE PAGE WILL TURN.I've used Kindle e-readers for close to a decade. This was a Christmas gift that I was excited to receive, but found it almost unusable.E-readers are held in two different ways:(1) LIGHT-GRIP -- HOLDING IT LIKE A DINNER PLATE: When you're sitting in a chair or at a table and you know you don't need to keep the e-reader from falling out of your hand you hold it with a LIGHT GRIP like you're holding a dinner plate. Your thumbs and fingers are barely brushing the side because gravity is doing the work of keeping the kindle in your hand.  In this situation the bezels don't matter.(2) FIRM GRIP -- HOLDING IT LIKE A FRISBEE (aka flying disk):  for all other occasions and ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT WITH ONLY ONE HAND or reading at night while lying in bed you hold it with a FIRM GRIP which means your thumb needs to be somewhere on top of the screen.  With the older kindles this was easy to do because the bezels were wide enough that you could rest your thumb and not worry about turning the page. WITH THIS KINDLE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD IT WITH A FIRM GRIP AND NOT TURN THE PAGE.Very disappointed.

But this is where the pros stop for me. I currently use a 2014 paper white and wanted to get this new 2021 upgraded unit. However, I find this new unit has a very soft almost fuzzy screen.

But they don\u2019t!E-ink technology is getting worse, the letters on my older model are so sharp, crisp and clear and look like they\u2019re almost floating on the background. On this new model they more or less just blend in with the fuzzy background. I\u2019ve read that is because they made the screen flush on this model and that involves adding more layers of plastic which dull the contrast.It\u2019s a real shame that people new to E-readers think that this is a such great device. Don\u2019t get me wrong it has some great attributes, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about the display quality and when you have something to compare it with, this new model doesn\u2019t deliver.New Paperwhite on left and old 2014 on right, same font and lighting settings, unfortunately the picture doesn\u2019t really come through well.I ended up with a Kobo Libra 2, the screen contrast is brilliant and I like the software better than kindle","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"51 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636675200000}

{"reviewTitle":"AWESOME except for missing features and poor dark mode","reviewDescription":"This thing performs so well in daylight and I look forward to reading more books outside regardless of sunlight conditions!  So if that's what you're looking for, this is your device.However, at night I like to read in Dark Mode (or reverse with white lettering on black background) and that is one are that this falls short.  I'm sure it has to do with how they designed the screen to be so good in daylight.  But when you switch it to Dark Mode, you get a washed out black background (let's call it gray or grey, whichever your preference).  So you don't get the sharp contrast that you will find with the other devices (e.g. iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android) that have a black background in reverse screen but suck in daylight viewing.  So it looks like I'll use the iPad mini for night reading and use the Paperwhite Kindle for daytime reading.  Not my preference, but that's the price to be paid for awesome daylight viewing.The second area that it falls short is that there are NO options to change the font size, etc.  So if you can accept that this displays pages much like a printed book where you get the font size, style and spacing as the publisher printed it, then you'll be fine.  I'm just familiar with the Kindle app on other devices where you can personalize the layout for better viewing.  I've looked high and low in the few setting selections that it comes with and I found nothing for that.  So I've decided to treat it like a printed novel where you have no choices on how it was printed, even though it is an electronic display.  Just imagine that it is printed paper and you'll be fine.The setting selections are very minimal.  It would be nice if you could select to have the time display on the bottom margin along with the page number and percentage complete, in my opinion.  Some people don't want to have that in view, but I'm often reading while waiting for brief periods of time and would like to keep an eye on the time without having to swipe the screen to view the time - which it is viewable (along with the date) on the quick settings display when you swipe down on the screen.This device is obviously optimized for daytime reading and it shines in that realm where other devices can't come close.  For a simple reading platform with no bells and whistles, it can't be beat - except in Dark Mode.  :-)UPDATED 7\/26\/22:  OK, I accidentally found where you can adjust the font size and select to have the time displayed or not.  Oddly you have to do a small swipe from the top to display that portion.  Apparently my swipes were always too aggressive and when I swiped a couple of inches, I would get the simple setting screen that didn't have those display options.After finding that I can get to the settings I was looking for by doing a short swipe, I added a star back onto my rating.  Still not able to give it the full five stars because the Dark Mode underperforms to my liking, but that is one small detriment when compared to how well it performs in daylight.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658016000000}

Granted for me the \"download\" things from Kindle are confusing at times. But with only a couple days in, I'm learning.I also wanted the ease of reading in bed.Here are some things I have taken note on.This is cheaper than the NOOK line. And I have had a nook before, several years ago(the nook still works but slow), and they seem similar but the access of books is easier (for me) with Amazon.The touch screen is responsive. There is a slight delay but really it's not that breaking for me.I went with the papaerwhite because of the \"warm light\". I can't do LED full on, all my devices have blue light filters\/warm light, ON nearly all the way. So for me that was huge!You CANNOT download apps to this, strictly books from the Kindle library. There was a update for my new one, for the software. (I checked for an update right after starting it) Which I'm not sure what it did but I CAN DOWNLOAD BOOKS DIRECTLY FROM MY KINDLE, FROM THE KINDLE LIBRARY! Some people said you couldn't, with mine and the update I can.It's lightweight which is awesome for holding it up at night or in the car. It's also waterproof, so bathtub reading is there, or beach\/pool.You can also use your Kindle app to download books to your Kindle wherever you are at.You can get Libby and send borrowed books to the Kindle. Again you CANNOT download apps to this Kindle, you have to have Libby on another device and set up your kindle within the app.I have the ads on mine, it hasn't been disruptive at all.Reading has been comfortable.

I like the magazines. Though remember this is strictly black and white so no color pages or pictures.No headphone jack which is sucky (yes I know less places to get water in) but it does have Bluetooth for headphones.Mmmm....what else.......Really for an e-reader, my opinion, this is a great option.

{"reviewTitle":"Slowly getting used to it.","reviewDescription":"The only thing that got me to upgrade to this kindle from my 3rd gen kindle was that my older version's battery stopped taking a charge. It was like losing a faithful pet and facing the uncertainty of a new one living up to the standards set by the one you lost.I'm a bit of a luddite when it comes to electronics and prefer them to be as simple as possible. I still prefer holding a paperback novel, but I've come to enjoy the portability a Kindle brings to one's book collection. I hate the constant need to re-learn new software, though, hence my resistance to upgrading until I had to.If you are anything like me, I can assure you that there are features on this version of Paperwhite that will grow on you even as you miss features you no longer have. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:-Backlighting and its adjustability makes for comfortable reading, especially in the dark if your partner is sleeping next to you. I used to have to get up and go to another room because my old Kindle had no lighting.-good battery life, especially if you keep it in airplane mode unless you are downloading a book.-Your library list tells which books in your collection you have already read, which are partially read, and which are new. Not a critical feature, but nice. I wish they would tell you which one they are in a series, though. That would be even more helpful.Cons:-This Kindle doesn't have has much area around the screen to hold the kindle without accidentally touching the screen and turning pages when you don't want to. A case is a must to help with this, but that adds weight to holding it. It makes me miss the buttons on my gen 3 Kindle.-I don't care for the icons for book titles when you are searching for a book. It's attractive, but the artwork makes titles harder to read when they are so small and this version doesn't let you switch to get a simple typed list view. I've tried and searched on line for help to be able to do this, but none seem to apply to this version. You also have to do a lot more scrolling because only 6 icons fit on a screen at a time.-Trying to find what you are looking for can be like getting through a phone tree. It takes too long to find what you need. Maybe it would be an easier transition for customers not using a Kindle as old as mine was, but after several months, I still find I have to really hunt to remember where a feature is.-No More Whispernet! You have to be around a router to download books. I don't travel as much as I used to, but the ability to download a book in a moving car was a wonderful thing and I know I will miss that. --I'm not crazy about the extra step to download a book after I purchase it, either.

{"reviewTitle":"Very Glad that I finally bought one, but a few minor annoyances","reviewDescription":"Overall, I LOVE my new kindle paperwhite. Can't stress enough that it really has overall been a great purchase. I love having a dedicated e-reading device as other things don't interupt and distract my reading time, etc... I now refuse to read e-books on any other device as I much prefer reading on my Kindle.Pros:-Absolutely love the adjustable warm\/blue light options and dark\/light mode (as I can read comfortably in the dark without disturbing others)-In love with the fact its waterproof so I can read in the tub\/pool\/etc...-wifi connectivity awesome feature-The kindle store experience isn't as good as it is on a tablet\/smart phone but was way better than expected-size and weight are just right for holding and reading.-I've read it several hours a day and the battery still managed to last at least a week plus. And if I don't read as often and leave it in airplane mode with bluetooth off it lasts a very, very, very long time without re-charging. So no complaints there.Cons:- Biggest con is as of 2022 kindle paperwhite doesn't support immersion reading (i.e., listening to audiobook and seeing book text at the same time) you can only do one or the other\/switch between the two. As an exclusive e-reading device I was very disappointed it doesn't support this particular feature.-It occasionally glitches either skipping ahead by several pages, or makes me tap\/swipe a few times when I attempt to navigate backwards in my book. Its not a deal breaker as it happens rarely but still can be slightly annoying at times. This may also improve with updates in the future.-The screen does smudge quite easily\/noticably but when reading you can't really tell-a little sad it doesn't have its own speakers to listen to audiobooks, but I knew this buying it and it does connect well to my bluetooth devices. Also, not including internal speakers does keep it very slim which is nice.-There are one or two e-books I own that \"aren't formatted\" for the kindle so I can't read them, but its quite rare. Also I wouldn't recommend reading comic books, graphic novels, or childrens picture books on a kindle as they are all black and white and don't show color (and the pages are smaller and text can be quite difficult to read) However none of these books really read well on normal tablets\/smartphones either as they are usually best as hard copies. That being said my toddler still enjoyed reading the one or two kids picture e-books I do own on the device. But its best and really designed for text only chapter books for older kids\/adults.Other comments: other reviewers mentioned that the power button is not in a good location as its on the bottom of the device. They stated they occasionally accidentally turn it off while reading (especially if you hold it right handed). I agree its in a bad spot\/is slightly inconvenient but it hasn't caused me to accidentally turn it off. So overall this hasn't been an issue for me.Overall I would buy it again, and I would definitely purchase the paperwhite over the standard kindle if you can afford to (although the standard is still a good experience).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1653696000000}

If I decide to try to find a book in my library or need to visit the Kindle store?  Might as well be using dial-up speeds.

They just rebooted themselves over and over until their batteries ultimately dies.To add insult to injury, in both cases, Amazon support also would not honor the return.  They said the return period closed.  I had to fight for hours with Amazon support to get a refund under the \" 1 year warranty\" and even then it wasn't a full refund.  They made me purchase  a new one (at a newer, higher price) and then made me call back to get the original refunded at the lower purchase price.  I was out an additional $35 and a month later still had  a second broken kindle.Again - I love the original paperwhite's but these new ones are junk and Amazon wont help you when they fail in  a month.

The screen lights evenly and the increased size is pretty wonderful. It feels more \"real book\" size. The battery life seems excellent. One of the biggest nudges for me was that my old Paperwhite was starting to fall short. I would have to charge it after every book or so. The new one (Refurbished) used about 20% for a Brandon Sanderson book. Those are pretty quick reads, I would figure that was about 8 hours of use. Much better than the old one.My biggest complaint is that they went away from the inset screen, with the portion surrounding the reading area being part of the front screen. Fingerprints love it and it's easier to accidentally get them on the reading portion. The back also seems prone to acquiring a scuffed jean like appearance on the corners. At least, that's what I can figure from the refurbished one I received. It is why I moved to a new one. I didn't have any issues with the use of the refurbished model, but I'm unsure how much use is required to put those kinds of marks on the device, and would like to keep this one for a very long time.The comfort of holding the device is perfect. I didn't actually want to buy another e-reader. I have a 10\" Boox Note Air that reads great, but is awkward hold for casual reading.

Nothing like paper as people had described it. So, I traded it in (got 20% off plus an extra $5 for the old device) and forked out the bucks for this new Paperwhite. And oh my. It is way more pleasant to read on. Even when I'm reading in a well lit area, I prefer the warm light on vs the light completely off where the screen is more of a gray color. I'm still keeping my basic to use when I travel because it is smaller and more convenient to pocket and hold. However, at home this Paperwhite is such a joy to use. The bigger size and weight isn't an issue. Not having raised bevels to make it easier to hold.... Also not an issue. I just plop it on a phone stand and I'm good to go.

Even if I do, it's so much lighter than a book! I love being able to highlight and then collect my highlights at the end and send them to my email. I like that reading doesn't affect my eyes the way blue light does, so I can read right up until bedtime, which is a problem with a tablet or phone. (I don't know why the makers of e-readers don't emphasize this more; most of my friends weren't aware of this advantage.) I bought this model because my previous one would not maintain the page I was reading when I stopped, and it was losing battery life, which I guessed was causing that problem. It has one flaw for a reader like me: the switch being on the bottom of the reader prevents standing it up in the holders that I previously used, and most of those that I shopped for on Amazon. Essentially, resting the reader on the switch turns it off. I finally found a small foam pillow to hold the reader, which has a groove with a slit at the bottom and doesn't put pressure on the switch.

Its battery was starting to hold it's charge for shorter and shorter times.Functionally, it still works fine, if I disregard the now-degraded battery life.  I use it daily, averaging over an hour of use.This new Kindle is a bit of a mixed-bag.The return window on it has just closed, so my dithering on whether or not to return it is now moot.I read some feedback suggesting that the display, while higher-dot-pitch, was a bit fuzzy (due to the flush touch-screen) and seemed to be something of a fingerprint magnet.  I discounted those comments before purchasing.I was surprised to discover that the fingerprint issue *is* a real thing and can, at times, be distracting.  The slight degradation in clarity seems to be balanced off against the higher dot-pitch.  This goes hand-in-hand with the flush-front design.  I'd like it more without the fingerprints being so much more noticeable.After a month, the charge on the new unit dropped low enough for me to plug it in for a full charge.  Their published battery-life estimates have always been based on what I consider very light usage levels.  But certainly reasonable and easy to extrapolate battery lifetime with heavier usage.One of the worst parts of the Kindle experience from the beginning is the totally tone-deaf view of the readers by the software development team (or, more accurately, their management).  They actively go out of their way to deny the end user the ability to customize their Kindles.  Locking down the system to prevent any third-party software access.  (\"have [it] painted any color he wants as long as it's black\")I was greatly saddened when I discovered that the current generation of the reader OS has been hardened enough to so-far stymied the developer community.I look forward to the day they break it.  And break it hard.My original Paperwhite has been jailbroken\/hacked\/rooted\/customized so I could tweak its settings.  And it's been in airplane mode for a decade.  I side-load everything I read.  *Nothing* goes over the air.I like reading with *very* little margin on the page.  I already have a quarter-inch bezel on the device, I want to put more words on the page, narrowing the side margins even more than the narrowest option currently available to the native operating system.  My old PW is set that way.I like having custom lock-screen images on my unit.  I have a directory full of images in the original that get randomly shuffled and picked each time the lock screen comes up.  The new unit has the original tiny collection provided by the OS that feels old after a month with no access to the storage directory.How difficult would it be to give access to an image directory for the end user with the desire to do so?  *That* should be easy to implement.  It's not like that would be a directory full of executables.If someone can tickle the unit into *executing code through an image file*, then your team might want to reconsider being in the OS business.It also seems like the price differential between the 8GB and 16GB models has dropped since I purchased my unit only five weeks ago.I would probably have sprung for the extra RAM, even though I doubt it would be useful in my case unless I got into audiobooks in a big way.I've been using the blue-white light on the original reader for so long that I haven't felt the need to go out of my way to use the 'warm-light' feature on the new one.  I *have* set the automatic time-based adjustment feature and it is in use during nighttime reads, but it hasn't had a noticeable impact (positive or negative) on my habitual reading.  It probably does improve reading for many people, though.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"169 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683936000000}

Up until now, I never saw a reason to upgrade. I got the previous model last year. It had the Bluetooth and water resistance. Two features I could care less about. If I'm going to listen to audible, it's because I don't have my paperwhite with me. As far as water, I've always had a sea to summit device bag to protect it if I wanted to do a little hot tub reading. But aside from those two features, there wasn't much new. Even the response time was near identical despite eight years apart. It wasn't enough of an upgrade to keep, so I gave it to my mom.One year later, my desires have been answered. Larger screen, faster response, warm mode back light. This one is much faster than the previous generations. It feels so much better to have pages turn when you tap the screen rather than 1.5 seconds+ later.For what to buy, do not waste your money on the ad free version. It doesn't get rid of suggestions that appear below your book list. It just adds a swipe to open prompt when you open the cover. And frankly, I HAVE bought books before that appeared there. Plus it also adds a little protection to accidental touch. To pay a one time fee on something you're already buying to remove ads from the platform you're basically required to buy books from is fairly hokey. But whatever.I love the new warm light feature. You can set it to follow your local sunset schedule, which is nice. It overall gives it a nicer reading a real book under incandescent light feel.The wider screen is a nice addition. I don't know if this is a complaint because obviously I don't want the device bigger. But my reading in bed while laying down is harder because I used to grasp it on the edges. Now there's no real edge to speak of, so keep that in mind.Main reason for one removed star is the battery life. I finally recharged somewhere in week 5 when I got into the teens. For the record, I don't turn off wifi when I'm not using it. I like to turn on hotspot on my phone and have my kindle quickly sync reading. I also never did on my old one. That one lasted a solid 2+ months for years. This one does not appear to have that longevity. For the record, I do not have the power save mode turned on. I found it to be way too obtrusive. You have to wait a few seconds for it to wake up when you bring it out. But the biggest reason was, while I always have the backlight set to like 5-10 brightness and medium warm, during this wake up, the screen would be bright and full white. This is not something I enjoy when I am trying to get to sleep. So I sacrifice battery life for that experience. Keep in mind, my old model didn't even have a battery save feature. So I'm not sure where that life is going.In conclusion, up until this year, unless you had managed to break yours, I wouldn't have recommended an upgrade unless you really need the Bluetooth or water resistance. This one, however, has definitely sold me. While I wish there were more user controlled features and settings, it's an overall great experience.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"198 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684886400000}

But that would mean that it would be connected to my Amazon.nl account and I would not be able to use the book content on my Amazon.com account...... Strange. But, this kindle is not shipped to the Netherlands from Amazon.com (why not????), so I had to ask a colleague in the US if I could had it delivered to her address and then, when she would be coming over to the Netherlands 2 weeks later, she could take it with her and deliver it to me. That worked :-) I now own this kindle from Amazon.com connected to my Amazon.com account.... I'm happy!My old kindle was still good (which was delivered to the Netherlands straight from Amazon.com back then), a bit more slow, battery not so long lasting anymore, but it's 10 years old and it always worked perfect! Still does! So why a new kindle? Because I wanted better light, longer battery life, better screen, more features. And after 10 years of heavy use the leather cover was crumbling. I will still use this kindle though when going to the beach or reading when in the bath tub.The new kindle 11th generation is easy to use, the screen is very clear, the settings are easy to find (way more easy than in my old kindle), it's now easy to jump to a previous or further point in the book, it's easy to sync, it can connect through bluetooth as well and I'm just very happy with it!

The screen light is amazing, much easier and effortless to use than bringing a book light with you everywhere.- Vocab. Anytime you don't know what a word means, you can simply hold your finger on the book and BOOM - you instantly get the definition. If you are connected to wifi, then it also automatically searches wikipedia for things that aren't in the dictionary. PLUS - if has this nifty feature where you can see a list of words that you've looked up. If you want to retain all the new words you're reading, this is a great way to increase retention if you check the list every now and then.- Reading speed. With physical books, each book has a different font size\/type and page\/margin size, which I believe has a small, but noticeable effect on reading speed. Since kindle books all look the exact same, your brain gets used to it and you start to read a bit faster on the kindle.- Amazing battery life. A few weeks is plenty.

{"reviewTitle":"\ud83d\udcda Kindle Paperwhite: A Delightful Read with a Few Tiny Hitches \ud83c\udf1f","reviewDescription":"My adventure with the 16GB Amazon Kindle Paperwhite has not just been enjoyable, but it has been an absolute revelation for my reading habits. I started this journey with a sense of curiosity and came out the other end with an indescribable sense of joy. The Kindle Paperwhite is no ordinary e-reader; it's a library, a companion, and an enabler that stoked my passion for reading in ways that I hadn't anticipated.Although it's near-perfect in its execution, there are some aspects that could use minor tweaking. In the spirit of constructive criticism, I'll share my comprehensive experience with this device, giving you an in-depth insight into its many facets. My review comprises of my commendations, but it also includes friendly suggestions for potential improvements.\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\ud83d\udcda A Larger, Pleasurable Display: Turning over a new leaf in e-reading: At first glance, the most noticeable upgrade in this device is the 6.8\" display. It\u2019s significantly larger compared to previous iterations, a change that has had an immense impact on my reading experience. More words per page mean fewer page turns, a feature that has significantly enhanced the flow of my reading. It also provides a sense of continuity that's often missing in e-readers. The sharp resolution, quite similar to printed text, strikes a beautiful balance between the tangible comfort of traditional books and the convenience of digital reading.\ud83d\udca1\ud83c\udf19 Customizable Warm Light: A Harmony of Comfort and Adaptability: The adjustable warm light feature, in my opinion, is the unsung hero of the Kindle Paperwhite. It allows me to tailor the screen\u2019s warmth, an incredible boon for long reading sessions. Whether it's a sunny afternoon spent in the park or a quiet night before bedtime, the adjustable light adapts to my environment, reducing eye strain significantly. It's small innovations like these that set the Kindle Paperwhite apart from its competitors.\ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udf92 A Library in the Palm of your Hands: Bringing the World to You: Avid readers know the joy of being surrounded by books, and the 16GB storage capacity of the Kindle Paperwhite is a testament to that joy. It allows me to carry an eclectic mix of books without the associated weight or bulk, a feature that's been a game-changer, especially during travel. On a whim, I can switch between genres, authors, and themes, making every reading session an exciting journey through the literary world.\ud83d\udd76\ufe0f\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f A Sleek Look Combined with Comfortable Grip: Designed to Impress and Comfort: The elegant black design and the sleek aesthetic of the Kindle Paperwhite are visually pleasing. But what enhances the user experience is the rubberized back and the smooth bezel around the screen that ensures a comfortable grip. Long hours of reading no longer feel cumbersome, making the Kindle Paperwhite a true ally for book lovers.\ud83d\udd0b\u23f1\ufe0f An Impressive Battery Life: The Power to Keep you Company: One of the Kindle Paperwhite's most reliable features is its remarkable battery life. Lasting for weeks on a single charge, it proves to be a trusty companion for long commutes, travel, or power-reading sessions. I have often found myself lost in the world of books without worrying about the battery life, a freedom that very few e-readers offer.However, in the spirit of a balanced review, it's essential to highlight an aspect that might require some acclimatization:\u2696\ufe0f\ud83e\udd14 Size and Weight Considerations: Slightly Bulkier, but for a Reason: The larger screen size has undoubtedly enhanced the reading experience. However, it also brings a slight increase in the overall size and weight of the device. For those, like me, who were used to the feather-light feel of earlier models, this change took some getting used to. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but something to be aware of.Considering all the factors, the Kindle Paperwhite 16GB more than earns its 5-star rating \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f. The slight increase in size and weight is but a small compromise when compared to the extensive list of advantages. The stunning display, adjustable warm light, ample storage, refined design, and impressive battery life easily outweigh this minor inconvenience.So, to all fellow book lovers and prospective e-reader explorers, I wholeheartedly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite. It promises a world of literary adventures and endless hours of pleasurable reading. And in the end, isn't that what we, as readers, seek? The chance to lose ourselves in the world of words, one page at a time.I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to you for taking the time to read this exhaustive review. I hope it proves useful in your decision-making process and brings you one step closer to finding your ideal reading companion. Here's to a future filled with the joy of reading, one book at a time. Happy hunting, and even happier reading! \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf0d","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"751 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687392000000}

{"reviewTitle":"I purchased my Kindle in July and it completely stopped working in early September","reviewDescription":"After seeing many of my friends purchasing a Kindle and enjoying reading more on a Kindle, I caved in and decided to purchase one myself.  I loved the ability to read at night with minimal lights on in my room (and my eyes not hurting too much from the screen), Kindle Unlimited, and the significant price difference between eBooks and paperbacks.However, out of nowhere, my Kindle completely stopped working.  I take care of all my items.  I took care of this item, and it would not go beyond the swipe to unlock screen (and then never unlock).  I was a bit shocked that a new Kindle would break that quickly and from seemingly nothing.  I utilized the warranty process and received a refurbished Kindle.  I understand that this is a possibility, but the fact that I clearly received something of lesser value when the one I purchased broke through no fault of mine is quite mind-boggling to me.I attempted to work something out through Amazon Customer Service.  I wanted to see if I could receive a new Kindle as a replacement or some form of credit for the difference in value between what I paid and what I received.  I was unable to work out either.So, feel free to purchase a Kindle from Amazon, but there is a chance (probably greater than you think) that it will simply stop working for no reason, you will never receive a reason as to why that was the case, and you will get whatever they have left.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697846400000}

I am an Amazon prime member and Amazon usually does not disappoint,  However, in this case I would suggest buyers look into the Nook or some other e reader for the following reason:  My Paperwhite which I bought in 2013 broke.  I needed to repair it for a host of complex reasons, the main one being that I can not use a new one to transfer my information because it involved Amazon China which Amazon US has now pulled out of - no more e books etc in China.  So I attempted to get Amazon to help me fix this Kindle which needs a battery replacement.  I understand it is out of warranty so I said I was more than happy to pay for it.  No, they will not do repairs unless it is in warranty!  Who  ever heard of such a thing?  If my dish washer breaks down will they tell me they can not do any repairs because it is out of warranty?  Of course not.  One just has to pay for the repairs as opposed to having them covered.  Then I gave up on that route and just decided to ask a supervisor what battery I needed so I could buy it myself and the supervisor refused to give me that information, as thought it were some top secret, classified information.  He said that I should get a new Kindle and they give a slight discount towards that.  I explained to him how that does not solve my problem but he clearly did not care and refused to give me the battery information..  Afterwards I found out that it is quite easy to find out what battery the Kindle paperwhite 2013 takes just by googling it and I was able to buy the battery and a repair kit online and I will try to do it myself.

Why didn't they transfer somewhere I could find them?So many reviewers are mentioning warmth, display, brightness, etc., as problems.

As on my other devices, the reading progress on the bottom of the page frequently resets to none. Almost daily. You turn it off then return to reading to find your font has gone from a 5 to 8. You select a book and your no where near where you left off. And it doesn't keep your place across devices or apps with any reliability.Update: I have revised my review from two stars to one. I would give lower if I could. While turning the age, instead of the next page I get the \"before you go\" page at the end of the book. I am only on the third chapter! Worst Kindle ever.Second update: a new problem has surfaced with my Kindle Paperwhite. While reading a book, any book, I will turn the page and suddenly find myself at the end, or they ask you to rate the book. If I go backwards I'm at the same page I just left. The only remedy is to restart the Kindle. When you're reading a very large book like the Bible, and you lose your place, it can be difficult to find it again. Also, regarding the size of the lettering, I can set it down still on, pick it up and find that it's gone from a 7 to a 4. Or some other size. I've never owned a more frustrating Kindle. I'm tempted to simply download the app to one of my tablets and forget this thing.Update 3.Now have to restart the Kindle everyday.

{"reviewTitle":"Tree Screen...Known Problem...Don't buy!!","reviewDescription":"I very rarely review products, especially a crappy one. This one however, isn't okay. I bought mine back in January (not even 6 months ago) brand new for $130. I have been a long time Nook user. I've been having an issue with viewing a regular screen so I figured if I was going to purchase an e-reader and not a tablet-esqu one, I might as well go with Amazon for Kindle Unlimited as using my library apps seemed complicated. From the beginning, I had odd issues and just thought it was an inferior product because it was just an e-reader and nothing fancy. Sometimes my books just wouldn't download. No biggie. I then noticed my Kindle quit saving at the right place. Sometimes a page or two behind or sometimes chapters behind. I have the Kindle app on my phone and even though I don't really read on my phone anymore, thought maybe the two were just interfering with each other. I got over it. About two weeks ago, I was trying to download books and I was getting an application error. I thought maybe it was my wifi. I literally just kept figuring it was quirky and an e-reader... Now, last night, I got the page with the tree and person and it literally just keeps rebooting that screen every 15-20 seconds. It's been doing this for the past 24 hours. I can't just hold the button for 45 seconds and looking it up...it appears MANY people have had this issue and it's to do with the software. I did nothing to it. It \"lives\" in the side pocket of my daughter's nursery glider because I read it at night when I'm up with her. From what I read, most people are either offered to buy a new one for like $80 or they are told nothing can be done if there's no warranty. I do not have a warranty but I'm not dishing out another $80 to Amazon for the same product to break again. I'll be calling Customer Service tomorrow but judging from all the forums online, they'll use tech speak and then tell me nothing can be done. Even people WITH a warranty are simply being given refurbished ones after promised a new replacement...some already broken upon arrival. I REALLY expected better from the Kindle line.

Although the overall rating on this product is very good, there are far too many people who had the same issue as this: the screen randomly wants to restart or the screen freezes up or flashes on and off.  A pop-up screen appears giving you three choices; cancel, restart, or screen off.  No matter what choice is made, the unit wants to restart.  It takes forever, sometimes restarting several times, occasionally taking you back to the beginning of whatever you are reading. This is the third unit since my original purchase.  I was sent two refurbished ones, plus a new one for four total.  They all exhibited the same problem.  Very frustrating.  Lots of time spent with CS via chat and live.  Lots of troubleshooting.  I always had to start at the beginning with each agent to explain the problem.  They were very nice and helpful but nothing worked.  After sending it in for repairs I would get a message saying the item was defective and not able to be repaired.  They would send a refurbished one that had the exact same problems.  I have to question the repair department.  Why would they send  defective products as a replacement?  I suspect many more people have this problem to some degree and choose to just deal with it, as I almost did but finally said enough is enough.  The operating system has a major flaw. I have two other Kindles 10 years old that have never had a problem.  I wanted this new version for the bigger screen and warm screen feature.

{"reviewTitle":"Amazon is Turning into Apple","reviewDescription":"In the past, Amazon was a company you could count on to continually innovate to find ways to provide great things for its customers. With its enormous market share, it is now turning into a company, like Apple, that narrows its customers' options and forces them into buying its substandard products. I was very happy, for example, with the Kindle app for Android, and have been buying many more Kindle books than I ever purchased in paper. But now Amazon has discontinued its Kindle app for newer Android devices. I've come to rely on eBooks so much that I needed an alternative. It seemed that the best alternative was to buy a Kindle. I first purchased a Kindle Fire and was disappointed with the glare on the screen and the short battery life. So, I then purchased a Kindle Paperwhite (11th ed.) The battery life is better, and the text is very readable, but the contrast for images is washed out and there is no way to adjust the contrast. But the worst thing for me is that the Text-to-Speech function is now gone. I commute to work and enjoyed listening to books. It is still possible to do so on the Paperwhite, but you either have to pay extra for an Audible version of the book, or you need to use the Accessibility feature for blind people which is extraordinarily clunky. It reads everything on the screen, is a first-generation voice (sounds more digital), and is very difficult to navigate. It is impossible to switch back and forth very quickly. You must navigate through multiple menus to turn the feature on and off, including turning your password off every time you use the feature. I have now spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the best alternative to the Kindle app for Android, which worked perfectly. Of course, I'm sure Amazon is very happy about this since I've been forced to buy more of its products in order to do what I was formerly able to do for no additional cost. In the past, I was a huge fan of Amazon because of the way it responded to its customers' needs.

Menu is difficult to access, and by the time I'm finally able to get to it I've completely lost my place because it thinks I'm trying to turn pages.It's impossible to keep your place while reading bc if you accidentally OR purposefully touch the screen, it skips you forward or back several pages (never know which it is).The things I like is that you can read in bed with the lights off and read in the pool or bathtub (but the stress from its constant malfunctioning makes these activities far less relaxing). Unsure if it's worth keeping.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687564800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Clichey","reviewDescription":"I love the screen size and the features on how the screen looks. It will work fine but then cliche out while I am reading book. It will just start having the pop out for when you get to the end of the book over and over again while I am trying to read the book. One author's books now gets an error and closes on this device. I have to read them on my tablet. I have owned a number of kindles and this one functions very poorly compared to the others. I am surprised and disappointed with this model. I hope the next one is better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695427200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Meh","reviewDescription":"Like most Amazon products (kindles, Alexa, etc.) this gave out after 2 years. Super slow, buttons are hard to push and overall annoying. Also not happy with the screen.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1706572800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Turns pages like it's running Windows 95. I can't believe these things have been hyped for YEARS","reviewDescription":"It's current year and Kindles ought to be mature technology. Why is page turn not totally instantaneous??? And yes, I have the animations turned off.I've read 300+ books a year on the Kindle app on my phone and decided to treat myself on prime day, persuading myself that a purpose built reading device would be some kind of upgrade.Also, I'm a lefty, and therefore hold the device in my left hand. I cannot easily reach the right side to advance the screen, and wind up going back as often as I go forward. Accessibility? What's accessibility?About the only thing you can say for it, over a phone, is that it's easier to read in bright daylight. Not worth the aggravation. Wish I could return it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690761600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Annoying WiFi issues.","reviewDescription":"I love kindles, I've had a ton of them. This one, and my 10\" tablet, both have connectivity issues with WiFi. I've googled and found a setting to turn off that interrupts the connection when not in use but to no avail. Continues to have blink on and off connection most of the time. I've even kept it on airplane mode while I'm gone to work. I have to get up and make the entire family mad by restarting my router. I'm done with that. Now i just hotspot my phone and download the book I won't and let the dang WiFi blink on\/off.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698192000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Quality has been steadily declining","reviewDescription":"This latest iteration of the Paperwhite has been nothing but a disappointment. My first 2022 model stopped downloading books after one year. I tried all manor of trouble shooting and nothing worked. So, I purchased a replacement in April. This latest Paperwhite has now started to either do to a previous page\/chapter or the end of the book when I try to go to the next page. The book must be restarted each time, and it will happen multiple times for each book. My other e-readers from the kindle with keyboard, to the Voyage, Oasis, and previous Paperwhites lasted several years. It is very disappointing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693872000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Didn\u2019t even work for 2 years","reviewDescription":"My Kindle randomly stopped charging and has kept giving me an error saying there is water in my device and I need to hold it upright until it dries. My Kindle has not gotten wet, has sat upright for weeks, and the error won\u2019t go away. I\u2019m really disappointed in this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1703808000000}
