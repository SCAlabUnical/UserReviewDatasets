Your mileage may vary.I returned them and found the originals that I'd purchased the last time around (in a German package here) for a bit more.

We tested for a few nights in a row, we would brush with a brand new oral-b cross action brush, and then brush with a new one from this Genkent 20 pack of brushes.After days of testing, we were surprised but sad.  We both honestly estimate that the oral b crossaction seem to have about 30% to 40% more scrubbing action than the Genkent did.That's too bad. These Genkent are such a good deal, and so we have to decide what to do.  We definitely would rather the cross action brush, but, they are like three dollars each, compared to these are only 60 cents each.  If you like a soft gentle scrub for a brush then these are fine, but for us we need \/ want a better scrub.  Why can't Genkent make a crossaction brush, and make it stronger, firmer, more active for a more robust  brushing experience? We would rather pay an extra quarter for Genkent to make a better brush.Update a week later: We are still testing every night comparing ban-n-forth, and we still find these Genkent replacement brand are just too soft and do not clean \/ scrub as well as the original.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"46 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696291200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great for price and quality","reviewDescription":"This is cheaper than competing brands but does the job well. Replacing often makes this brand more worth while. Doesn't have plastic bristles like leading brands but holds up well. The small plastic ring allows for family color coding but comes off easy.

{"reviewTitle":"Jury is still out.","reviewDescription":"I bought these because of the really low price.  The head is quite a bit smaller than the name brand.  They seem a bit softer also.  Th head was extremely hard to get on my base. They brush my teeth as intended.  Just a little different than what I\u2019m used to.

{"reviewTitle":"Five years worth of toothbrush heads","reviewDescription":"If you change your toothbrush head every 3 months as dentists suggest, this set gives you five years' worth for what a years' worth of regular toothbrushes cost. I love these; they get green leafy vegetables out of my teeth, and improve my gum health. Nice and soft, too. I just changed out the head this morning, and it's very easy.

These were much cheaper so I didn\u2019t think they would be that great but I was surprised to discover the bristles were less harsh and softer. Surprised at how much better they felt quality wise.

{"reviewTitle":"Don't buy them - cheap quality, flattened out in 3 days","reviewDescription":"They're brushheads but they only retain their shape for the first 2-3 times that you brush your teeth. On day 3 the head looked like an old toothbrush that had been used for months, like how it looks before you retire it to the trashcan. The bristles on the head were flattened out, had gaps in the bristles, and was otherwise unusable due to it being ineffective. Luckily this was a cheap purchase but I would not recommend buying these for your Oral B electric toothbrush. I'm not even a hard brusher. They're just that poor quality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1485907200000}
