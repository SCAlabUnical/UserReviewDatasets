{"reviewTitle":"If you just want a basic iPad for a great price, this is it","reviewDescription":"As my review title says - If you just want a basic iPad for a great price, this is it - while it lasts! Although the 9th gen iPad has an older design with a larger bezel and TouchID home button, it still works great as a basic tablet to do simple things. The most common activities - browsing the internet, checking email, chatting through Facetime, reading news, and playing basic arcade games - do not require you to have the latest, greatest, and more expensive iPads when this one can do it all without compromise or a reduction in experience.The fact that the current pricing is $80 under MSRP makes it a steal; at this price, I don't see why one would buy some inferior tablet from other brands when a genuine Apple iPad can be had for under $250! But of course, this price can only last so long, so if you want a basic but high-quality, fully functioning tablet, you can't go wrong here.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"67 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704499200000}

For a good price of 270$ you get a great tablet, with great battery, handful of polished software, and latest ipad OS.Evident Pros:The battery life is admirable. In my experience so far, it ocassionaly withstands 2 days before having 17-22% just before I recharge it. Worth to mention however, I don't use it for any mild-heavy gaming.The UI and the OS itself make the tablet a big win for art, study, and partially productivity work. It's very reliable.Nice responsive smooth screen. It's bright, colorful, and the panel is pretty qualitative, and what's important it's fairly repairable, so if you break the front glass it could be easily changed without the need to replace the whole screen.A13 processor. Let's not forget about that. Everything works smooth and fast from UI to the apps themselves.Shots to the overall quality of the product. It's very well-built what makes it feel like a more of a premium product for this money.Cons:The Camera unfortunately is only in the device for the sake of having a camera. If I wouldn't have to, I wouldn't take any photos on this thing. It's too unreliable.Have you seen the bezels of the screen? Having it's crazy specifications for its budget the front screen design makes it look like you bought a tablet from way back in 2016.Apple pen 1st gen. Seriously. Was it that hard to implement apple pen 2nd gen support? Come on apple, you don't even include the pen in the package.Absurd prices on accessories.

Fun fact, that's not possible because every time I follow the procedure for the factory reset, the thing locks me out for longer! So now I have a completely useless iPad.

{"reviewTitle":"Apple does it again, the best of Apple in a great price!","reviewDescription":"I have had my iPad 9th Generation 64GB Wi-Fi since the end of November, 2022. It has been about 5 months. I upgraded from an iPad Air 2 32GB Wi-Fi (2014 model) that I had for almost 6 years! I have to say that there is a reason why Apple iPads are sold at such a premium price. That's because they provide valuable practical use for far longer than the vast majority of what is available in the tablet market.With that said the 2021 iPad 9th Generation is a base iPad with a limited amount of fancy features and a dated iPad design. Quite frankly, I actually use my iPad on the go and all of the iPads I have had go directly into an Otterbox Defender case. So I hardly notice the little aesthetics in design when my iPads area always in an Otterbox Defender case.I won't make this review long and will highlight the particular reason why I feel the need to write this review at all. I would say there's three top reasons why I believe the iPad 9th generation is excellent: 1. Good CPU performance\/64GB base memory capacity, 2. Value pricing, and 3. Apple Pencil\/Freeform.1. CPU performance is good with the A13 CPU from the iPhone 11. I am confident that I will be able to use this iPad for at least 4 more years, if not 5. I bought my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) in 2016 and it was supported with OS updates up until iPadOS 15, which is a total of 8 years. But the iPad Air 2 was among the longest supported iPads in Apple's tablet history. So it is not likely to be repeated. But I think that the iPad 9th generation should be supported for at least 6 years, 2021 to 2027. Plus, the 64GB base capacity is excellent for my basic use of the iPad.2. The pricing for the iPad 9th Generation 64GB retails at $329.99, but it is often for sale at $269.99. That's how much I purchased it for during Cyber Monday 2022. It has been on sale for as low as $249.99 at some other retailers as well. So overall, the pricing is very affordable for a device this capable with support for many years to come.3. I know that the Apple Pencil has been out for years, but I have only now tried it. It was not supported with my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) and I never gave it much thought as being useful to me. I always thought that the Apple Pencil was geared towards artists, which to some extent it is. I tried the Apple Pencil on my iPad 9th Generation about a month after getting mine. It was a revolutionary experience for me. I have been looking for a viable substitute for a whiteboard for the longest time. But there is not any real replacement for what you can do on a whiteboard. The Apple Pencil with FreeForm is the closest that I've come to the experience I get on a whiteboard. Although, I do still use a 4'x8' whiteboard for some brainstorming sessions, the Apple Pencil has afforded me to do some basic brainstorming in FreeForm. This is a massive benefit and I can only see Apple getting better with its FreeForm app. Not to mention app developers releasing new apps to take advantage of the Apple Pencil for brainstorming on a virtual whiteboard.Overall, I highly recommend the iPad 9th Generation.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"314 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679788800000}

But the issue was fixed and iPad is working.Purchased this refurbished iPad on Amazon while I was away abroad. Came home, picked it up and left again, only to find out I can\u2019t set it up at all, because it has remote management configuration on it, which, according to Apple, hasn\u2019t been released by the previous organization-owner. Basically, the iPad that I thought will be mine is remotely managed by the previous owner (never mind that it is supposed to be fully refurbished), and I can\u2019t go further than turning it on.The iPad is useless, might as well hammer in nails with it, it doesn\u2019t work because of this remote management thing. Amazon refused to help, because the return period has ended (\u201cnothing we can do\u201d was their exact answer). I\u2019m furious.

First, all of Apple's requirements to make an Apple ID, password, passcode, is extremely dragged out.  The process to set up the tablet is extremely long and having to remember all the passwords are difficult.  Second, a lot of the screen is actually blacked out on the side.  I wanted to see the whole screen while watching movies and videos, not parts of it.  Third, some parts of the IPAD is unresponsive.  I had to click multiple times in order for the tablet to register what I was trying to do.  Fourth, the fingerprint requirement is a pain.  When my son wants to download an app for gaming, I have to go over and have it take my fingerprint.  An annoying and unnecessary step.  Fifth, storage is horrible when you download regular games.  I suggest buying the more storage option.  Sixth, the battery is terrible.  I was expecting the battery to rival Samsung Tablets, however, that was not the case.  The IPAD dies quickly even when on low power mode.  Not what I was expecting when I spent hundreds on a tablet.  Onto a more positive note, I do believe that the built quality is up to standard and it was nice that Apple included the charging brick and cables.Pros:1. Built quality is good2. Accessories (charging brick and cable) were includedCons:1. Long set up times2. Very large black bars on the side3. Some spots were unresponsive unless repeatedly tapped on4.

I also don't like the interface.  I have to learn everything all over again.  It's a hassle.  I'll stick with Android next time.
