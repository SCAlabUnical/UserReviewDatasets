I ordered one similar for my girlfriend prior to purchasing this model. When I went back to purchase the same one I had for her, it was not available. This watch was offered as a similar product, so I took a chance.From the onset, regardless of the settings, it did not track sleep at all, regardless of how tight or how loose it was worn at night. The step tracking and caloric counts are nowhere close to accurate. After an hour of heavy treadmill cardio, the treadmill logged 591 calories, the watch register 167. Definitely off.The app is not very intuitive nor comprehensive. It does not keep a log of daily progress (despite monitoring and changing the settings). Data is wiped out every day with no log of activity to compare progress. The weather monitor is always off every morning. I live in Florida and it continually tells me its 12 degrees. (and yes, I changed these settings multiple times as well.Additionally, I have had this watch for less than three weeks. It arrived on 1\/4. Two days ago it got wet doing dishes. Wet, not submerged...and while it claims to be water resistant, the watch now has stopped responding to the push button on the right hand side. It has simply gone black, only popping on for a couple seconds if there is some random movement of the wrist.It's a shame, as the watch is fairly nice to look at, but again, if you're looking for a decent caliber tracker for health, fitness and to have some interaction with platforms, this watch falls very short.

{"reviewTitle":"Nice, easy-to-use smartwatch (with a few annoyances)","reviewDescription":"I wanted to get my 8 year old daughter a smartwatch with limited functionality (not a full-blown Apple Watch with internet access), and my daughter loved that it looks similar to an Apple Watch.  It does a great job with serving as a pedometer for activity tracking, alarm clock to set time limits, and stopwatch for when she's tracking activities (and of course, telling the time).  The app requires connection to a smartphone for full functionality (many of the features can be disabled in the app so that the watch is not constantly looking for a data signal to await commands).  One the features I wish worked better is the weather\/temp feature on the watch.  When pairing the watch to my phone via Bluetooth, the app appears to be acquiring the current location (for displaying the current location's temp\/weather status).  The app, however, often indicates an inaccurate temp\/weather status, which I'm guessing is because it fails to acquire the current location from my phone.  For example, the other day it was 20 degrees F with clear skies.  The watch indicated that it was 42 degrees F with light rain (and there was no rain the forecast that day).  If I disconnect and re-enable the Bluetooth on my phone several times, the watch will eventually acquire the correct temp\/weather.  But that's annoying, and there's never a consistent number of times for the disconnect\/reconnect to work.That said, if you're not looking for weather\/temp updates on your watch, this might be a good solution for a fun and stylish entry-level smartwatch for someone who doesn't want a full-blow (ie expensive) smartwatch.

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty good for the price","reviewDescription":"I've had this watch for a couple of months now. Overall, I'm happy with it. I like the functions available and the price point. The app (GloryFit) is free which was a must for me.  It's not prefect, but if you don't need super accurate numbers, it's pretty good.Cons: 1). It disconnects from the app a lot. Even when I'm close to my phone all day. I notice it is disconnected. However, it's easy to resync. Literally, just tap the app and it pairs back up. It only takes like 20 seconds.  2). The distance feature is definitely off!! Probably the most frustrating thing for me because I bought this to keep track of my runs.  I run the same loop a couple times a week. It's given me a different distance every time and it's always short.  I've run 2 miles twice and it shows the distance as 1.75 the first time and 1.77 the second time. My son's app (Strava) shows the run as 2.10 each time. I drove it with my car and it's right at 2 miles. Pretty sure the step counter isn't accurate either but I'm not sure that any of them are really correct. 3). I've somehow put a pretty good scratch on the watch face. BUT I'm pretty rough on stuff and I wear it all the time. So, if you're not real outdoorsy and you're gentle, you may have better luck. It still works fine with the scratch, and it doesn't really bother me. 4). Can't switch out the band. 5). Sometimes the sleep monitoring doesn't work (but works most of the time).Pros: Price point is great!  App is Free!  Waterproof.  Easy to operate. Lots of features. Can answer and make calls as long as your phone is at a reasonable distance (doesn't work if it's disconnected from the app).

{"reviewTitle":"Okay watch with some severe deficiencies for fitness and weather","reviewDescription":"I held off on writing a review until after I had owned the watch for a few months.  My primary goal was to replace an old Fitbit with something that had more capability, but I didn't want to spend a ton of money because I wanted to try some of the features out before committing to a larger expense.  This one looked like it fit my needs and for $30 it was a reasonable gamble to take.Basic functionality:  It's a watch so I expect it to tell time.  It does that, though I have had times where I needed to resync it to the app to update the time, such as after daylight savings time.  There are a couple of faces that you can pick from in the watch itself, but when you go into the Gloryfit app there are additional ones you can download to the watch.  The standard ones I didn't like but one of the app ones I did and that's what I went with.  The watch also keeps track of your pulse and oxygen levels.  The pulse seems pretty accurate, and I compared the oxygen sensor with my pulse oximeter (which calibrated well against one in my doctor's office) and the watch was off by a percent or dead on, so I think it's reasonably trustworthy unless you need real accuracy.  The sleep monitor is interesting and seems accurate for the amount of time I spend sleeping.  It has a \"find my phone\" feature, and it displays a snippet of emails and texts from my phone on its display.  I don't use it to make calls so can't vouch for how that works.  Battery life is good, as I only need to charge it about once a week and it's fully charged within a couple of hours.  The band is comfortable and I don't have a problem wearing it all day and night.  I take it off to shower so don't know about how waterproof it is.  For core function it's pretty good.Now the bad stuff.  The watch is supposed to tell you the weather, but that is highly inaccurate.  The temp is always way off, and the reason is the app picked a city that's spelled similarly to where I live but is always 10-20 degrees colder with different weather.  For me this feature is a joke and entirely useless as it's guessing by the city name it finds and not using GPS or other accurate data for the location.  The Gloryfit app shows the wrong location but there is nowhere to fix it.  All of the location syncing is turned on in my phone but it just ignores what my phone knows about where it is.  My phone's weather app is 100% accurate no matter where I am, so it's just this dumb app.  Sometimes when I travel to another town it gets the correct place and weather information but not always.  Second, the exercise tracker is awful.  There are about a hundred exercises that the watch and app track, but I typically only do about a half dozen of them.  There is no way to reorder the exercises so they show up at the top of the limited list you can see on the watch so you have to go into the app and manually disable those showing up above the ones you want to use.  After winnowing the list down they still stay in the same order they were originally in, so I can't put the one I do most often at the top of the list.  Also, it doesn't track steps accurately.  When on the elliptical machine at my gym my Fitbit counted all of the steps, but the watch only counts about a third or less of them.  When I do a lot of walking the steps are also lower than what I recorded with my Fitbit on previous treks.  This makes the step counter and calorie counter useless since it's not getting good data for my effort.  Do not get this if you are wanting a real fitness tracker.Would I buy this watch again?  Probably not, I would have found a better one with a decent app instead.  When I bought one for my wife after having this one I opted for a better\/more expensive watch and she's very happy with it.  I expect I will get a better one for myself eventually and toss this one in a drawer or give it to someone who isn't into fitness and doesn't care about seeing the weather on their watch.  But for 30 bucks it's worth that much in terms of the things it does reliably.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"57 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704758400000}

It seems pretty accurate so far with everything I've been monitoring. The watch has an app you'll need to download (GloryFit) and, through that app you can keep track of whatever vitals you want to monitor along with setting different exercises that you can set & monitor.I needed a watch that was compatible with my Android phone (Samsung) but I could NOT afford one of the name brand ones and this one was very affordable, works great with my phone & has almost everything I need. You can receive notifications from almost any app & you can read any messages received. The ONLY thing I wish you could do is reply to messages from the watch face but that's a small inconvenience when I can just grab my phone & reply.The watch face is customizable & I love that because I need to customize EVERYTHING lol the app for the watch has a HUGE variety of free watch faces you can use with different layouts for your vitals, the time, etc. You can also upload your own image (as shown in the last photo I uploaded) and it will just have the time & your steps shown on the screen. When you upload your own image, you can't rearrange the time or steps or add anything else to monitor but you can change the font color to match the background.Overall, this is a great budget smartwatch & does everything it says.

{"reviewTitle":"Best smart watch for the price.","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve had this watch for about 2 weeks now. My last watch was Apple Watch 3. My first impression on this watch is it\u2019s really comfortable. I had a hard time finding a watch band for my Apple Watch that fit well and I liked. This watch out of the box is great. No need for a different band. Setting up is pretty easy. The battery life is amazing, I don\u2019t understand how this watch can have battery life 10x as long as an Apple Watch. I really like the blood\/oxygen reader, works well. The only thing that this doesn\u2019t have that Apple Watch has is the Apple Pay and location tracking, which really isn\u2019t that big of a deal to me. Has a bunch of different faces to choose from in the app through the phone, so pretty cool faces.Dislikes are the screen resolution is kind of low, text looks kind of old school but not that big of deal, I mean I paid $26 for it. No way to control volume when using music\/podcast player through phone. You can only text via voice, no keyboard. The screen brightness is too bright even on the lowest setting. Also to check the time when you hold up your wrist it takes a 1-2 seconds for the screen to come on, kind of annoying. Need to have a \u201cdisplay always on\u201d option.All in all great smart watch for the price, I\u2019d recommend getting one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"21 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711843200000}

It tracks: your bpm, blood oxygen level, sleep patterns, allows you to make calls via the phone which can be handy if you use your hands a lot (since you wouldn't have to hold the phone to talk to the other person). It is useful. Other apps also include a weather monitor.  The watch face\/screen display can be changed.

I opened up the box and took out the smart watch, instructions and charging cord.I ordered this Smart Watch in Rose Gold with Pink wrist band and it was just gorgeous. High quality watch face, strap and metal clasp. I am extremely delighted with this product for only $32.I charged it up a little then downloaded the APP from the QR code that the watch automatically displayed. It was super easy to get everything set up and only took about 3 minutes. I know it came with instructions but I tend to not follow directions well so I got it set up without reading the booklet.I bought this watch for 2 main reasons. One, to receive calls on it while my phone is in my purse or on the counter so I won't miss a call going from room to room while staging homes or if I'm just at home. The second reason is so I don't miss a text and easily respond without picking up or finding my phone b\/c I heard a ding from the other room.I also love that I could choose my home screen from several different options and chose a simple but classy style with a gold emblem in the middle of it.I know this watch has other features like heart rate, step counter, etc but I really bought it to easily receive and reply to phone calls and texts so I can seamlessly run my Staging business.I definitely would recommend this watch to anyone. Since the packaging and watch is extremely nice, I would also recommend it for a gift for someone.

{"reviewTitle":"Great for the price","reviewDescription":"So far I am super impressed!!!!I paid $29.99 because I had $10 off. I was tired of my Fitbits dying after less than a year so why spend the money? I'm a nurse so a watch is very important to me.I've only had a day but it's easy to figure out. Will update my review when I've had a week and it's tracked sleep and such. So many watch faces to choose from. Do not see an option to use own picture from gallery? Also need to figure out how to change weather from celsius. Going to of course try messaging options (seems this watch will let you get multiple messages from different apps unlike fitbit) and making calls, music, etc. Excited to really take this thing for a test run!Update: 9\/25 I came on here 2 weeks after I had this watch and wrote a LONG update and honest review on it and they didn't post it\/deleted it!!!! Workout tracking is poor, sleep tracking is poor and you can't edit sleep like you can a fitbit. It says I had a 3 hour nap when I was reading a book (I did move during this time) honestly at this point its just a pretty watch. I set a timer it didn't go off, a plus is my alerts and texts go to the watch 99.9% of the time. Calls are a different story. I guess this is a true case of you get what you pay for.

{"reviewTitle":"Make sure your phone's playstore is compatible with glory fit app","reviewDescription":"I bought this watch for a 10 year old boy. He absolutely loves it! He doesn't have a phone but he does have a Samsung tablet. The galaxy store as well as the Google Play store said the glory fit app wasn't compatible with his tablet. However, I was able to maneuver around that by installing glory fit via apk. And it works! He now can receive messages and calls from me on his smartwatch even though his tablet isn't really a phone, (a smartwatch is an accessory to a phone\/tablet) as long as he's connected to wifi at his cousin's house. He's obsessed with all the many functions and customizable faces he potentially has at his fingertips. The only thing I wasn't sure about was night one with the sleep app. I kept checking to see if it was tracking his sleep on his watch and it didn't look like it was. However, when I went to the glory fit app on his tablet, it let me know I wouldn't start to see results until after the first 4 hrs sleep. I was surprised by how accurate it seems to be! We had never used a smart watch before buying this one and didn't want to spend too much money on one without checking a cheaper one out first. I purchased this when it was on sale for 30 bucks and cannot believe how cool this thing is!

If I cannot find a solution I am going to find another watch.Also, not a major problem but there is no flashlight on the phone. I get up a 4am and use my flashlight on my watch to allow my wife to sleep find a few things I forgot to put out the night before.Update 7\/29\/23:There not a lot of improvements to be made. It is the best smart watch I have had in the past without paying the money for an Apple watch. This watch has great battery life, the size and brightness make it easy to read. It does have a flashlight wrongly stated in my original review.I believe this can be a great watch after some of the software is addressed, it shall be worthy of a five-star rating.I made an error the watch does have a flashlight.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687219200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good for the price!","reviewDescription":"Let's begin with the bad things first, the weather widget is not good, it pulls data from a specific server that does not update quite frequently unless you update manually in the app so it would be better just to check your phone. The watch display is not that customizable as I personally don't really like that much some of the designs in the app and the \"Custom dial\" does not have more widgets than time and step count (yeah I know it's a watch but it would be nice to have the date and other features from other watch faces). Also, you can't change the font so that might not be so appealing to some users.With that said, the watch is really solid in every other feature I tried, it syncs pretty quickly, notifications arrive as desired, the sedentary monitor is accurate, BPM and O2 saturation tracking are pretty good, and while I have seen some people complain about the step counter I haven't seen any problems with that, the watch itself tracks it so it doesn't need a phone with step count. The Music control feature is quite simple but it does the work, would appreciate it if it was possible to add volume controls to the screen. The rise to light on the screen works quite fine and when it stops doing it properly a soft reset solves the problem.When I started using it I got the \"Temperature too high press verification\" message and I was disappointed by that because I used to get the message quite often, after two days the message stopped appearing and I have never seen it again, what I noticed at that time was that I was wearing the watch way too tight and when I loosened it a bit the watch stopped raising the said issue. Can't say anything about It being waterproof as I have not tried that.Battery lasts for a long time, up to 12 days without charging nor turning off. If you turn it off at night it can last for 3 weeks. For the price, it's a good deal, some improvements could be made to the weather widget and the customization but overall it is a good product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712016000000}
