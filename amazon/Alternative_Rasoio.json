I have used the Mach 3 for years and is a good standard, but feels expensive sometimes.  I decided to try the Amazon three blade.  The first shave was okay, pretty clean, did not grab hairs.  ONE DAY LATER, it is a rough shave, misses some of the hairs closer to the skin needing multiple strokes and grabs hairs frequently.  The amazon also leaves a goo on your skin afterwards.  Normally I don't mind trying Amazon items, because there is normally a good return policy when something is garbage, not for this razor.  Make up your own mind, but I highly recommend not buying one of the big packs, like I did, thinking you are getting a deal on a Mach 3.

For the products I've tried in the past, they generally are as good as the branded version and at a much better price point. I'm sorry to say this is not the case with the 3-blade system Amazon sells. I can easily afford the Gillette blades, but their price has increased so much lately, it felt like they were taking advantage. So, I decided to try Amazon's alternative. When I unboxed it and saw that the cartridge looked very similar to Gillette's Mach 3, I was optimistic. However, after just one shave, I could tell it was inferior. Since then, I have have shaved twice, using Gillette on one side of my face and Amazon on the other, I can confidently say that the Gillette Mach 3 gives a much closer shave even with less pressure. The only other significant difference is the razor handle is a bit wider in diameter than Gillette's razor. While I don't like it quite as much, I could have gotten used to it. On a scale of 1-10 (where 10 is best and 1 is worst), I would rate Gillette's Mach 3 a \"9\" and Amazon Basics a \"4.\" Conclusion: If you want to avoid the ridiculously high prices of Gillette's Mach 3, you should perhaps look elsewhere first.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1692835200000}

I never believed the 3, 4, or 5 blade razors would really be any better, and are more expensive. They always seemed like nothing more than manufacturers\u2019 marketing teams hard at work to get you to spend more $ per razor refill, increasing their profits (I can say that with 40 years in marketing). When I found this 3-blade model from Amazon at reasonable kit and refill price point and generally excellent reviews, I decided to try it.After about a week of using it daily, I have to say it comes up short in most ways. On the positive side, the handle is a great design -  nice heft, and ergonomic? It handles well, and sets the expectation of a good outcome. However, the blades have already gone dull enough to not shave well - and I don\u2019t have a thick or heavy beard. Just average. With my 2-blade brand, I\u2019d still get at least a few more days out of it if not another full week.I wouldn\u2019t say the shave is really any better. In fact I\u2019d say it\u2019s not as good from the start. Using it the exact same way as my 2-blade, it leaves areas only partially shaved. And as the week progressed that got worse as it got duller. I don\u2019t like the way the thing tugs at my skin and beard, either. If it did a better job, I\u2019d say that function maybe contributed to a better result. But it doesn\u2019t.I\u2019m glad I kept my old 2-blade razor.

As stated previously, I have Bic single blade razors, I bought for an unscheduled road trip, that I have had for over a year, used many times, haven't shown any signs of rust, and still shave reasonably well.  Much of my body gets shaved and so far I end up using the months old Bic razor to do the first basic shave and then use this for the final shave. If I used them for the full shave they would have to be discarded after that. Other razors might be more expensive, but they shave much better, last longer, are easier to use, and have a better design that gets the smaller curves areas easier (such as the jaw line).

{"reviewTitle":"Smooth... soft legs, in a fresh clean bed. HEAVEN!  BUTTT.....","reviewDescription":"Let me start by saying I've been a loyal user of Amazon razors for years, and they've been my go-to choice for a reason. The 5-blade razors, in particular, have been my holy grail, providing the smoothest, most comfortable shave I've ever experienced. Each replacement head lasts me well over a month, even with daily touch-ups and every other day shaving. I couldn't ask for more in terms of quality and longevity.A Slip in Attention:However, this time, I admit I didn't pay close attention while ordering, and I ended up with the 3-blade version instead of my beloved 5-blade razors. It was a classic case of my own oversight, and I'm kicking myself for not reading the listing more carefully. The 3-blade razors, while undoubtedly functional, just don't match the smoothness and precision I'm used to with the 5-blade razors.Personal Preference:I want to be clear; my slightly lower rating is purely due to my personal preference. The 3-blade razors are not bad by any means; they just don't align with my shaving habits and skin sensitivity as well as the 5-blade ones do. I find them a bit rougher on my skin, which is something I hadn't experienced with the 5-blade version.A Note to Fellow Shavers:So, here's a friendly reminder for fellow shavers: make sure to double-check the specifications and choose the razor that suits your preference best. Whether you're a fan of 3 blades or 5, Amazon razors are undeniably top-notch in terms of quality, sharpness, and durability. It's just a matter of what works best for your skin and shaving routine.Conclusion:In conclusion, Amazon razors are fantastic, and my experience with the 3-blade version hasn't changed that. While I might have a temporary mismatch in my shaving routine, I can confidently say that these razors, regardless of the blade count, are worth the investment. So, whether you're a meticulous reader like me or occasionally overlook details, rest assured that Amazon razors deliver quality, even if you accidentally end up with a version that doesn't align perfectly with your preferences.

I am used to my expensive 5 head razers lasting 3 weeks to a month.  I have used Gillette, Schick and Harry in the past.  I have liked them all equally depending on the blade model that I buy.I bought this pack with 2 of the 5 blades, but then bought 3 blade replacement pack because I never felt like I got a closer shave with my Gillette when it went from 3 blades to 5.  It just got more expensive.This razer handle is about the same as others.  Weight, angle, etc.  It's comfortable and easy to use just as the all are.  But the head does seem to swivel better in more directions.  It gives a very close shave and although I have sensitive skin, it glides nicely and does not leave razor burn.The surprising thing...... It is now exactly 2 months since I bought it and I have not been able to try the 3 blade refills because I'm still using the first 5 blade head that came with the handle.  It came with 2.  So it will be at least another 2 months before I will be able to try and review the 3 blade version.The only negative for me is that they are very large.  There is a large area around the blades.  I have had some other brands models that do this too.  It's like a swiffer, and makes it a bit difficult to make clean lines at the sideburns and get under the nose.  I'm not sure why they do this.  But it still shaves like a dream and last such a long time that it makes the already good value even better.Some men throw their razers around or stick them in with toothbrushes and other thing where the blades get banged up.

Let me just say that I have been using crappy generic disposable razors recently because I've been leery to invest in a shaving system. Mainly because most of the blades are ridiculously expensive and there seems to be a new one every month making the old one obsolete. I decided to pull the trigger on this because I couldn't beat the price. I have a beard and only shave my neck, cheeks and mustache, which I do 2-3 times a week tops. So I figured with as little as I shave these will last me three years and by that point I think my $15 investment is well worth 3 years worth of shaving even if eventually they stop making these blades.So I ran out of the cheap disposable razors and I hadn't shaved in about a week so I was getting pretty scruffy. Usually when I get to this point I'll take my electric clippers and trim it down as short as it'll go before I actually shave. Just to save some wear and tear on my face and honestly those cheap disposable razors just couldn't handle it otherwise. Well I wanted to put this new system to the test so I decided not to do that and I just shaved fresh out of the shower with a week of stubble. All I can say is wow! This thing went through my beard like a hot knife through butter. Made me feel kind of dumb that I kept wasting money on those cheap disposable razors recently. I have no nicks, there was no pulling and it took it off with very minimal strokes.

It's difficult to get the blades onto the handle. The blades look like they could fit either way. Even if you get them attached, at first it looks like you've got it backwards. The little moisturizer strip at the top of the blade is just a little too wide for me to be able to get the blade on the mustache hairs directly below my nose. I inevitably miss those hairs and I can feel them every time I exhale through my nose - that irritates me all day. Finally - and most importantly - the blades just aren't as sharp as Gillette and they dull significantly faster, leading to me having to cover the same area three or four times, irritating my skin.

I'm here to tell you it doesn't come close to saving close although it can pass on the first day meaning although you will feel peach fuzz as we call it the face still looks clean. On the second day no such luck.  You begin to see the visible peach fuzz left on your face. The third day using the same blade while you're shaving the peach fuzz shows because you can't get the shaving cream to shave off your face.  In short your face especially if your beard is grey like mine is visible and you can't even shave the cream off your face.  Sure it shaves smooth and you don't have to worry about cuts because the blade glides over your skin and facial hair.  Sure the razor handles well look good but that's all.  You have to be careful with reviews some people will deceive you for some secret discount or work for the company.  Here is the good news, if you change blades every day your shave will have peach fuzz but not visible to the naked eye and truly maybe that is why you get so many blades.Thank youTruth finder","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1625875200000}

I bought two of the 21-packs, which meant I had 2 handles and 40 cartridges. The value seemed insane! And the reviews I read were overall pretty positive so I was looking forward to it.Quick backstory: I've gone through a good number of razor brands and models over the years. For whatever reason, it seemed like after I had used a particular option for a while, my shaves got worse. i.e. Dollar Shave Club was great for a long time but after a while the shaves started sucking. Similar story with Gillette Mach 3 refill cartridges, even when they came from different sources (i.e. Amazon, Costco, grocery store). Tried Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive disposables and those worked pretty good but wasteful\/expensive for regular use. Then I found my way into Harry's 5-blade razors and those work great but a little too close and not sensitive enough (I think 3-blade razors are my thing). Although more expensive than I prefer, Harry's is still my preferred option over these Amazon Basics 3-blade Razors.Onto the Amazon Basics offering... overall I don't like them. The first shave is kinda rough. 2nd shave is actually \"okay\" and makes it seem like the blades just had to break in on the first shave. But then by the end of the 3rd shave it's dragging hard and I have to dispose of the cartridge. Also the blades seem to clog more than any razor I've used before which means it takes longer to shave. So far I've gone through ~30-35 of the Amazon Basics 3-blade refill cartridges so I'd say my assessment is fair.For my use case (decently thick beard, shave every-other-day) I wouldn't recommend these. Even getting 3 shaves per cartridge the value is still reasonable but I'm only still using them to not be wasteful.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698796800000}

{"reviewTitle":"A good value triple blade razor","reviewDescription":"I've used Mach3s for many years so I admit my bias.  I tried this razor because of the great value.  Functionally everything works well and I'll probably stick with it.  Three things I've noticed:  1) the blades are thinner and spaced much closer together versus the Mach3; this has the affect of requiring more pressure to get a close shave and you need wetter\/thinner shaving creme on your face; 2) the angle of the blades is shallower versus the Mach3 which is another thing that makes getting that close shave just a little more difficult; and 3) the cassettes are very wide making it difficult to shave completely under your nose; I have to go back with a trimmer to get those last few hairs every time and it's annoying.It's a good value and you can get a decent shave with it but, though it may be safer for folks who don't have good technique or finesse, the Mach3 has a better blade design for a close shave.  For me the whole fancy swivel head thing is a pointless gimmick.

I'd say the problem is the blade spacing but it's not impossible that these carts simply aren't a good fit for me.This was also still better for me than the variety of cheap bic razors (which still cost more than this on Amazon) I tried out right before this, so if you're using something like a Comfort 3 or generic disposables and they're almost good enough for you then this might work out.

But of course, double-edge shaving takes lots of preparation, time and care in order get even a passably close shave without nicks and razor burn.  Cartridge razors are smoother, faster and easier, but prohibitively expensive.  Until now.I've used the Solimo three-blade twice now: once with my lather and mug, and once with just plain old soap.  Each time, I got a closer, smoother, faster shave than I could ever hope to get with my double-edge, with no risk of cuts.  And with cartridges at less than a $1 a piece, I can finally save time shaving without wasting a ton of money.The build quality and hand feel is, in my opinion, just as good as my old double-edge or the Gillette Mach 3.  The handle is substantial and heavy.Lastly, don't let the cult of double-edge shaving fool you.  It's utter nonsense that a double-edge razor gives you a \"closer\" shave than a well-engineered three-blade cartridge.  A double-edge is putting a bare razor blade against your skin and dragging: a cartridge keeps a steady angle, perfect depth and has lubrication strips on the top and bottom.  All the double-edge has going for it is nostalgia.  Sometimes, modern technology really does build a better mouse trap.

I know there are other people who say they cut themselves a lot with this...but I am guessing they do not know how to properly shave, were in a hurry, or were caught in an unfortunately timed earthquake.  Everybody's facial hair is different, of course, but as long as you go with the grain on the first pass, this thing performs like a champ.  Zero cuts, even without shaving cream.The handle is much bulkier than the Mach 3, which took a little getting used to, but arguably makes it easier to hold on to in wet environments like your shower, a Polynesian jungle, or the deck of your deep sea fishing vessel.There is not as much plastic around the blades as there is on a Mach 3, so it makes it much easier to shave in tight spots, like right under my nose.  It seems like a closer shave than the standard Mach 3, too.  It has been 24 hours since I last shaved and I just barely have stubble again.The only thing that remains to be seen, as far as I am concerned, is how long the blade lasts.  I shave, on average, every other day, and a cartridge from a Mach 3 will typically last about a month before I need to take out a bank loan to replace it.  Given how cheap these are, though- even if they do not last as long, they seem like a solid investment.I really do not think you can do wrong here.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"50 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1566086400000}

The three blade version of Amazon's does NOT have the single trimmer blade  ( like the five blade version ) but would have been a nice touch to at least try to outdo the Mach 3. The price is better with the Amazon version and blade and shave quality are there, but to be king of the 3 blade shaver's, Amazon needs to make these two changes without changing the price and a NEW king of the hill will be born.

They do last as long if not longer than higher priced razors!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1647129600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Dollar Shave Club Replacement","reviewDescription":"I used Dollar Shave Club for years.

{"reviewTitle":"Why are these so much better than Gillette?","reviewDescription":"The blades work so well I\u2019ve given up on Gillette blades after 40 years of shaving. Over the years, I tried every variation of blade and settled on Gillette  but even with their advancements in handles and blades, they never got my face quite smooth enough. I\u2019ve tried canned shaving cream, fancy brushes and lather, pastes, and oils. Oil comes closest.I originally ordered this brand by mistake, though they didn\u2019t have the Amazon label. When I realized it, I figured I\u2019d get a handle since they were cheap.I can\u2019t believe the closeness of the shave and the smoothness it leaves behind.I have two problems with the product, which prevents me from giving a 5-star review: First, the handle really is cheap-it\u2019s difficult to get the blade connected. And second, once you get it connected, it disconnects when trying to get it out of the blade holder. A coupe of times I set the razor down and the blade popped off and it is hell getting it reconnected.I might look at a new handle to see if that fixes my issue.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688169600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Smooth","reviewDescription":"I like these. They don\u2019t last too long, and obviously don\u2019t shave well when they\u2019re starting to dull down, but they\u2019re good. It might be because I don\u2019t change the blade often enough. Maybe 1 blade per month is a good habit to have.The shave is smooth and fairly close. Reminds me of Gillette, but a little better in terms of smoothness. Gillette does last longer though. And Gillette does still shave decently when it\u2019s dull.I\u2019d still get these again. It\u2019s basically a buck per month to have good shaving sessions.
