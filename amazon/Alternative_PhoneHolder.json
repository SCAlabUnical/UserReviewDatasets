{"reviewTitle":"Some Aspects Great, Some Not Great","reviewDescription":"I bought this as a replacement for the phone mount I had in my car for years. I really loved how it came with multiple ways to mount my phone (vent, dash, or windshield). It was easy to install. I first tried the dash mount, and it would not stick. I tried for days over and over again but it just wouldn't stick. I then moved to using the vent clip mount and it is absolutely wonderful. In regards to the part that actually holds the phone, it seems VERY sturdy (sturdier and stronger than my last one), but it doesn't automatically clamp. Because of this, it takes much longer to set up my phone than I'm used to. It's a bit of a personal annoyance as I have to use 2 hands to put up my phone until I figure out how to do it with one hand quickly, but it's not a deal breaker. The strong grip of the phone holding part is enough of a win to make it worth it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689120000000}

I receive my package, only to find that the \u201cstrong suction cup\u201d advertised by this company is not a suction cup at all, rather a silicone pad with adhesive attached.Vicseed, for your reference, here is the definition of \u201csuction\u201d: the production of a partial vacuum by the removal of air to procure adhesion. Suction cups don\u2019t require adhesive, rather the suction is created by voiding a vacuum of air. As I can\u2019t risk using the adhesive in South Florida, I am forced to use the vent clip, which I did not want to do as my large phone blocks the flow of AC. Very unhappy that this device did not perform as advertised, or even come with the advertised parts.Another note, if your phone has a PopSocket or something similar you will have to remove your case so your phone will be secure in the holder.

Much like everyone else I have been searching for a good car mount for a long time and have spent hundreds of doallrs on devices like this.This first issue is the puck that comes with the mount that you use to mount to the dashboard  had less glue than a piece of scotch tape. I stuck it to the dashboard and it slid off. I heated the sticky side and put it back on the dashboard. It stayed put for a while but eventually fell off while we were driving nearly causing an accident.W eventually got it to stick to the window, my guess is that it has more to do with the glue on the suction cup than anything, but it got us through the trip. The lijsting indicated the mount is  \"[Thick Case & Big Phones Friendly]\" which we did not find to be true at all. In fact, my wife has to remove her phone from her case to get it to fit as she has a pop socket the this mount will not accommodate.For now this Junker will go in the box with the rest of the useless plastic mounts of failures and disappointments.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1654473600000}

I followed the instructions: clean the area, press firmly and leave for 24hrs. But the disc merely slipped off, I figured the adhesive wasnt sticky enough. To make matters worse, its not like the suction cup can stick to any surface, it has to stick to that small disc or else you cant use the arm mount. Figured you can just place more adhesive to the belly of that small disc plate but I was hoping the arm would work and if im purchasing a product I would expect ALL of it to work not just 50% of it.However, the small vent clip works perfectly so the product isn't completely a bust?

The only slight gripe I have with it is the fact that the part that holds the phone itself (the fingers I guess?) curve inward too much and don't fit my case completely. This may be due to the extra thickness of my phone's dual-screen case and is probably an issue unique to those with extra thick cases. I would've probably preferred not having the extra curvature.

{"reviewTitle":"Very solid phone mount","reviewDescription":"I had been looking at various mounts for my iPhone XR for a long time.  I finally settled on this mount, and I can say that I am very pleased with the results.  The mount is very well made, and is very solid.  The suction cup is very strong.I initially tried this as a window mounted configuration, and when I tried to remove the suction cup, it took me several tries to actually get it off.  The cup does have a sticky substance on it that helps hold the mount in place for longer amounts of time.  Just beware that the sticky solution can wear off if you move it around a lot.  I ended up going with a dashboard mounted configuration, as the unit comes with a flat pad so that the suction cup can be mounted on the dashboard in case it's a bumpy surface, like most dashboards.The mount is easy to manipulate if you want to change from portrait to landscape for map\/gps applications.  Just make sure not to tighten the ball mount on the back too tightly, or it will be hard to move.  The mount is also well padded at points where it contacts the phone, and the holders on the mount extend to a very wide with for larger phones.  It holds my iPhone XR, with my OtterBox Symmetry case, very securely with plenty of room to spare for larger phone models.I like that the mount has a release button on the side to expand the mount clamps when you want to remove your phone.  The button can be hard to find, depending on where you have the mount, so be sure to leave some room to push the button so you can easily remove your phone when needed.All in all, a great product for the price.  I would not hesitate to suggest this mount as a great option for your vehicle.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1641772800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great size options","reviewDescription":"PROS:1.  Several adjustable options make it fit for every phone and almost every desired position.  It has adjustments on the arm that make the arm move forward and back which is good for the distance you want from your window\/dash to your hand.  It has a bendable up and down option so you can move it up towards the window or lower.  It has a rotating end so you can turn your phone in a variety of directions.2.  It gives you several parts so you have the option to stick on your windshield, stick to the dash or put in the vent.3.  I love, love, love the adjustable side arms so that you can adjust it to the size of your phone and make it lose enough so you can just drop your phone in and pull it out without two hands.  THis was the number one reason I bought this model.  It also has rubber on the inside to keep your phone in place.4.  The suction really sticks to the window.CONS:1.  If you are going to use the sticky pad for your windshield you better make sure you put it exactly where you want because taking that sucka off is almost impossible.  The little tab they give you to pull it off is so small it's almost impossible to pull and grab.  I wanted to move mine but I can't get it off.  I'll most likely have to use a knife to create a pocket of air to pull it off.2.  Don't place it too high on your windshield because though it has a rotating end, I found the rotation is limited.  Also be careful not to place it too high where it will hit your mirror.  Remember your phone is higher than the unit empty.SUMMARY:  This is worth the buy.  It's easy to put together and comes with many options.  I bought two and recommended it to my parents.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1625184000000}

{"reviewTitle":"VICSEED is my trusted brand for car mounts!","reviewDescription":"I like how they include the suction cup mount and the vent clip so you have the option to choose. I\u2019ve tried many different car mounts, but having to buy them and return them was a hassle. I then decided to try VICSEED\u2019s dash mount. Super easy to use and navigate. I love having my phone vertically up and down, but sometimes I need it horizontally so I can use the navigation system.As I tighten down the screws to adjust the car mount, I noticed how sturdy it was and it didn\u2019t feel like it was going to break as I was tightening it. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve had other car mounts, but when I tighten those, I strip the screws and it no longer holds the level that I need it to. With VICSEED it is super tight and holds my phone well.One-handed operation is something I also look for. I need something that doesn\u2019t take much time and requires me to use both of my hands just to put my phone on a mount. If I can use one hand, it\u2019s a 10\/10 for me. I\u2019m always on the go and I require that my phone stays securely on the car mount. If my phone were to fall on the floor, it would be super dangerous for me to look down and find my phone on the floor.It sticks so well to the dashboard and the suction cup is powerful. I cleaned my dashboard with a cleanser and made sure there was no dust sticking onto the suction cup (that\u2019s the number 1 reason why suction cups fail). They also included a 3M adhesive pad which I could\u2019ve used if my dashboard had a textured dashboard. I also have the option to put the car mount onto my windshield if I wanted to but decided not to.Overall, this car mount is something I would buy again if I were to get a new car. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who wants an easy-to-use car mount! The customer service is super friendly and they will literally answer any questions you have.

{"reviewTitle":"STOP! Purchase NOW","reviewDescription":"This is perfect. I have a SAAB 9 7x that has square rotating air vents so I really needed more of a dashboard suction kind of phone stand. The problem I often have is the dash is textured and does not hold onto the suction stands for too long. However, this phone stand uses a special kind of system that has a base with glue (that is only usable once, so place well) but cures for 24 hours. After the base is set then the suction part cleanly sucks up the to base, leaving you with an amazing phone stand that will not budge under any rough terrane.The phone holder itself, I guess you could call it 'basket', fully adjusts to your phone using a gear system. The phone cannot fall out due to the friction and slight pressure the stand uses on the phone. In order to release your phone, you just press a small black button on the side, where the gears retract outward and release your phone. On the bottom of that stand, there is a little lip that holds your phone up a bit, it is split into two parts to allow you to charge your phone while it is on the stand.My husband uses the air vent component (both parts are included when purchasing and remember I got two). The air vent component fits perfectly in the Honai Sonata's vent and even has a special piece in the back that laches itself on behind the plastic panel. So when he takes his phone, the entire holder doesn't come out of the vent with it.Honestly, this was a genius design. The manufacturers and designers worked well with each other and really made a solid phone holder. everything works so well together. When you pull it out of the fancy little box you will be amazed at all the little extra steps they took to create the perfect stand, that you can custom place in your car.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1642723200000}

Phone holder 1, Desert heat 0.The piece that holds the actual phone is not terribly deep and I have a phone case with one of those moveable finger rings on it so it's a little thicker than usual. To remedy this, I tilted this part back a little so the phone kind of just rests on it in place. Absolutely not a major issue, but anyone using an Otterbox or something similar might experience the same thing. I love the \"jointed\" feature on this instead of a long bendy arm that you have to wrestle into place. Much more user-friendly.Be careful not to attach it where it brushes up against knobs in your car. I didn't notice right away, but the holder bouncing on my A\/C knob has chipped a lot of the paint off of it. This is user error, nothing wrong with the product. If you keep hitting something, eventually something will change.

I decided to leave a review on this and see when I ordered it, I bought this 2 years ago. Except for retightening and adjusting the arm a couple times it\u2019s never had any issues. The plastic is turning yellow, it\u2019s going on it\u2019s third Texas summer, and on a dash that\u2019s not perfectly flat, and it hasn\u2019t budged an inch. Unless I actually released the latch to reposition it.It is a little bulky, but I have it slightly behind and right next to my dash screen and haven\u2019t had any visibility problems. I love the side clamps. I can quickly plop my phone in and squeeze them shut and it stays put. Then I press the side button, it pops open, I grab my phone and go. No awkward fiddling around to put it on or take it off.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686873600000}

I typically use magnetic mounts; however, I have seen the Vicseed open on Amazon and liked that it had such good ratings.Unlike some of the reviews, I found installation to be very easy. I did not use the mount plate although it's recommended. I mounted my Vicseed by suction-cup mount only and directly to the dashboard. I cleaned the area first by wiping it down with rubbing alcohol and then applied the suction cup. I let the mount sit overnight before using it the next morning.I have had no problems such as  mount not adhering or falling off, and the temperature in my car during the day can get to be 100 or more degrees.The only thing that would make me like this mount better would be to have the arm come down lower and closer to the level of my air vents. Right now it's lowest position still sits rather high on my dash for my liking.It's easy to place my phone into as well as release my phone when I am done. It allows my phone to still nestle easily into the mount, even when the charging cord is attached. Although it still bounces a little when driving, I thinks it's expected as it is attached to the car.Overall, I am quite pleased with the Vicseed. However, should issues arise, I will update my feedback.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1648339200000}

Then I went to Walmart and again my phone is too heavyI finally decided to look on Amazon and under HEAVY DUTY.  I found this along with Great reviews.  This holder is great it actually has something to tighten the ball joint so my phone can be heled in the case.  For me the vent  clip didn't work because there is a piece of plastic above my air vent in the car for esthetics which blocks the vent holder being tightened. However the windshield holder works perfectly! my phone is stable and tight and it stays on in 180 degree disgusting heat in the car in Florida.I'm sure the dash would be great also but i'm afraid because even though it says it won't ruin the dash Florida is a constant 150 to 180 degrees in the car and I won't take any chance.I know I'm ranting let's get to the point.  This is a beautiful cell phone holder. I'm a man that only takes quality. it's heavy duty, it holds my ultra 23 with the case tight and I'm sure you will be happy with it.

Once customer service got in touch with me, they sent me out a replacement, and sent me several notes to ensure everything was correct and offered to apply a lifetime warranty to the item if the same issues keep happening.  At the end of the day - if a company stands by a product like that, and is willing to go above and beyond to help, I can't really think of giving them less than 5 stars, so I am amending my review.Previous ReviewWhen first installed this mount seemed like it was going to work well.  Over time, the clear suction cup became yellow.  I e-mailed VICSEED that this did not look right and if they would replace it.  This was really an eyesore on the windshield, but they said this looked normal to them and if it had more of an issue in the future they would help out.A few months after this, I noticed it starting to melt, and so I went to take it off the windshield and it was a gooey mess as pictured.  I messaged them back for a replacement, as they said they would provide one when the suction cup started to fall, but they never responded to my follow-up e-mail.I can understand that things fail over time - but specifically they have the marketing claim that this \"will leave no residue behind\".  Per the pictures I have included, that does not seem true, and it was frustrating that they did not follow-up on the message to replace the unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1651881600000}

It is advertised as good for thick cases but my otterbox defender case is barely held. It is awkward like its not meant to be and your forcing it. I have a thin finger ring glued on the back of my otterbox defender case which is about the same thickness as a pop socket and it barely grabs the sides of my case and it is hard for me to get it to grip it when setting it up for use. It really needs another quarter of an inch of gripping sides to hold it confidently. Another issue is that I have it suctioned to my glass and in two weeks it fell off once...which isn't awful but still it isn not great either. I have it basically resting on right above the dash in case if falls off and it still pulled away from the windshield.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1615075200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Versatile. Easy to Install. Works as Expected.","reviewDescription":"Note: This review is based on the vent-mount, rather than the suction-arm mount. My phone is an LGV30, with the huge, heavy, Love Mei case, which is .6\" thick (a tenth of an inch thicker than this device recommends).So far, so good. It mounted quickly and easily, even with my giant, heavy phone case. It barely fit the width of my phone, and had to be slowly wiggled into place. However, this is probably because my phone case is a tenth of an inch thicker than their maximum allowance, so it meets the adjustable grips at a place where they're more narrow. I'll give them some slack on that.The device comes with two mounting options (suction mounted arm, or vent mount), which fits many scenarios. It keeps my phone securely in place, and allows me to position it exactly how I want it, for easy viewing. I haven't been using it long enough to see how durable it is under rough driving conditions, but will update if there are any problems.The specifications for this device say it handles phones that are \"4-7\" inches wide. I'm not sure what they mean by that. It will definitely handle a phone that is 7\" long, but the adjustable jaws only go 4\" wide. I suspect what they meant is that it will handle a phone that's up to 4\" wide and 7\" long.Another note here, regarding one two-star review, where they said this device wasn't for thick phones. That person's phone had a pop-socket mount glued to the back of it. You can't use this with a pop-socket mount, and it's not fair to judge this device based on such ignorance. Also, the specifications for this state your phone is supposed to be less than or equal to .5\" thick, and with their pop-socket mount, their phone was closer to an inch thick.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1623801600000}

They all are good at some things and poor at others. Maybe it\u2019s sturdy but it blocks a vent. Or it has good visibility but it\u2019s a little wobbly. Very sturdy, doesn\u2019t block anything, but it\u2019s out of your peripheral vision, making it dangerous.This mount is literally the only thing that I\u2019ve ever used that has checked every single box.Most important to me, it\u2019s extremely stable. You can extend the arm quite a bit and maneuver the angle to suit your needs, and I was shocked at how little jiggle there is. I\u2019ve actually bought two of these mounts and the original is still stuck to the glass where I installed it two years ago. That\u2019s impressive.And the fact that you can stick it to any glass means you\u2019ve got a lot of choices on where to mount it. I\u2019ve got mine off to the left in the small triangle window of the driver side door. This puts my phone just off to the side, perfect to keep my eyes on the road and check the map.It comes with a vent mount as well but I\u2019ve never used it. The glass mount is all I have needed. And I really like the spring loaded mounting mechanism which allows you to gently nest your phone in the holder and release it when done.Zero complaints for me. Especially at this price. I would probably pay double, given how durable it is. Knowing I won\u2019t have to buy another mount is priceless. The only reason I bought two, is because I got another car.I\u2019m a fan.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696636800000}

Other than that it's been great these last few weeks. Also I suggest setting the direction of the base of the mount like in mine and others photos, it gives you a couple extra inches so your phone isn't resting right against the vents, depending on your car.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1622073600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Happy I made the switch from vent clip to this holder!!!","reviewDescription":"Was very excited for this to arrive I\u2019ve gone through so many cell phone holders and I have finally given up with the vent clip and gone to the suction and this one with the extending arm works just perfectly with my wireless attachment. Very happy hopefully it sticks for a long time the suction is great but the adhesive doesn\u2019t really adhere to my dashboard as much as I\u2019d like but I can fix that that\u2019s not a big deal my biggest concern was whether it would coordinate with my wireless charger and it does and I am very happy with it","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1610755200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great but weight of phone causes tilt","reviewDescription":"I liked everything about this except for the fact that the piece that your phone actually sits on tilts from the weight of your phone. It\u2019s a problem I\u2019ve had with every phone mount, but this one at least mounts to the dashboard so it doesn\u2019t completely fall over. I do wish there were a way to tighten the ball and socket joint considering the fact that cheaper ones have that ability, but it\u2019s something I can look past for it\u2019s overall great quality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1623974400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good Product","reviewDescription":"The product is fine. I have had no problems with how it works. Though keep in mind if your dash is slightly curved, it will not stick to the dash. I had to stick mine to the window. I didn't want to cover up the ac, cause it's super hot during the summer.However, the rubber backing is just not holding up to the Texas heat. It has bubbled up and I hope the backing doesn't come off. I'll update if it does.Overall, it's solid and I believe you get a good product for what you pay for.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1594598400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Different brand second time ordered","reviewDescription":"Overall, this has a very great suction and does not get worried if there's excessive heat on your window like I have been used to with other brands. However I'm quite disgruntled about this one because this is the second time I ordered this particular one and the clamps are different than the first one therefore my phone doesn't set steady with the side clamps because they curve in the ones I had before actually were straight and not curved if that makes sense I will not be buying this again because of that. The whole idea is to hold your phone and if you have a contraction that can't do that then there's no purpose.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1626652800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Returning","reviewDescription":"The suction cup with the glue is great for the windshield. I had it there for a while with no problems...except putting in a sunvisor was impossible because of the huge arm sticking out of the glass. In the Vegas heat a visor is a must have. So, I decided to use the air vent option but the part that comes together to hold\/pinch the vent was way too long and hits on the inside components and wouldn't go in all the way (2020 4runner). So it would keep falling off with the weight of the phone. Lastly I tried the disc with \"3m\" like glue on the dash but that also didn't work and kept unglueing with the weight of the arm and phone. Returning.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1601683200000}

It\u2019s said to wipe the area and then press it on hard for a minute. Then let it sit for up to 72 hours before you try to attach the phone holder. I did all of this and the disc came right up after I attached the phone holder.

Now the suction cup wont stick any more. Now i have a adhesive pad screwed to the surface of the truck and the phone holder wont stick to it any longer.

{"reviewTitle":"Defective Part","reviewDescription":"Easy to install as windshield  mounted phone holder. It served its purpose well but after 8 months the phone mount suddenly collapsed. I was surprised to find that the plastic nut that holds the phone mount to the arm had cracked.  I attempted to connect with the manufacturer for a replacement part at the website that the Amazon rep identified for me but keep getting a 404 error message. I will try to see if I can get a replacement for the part at the hardware store but the inability to contact the manufacturer is disappointing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1631145600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not for thick case phones.","reviewDescription":"It's like any other car mount. I don't know why it's advertised as a thick case holder, bc is clearly not. All I have is a popsocket and it is not deep enough to hold the phone. If they would have just made the arms that clamp down just a bit wider, then they could claim that. I really don't know why it's so hard to design a car mount with deep clamp arms that can hold a phone in a case and has a hole on it like most phones now have. Very frustrating. Poor design on all car mount products.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1611187200000}
