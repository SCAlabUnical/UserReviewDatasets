{"reviewTitle":"Upgrade the Touchpad driver!","reviewDescription":"I couldn't justify spending the amount of money on the laptop I really wanted, and opted for this because it's good for the price. Initially everything was fine. Less than 24 hours later, the touchpad became unresponsive. I noticed shortly after startup the icon indicating the touchpad was off would pop up. I could only get a cursor by using a mouse in the usb.TL\/DRGo to drivers.softpedia.com and search for Acer Aspire ES1-111M Elantech Touchpad Driver 13.6.3.1 for Windows 10 64-bitIf there's a newer one, I didn't bother, this resolved the issue as soon as I setup the driver and rebooted the laptop. The driver that the laptop uses by default is an old 2006 Microsoft driver which can't handle the newer touchpads.Things that did not work (aka maybe don't waste your time):1. Turning the touchpad back on (also this laptop had the touchpad on f10, not f6 or f7 like other models)2. Checking updates (even the optional ones)3. Uninstalling the driver and rebooting to force it into reinstalling uncorrupted4. Entering BIOS and changing touchpad to PS\/2Save yourself the time and hassle, just install a better touchpad driver as soon as you're done with initial setup.Other than that, it's a good laptop. I do minimal gaming (I don't play AAA titles on pc but indie games are great), a bit of programming, some spreadsheet work, and a little graphic design work. This does what I need sufficiently. 4 stars only because of the issue with the touchpad driver, which seems to be very common if you read reviews around online.Update: I've knocked this down to 3 stars. I shut down the laptop last night, and after coming home from work today, I turned it on and it won't register my docking station anymore. I thought maybe an issue with my dock, but I did every troubleshooting step I could, and went to Google. When I was there, I noticed the touchpad was acting up. It wasn't allowing me to scroll. I checked the driver, and to my horror, it had reverted back to the outdated 2006 Microsoft driver. I looked at the rest of my drivers (as I had done the previous day to make sure nothing else was outdated) and EVERY DRIVER was a 2006 Microsoft driver, when just yesterday the oldest I had found was from last year. At this point I'm thinking about returning the laptop. I'm in the process of doing a system restore to what I had that worked, and if this still won't correct it, I'm sending it back. I have had this laptop for 3 days at this point, and two of those days were spent trying to fix it.Update: Leaving it at 2 stars. The restore slightly worked, all my drivers were back to normal EXCEPT the touchpad driver was still outdated from 2006, only now it won't let me install a newer driver. I reset the entire computer to see if that would help... Same, but at least now the other drivers aren't magically reversing to outdated garbage. I usually have my laptop hooked to a docking station so it's not the end of the world that I can't use the touchpad, but having to carry a mouse with me if I do want to take the laptop even into the other room is a nuisance.Unacceptable that after 4 days the touchpad became useless.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1715990400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Engineered to hurt your feelings.","reviewDescription":"First off, I scrutinized this purchase to make sure it fit my needs moving forward. Acer Nitro had done great in the past for me. The excellent lifetime given by my previous Nitro 5, i5 Gtx1060  from 2018. Brought me back with established brand confidence.Then it hurt my feelings with deceptive system write ups, misleading access port specs, ect...The short version.This is a whole lot of all the right components forced to live with each other against their will. This laptop is an uncooperative disappointment.All the gripes:I picked this model specifically for its Thunderbolt 4 USB C Display Adapter Port and was thrilled about the RTX3060 GPU.It took 20 hours of setup (WTF seriously) to find out that besides all the issues that would have made it a defective return anyhow, the Display Port is hard wired to the Intel HD on-board graphics processor. It is built to fail on that point.This system has issues built into it in ways that boggle your bogs. The screen had 7 to 8 light discoloration areas around the edges like it had been beaten on from the inside. The new power cord design is something I hope they have fixed in 2023. My experience was it caused power failures when moved while plugged in.  Sudden total power failures, it was like to a blackout.Speaking of feedback, the audio on board sends back slight popping sounds.  Digital distortions from all operations and outputs was intermittent; it does seem consistent as reported by other owners of this model. Some speculation whether this is a new WinOS build issue.If you are a VR user just looking to occasionally link to a laptop, find another. It is possible but the performance of the  RTX3060 in this systems build is surprisingly dismal. At midrange settings, no ray tracing, CP2077 (Cyberpunk 2077) was not able to hold 15 FPS for any interaction beyond the menu screen. The RTX GPU and the CPU share a studio apt with inadequate airflow. It heats up fast and \"The GPU Little Dual Fans that Could\" can't . Why they even let this build go into manufacture is beyond me. This machine cannot keep baseline operating temperature while watching a Movie. This is actually the first time in 13 years of having a laptop as a critical tool of my trade that I even noticed they had any fans. I always just gave them proper ventilation. You will notice these fans thiugh, when the 95 to 110 degree air starts blasting from all possible routes. This is the GPU warning you that an \" Emergency Safety Shutdown\" is about to occur because you are playing Fortnite or whatever. This was the only helpful unintended feature. I found I had about 15 to 20 seconds to save my game or work. By the time I figured out that workflow hack, I finally admitted to myself that I had been naive and was being stubborn trying to create work arounds and validate the value of my purchase.If you are the kind of person who enjoys taking badly designed hardware platforms and tinkering with them you found a deal here..Cyberware PC, ASUS, NITRO have done well by me for the 3 previous workstations I have built on their bare bones. My 2018 Nitro 5 survived, falls, collisions and was even stepped on (In my bag) and made a cracking noise that brought so many simultaneous gasps in a room full of technicians that you could feel the air leaving the room.So please don't let this lengthy review of this one product turn you away from the brand. It has been solid so far.Goodbye 2018 Nitro 5 you were a adequate tool and a  nobel machine.R.I.P.  \"MiniPrime\"2018-2023 Death by Winter Storm  \ud83d\ude2d Like tears in Rain,,I found it next an open window after a storm, in a puddle.Waaaah!If you read this whole thing, thanks I guess.

{"reviewTitle":"2 repairs needed since purchased 11 months ago...","reviewDescription":"If you're looking for a affordable gaming laptop, I'm sure this model came up. I mean, it looks cool, pricing appears reasonable, and there's room for upgrades, so what's not to like right? Well if only it was that simple.First the pros.1. Pricing.2. Ports (3 usb-a ports + 1 usb-c port + 1 hdmi port + ethernet port) ... yup, it's chunky!3. Wifi 64. upgradeable RAM5. Additional StorageFor me, I loved the fact that I could upgrade the RAM along with the SSD's and HDD. So I did just that. I swapped out the old RAM for 2 Crucial 16GB DDR4, boosting my RAM to 32GB. Not too shabby. Then, I added an additional 256GB M.2 PCle SSD and a 1TB SATA SSD making it even more chunkier.Parts List below (purchased through Newegg: Total cost $300.00):-Crucial 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4 2666MHz DRAM (Notebook Memory) CL19 1.2V DR SODIMM (260-pin) CT2K16G4SFD8266-Silicon Power 256GB NVMe M.2 2280 PCIe Gen3 x4 TLC SSD (SP256GBP34A60M28)-WD Blue 3D NAND 1TB Internal SSD - SATA III 6Gb\/s 2.5\"\/7mm Solid State Drive - WDS100T2B0ASo you would think it would be running amazingly well with all of this under the hood. At first, yes, but I noticed after a while that it would freeze up every now and then. Meaning the screen would freeze but would then go back to normal. I never took it anywhere so it stayed in one location on my work desk and stayed running into about 9 months of its purchased life (June 2022). Then it just died. No power. Nothing. Tried all the reset tricks but nope. Nada. So I sucked in my pride and went crying to ACER directly who shushed me and told me they would make it all better. They mentioned it was a faulty motherboard which they replaced since it was under warranty. No harm no foul. However....I've only had it for 9 months!Now here we are...2 months after I received it back from ACER and now I got the notorious black screen of death. Yup. It finally happened. Oh I've tried everything. Even turning it off and on again. But no, I must suck up my pride once again and go crying to mommy ACER to fix this yet again. And you know what they said? Of course little Timmy! Ship it to us free of charge since it's still under warranty. I mean, I'm impressed with the warranty to be honest. But they're trying to distract me from the fact that it's been 11 months since I bought this thing and have had to turn it in for repairs TWICE!!! Yeah the customer service is great, yeah the warranty is great, but c'mon!!! Oh, that brings me to my cons list:Cons (The bads, the uglies, the face palm moments)-It's loud (like standing on the tarmac loud)-Heats up fast (The cooling system isn't that great. I would recommend getting an external cooling pad)-It's Big (I call it my BBC...big black computer. errr...what were you thinking I meant?)-the power cord in the back requires a double push-in to ensure it connects (there are so many forums discussing this it's not even funny)-Requires a ton of power to run this thing. So yeah, the power brick is literally a brick.-And just because I'm picky, unfortunately you're stuck with the black & red ensemble. The glowy red color does not change. Either red or no red. That's it.So all-in-all, for under $1k bucks, you can have an okay laptop with about 1.5TB of Storage and 512gb of ram. It's loud and hot, might shut off sometimes and never come on, but long as you get the extended warranty then you've got nothing to worry about. So make SURE you get the EXTENDED warranty if you do buy it. Trust me, it pays for itself and you'll be using it sooner than you think. But if you want to save yourself a headache and have the extra $$ to burn, then you can definitely do better than this machine. Avoid if possible, but if it can't be helped then at least get the warranty. You've been warned my friend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661731200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nonstop Issues","reviewDescription":"I've delayed this review for so long because I wanted to try to rule out every other possibility beforehand. I can't fathom what else it could be but the computer at this point.Ever since I got this computer for when I travel, it's had issues. My first week consisted of reinstalling the OS 3+ times just to fix those issues (by this point I don't even remember what those original issues were). Then, ever since then, I know I've had the issue of USB ports.The USB ports will randomly lock out inputs. My microphone will randomly cut me off often, making calls very annoying. My controller will lock up my inputs randomly and for random lengths of time, making some gaming sessions impossible. I've thoroughly checked for viruses. Nothing. I've replaced my controller and the cords for both the controller and the microphone. Nothing. Everything works perfectly on other devices, then doesn't work on this one.I've since reinstalled the OS again, going back to Windows 10 instead of 11, while also completely wiping and reformatting the hard drive this time around to get an absolutely clean slate. Seemed good for a while, but no longer. Same USB issues. Also, Python's multiprocessing package fails to multiprocess on this machine correctly, despite the same exact code working perfectly on other machines with the same OS, same IDE, and same code. At this point, I'm convinced there's just underlying issues that's affecting all of these.I can't stand it anymore. I can't keep upping my IT skills until I can build a laptop by hand. A computer repair place couldn't even correctly diagnose my issues. I'm tired of this, grandpa. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm selling this soon and finding a replacement.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723507200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Can't use PIN for login without wifi","reviewDescription":"I set up a pin for my laptop when I bought it. Was using it and logging in just fine for the first week. And then took the laptop somewhere else where I wouldn't be at home or by wi-fi.I didn't realize that when you log in with your PIN it needs wi-fi to let you log in. I found this out the hard way once I was away from the wi-fi.You will get an error saying \"Something and went wrong and your PIN is not available, click here to set up a new pin.\" When you go to set up a new PIN it tells you you need Wi-Fi to do so.  I wasn't at a place where I had access to Wi-Fi and intended to do work for the day at a location away from home. If I had known you need Wi-Fi in order to use a pin I never would have set one up and it was not apparent that this was the case when I set up a pin. I'm going to try and see if I can remove the necessity to have a pin but then I worry about the security so I'll probably have to get a thumbprint login for the USB or something. If I can't figure out another solution I will be returning the laptop. I have another Windows 11 laptop that does not require Wi-Fi to do a pin login so it seems that if something specific to this computer. I think it's quite ridiculous to not have a system or you could log into a computer without wi-fi. But I mostly annoyed because there was no warning that this was the case when I set up the pin. Or if there was they did not make it obvious.Rest for speed, it does okay but it crashed when I was doing render work for video editing within the first week and what I was doing was not very intense. It also is not substantially faster than my basic laptop that has no fancy video card before rendering.It was a reasonable deal money wise but I'm not as impressed as I hoped to be. And then the pin thing happened and I was just very annoyed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1697932800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Stupid Design","reviewDescription":"Most annoying is that the keys are black and requires light to see the keys.  The keys do light up so they can be seen, but the backlight goes out after 30 seconds of no activity.  The user then has to press any key to get the backlight back on, which then enters that key on whatever you are working on.  If a backlight is required to see the keys, then you would think they would make the keys a more visible color than black.  Also, and this is really stupid, the keyboard goes black every 30 sec. of no use so it can qualify for some \"Eco\" designation.  Really, how much electricity is saved by a laptop keyboard going black every 30 sec.?  There is no way to change this 30 sec. interval. Stupid!Also, for some weird reason, to adjust volume, you have to press the \"Fn\" key and then the up or down arrows instead of dedicated keys.  Stupid!  Also, the layout of the keyboard is different from other laptops. So if you're using 2 computers, you have to place your hands in different positions. Stupid!The screen image is not very sharp.  Again, 2 hands needed to change the screen brightness instead of dedicated  keys, like most computers.  The \"F\" keys for volume and brightness do not work. Stupid!I would have returned this laptop, but I had it open and was setting it up when I realized this stupid design.

Seeing this made me gasp thinking it was a good deal when it was on sale for 850 US. i was so wrong. A 3050 with a miserable 10300h at 8gb at 2933 was a horrible combination. it is hard to just play simple high giving fps games like fornite, pubg, rocket league and many more. the only game i would cap out at 144 is rocket league and even then it would flicker every now and then to 90 or so. but other games at LOW texters no shadows whatever it may be, bottom of the barrel low barley gives you 60 and half the time your playing at 40fps. this is a honest review and i should have spent the extra hundred on something like a tuf laptop with a 17inch and better specs. this is not the computer for any real gaming. also when you receive the computer at \"256gb\" you realistically only get 180 because windows takes about 70-80 gigs just downloading. the drivers for this gpu is horrible at the moment and is bottlenecked by the absolute worst cpu i have ever used. every game is full load on gpu while the cpu cant push anything and dont think about overclocking because this computers psu wont allow it because its so bare minimum with the voltage that you cant touch anything about it besides upgrading the ram. dont go with this laptop is is HORRIBLE.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1653609600000}

The dedicated 3050 comes in handy when rendering finished models and the CPU is beefy enough to handle all the processing requirements these programs take.While the i5 is great for my own needs I would recommend going with the i7 if you can afford the extra costs. I haven't found a laptop yet that can beat the performance this offers at this price.However here are some drawbacks and considerations.The screen quality is great but the backlight shows slightly and the color seems a bit off compared to when I link the screen to another monitor. Maybe that's a user error, but its a noticeable difference from when I look at the same image on another screenTerrible battery life. Make sure you always have a charging cord handy and don't expect it to last the entirety of a long flight. The battery last around 4 hours with light usage. 3 hours if I'm rendering or designing. If power-saving mode is enabled you can extend this time frame at the cost of performance.Low Storage and mediocre ram. Luckily these issues can be mitigated. Additional storage slots for SSD and HHD are available to increase storage capacity. The RAM is acceptable for what I need, however, if you plan on rendering large projects or want to play some AAA games you'll want to upgrade these features.I'm very happy with my purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1648166400000}

Still neat, though!Only thing I'd change is I wish I'd have sprung for the 1TB version (or more, if they make it). Two of my games were 150GB each, so the memory filled up almost instantly.

{"reviewTitle":"La mejor relaci\u00f3n costo beneficio","reviewDescription":"Ya llevo con esta laptop casi un a\u00f1o y estas son mis impresiones:1. Lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 es la capacidad de expansi\u00f3n: ahora tiene 32 GB de RAM (crucial 3200MHz), dos discos NVMe (256GB, y 1 TB) y uno SATA de 1 TB.2. El rendimiento para los juegos es aceptable: Halo Infinite corre a unos 90 FPS a 1080p y calidad media-baja de configuraci\u00f3n. Otros juegos menos exigentes corren por encima de los 100 FPS.3. Hablando de la pantalla, la tasa de refresco es alta, no es tan c\u00f3moda frente a la luz directa (el brillo no es muy alto) y la representaci\u00f3n de colores no es la mejor. No lo recomendar\u00eda para edici\u00f3n de video o fotograf\u00eda, a menos que se contara con un monitor secundario de alta calidad.4. Para desarrollo de software es un gran equipo, el procesador, aunque ya de dos generaciones atr\u00e1s, responde bien. Windows inicia inmediatamente y funciona bien para virtualizaci\u00f3n.5. La bater\u00eda dura m\u00e1ximo 3 horas y media.6. El puerto USB C no tiene capacidades de carga de la laptop o de salida de video. Ser\u00eda ideal que un tuviera un lector de tarjetas integrado.7. No tiene el switch MUX (tampoco es de esperar en el rango de precios).8. El teclado se siente bien, el touchpad despu\u00e9s del primer mes empez\u00f3 a mostrar un brillo como si tuviera a\u00f1os de uso, sin embargo, mantiene su funcionamiento normal.9. No es un computador muy vistoso y la calidad de los pl\u00e1sticos no es la mejor. M\u00e1s pesado que un equipo no orientado a juegos pero sigue siendo transportable.10. La c\u00e1mara y el micr\u00f3fono son aceptables para videollamadas. Creo que los streamers preferir\u00e1n conectar mejores dispositivos.Conclusi\u00f3n: revisar el precio y comparar. Si hay equipos con i5 o i7 de 12\u00b0 generaci\u00f3n o con RTX 3060, a un precio similar, ser\u00eda mejor ir por esas opciones. Si el presupuesto es muy ajustado o est\u00e1 unos 200 d\u00f3lares por debajo de la competencia, el Nitro 5 vale la pena.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661990400000}

I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance @ 2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably. You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit. For games like WoW open world 89-144 fps out questing. PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with medium\/high settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit. But is great at 1080p seeing it\u2019s a smaller screen resolution @ 1080p looks amazing. color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well. I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does. Honestly I think it\u2019s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version. The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games. but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss. I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth. You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 2.5 sata drive slot as well.

Saw a lot of reviews about the laptop box arriving in a way larger box with a piece of paper used as \u201cstuffing\u201d this is correct\u2026 the laptop was shaking all around and I was nervous however the laptop box itself was very well packaged but Amazon could have done a lot more, easy way would just be use some bubble rap or even a lot more of the paper used to secure it.2. Opened everything up and I went to turn it on and nothing \u2026. Kinda made me nervous but I plugged it in and it fired right up, after going through the whole setup and landing at the desktop I could see that the battery was at 80%. I think they enable it so you have to plug it in the first time you use it since it connects to the internet and does updates so that makes sense.3.  Right after going through the long tedious setup process the very first thing I did was go to settings and search for \u201creset\u201d, from there you tell it to download a new copy of windows and let it do its thing. That way it gets rid of Norton and all the bloatware installed and you get a fresh vanilla copy of windows.4. Got everything back up and even installed a few games and so far everything has been great, no issues with screen, keyboard or anything else.5.

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing screen quality and performance at its price, but loud fans and poor speakers","reviewDescription":"The screen was sufficiently bright and could run games pretty well, but the fans were pretty loud and the speakers were kinda meh quality. The build quality of the laptop itself was very impressive, very rugged and durable, and the hinges seem like they would last at least 6-7 years.I found that you could lower the fan sound a little by setting the Power profile of your computer to Balanced, and helping it even further along by setting the display to 60 Hz, but it might require you to use Vertical Sync\/VSYNC in some games.  I was able to run Starfield at 100+ FPS on Low, but the fans were blaring at me the entire time. The fact that it also comes with SATA drive support is also very impressive, because most laptops have completely abandoned SATA support for NVME to save space and for slightly better thermal performance. This computer also has 2 fans for improved thermals (weird fact, I know, but some laptops only have 1), but they also generate twice the noise.Aside from that, this is a very solid entry-level gaming laptop and will be able to run modern games at low-medium settings for at least a few years.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697760000000}

{"reviewTitle":"For the price, this thing rules. However, upgrades may be required.","reviewDescription":"There are plenty of reviews already, so I will be brief. I got this thing over a year ago now and have used it fairly extensively. For the price I paid, it can do some serious gaming. Primarily when I got it I was looking for a high(ish) CPU clock speed, a dedicated graphics card, and enough USB ports to support a second monitor\/mouse\/external HDD.I will note that one thing about this laptop is that it has two major limiting factors. The SDD that comes with it is great for the OS, but modern games and having a bulk of files made it essentially required that I add on additional storage. My solution happened to be an external HDD, but it has space for additional internal drives.I also had problems with capping out the RAM. 8 GB is not enough for serious gaming with a modern web browser opening. I was experiencing some choppiness. I did just upgrade to 16 GB and it is running nice and smooth. If you plan on using it for a main gaming computer, consider replacing the RAM with something more appropriate.For the price, it really is hard to complain. Even with the cost of my upgrades to it, the total cost pales in comparison to the utility. If you are looking for a gaming laptop for under 1k, this is a worthy consideration imho.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708646400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Best laptop for your money, if memory ain't an issue...","reviewDescription":"Basically, the best budget computer. Yeah, including Desktops.You're telling me I can buy a gaming computer that outperforms AND replaces Xbox, can be used on the go, and only costs 800$?? That's amazing. Gaming laptops have never been more affordable, and powerful, all at once. Half the price of your standard gaming laptops, without the assembly of a gaming desktop.Enough gushing, though. It's not perfect. At this price, you can play generally any of the standard games with only minor problems. I played Halo Infinite and Modern Warfare well, loading faster than my Xbox buddies, but some menu navigation issues here and there were difficult to ignore. These games themselves run very well, but really push your computer's GPU, which means don't expect to play high end games for long without charging. That is to be expected.The material that makes this computer aren't the best, but good for the money. It's not the most delicate computer, but maybe don't go crazy and throw it or spill anything on it. It's a bit heavy if you plan to vibe out in bed or on the couch. Definitely don't game with this thing on your lap. Keyboard is so-so. Maybe don't eat over this computer unless you are okay with crumbs in the keyboard. Speakers are fantastic in my opinion. You can connect some Bluetooth speakers or earphones easily if you think otherwise.The AN515 model, the cheaper 800$ish you're likely looking at, you'll gonna lacking in RAM and SSD memory. It's not the end of the world...who am I kidding? 250gb SSD? That's way to small! Maybe consider the models with more RAM and Storage. They can run between 1000-1200$, but if you can afford it, or upgrade the RAM and storage yourself, it makes a world of difference. The most you'll need is an external HDD, which is maybe 80$ for 1tb. Still cheaper than most laptops and desktops.The Nitro 5 is definitely the best computer for a budget or if you're starting out and want a computer you can play right out the box. This can replace your Xbox, or a spare Xbox when you have friends over. This plays the majority of PC games at good resolution and framerate.  As a casual laptop for websurfing, videos, programming, Photoshop, you're in good hands, and can be easily upgraded if RAM or memory is an issue. Think of it as a portable desktop, or even a portable Xbox. You won't be disappointed, especially at this price.

{"reviewTitle":"The nitro key is THE WORST, it absolutely RUINS this model, and is DRIVING ME INSANE","reviewDescription":"It sounds silly, but there is one fatal flaw in this laptop design: the 'nitro' key. This key is positioned next to the Backspace key, and absolutely RUINS the user experience. It's so bad it makes me want to toss this laptop out the window and buy a different one (I don't have the money). Whoever designed this needs to be FIRED, and I don't say that lightly. I'm pro-worker! Pro-union! Extremely anti-nitro key. Definitely a fireable offense, I'm sorry. Terrible oversight. The should fire the designer's supervisor as well, and perhaps every product tester they employed. Just my 2-cents.Imagine you're typing up a paper for work or school. When you inevitably reach up to tap the Backspace key, your finger isn't perfectly centered. Maybe your nails are slightly too long, causing you fingertip to slip, or perhaps you were typing a bit too fast and your coordination lagged for a moment. It doesn't matter the reason, because the reality is that you're gonna hit that ridiculous \"nitro\" button, positioned immediately behind the Backspace key. After that you have approximately 2 seconds to close out of the start-up prompt before the computer fully engages the program, opening it over top of whatever important thing you were working on and turning your laptop's fans on jet engine mode (opening the program that manages this laptop's fans is apparently very taxing for the laptop????).Trust me, this WILL happen to you, and it will happen A LOT. SO MUCH. It's really driving me insane, but you cannot grasp just how often I open the annoying fan app on my laptop when all I want to do is fix my dang typos. And you gotta wait for the program to boot up, it's not like you have the time to keep typing while it loads. I begged my boyfriend (a computer science graduate) to help me turn off the sticky key, creating a dead useless nitro key that takes up space on my keyboard for no reason. He did, and everything was OK for a while, but guess what? Acer must've done some crazy update or something, BECAUSE THE NITRO KEY IS BACK and as annoying as ever. When you go to the Acer website, desperate for a way to get relief from the terrible nitro key, THE INSTRUCTIONS THEY PROVIDE ARE USELESS. The options that their example solution provides literally DO NOT EXIST. The fact they had to dedicate a page of their website to turning off their terrible nitro key says a lot, but the fact that their instructions to do so are completely wrong says even more. The nitro key is cursed I tell you! Cursed!DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SANITY. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. LAPTOP. If you're ignoring my warning and press on, I'll give an honest review on some other features:- anti-glare screen is actually very nice and useful, though I was a bit put off by it at first- key backlighting only works once you've pressed a key, not just from moving the mouse; good luck finding that first key in the dark lol. hopefully you don't accidentally press that nitro key...- battery dies fast; you get about 2.5 hours unplugged, even brand new out of the box- fans are way too loud. yeah, i get to play my favorite games, but I can't hear them unless I have my earbuds in and turned up to the point of damaging my poor cochleas- you cannot adjust fan settings. even if you drag the little dials that determine each fan's power, they literally do nothing. I think it's like when you're at a crosswalk and you press that little button to make it switch to pedestrian crossing faster but it doesn't really do anything except pacify you. that's what the fan settings on this laptop are like.- audio quality sucks noticeably, plus this laptop never gets loud enough to hear over its godforsaken fans- i like that this laptop has some weight to it, it doesn't feel super fragile and paper-thin like so many others on the market todayDo not buy this laptop.

I love how the keyboard lights up, I love how it boots up quickly, the great response in gameplay. The only thing that I do not like about it is the battery life is like 3 hours. I called the acer help desk to see is this is a problem. I was told that this is normal. This is not a problem for me because I do not travel and can plug it in when I need the battery recharged. This might be a problem for other folks.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704067200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent secondary or beginner gaming computer.","reviewDescription":"I bought the Acer Nitro 5 with the i5 10300H CPU and the RTX 3050. I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgrades.Pros:-The visual fidelity is outstanding. Games like Battlefield 4 and 5 run perfectly and look amazing. Forza -Horizon 4 runs amazing at high FPS around 80 to 90 on high settings.-The Windows home screen and Cortana work great since it has a built in mic and designated buttons on the keyboard. Much better usage than on a PC.-It is very lightweight and portable.-Screen has soft colors but is very crisp.-Boot times are very fast.Cons-The battery life is atrocious but who isn't gaming without plugging in first? Watching Youtube only the battery lasted unplugged around 3 hours.-The laptop gets pretty warm and the fans are loud almost instantly loading into a game. This is not a huge issue for anyone wearing headphones.-The layout of the keyboard is very tight and you will click the wrong keys at some point. Also the touchpad is in a very strange position offset to the left so you'll want to disable it and use a mouse.Overall, this is a fantastic laptop for anyone getting into gaming computing. I own a PC with a 2080ti and even still am impressed by this little computer. The budgeting option to spend $168 a month for 5 months was a no brainer to me. If you are going to buy a laptop for any reason, might as well get a gaming one like this!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1634860800000}

I went with the cheapest option, mainly just wanted to turn on Ray Tracing in Minecraft, yet totally impressed. It's an i5, but one made specifically for gaming, 3 times the voltage, twice the thread count, and slightly better then the i7 9th and Ryzen 5. Currently the 6th best benchmarked chip despite being now 2 gens old. Ram is easy to upgrade, just a couple screws.As for frames per second, I could only find 2 games that dropped it under 100 in performance mode\/game mode with ultra on: Cyberpunk at 70, and ghost recon at 45.I'd say it's weakest link is actually the wifi. Plugging in an Ethernet I was capped by Steam at 100mbs, but wirelessly, 10mbs.  Even did a broadband check at speakeasy, 10mbs. Fiddled with every setting, driver and windows update to no avail.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent laptop for the price!","reviewDescription":"At this price, you'll have a hard time finding the same raw power anywhere else. So far, I've played No Man's Sky and Planetside 2 (at default settings) with no framerate issues that I can notice. Minecraft with RTX also works. It has a few framerate hiccups, but I've seen the same from some desktop RTX cards.The screen is nice. The colors aren't washed out by the backlight, like in other laptops, and the higher refresh rate makes everything feel liquidy smooth.A big factor that drives the price down is, of course, the storage. The more modern games you'll probably want to play on this machine are usually 50+ GB in size, and at that rate, the 250 GB hard drive is going to fill up in no time. Just remember that the storage is extremely upgradeable--another feature that's hard to find in laptops at this price point. Don't need a ton of storage? Great, enjoy the low price. Need more storage? The option's there for you when you're ready.P.S. I was wary at first, because Acer has a bit of a \"you get what you pay for\" reputation. But I've had it for about a month now, and haven't encountered any issues. I also purchased the 4-year protection plan, just in case.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1647302400000}

Not that anything wrong with 8Gb ram and 256Gb SSD but 8Gb rams are not that expensive at all these days.. I had 2TB SSD from my big computer, just switched it over.

This computer does play FPS games, and plays them very smooth. The fans start running though, and you might think it's overheating, that's not the case, it's normal. They don't go full speed. I also play mobile games and stream through laptop... no heating no fan issues at all... it's like so smooth and easy for the machine.

Why any company in their right mind would do this, I don't know.. but I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this trash.Edit - So I ended having to return the new drive that I bought for the laptop, and purchased an M2 drive, to replace the one that was in there, this was how I solved the problem. The laptop has the ability to add 2  M2 drives, and one 2.5 drive. I wanted to remove the M2 drive that came with it, and just install the 1tb 2.5 SSD... but that was not possible, and I was in contact with support on multiple occasions. Since then, I have had no issues with the laptop. I wish it could be upgraded past 32gb RAM, but I guess this are the limitations that come when buying a \"budget\" laptop, which this considered to be.

(This is the biggest PRO)- Great cooling ~ I never had an overheating problem while using a cooling pad.- Easy access to multiple slots for adding extra Storage & RAM.- Backlit keyboard is really nice, even when using it in a well-lit room.CONS:- 2 USB ports died after 10 months. Sending it in for repairs takes over a week so I had to buy the $50 part and replace it myself.- The mousepad started acting jumpy and annoying to use. No problems with using a mouse but sucks for pad users and I've never had this problem with other laptops before.- The Delete [Del] key, in the top-right corner, is moved one space to the left and [Home] key is in its place.

{"reviewTitle":"Best Priced for the Quality!","reviewDescription":"I've been searching and reading about all the different laptops because they don't make them like my old Toshiba laptop anymore. Mine finally died after replacing parts for over 12 years. This one was missing the RGB customization for the keyboard and I love having 2 mouse click buttons at the bottom of the mouse touchpad but it's impossible to find that now besides the Lenovo's Thinkpad. The camera quality could be better than expected and some of the keyboard keys are smaller when trying to type on here but I think this should suffice me for the next several years. I'd suggest buying a webcam for clear picture quality if purchasing this and using it a lot. I also think for the price, they could've made the \"N\" logo on the bottom of the screen light up as well with the keyboard.BTW**TO DISABLE THE TIMEOUT ON THE BACKLIT KEYBOARD:You have to go into Nitrosense.

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty good gaming laptop.","reviewDescription":"Review for the \"Acer Nitro V Gaming Laptop | Intel Core i5-13420H Processor | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050\".In my opinion the webcam is okay but quite noisy. The little microphones sound okay. Wish there was a hardware disable switch for the webcam and microphones.Gaming performance seems good for 1920x1080p Gaming at medium settings. In BFV while using performance mode I never dropped below 60FPS while at medium settings.Fan noise is a lot louder in performance mode, but if you switch to balanced mode then your FPS will suffer at the gain of decreased noise level.The screen is 144Hz which is great for non-intensive games and scrolling. It also seems pretty good with color accuracy.The CPU and GPU seem well matched performance wise. However, battery life is not great.There is only 8GB of RAM Which seemed in my testing to be fine if you're not doing too much at the same time. I only had a couple things open in the background while gaming and the RAM usage was at about 94%. So if you plan on doing more than one activity at the same time then I recommend getting 16GB of RAM.I thought the speakers sounded really good, and even without headphones I was able to track enemy positions. At max volume you will feel the explosions.The keyboard seems good to me. Not the best I have used, but it's good. For a laptop there is a lot of key travel, although there is some key wobble and the key corners sink too much for me. The backlight does not shine through the key letters.Overall, I think it can play games and give you a pretty good user experience. There was not too much bloatware, but I got rid of the McAfee before I did anything else. Trackpad is okay, screen is good, keyboard is mostly good, speakers are good.

{"reviewTitle":"Good performance but very lacklustt control over the performance","reviewDescription":"The setup was easy as it was a standard Windows setup, and the laptop itself feels solidly constructed as much as a plastic case laptop can feel. The keys feel alright, like typical scissor switch laptop keys and the screen is pretty good and clear looking.The primary focus of the laptop of course is gaming performance and in that front the laptop performs quite admirably. While plugged in with the included charger, the performance is on pair with a desktop 3050 but, however, when not plugged in and the max performance mode isn't able to be used, the performance is about 20 to 30 percent worse which is probably for the best though since when not plugged in this bad boy burns through the battery juice like nobodies business with the battery going down a percent basically every minute and a half while gaming.The battery life while not gaming is better but still not too great as the battery still goes down at an appreciable rate of about a percent every 2.5 minutes. Luckily, you can charge the laptop using usb c so you can charge the laptop using a power bank while you're not hooked up to a wall. The 65 watt usb c charging is enough to counteract the drain while gaming, but for some reason while charging this way the performance takes a leap down of about 20 percent, being even worse than when the laptop is on battery even though the laptop is being charged just not with the included charger.This brings me to the worse part about this laptop which is the horrendous amount of control that is given in terms of the performance and fan speed. The software is ass when it comes to fine tuning the power of the GPU and CPU as there are basically only 3 settings - eco, normal, and max. Similarly, the fan speeds have only around 7 speeds and the difference between each is too great so you can't get the noise level or heat of the GPU or CPU down to the amount that you actually want. As far as I know there is no way for any additional amount of control to be given since afterburner doesn't work as the GPU just throttles down to the standard performance setting.Still, the performance of the laptop is satisfactory, and it will run any games on the go as long as you adjust the settings to be lower since the laptop doesn't have too much power especially when not plugged into a wall and even more so when charging using a power bank using usb c which you may want to do whenever you want to use the laptop but also want to maintain the battery percentage but don't have an outlet to plug into.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1717632000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great for gaming","reviewDescription":"The whole thing is made mostly of plastic, but doesn't look low-end at all. The design is very nice and relatively thin. The keyboard feels average, not suitable for typing, but fine for gaming, and it doesn't support RGB settings. But the touchpad is better than expected. The screen isn't too narrow, but it's not too wide either, which is nice. The screen is a 15-inch matte screen, does not support touch, and is of average quality. Because of its 1080 resolution, there's noticeable graininess on the 15-inch screen, but it supports a 144 refresh rate, which is great for gaming. The heat dissipation vent in the upper right corner is a bit awkward, as it blows hot air towards the display for a long time. I wonder if there will be permanent damage to the monitor later on.In performance mode, when running Cyberpunk 2077, the CPU performance can reach up to 20W, and the 4050 has a maximum performance of 75W. The average performance is about 56 frames, with a maximum of 85 frames and a minimum of 41 frames. The graphics card temperature was about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the keyboard position was only about 90 degrees Fahrenheit. , does not affect normal use at all, and the game is still smooth, because the monitor only supports up to 1080. Then use furmark to use 100% of both the CPU and graphics card. The maximum temperature is only about 170 degrees, the GPU power consumption is 75w, and the CPU is 20w. The fan is a bit noisy, but the cooling effect is good.Laptops in 2024 only have 8g of memory, which is indeed less, but you can add an extra piece of ddr5 memory. There are also a total of two SSD slots, m2 ssd PCIE x 4, and a 512G one is included. Equipped with a 57Wh battery, it can be used for about 4 hours under normal use. If used at full capacity, it can only last for one hour. There are also built-in speakers, the sound quality is very poor, and there is a popping sound when turned up to the maximum volume.This entry-level game console is actually equipped with Thunderbolt 4, which is very surprising. It can be used to connect external displays or transfer data quickly. It can also charge mobile phones, iPads, etc., but unfortunately it does not support powering laptop PDs. So you have to carry its bulk adapter.Best of all the price is $779. I think there are better options at this price point.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1714089600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Size vs Performance!","reviewDescription":"I chose this Acer Nitro for my wife as she basically does everything on her iPhone, however, not everything can be done on a smartphone, easily! I ran a benchmark of this Acer vs my Lenovo and this Acer is rated twice as good and good for gaming. I think an experienced gamer may hesitate with the i5, being more for a beginner. My Lenovo is i5 and after typically using i7, I noticed a big difference in response time when processing requests. I do have to say the Acer Nitro is much more responsive than my Lenova, though! As I am not a gamer, I can only go by my many years of using different laptops. The keyboard is standard qwerty, the included number pad is a must, for me, and the separate up\/down\/left\/right arrows are very useful. Setup was quick and easy. Sleek case, modern. The 15\" is screen is crisp and clean, making text easy to read. Images are excellent. Where we travel quite a bit, the easy of throwing into a back pack is great. the charger is by 3.5 mm or similar, but it also has a thunderbolt, type-c, port for additional charging options. My 65 w charger from the Lenovo would charge it, albeit slowly, and get a warning the charging is weak! The included Acer charger is 165 w, which explains the difference, but it is one less device of equipment we need to carry. In this day and age, not sure why they do not include a type-c charger. The other thing I miss on the Acer vs my other laptops, the touchscreen, I never realized how much I use a touchscreen until I'm on a laptop that excludes it.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1718582400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Basic and budget friendly","reviewDescription":"The NVidia Geforce RTX 4050 in a gaming laptop at this price point is the real winner here.  Does the rest of this budget gaming laptop stack up?  As an entry level experience, yes.  This is not meant to be a powerhouse machine and the price reflects that.  The case is bare bones and only has the necessities; however, it does have room for expansion.  The num pad is crammed in, leaving less room for the rest of the keys.  The keyboard is backlit, but there\u2019s no RGB or customization.  One particular annoyance I noticed with this keyboard is the num lock key has to be reset every boot up.This laptop can run all of the latest and greatest games so long as you aren\u2019t attempting to max out the settings.  The harder it has to work, the less battery life you\u2019ll have between charges and the louder it will get (and it gets LOUD).  The battery is the biggest issue here.  Even with basic use, it doesn\u2019t last long.  I got about 4hrs out of it before it hit the 10% mark, and this was only from my testing various games and software.  I wasn\u2019t playing any one single game for longer than twenty minutes, nor was I multi-tasking.  If you plan on using this in one place, it\u2019s not really a big deal.  If you want something portable to travel and game, this probably isn\u2019t for you.The screen is 1080p; not horrible, but not the best.  I do appreciate the matte surface, it cuts out a lot of glare.  The speakers are acceptable, but not something I would use on the regular.  A headset or a pair of nice external speakers is a must if you want a truly immersive experience.Overall, it\u2019s not a bad deal.  It offers decent performance and has room to add a little more power if you want it.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1714262400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Fantastic overall though some things to keep in mind\/be aware of","reviewDescription":"So I've had my Acer for almost a year now and here are my thoughts, struggles, FYIs for those thinking on getting one.First big thing is RAM 8gb is a very small amount and if you're planning on any sort of heavy gaming beyond some old titles or mmo you'll want to upgrade it (great thing is though that it's easy enough to swap out).Second is battery when I was still deciding on buying or not there was a few reviews mentioning a possible battery issue where it it will start losing its charge and having to swap it and sure enough after a few months I saw my battery slowly but surely losing its charge and decided to order a replacement. Now as I was waiting for it I lost power for some hours mid gaming and chose to just run the battery out until it came back after draining it and the power got back on for charging the battery issue was gone which while great was a bit frustrating having to go through a return for the replacement battery.Lastly temperature it can get fairly warm so I'd recommend getting a cooling pad if anything for longevity especially if you're like me and plan on using it for years to come.Outside of those couple things it's been perfect for me especially for an under 1k laptop.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"58 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669852800000}

I was so worried. turns out, it was just the charger, and after replacing it works greatthe main thing I have to say isn't aabout the laptop but about amazon..they were so kind and proffesional with their help. the momentit turns out to be a problem with the charger they ffer a full discount for the defective charger. no trouble at all. I took more time writing this review than explaining the problem and getting help from them. if you want to buy latop from amazom I highly recommend it - and in Israel especially - much better service than the local companies and MUCH cheaper.now for the latop itself:it is a capable laptop. nothing to fancy or heavy ( i bought the 1 5 10300H version with RTX 3050 )PRO:price, hardwareCONS:the screen is weird. it hurts my eyes sometimes, and even thogh it is configured to 144 HZ, something doesn't add up. not feel right (checked several times, it is configured to 144 HZ)other than that:keyboard fels cheap, and the cover is a cheap plasticthere was also the issues with the charger I saidoverall, for the price, I think it was a great choice. for people who want a gaming beast or even just high quality laptop - this is not the place. but if you want a capable cheap laptop I thinkfor the price it is quite a fair bargain","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1639180800000}

{"reviewTitle":"If you can swing it, get the Legion 5 instead.","reviewDescription":"In the \"almost touching four figures\" range, there are a lot of surprisingly good gaming laptops coming onto the market from different manufacturers. Assuming each one was available, you'd be spoiled for choice this summer. Decent processors, nice midrange RTX GPU's, and at least a certain degree of expandability should be expected.Acer's Nitro 5 is... well, not great. Personally, when I think Acer, I think \"budget\". And there's nothing wrong with budget systems and components. I'm quick to recommend Acer to people on a tight budget who are looking for entry-level laptops. Their stuff isn't top-tier, but is usually fine for what you pay. Few of us have infinite dollars to spend on computers. Though Acer tends to make their products *feel* like they're not quite as good as everything else, and the Nitro 5 is no exception here.Case in point: at the time of this writing, another hundred bucks or so gets you the. And for that hundred dollars, you get build quality that makes the Nitro feel kind of flimsy, you get a processor that absolutely trounces the comparatively anemic i5 10300H, twice the RAM, twice the storage space, an ARGB keyboard, and a faster refresh rate on the display.All that, for a hundred bucks. Give or take.So, is that a testament to Lenovo giving you an incredible value, or Acer not being up to par? Yes.Having both systems side-by-side, it highlights so many places where Acer could have delivered, but cheaped out. When you delve into what you're getting with the Nitro 5, everything about it feels like you took the cheapest thing on the shelf. From the very beginning, you need to dedicate nearly an hour out of the box just for Windows updates that Acer didn't add to their shipping image. And not because of a slow connection (I was hitting in the neighborhood of 800 megabits over 802.11ax) but you can feel how constricted the system really is with that i5 and only 8 gigs to work with.Once you've got your Windows updates set, you have to navigate the sea of bloatware that Acer loaded the Nitro 5 up with. No, I don't want Express VPN. No, I don't want Dropbox. No, I don't want your weird app store. No, I don't want your... whatever this password manager thing is that I've never heard of. No, I don't want... And it hits you that while you'd wading through all of this junk, Acer thought it would be good to put their system update software other than in the Acer folder. It's kind of a head scratcher.All the while, the bottom of the laptop gets scorching hot. Yeah, a gaming laptop without a great vapor chamber is going to get toasty, but again, it's one of those areas where Lenovo figured out how to make efficient heat pipes that make the Legion 5 bearable. Why didn't Acer?So I moved on. Let's get 3DMark and PCMark on here, and see how it compares. And even that produced a \"Go home, Acer. You're drunk.\" kind of emotion. Load up 3DMark, and it says \"Hey, you've got an i5, and I see this RTX 3050 over here...\" and then it barfs at the end saying that it couldn't quite figure out what you have. I installed official GeForce drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled 3DMark, and still got the same \"This isn't official because reasons.\" message. But don't take my word for it. Check out the pictures I've attached.So the results, while not \"official\" tell a pretty interesting story about what a hundred bucks more gets you. As you can see, these are the Acer Nitro 5 against the Lenovo Legion 5. While 3DMark is calling the GPU \"Generic VGA\", you can see for yourself that the specs are correct for a 3050 dGPU and are too high to be the iGPU from the i5. But they're also 1618 apart.For perspective's sake: the difference between the Nitro 5 and the Legion 5 is 100 points greater than the difference between the Legion 5 and my desktop Ryzen 9 5900X with an RTX 3080 GPU. And again, you can see that the dGPU is running at full frequency. Even if you're thinking \"Oh, this dude is a total Lenovo shill, and the results don't have approved drivers, and I'm an internet detective and blah, blah, blah...\" look at the CPU scores. There's no CPU driver. And it isn't like Acer or Lenovo are like \"Yeah, go hog wild with settings for undervolting and underclocking in our expansive BIOS features\" on either system.In my review of the Legion 5, I took it apart and ran PC Mark, and dug deeper into it because I couldn't believe how much power you were getting for the price. But with the Nitro 5, I didn't see much point. The moment you try to slap more RAM into it, you're at the same price point. It would cost you more to bring just the RAM and NVMe drive to the same specs as the Legion 5, and you'd still have a slower computer with a slower refresh rate, worse warranty, inferior build quality, middling keyboard, and terrible heat management.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1627171200000}

I am not impressed with Acer Company. I will buy from this merchant again, but not the Acer brand. This merchant had very fast delivery and the machine was packed very well. They were very responsive to my need for help! Good merchant, but poor quality Acer Laptop. I have not used it for gaming only for graphic work (Excellent machine for graphics), so I can not speak to the gaming quality this machine is usually sold for.

I tested out the graphics and glad to say its runs quite well, though maybe not at the max and highest of definitions but at the least medium to high graphics. The fans on the laptop are quiet and I have yet used the nitro key when gaming. I mostly expect to play on the laptop plugged in since the battery doesn't last too long even in battery saver mode.

Push it in Then Push it a second Time!","reviewDescription":"ATTENTION IF YOU CANT POWER ACER NITRO 5 ON READ THISI just got my Acer5 today 6\/5\/2022 so I can't say much about it yet in regards to experience, however I can tell you how it was delivered, I didn't like the delivery method at all. When the package arrived the box was hanging open with some garbage quality amazon tape barely holding it closed, the box it was in for shipping was WAY larger than it needed to be, rectangular wide almost 75% bigger than my laptopsactual box and had no filler to keep it from moving, im surprised it was still in the delivery box at all.None the less I tried to test the laptop and it wouldnt turn on I figured it was dead as I tested it in my car with an outlet in my car at work, fine whatever. I bring it back home (just go with it) and I try an actual wall outlet when I get off work, doesn't work just like the car. At this point i'm thinking, I know how computers work this is stupid and defective and I'm frustrated. I got all the way through starting theprocess of sending it back on amazon when I googled one last time for answers and this worked for me.TLDR Answer: Plug the laptop in, it will feel like its in but its not, make sure its plugged in with the plug facing sideways in the socket, then press down HARDER, and you will hear a click, basically you push it into th slot once and then push it a second time to get it in. It's some kind of feature and it made me think my laptop was bonked up. I hope this helps people, I know I was FRUSTRATED, otherwiseseems like a decent laptop so far.Edit: It seems this has helped 50 people thats cool. Would be kinda cool to see what people have to say. If you'd like to direct thankyou messages feel free to email \"deudomufo@gmail.com\" im moderately enthused to hear how it's helping out.P.S. laptop is still working great, but it does run into some issues as a video editing laptop in after effects. The software eventually freezes permanently and you have to close it. Which is a shame because the GPU should be great for it..

{"reviewTitle":"For the price, a solid laptop","reviewDescription":"For the price, this is a solid laptop to be used for basic gaming. However, I would say that this laptop is not really great at anything it does. The SSD is too small for a lot of games to be installed, but it does have an extra SSD and HDD slot, so you can easily upgrade (which I did after about a month). The RAM is also lacking, but another easy upgrade to make. Another negative is the build quality. The laptop feels cheap and plasticy (which I don't think is a word), but for the price that you pay it can be expected. The battery life for basic tasks, like writing, internet research, and light movie watching is pretty terrible. At most I get 3-4 hours. But for gaming, you wouldn't use it off the charger anyways so its a mute point if you plan on using the laptop for its stated purpose.Now for some positives. The display itself is really nice. Games look great as well as movies and it has a really nice refresh rate. I actually enjoy the typing experience of the keyboard.For games, this laptop plays Farming Simulator perfectly on maxed settings. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 can be played at slightly less than max settings as long as you are using it off the laptop screen. If you are using an external monitor, depending on the size of the monitor you might run into a little bit of trouble. I have a 49\" monitor and when I tried plugging the laptop into it wasn't able to maintain the same quality and performance.Overall, I would say that if you are looking for a cheap gaming laptop to do some light gaming on the road then this is a good laptop for that. If you want a gaming laptop and one you can do work on the coach with, this isn't it. If you want hardcore gaming, this also isn't. For the price though, I would say that its a solid laptop just don't expect to do everything you want at max settings.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672272000000}

The performance is great as well as it can play most modern games at 1080 ultra settings at great FPS.The negatives for me come in two-fold: the display and battery life.1. The display being 144hz and IPS is great and all, but the actual quality of it is below mediocre. While backlight bleed is expected for an IPS panel, it's weirdly uneven and discolored. Also, I'm not sure if it's a defect with my specific device, but the display can't produce the color red accurately (it's more orangish) and overall things look a bit flat and there's no way to actually fix it besides finding your own ICC file. And even then you might as well use an external monitor.2. The battery life is terrible. Even on powersaving mode the laptop barely lasts 5 hours, and that's just doing basic internet browsing.

I've use Devinci Resolve 18 (Free) to edit my GoPro 9 and Sony FDR-X3000 vloggs.

Get a laptop stand but never run the extra fan. Just packs extra dust into the machine. I have one just as a base for better bresthing of my own laptop.The keyboard is also quite nice. I don't mind the short stokes, my fingers glade across like a gizzle.Just make sure to lower the keyboard brightness (helps with battery)Windows 11 isn't bad either, they did it right, has a Mac-ish feel, i like it.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent Value Gaming Laptop","reviewDescription":"Good sub-$1000 gaming laptops are hard to find, but The Nitro 5 gives great value without breaking the bank.  The 10th Gen Core i5 processor is 2 generations old at this point, but it has plenty of power to run pretty much all modern games at a decent setting.  The Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics processor is an entry level to the new Ray-Tracing sexiness that's the next big thing in graphics.  On newer games you probably won't be able to get past the 60fps barrier at 1080p with the settings cranked, but dialing the details down a bit will give you better rates. The display is rated for 1080p and 144hz, and while it's not the brightest or most vibrant screen out there, it's fine for this price point.  There is also a (full size) HDMI out, but I have not had occasion to connect this to an external monitor yet.  The cooling fans do a good job of keeping this machine within temp specs... but do note they can get pretty loud under load (honestly that's almost inevitable on a gaming laptop, it's hard to keep things cool in such a small box. Anyone who games on a laptop should invest in a good headset IMHO.)I have opened this computer up to install a few upgrades (more on that below) and I will say I'm pretty impressed with the build quality for a computer in this segment.  The components are reputable makes rather than mystery off-brands (WD for the SSD, looks like Micron on the single 8gb RAM stick.) All the panels fit together nice and go back together easily after disassembly, making upgrades something you don't have to dread.Speaking of those upgrades... for a computer at this price point you have to live with a few compromises and here is where they may be found.  The storage this model comes with is a paltry 256gb m.2 drive... If you do plan on gaming on the Nitro, either be ready to upgrade this quickly or learn to love delete-ing and re-installing games and apps constantly.  Fortunately, there is a second un-used m.2 PCIe slot on the motherboard to accommodate an upgrade (this processor and motherboard supports PCIe up to gen-3 speeds.) There is also an open 2.5 inch bay for an SSD. Memory-wise, this unit comes with a single 8gb DDR4 SODIMM RAM stick installed.  This should be fine for most gaming- if you don't run big apps in the background-  but since this has two slots total for an upgrade I removed it and installed 2 8gb sticks of Kingston FURY Impact DDR4 RAM,  just for a bit of extra headroom (the max speed the i5 10300H will operate memory at is 2933 Mhz, so it's not worth it to spend more on faster RAM.)All in all, this is a fine machine for someone who's interested in a good no-fuss entryway into PC gaming, or a seasoned gamer who wants an inexpensive but capable machine to go mobile with.

{"reviewTitle":"Budget friendly for new-to-PC","reviewDescription":"This is very much a highly modifiable and budget friendly starter PC. As soon as you look at the hardware you know there are going to be bottleneck points if you want to actually use this for more than 1 modern program. I immediately put it a Predator SSD and upgraded the RAM to 32 bit @ 3200 MHz (two RAM sticks at 16 is going to benefit more than a single 32) which skyrocketed the CPU performance. Every upgrade video you will see show a bunch of adapters that you don't need. There are two (2) M2 ports you can easily access removing the bottom; one hosts the original Hard Drive and the second I put the new SSD drive in, I then followed the Hard Drive copy process on their website and within 10 minutes I was done. It also opened up the bottleneck in the system and allowed games to appropriately use the GPU.Now, the GPU is just midgrade but you get what you pay for. You're not going to play Battlefront \/ COD at 1080p by any means without a lot of lag, but after just the two upgrades every game so far it flawless at 720p. I could have also lowered the refresh rate from 144 Hz and gotten the responsive 1080p at the cost of smoothing. You can plug in an HDMI-ported high refresh display that bypasses the graphics bottleneck but you got a laptop for a reason and the GPU can still only handle so much.Overall, this is my first time getting a dedicated gaming PC and I'm extremely happy with not only how well it performs but how well laid out it is to modify\/upgrade. I would recommend it to people starting out and don't have a high graphics demand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705795200000}

I've tried calibrating the battery(No flash for 2 days), battery resetting(No flash for 10 hours), unplugging the battery(No change). None of these things would get that darn light to stop flashing. So, to remedy this issue, I've changed the battery. Low and behold, it never has flashed orange since. First thing I recommend with this laptop is change the battery ASAP for two reasons. 1. The battery life isn't very long. 2. Prevent that issue that I ran into when buying mine.(plus it lasts 4 hours longer than the one it came with.)I haven't hit my 80 Days with it.
