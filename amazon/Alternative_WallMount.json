{"reviewTitle":"This is a very nice device, and if you have any handiness with tools, easy to install on the wall.","reviewDescription":"I have a 32 inch TV, and this accommodates it well, but I chose this wall mount because it will support a larger TV when I replace the one I am using now. The hardest part of installing this thing was finding the wooden framing behind my walls. Even with a stud-finder, it was a bit tricky.There is a list of tools needed to install this that do NOT come with it. Luckily I had all of those already on hand. If I had not, I might have been a bit annoyed, In addition to what is included in the box you need the stud finder if you are installing on a plasterboard and framed wall, a cordless drill with a 5\/32' (4mm) bit, a manual Phillips-head screwdriver, A socket wrench and a 1\/2 inch socket (12 or 13 mm), an awl or ice-pick, and a pencil.It would also be easier mount on the wall if you have a spare set of hands to keep the mount in place while you crank the top two lag bolts.NOW that it is installed I only have two very minor issues with it.1. The bars that attach to the television  stick up over the top of the set, which will no longe be an issue when I replace my little TV.2. The set pulls out and retracts very well, and tilts from side to side easily. However the vertical tilt has to be chosen and locked in. If you want to change it you have to loosen two bolts and then retighten them once you have moved the set to the preferred angle. It would require a sophisticated bit of machinery to overcome this, so for the price I can't really complain.In all this is a very functional television wall mount, and very sturdy if installed correctly.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718668800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Exactly as advertised.","reviewDescription":"This would get 5 stars if the back plate was about 18\" wide instead of about 13\".  Why you might ask...Well, install instructions tell you to mount the four corners on wooden studs when mounting to dry wall.  The problem is, in most residential constructions studs are 16\" apart.  This mean, if you want to stud mount you have to get creative. Fortunately the back plate has two holes dead center which I used to stud mount and then I used heavy duty mollies to secure the corners.  This is not recommended or \"suggested\" in the mounting instructions and hardware to do this is not supplied.  While I am not an engineer, I believe this is wholly adequate and unless someone hangs from the TV, it is not going to get ripped off the wall.  That said, if you are not \"handy\" with these kind of things you might find the hanging instructions to be inadequate.  The install hardware does allow for fine tune leveling but if you hung the mount level in the first place, you won't need to use this.That said, the mount works great.  It is easy to articulate, forward, back as well as about 30 degrees left or right.  There is also the ability to tilt the screen a few degrees forward.  This can really help with minimizing reflection on the screen.Mounting issues aside, this is a great mount for the money...you should have no issues.PS - I am going to make the wires disappear after I mount the cabinet below the TV.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722384000000}

{"reviewTitle":"seems sturdy, a couple minor gripes","reviewDescription":"It seems like it's pretty heavy duty and the instructions were easy to follow. This was my first ever attempt at mounting a TV to the wall. I was trying to hang a 65\" U8K by myself but wasn't sure why it wasn't connecting with the mount. I had a friend come help me and noticed the mount was tilting when trying to hang the TV. The tilt adjustment was totally loose, and nothing was mentioned in the manual about this. If I had known I had to tigthen\/check the tightness of these screws before-hand that would have helped.Once I tightened those screws it was possible to actually hang the TV on the mount.The TV has a slight downward tilt, despite manual saying it should be parallel to the wall. I've adjusted the tilt as much as I can, but it still has some downward tilt. I think it may be because of the spacers.The manual for the U8K says to \"use spacers\", but doesn't specify how much spacing is required\/suggested. It does however state that the screw length should be 9.5 mm - 11 mm. So based on this information I was trying to choose the combination of spacers and screws (plus the washer) that would get me there. The proper screws per the U8K manual are M6, so I didn't bother even looking at the other screws available with the mount. The closest possible arrangement for the 65\" U8K in terms of spacers, screws and the washers is one of the 10 mm spacers and two of the 2.5 mm spacers, plus the washer and 35 mm M6 screw. This gets the numbers down to 13mm (excluding however thick the washer and bracket add). I'm not sure that much space is really needed, now that I see it on the wall. The TV has a little subwoofer on the back but there's now plenty of room for ventilation AND clearing the bump.Finally, while the hardware was fine, the allen wrench was Chinese garbage.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699747200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Won\u2019t fit most studs\/walls + shipped used product","reviewDescription":"First off if you own a typical American home with 16\u201d spacing between studs this product most likely is not possible\/feasible to mount on your walls. Longer explanation below At the holes widest points they are exactly 16\u201d apart, However this leaves you no wiggle room whatsoever, to the point that you need to precisely consider the width of the screw when drilling the hole because again at its WIDEST point it\u2019s 16\u201d meaning if you account for the width of the screw you have closer to 15.5\u201d of space between the holes. Most walls are not constructed so that the studs are placed at exactly 16\u201d, there is a good chance you will have some studs that are spaced wider than 16\u201d apart. If the spot you want to mount this in is like this, you will have to find a different spot and search around your house for studs that are lucky enough to be spaced just right for this product. Seriously, what were they thinking?? It\u2019s clearly a design flaw.Second, this product was clearly used and returned before it was sent to me. Some of the parts were modified in such a way that if you had certain sized screw holes you would have a difficult time. The labeled bags were just left open so the parts could shake around the box, meaning I had to go through the process of figuring out which part corresponds to each letter\/number. Also the mount itself was scratched up. I paid for a new product not a used one. Why was I shipped this?TLDR, if you want a used product with obvious design flaws that you can\u2019t actually mount your tv with, then go ahead and waste your money like I did","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1644451200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very narrow, definitely measure stud distances before you buy","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve installed plenty of wall mounts, and I\u2019ve never seen one so narrow. MEASURE your stud width in the spot you want to hang it before you buy.Typically, the 16\u201d specification on a wall mount means that the center-to-center distance in the outside slots is 16\u201d. This is to allow some wiggle room for slight variations in stud-to-stud distance, and so you don\u2019t have to be so dead on with placing the lag bolts. As you can see from my crude drawing, this mount measures 16\u201d from the EDGES of the slots, leaving no wiggle room at all. Everything has to be dead on. So even if you think your studs are 16\u201d apart, it still can be tough to install this mount.That being said, the range of motion is pretty good and sits pretty flush against the wall for being a swing arm style. It doesn\u2019t hold tilt position too well and is a little too easy to knock the roll position off.(Note: Search online for tips on how to find studs from outlets, it\u2019s the first thing I do before trying a stud finder, which I use as a confirmation tool more than an initial finder - it\u2019s thrown false positives).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1596585600000}

But mounting on a standard Sheetrock wall w wood studs is an issue because the mount is only 16\u201d wide... so if you want to center it, like over a mantle, it's impossible unless your studs magically are in the correct location. The mount needs to be wider so you can center and still hit studs to the left or right. In my case I centered it over the mantle and was lucky that a stud to the left was in range, but on the right I had to add anchors to the Sheetrock, which according to the manufacturer you\u2019re not supposed to do. Luckily my 40\u201d HD LED TV, is not too heavy so hopefully no issues. Also no included instructions and crappy online instructions.

{"reviewTitle":"Great full motion TV mount.","reviewDescription":"This is a great little TV mount.  Installation was simple, and the ability to move the TV is really nice.  My new TCL 55P607 looks great on the wall with this mount.  It feels very sturdy, and has ample positions including vertical tilt (which is great if your installation wasn't 100% level).  Movement is smooth and easy, and it holds position very well.  The instructions are some of the best I've seen with a wall mount.The included template with stick on level is more trouble than it's worth.  You need to \"level\" the level to the template to make it actually usable, and it's just easier to hold the mount up the wall with a level sitting on top.  You get a much more accurate placement like that.  While it comes with a full set of bolts and spacers, I found the spacers necessary for my specific installation weren't going to fit well so I had to go out and purchase 4 additional M6 bolts. I could have made due with the included hardware, but this gave me a more professional installation.  Also it goes a lot smoother with 2 people, although I was able to do the entire installation myself.While the included \"freebies\" are nice, a plastic level, Velcro straps, and an HDMI cable, but I would have rather they kept those out and lowered the price.  The level is very small and made of cheap plastic, but I guess I could give it to someone who doesn't already own a level.  The HDMI cable while of decent quality was too short for my installation, but 6' should be long enough for many applications.This being a full motion mount, it does stick out quite a bit from the wall.  If you need something tight against the wall, a full motion mount is not the way to go.Overall I would say this is a great TV mount for the price. I would highly recommend it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1504828800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Mostly OK with a heavier flat screen...","reviewDescription":"This is the second of these mounts I have purchased and installed.  In addition to these two I have mounted three other televisions on walls.  The latest install with this mount was with a Sony BRAVIA W-Series KDL-52W4100 which according to the purchase info here on Amazon weighs 71 lbs.  This mount is rated for TVs up to 99 lbs so one the surface it seems to be within spec.  I would rate this 5 stars except that the tilting aspect is clearly not strong enough for TVs over I would guess 50 lbs.  I originally had the tilt at just a few (~5) degrees from level.  I took extra time making sure the screws were very tight to avoid it slipping to its maximum.  However, even with that extra precaution the tilt screws were not strong enough and the TV over time tilted to the end of the travel (full 15 degrees down).  To prevent this from happening again I removed the TV, placed bolts in the slots behind the integrated tilt screws to fill the slots and prevent further travel.  This seemed to work fine to secure it.  Also, the TV mounting screws supplied for my bolt size (M6) were either too short or too long.  I had bolts that were in between the supplied lengths on hand from another TV mount that were a better length when used with the supplied stand off plastic spacers and washers.  The 5 mm shorter length was critical to get maximum threads in the mounting holes.  In general with these mounts expect to play around with spacers or shop for other bolt lengths or additional washers.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1510012800000}

The mount is sturdy, is easy to use, and does not sag. The assortment of bolts for the TV mount are acceptable, though not the best I have seen. You may need to alter spacers for them to work.Now, the cons: The mount is about 18 inches wide. I can't say enough, but this makes it very difficult if your studs aren't exactly where they need to be. This could be remedied if the bracket that attaches to the TV mounts was a bit wider to provide some side to side movement, but in my TV's case, I have exactly 3\/4 of an inch of movement left and right. My old mount allowed for the TV to slide up to 6 inches either way and was in no way visible behind the TV.

Those 2 screws are not a very large diameter and look like if you pull too much from the bottom of the tv to move it around, those screws could break pretty easily. Then the tv can be easily unhooked from the top of the bracket and fall. I used it for a 55\" curved screen that weighs about 45 lbs. If you're using this for a smaller tv, or if you just hang your tv and don't move it all the time and don't have kids messing with it, it will be fine. If you do move your tv position frequently, just don't grab the bottom of the tv.

Only hang up is the bolts which control the points of articulation are controlled by a hex key, but some type of finger operation (like wing nuts perhaps) would have made it a five star.

Because of this, when you mark a stud, you may be off center by almost an inch, worst case, so you need a bit of wiggle room , which is why there are slots and not holes. After very carefully marking my stud centers, the template slots were just barely lined up with the stud centers, with absolutely no wiggle room if my center was slightly off.

I used two toggle bolts that could each hold up to 50 lbs. I used two lug bolts (Included) into the stud (Top and Bottom of the left side of mount) and then I did two toggle bolts (1\/8\u201dx4\u201d) on the right side top and bottom. It is very sturdy even not being into 2 studs. My only complaint with the stand is the plate the TV mounts onto is just wide enough to hook the TV on. They could definitely make this plate longer so that you could slide your TV left or right to help center, but with my TV 49\" it didn't have any room for adjustment. Overall, I would recommend this stand, if it works with your mounting situation. I would recommend finding at least 1 stud, but I don't think having 2 is an absolute must, with the right equipment you can make 1 stud work just as well. With some heavier duty toggle bolts (I saw some that went up to 100 lbs) you could probably mount this only by toggle bolts, but that would make me a little nervous. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now with no issues. See my pictures for added clarification.Pros:-Sturdy Construction-Telescoping mount-Swivels Left and right-Angles down-Ample Mounting of Supporting Materials (Comes with a replica mounting sheet that you can test on your wall before drilling any holes, as well as bubble level for both the paper [stick on] and for the mount)Cons:-Mounting Plate not large enough to adjust left or right for small centering adjustments (My Tv was at the Max mounting hole width at 16\u201d, if your tv mount holes are closer together than 16\u201d than this might not be a problem, or if your studs are in the right spots to perfectly center, then it also won't be a problem.)-Takes some effort to pull TV out and Push in, there are no springs to help offset tension (Not a huge problem, but worth notating.)-Angling up or down requires loosening and tightening screws in the back (Also not a huge deal, adjust it where you want it one time and then just leave it.)-Recommend having 2 people (I know some can do this by themselves, but it is easier and safer with two, this would probably be the case for most any mounting stand though.)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1509148800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Quick easy install with included parts","reviewDescription":"This wall mount came with a nice piece of stock paper to drill pilot holes.  It also came with a small level that could stick to the stock paper and the stock paper had a couple self adhesive strips to stick to the wall.I marked the spots on my wall where the studs were and applied the stock paper to the wall.  Double checked the alignment with the studs and used the level on the paper to make it level and drilled the holes.Then I used my impact driver to screw in the mounting bracket.  Double checked the alignment with the included small magnetic level and it was good.The screws that were included for mounting the tv brackets to my tv (an old 42\" plasma) fit just fine.  I was able to put the tv on the wall mount with only one small issue.  The backplate where the tv brackets hook on hits the power plug on my tv.  I took off one star for that, but it would really be just half a star if I could.  I also think it's an issue with Panasonic, at the time, using very large plugs on the back of their tvs.  I could move the tv higher and alleviate the plug from hitting the bracket but then I would be able to see the tv brackets at the bottom of the tv.I usually buy tv wall mounts from another site, but thought I'd give this one a shot because shipping should be faster and I'm glad I did (not because of the shipping).  This is a nice wall mount and I'd definitely put Mounting Dream as something to consider if I needed another tv wall mount.On a side note - Amazon failed to deliver the wall mount by the guaranteed delivery date and could care less when I contacted them to tell them it was passed the delivery date.  Amazon shouldn't put guaranteed delivery dates on their site if they don't stand by it.

{"reviewTitle":"From a mechanics experience,  EXCELLENT product.","reviewDescription":"I have vast experience in residential maintenance field. Dealt with numerous types of walls. This product covers all types of wall material. The installation instructions are  easy to understand using easy verbiage and images. Packed in the product box is plastic marked bags containing all types of screws and hardware to attach this bracket.  However there is one drawback as in my case. The center of my desired placement of the TV falls on a stud. My studs are 16\" on center. Meaning the center of the bracket is screwed in the center stud. Leaving the ends of the bracket to be in between the next adjoining studs. In this case I purchased \"toggle straps\" to insert into the wall for the ends of the bracket. These wall anchors hold up to 70 Lbs. each. My TV weighs 30 lbs. The center of the bracket was screwed to the center stud using the lag bolts that are supplied. I paid under $10.00 for the toggle straps. Upon completion of the bracket placement I performed the recommended test to check for a secure install, using a 50 lb. weight..  It held up great. No worries. With the 2 other bracket attached to the back of the TV it was a matter of just hanging the TV onto the wall bracket. Then tightening 2 screws to secure the TV back brackets. With the TV fully extended it is a breeze adjusting the tilt and swivel of the TV. The swivel is adjustable without loosening screws, but the tilt must be secured with tightening four screws.  Reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that the entire length of the wall bracket is 17\". Not enough to reach the left and right studs when one stud is in the center of the placement. I'm assuming that the length of the bracket is so that a smaller TV can be mounted without the bracket exposed. A suggestion to the manufacture. Make longer brackets or supply metal extensions, to reach the next wall studs, that can be attached to the wall bracket.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1565136000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Damn near perfect.","reviewDescription":"I finally caved and got rid of my 36\" Toshiba tube TV from our bedroom and replaced it with a 55 Samsung LED.  The old TV was sitting in an armoire which it was the perfect fit.  The 55 was going on the wall and I needed to mount it.  I decided against mounting it flush so we could point it to anywhere in the room.I did little research before I purchased this mount based on its ability to tilt and swivel along with a good price.  Installation is easy even for a marginal DIY'er and its heavy metal frame will support at least 200 lbs when lagged into studs.  I know because that's what I weigh and I hung on it before hanging the TV.When unpacking, the only assembly of the mount you have to do is to attach the TV rails to the frame but that's after you mount the TV to he rails.  The hardware comes neatly sorted in pouches with an assortment of spacers and screws of different lengths to mount just about any TV.  It takes a bit of sorting to find the combination you need for any particular model but not all model TVs will work with the spacers and screw lengths.  My Samsung didn't and I had to cut two of the screws by about a 1\/4 inch to make them work.The only reason I didn't give a 5star is because of the spacers and screws having a large difference in length between the screws provided  While the shortest to the middle length screws and spacers length was only about 1\/4 inch, the difference in length between the middle screw length and the longest was about 1 1\/4' inches.  Another length dropped in between would probably make fitting every TV possible.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1578614400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Works great on a 55 inch","reviewDescription":"We recently decided to mount our TV in the living room after rearranging our furniture. This is the second mount we purchased, as we were very satisfied with the first one we installed in the master bedroom. Here's a comprehensive review of our experience:Installation Process:- Ease of Installation: The installation process was straightforward, especially the second time around. The mount came with all the necessary hardware, making it easy to get started right away.- Helpful Tools: The included paper outline was particularly useful for marking the placement of the holes. However, we wished it came with a tack for easier positioning on the wall without using tape. This would have made it simpler to use the provided leveler to ensure the holes were perfectly aligned for drilling.- Hardware: There were ample screws and washers included for securing the mount to the rear of the TV, ensuring a secure fit.Product Features:- Articulation: The mount offers excellent articulation, allowing for in, out, and side-to-side adjustments. This flexibility is perfect for our needs, ensuring we can achieve the optimal viewing angle.- Tilt Angle: The tilt angle is also impressive, offering a good degree of motion for adjusting the TV's angle to reduce glare and improve viewing comfort.- Cable Management:** The one area where the product could improve is cable management. It would be beneficial if the mount included some mechanism to organize and conceal cables behind the TV.Overall Satisfaction:Overall, this TV mount is a great product. Its ease of installation, combined with its excellent articulation and tilt features, makes it ideal for our setup. With the addition of a cable management solution, it would be nearly perfect. We highly recommend it for anyone looking to mount their TV securely and conveniently.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1720310400000}

It\u2019s 53 inches and 69 or 79 lbs, can\u2019t recall exactly. The mount seems to support it sufficiently. The instructions for installing this wall mount were easy to follow, and it came with various bolts and things to adapt to my specific needs. The only downside is that my studs are off center from how the tv has to be positioned. I can move it sideways to center it only as long as it\u2019s outstretched a ways from the wall, but if I push it back flush against the wall, it has to be off center.  The tv is on a narrow wall next to a doorway, so having the tv extended about a foot from the wall is unsightly as you walk through the door. If I had realized that beforehand, I\u2019d have bought a different model that lets it be flat against the wall but moves horizontally to center it. I\u2019m still giving this five stars though, because it\u2019s a great wall mount and works as advertised.

I think I was a initially a little more salty than I should have been. Most walls should have 16\u201d studs, so this should work well for most. I also realized that even if the wall mount plate has limited horizontal flexibility, the TV arms and TV can be placed anywhere on the wall mount plate. However, I do think still it\u2019s nice to have some flexibility on where to mount the wall plate, especially if you don\u2019t have exactly 16\u201d stud spacing or need to work around outlets. I ultimately went with mounting dreams similar \u201cAdvanced\u201d wall mount that fits up to 24\u201d studs (MD2104) and I like it a lot.Original review:Looks like a solid mount, but only accepts stud distances up to 16\u201d, and falls short of my 18\u201d studs. Every other mount I have seen has a wider plate, but my bad for not checking the description too carefully.This also means that event if you have 16\u201d studs, you will have exactly one horizontal location you can install the mount with no available left\/right adjustment.When I asked the seller about this, they proposed mounting additional horizontal 2x4s on my wall or buying an additional $40 24\u201d adjustment plate.So the choices the seller gave me are to make it look ugly or to spend $80 on a $40 mount.The other choice is to return it, I\u2019m doing that one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694390400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Premium Articulating TV Wall Mount at Discount Rack Price - Buy with Confidence","reviewDescription":"At this price point, my expectations were fairly low for the Mounting Dream MD2380 articulating TV wall mount bracket. Much to my surprise, this wall bracket is a robust, well engineered, quality piece that is on par with similar TV wall mounting brackets costing 3 or 4 times as much. The instructions are simple and clear, and the whole installation process is very straight forward. MD even includes a bonus bubble level, a braided 6' HDMI cord, and enough machine screws and spacers to fit the TV mounting brackets to practically any TV on the market. It took me a little over 20 minutes from opening the package to having my 55\" 4K TV securely mounted to the wall.The unit is designed to allow you to adjust your TV to sit flat against the wall (with an approx. 3\" space) or pull it over two feet from the wall for angling. When extended, the TV can be angled left or right up to 35 degrees and you can also adjust the vertical picture angle from +5 degrees to -15 degrees. An added bonus is the articulation makes it MUCH easier to add components to your TV at a later time. Flat wall mounts require you to remove the entire TV to access the back panels. The unit feels very sturdy and can be moved with a nominal amount of effort. The packaging says this wall mount is rated to hold up to 100 lbs., but when mounted properly, my guess is it could handle at least twice that weight with ease.I highly recommend this product and I am writing this review because I came back here to order two more for our other flat panel TVs. If you are going to buy this wall mount, and trust me, you won't regret it, read on for a brief primer on how to install it.Installation experience: Before opening the box, you will need a cordless drill\/driver, a 3\/8\" drill bit, a measuring tape, pencil, a ratchet with a 12mm socket, a #4 phillip's head screw bit and a stud finder. The instructions say you can mount this bracket to sheet rock studs or cinder block, but not to straight sheet rock. Makes sense as even with sheet rock anchors, the bracket will eventually pull from the wall if the articulation function is used as intended. The first step is to locate what wall you want to mount the TV to and then use your stud finder to locate the studs that you will be anchoring the bracket to. I found that the easiest way to get a nice level mounting was to use the mounting template with the included bubble level. Once level, simply tape the template in place and then drill the four mounting stud holes right through the template. After removing the template, place the wall bracket against the wall, line up with one of the upper holes you just drilled and use your ratchet and socket to drive the first bolt in until it is almost tight. Leave some play so that you can align the other three bolts and do the same with each. When all four bolts are in place, go back and finish tightening them securely. Attaching the TV brackets is really easy with the plethora of machine screws and spacers included with the kit. Once the TV brackets are attached to the back of the TV, find an assistant (depending upon the weight of the TV - this will be a two person job) and place the TV on the wall bracket. You will here it click in place. There are two included screws at the bottom of the TV brackets which are used to lock the TV to the wall bracket. Make sure these are tightened so you can safely use the articulating feature. Plug in your cables, fire up the TV and Voila! You can now sit back and enjoy your TV from practically anywhere in the room with a perfect picture angle.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1499212800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very well designed, sturdy mounts for just about any TV!","reviewDescription":"I've been purchasing Mounting Dream mounts for several years. Started buying them for home use and was so impressed I also began purchasing them for work.  Eight years later, and I am still purchasing them and recommending them to friends, family and coworkers.  Dozens of mounts later, and I am very happy with every single one I've purchased and installed.They have so many options, they're one of the best out there. Whether you need a flat-mount, arm\/articulated mount with short or long arms, light duty or heavy duty, they will likely have a mount for you.  I absolutely love their dual arm articulated mounts, as you can not just extend the TV away from the wall and back, but you can shift it left, right, or center, and bring it back against the wall on either of the three positions.  And if you mount these against wall studs or on concrete walls, the mounts will be sturdy and you will not worry about moving your TV when needed.You get all you need to mount these to most TVs out there, and that includes wall mounting bolts and screws for the TV. Make sure you confirm the type of mounting your TV needs (look in the manual or the back of the TV) so you know what you need. These mounts are very flexible when it comes to providing a variety of standard VESA screws, washers and extenders, but some TVs are not exactly mount friendly. Measure the distance between the holes and confirm the mount will support them. Like I said, most should, but you never know.Don't toss the extra screws and washers!  You might need these in the future should you replace your TV. These mounts are so good, I'd guarantee that you will use them with several TVs as long as the stand can support them.Packaging is excellent. Box is sturdy and componets are well packaged so as not to move and bang around in transit. Screws, washers and extenders are all bagged according to type and size in clear packaging, so you can select the ones you need easily.Lastly, it's a small detail, but it's a nice one - you get a free level. Although I have several \"pro-grade\" levels, I like to use these as they're smaller and can balance them on the arms as a second level. Plus - who doesn't need extra levels once in a while!?In short - Excellent mounts, excellent brand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703808000000}

{"reviewTitle":"ZERO wiggle room for 16\" studs, poor bolt location for mounting","reviewDescription":"Once it's on the wall, this is a pretty nice TV mount.  It holds my 55\" Vizio just fine and the range is good so I can access the cords and things behind\/under the TV more easily.  But, getting it on the wall is a BEAR (at least alone, but that's never stopped me before).First, if you have 16\" studs, you have to get this thing dead center because there is barely 16\" between the leftmost edge of the furthest left mounting hole and the rightmost edge of the furthest right mounting hole.  I don't know why they wouldn't extend the frame just another half inch so you can be sure to be centered on the studs.  The same goes if your TV mounting bolts are 400mm wide, you'll have about a half inch of play on either side of the mounting bracket to get the TV locked in.  I had to have a neighbor come help me because I couldn't hold the TV and see behind it at the same time to get it just right.  I successfully mounted another 55\" TV on a non-full-motion Mounting Dream mount (ASIN B00NKZ5R28) and there was a ton of room for adjustment.Second, good luck using any kind of socket wrench to screw in the lag bolts.  The geniuses put the mounting holes so close to the rest of the frame that I couldn't even get the tip of a normal wrench around it and had to do half turns at a time.  It looks like there's a lot more room in the pictures.  It took me about 5x longer just to screw in the lag bolts for this one than the entire mounting process for the other kind.  That one has the mounting holes inside the frame, so it was easy to use a ratcheting socket and power them right in.Third, which I probably should have realized from the pictures, I'm HIGHLY disappointed that this mount requires unscrewing and screwing in small screws to release and secure the TV, instead of the super-quick and handy pull straps on the first mount I bought.  Mounting Dream, why isn't that standard on all your products???In retrospect, I'll probably be buying a different brand if I ever need another full-motion mount.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657497600000}

{"reviewTitle":"I'd give this 5 stars, had it leveled my TV properly.","reviewDescription":"OK, so I'd give this 5 stars, had it leveled my TV properly.Pros:*  This thing is Rock Solid!*  Install is very clear, and easy - once you find the studs.*  They give you a template, so you can mark your drill holes with paper, instead of a heavy mounting bracket.*  All the stuff you need is included - and several options for different TVs is in there, as well.*  It allows for adjustments to the TV from side to side, once mounted (though it affects the distance from the wall)*  It allows for adjustments to the TV tilt angle, so you can aim it towards the floor more, if you mount it high.*  It allows easy access to the back of the TV, once mounted, & easily turns the TV direction left or right.*  It accommodates a number of TV sizes and weights, so it's likely to fit yours.Cons:*  This mount MUST be set into studs on BOTH sides (Just it's own weight would pull it off the wall, otherwise - never mind the added TV weight)*  Adjustments to the TV from side to side, once mounted - affects the distance from the wall - big time. My studs are not centered to the center of the wall, so I was offset by about 8\", once mounted. I slid my TV as far towards the center as it could go on their wide mounting bracket, but still had to push the mounting arms to the left by several inches. That forces the TV out from the wall by several inches to get it centered.*  The TV is secured by screws on the bottom, which is good, but there's very little clearance for them, and we nearly stripped one, trying to get it screwed in properly.*  There's no leveling option for the TV mount, once installed. I did mine PERFECTLY, and it is dead level on the wall mount. Unfortunately, once the TV was mounted, it sat crooked - which means the mount arms were not level, even though the mount was level at the wall. THAT is unfortunate, because there's no way in hell to fudge the mount against the wall. You have to bore out huge holes into the studs, just to hold it on the wall, so adjusting it a quarter inch isn't going to happen, and there's no way to know if the arms are level to the mount, until it's too late to fix it.I ended up shimming the top part of the TV bracket, to hold it up higher than it should be. It's not perfect, because I didn't have the perfect metal shim sitting around the house (I stacked 3), so I'm still a tiny bit off level, but it's barely noticeable.For my install, I'm putting it into a bookcase surround, that extends beyond the wall by 11 inches, so the fact that my TV protrudes 8 inches from the wall is not a big deal. I also really like the fact that I can turn the TV to the right or left, and pull it out from the wall to gain access to the back of it.If that protruding thing is an issue for you, then you might want to be sure your studs are centered to where you want to mount the TV. (ie, 8\" on either side of where you want the center of the TV to end up, gets you the least protrusion).Overall, I'm very happy with this mount, but the fact that they thought of everything but leveling the actual TV is kinda nutty. It presumes perfection on their manufacturing & assembly, the TV's manufacturing & screw placement, and the homeowner's installation skills. That's a lot of perfection to count on.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1511049600000}

I finally conquered my fear, and said I could do this by myself.  The mount was very easy to install.  As a 60 year old woman, it took a little bit of extra elbow grease to get the lag bolt into the studs.  One drill hole were made, I held the mount on the wall, hand thread the bolts and then started ratcheting each one in a bit at a time rechecking that the mount remained level and tightened them all down.  The hardest part was getting the stud finder I purchased from a big box store out of the packaging it came in and the cover off to insert batteries.All parts\/bags are labeled.  All necessary parts you may need are in the packaging.  Instructions are clear and easy to ready.  I would recommend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714176000000}

Instead of having to go back out to a store and paying for ADDITIONAL HARDWARE to complete the job. While $1.10 isn't a lot I quite frankly feel like I shouldn't have had to do that when I purchased a kit.Now as you can see by the photo of the step 1 they include plenty of screws to find the correct fit for your tv; M4, M6, & M8. As you can also see in the photo they ONLY include washers for the M4 & M6 tv screws. Meaning if your tv takes the M8 screw then you are going to need to go to the hardware store to buy washers that fit. Because the ONLY M8 washers included are the 4 for the bolts to install the mount on the wall. So take one of those with you to make sure you get the right washers.Other than the fact that the Kit should INCLUDE ALL THE HARDWARE in it, everything else is working perfectly. Once we had ALL THE PARTS WE NEEDED it went up fast and easily. The instructions are easy to read and follow, so no issues there.I am looking forward to using the wall mount, but as someone who was frustrated by this I wanted to make sure others wouldn't have the same issue.

Not a big deal because I have plenty of them, but it made the first install quicker than this one.2. The Template! This one angered me since I have to backfill holes and paint now. The template used to mark where to drill was too large. When placing the mount on the template, it appears this was a template made for larger tv's!

The one I purchased works best with stud lengths 12 or 16 inches apart (I think a 24\" was available). Instead of returning it for an exchange - and because my TV is very light - I decided to keep it and secure at least two of the mounting bolts into a stud with another four into heavy-duty drywall anchors. It seems secure, but since the mounting apparatus itself is quite heavy, I would advise measuring between studs to make sure that four bolts screw tightly into studs, especially for larger, heavier TVs.
