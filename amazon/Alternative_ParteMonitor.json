So far the only minor issue for me is the power button being in the back rather than a button under the bezel. I have a custom made desktop 36\" in depth and I don't like the screens to be too close so they're positioned more towards the back of the desk. This makes reaching the power button a little cumbersome cause in order to reach it you need to be able to get far enough to reach your hand behind it. So depending on ones particular set up and length of their arms it may be something that needs to be considered.

{"reviewTitle":"A Gem in the Workspace - Sceptre 24-inch Professional Thin 1080p LED Monitor Review","reviewDescription":"Overview:The Sceptre 24-inch Professional Thin 1080p LED Monitor has seamlessly integrated itself into my workspace, offering a host of features that enhance my daily computing experience. While not without a minor quirk, it's proven to be a valuable addition to my setup, specially considering it's affordable price.Packaging and Accessories:The unboxing experience was a pleasant surprise. The packaging was not only secure but also included a genuinely useful screwdriver. Unlike other products, every item promised was present, making the setup process smooth and hassle-free.Built-in Speakers:Admittedly, the built-in speakers fell short of expectations. I quickly switched to my computer speakers for better audio quality. While not a deal-breaker, audiophiles might find this aspect lacking. Thankfully, the visual experience compensates for this minor setback.Display Quality:As a secondary screen for my MacBook Air, the Sceptre monitor holds its own. The display quality is commendable, delivering crisp visuals that are not as high-quality as the MacBook, but is a fairly good companion to it, specially if you don't really need extremely high-quality graphics. There's a brief delay upon waking the computer, but once in use, the monitor performs flawlessly.Reflection and Workspace Dynamics:Working next to a window, I appreciate the minimal reflection on the screen. This monitor handles ambient light admirably, allowing me to focus on tasks without distraction. It's a testament to its thoughtful design, especially for those in well-lit environments.User-Friendly Controls:Navigating the controls on the back of the monitor is a breeze. The intuitive layout ensures quick adjustments without any learning curve. This user-friendly aspect adds to the overall positive experience with the device.Final Thoughts:The Sceptre 24-inch Professional Thin 1080p LED Monitor is a reliable companion in my daily workflow as a developer. Despite a hiccup with the built-in speakers, the exceptional packaging, display quality, affordable price, and user-friendly controls make it a worthwhile investment. If you're seeking a sleek and efficient secondary monitor that enhances your workspace, this Sceptre model is certainly worth considering.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701907200000}

{"reviewTitle":"A Budget Monitor that Mostly Works OK - Not Recommended","reviewDescription":"I have had this monitor for only a few days, and I am not very impressed with it.  The monitor control buttons being in the back where you have to blindly feel for them and just remember which one is which is a terrible design.  All of my other monitors have the buttons under the front edge where they are so much easier to use.  Having two HDMI inputs is nice, but the actual steps to switch between inputs are cumbersome, and the speed to switch screens is slow.  Not a big deal for the occasional change, but if you want to switch between inputs frequently while sitting at your desk, this is not a good monitor.The worst thing MAY be the speakers  - they are absolute garbage in both sound quality and volume (but see the last paragraph about the screen flashing on and off).  Turning up the volume in system settings on the monitor does absolutely nothing to increase the sound at any setting above 50%.  What you can hear sounds like a 20-year old laptop sitting on the floor of a school bathroom - tiny, echo-y, and very hard to understand.  I have several other monitors with built-in speakers, and these are by far the worst I have every heard.  The other monitor sitting next to this one sounds absolutely fantastic by comparison.  I have good speakers on my desk, but I was hoping to get rid of them to save some space - no way with this monitor!The picture quality seems decent - sitting side-by-side with a much older HP monitor of the same size and definition, both displays seem similar in brightness and color accuracy on an average browser window, but when comparing a screen with lots of high-contrast dark and light, this monitor is very washed out.  I have tried adjusting picture and color settings, and nothing improves the lack of a good black and poor contrast.  In fact, increasing the contrast setting just makes the blacks even MORE gray!But I am quite worried about the reliability.I set this up yesterday and left it on with the laptop in sleep mode all night - I didn't make any setting adjustments.  This morning the laptop woke fine and the monitor came on as expected, but as soon as I reached around the side of the monitor to find the control buttons, the monitor started flashing on and off, like a light with a loose or broken wire.  When I pulled my hand back, it was fine, but I could not touch the monitor at all without it flashing on and off.  The power light was not going on and off, so it was not that, and I tried changing the input to both HDMI ports with no difference.  Once I opened up the OSD, the flashing stopped as long as the OSD was up, but started again when I hit the Exit button.  After about 15 minutes of playing with the settings, I noticed that the monitor was no longer showing the problems when I touched it.  And it seems to still be working normally about an hour later.  But I am extremely worried about what was causing this issue, and how long it will be before it starts again.  If I wiggle the HDMI cable on the back of the monitor, it sometimes blanks out (but no where near as touchy  as it was in the beginning), so I guess the fault is there and I will have to return the unit.

{"reviewTitle":"Budget 27\" Monitor - Would be great if not for quality control issues","reviewDescription":"This monitor is hard to love due to some glaring issues with its quality control. That being said, it's a budget conscious monitor that has a MSRP of $129.99 so you have to be realistic with your expectations. I'll go through my experience for you from start to finish.The Pros - It is 75hz refresh rate capable. 5ms response time for those who need it. It's light weight and very thin. (Great for mounting) It has 2 HDMI connectors. The version that I got uses a 12V DC port (Useful for cable management). Built in speakers a plus if you have limited space to work with. (Like using the monitor at a work station \/ terminal)The Cons - Out of 2 ordered, 1 had a dead pixel. The speakers are not only muffled, but extremely quiet. Stand is extremely light weight for a 27 inch monitor. 12V 3A AC\/DC adapter looks really suspect (like the ones you get with LED strips) and probably will fail over time. VESA specs are incorrect in the manual. (They recommend M4 12mm screws). 1 year only warranty that requires you to send it back to them on your dime for service.My biggest gripe so far (dead pixel or not) is that the VESA mounting holes on the rear of the monitor are extremely shallow. I needed to special order a set of M4 8mm screws in order to get it to attach to one of my dual monitor brackets. VESA standards list 100 x 100 hole patterns to use a standard M4 10mm screw. My 8mm screws that I ordered barely fit into my bracket with a washer. I would assume the holes drilled in the monitor for the screws are 4mm or 5mm deep at best. The manual recommends using 12mm M4 screws! That would leave about 8mm or 7mm jutting out in the air. Most VESA mounting hardware will only include 10mm, 12mm and 25mm M4 screws for 100 x 100 hole patterns. So in case you want to mount this monitor to any bracket, make sure to have some shorter M4 screw sizes ready.Negatives aside, it's an extremely attractive monitor for the home office or the kids (teenager or college bound). You can forgive a lot of the imperfections if this is going to be attached to something you don't stare at constantly. Probably also good for grass roots e-sports tournament organizers who need a larger screen real estate but don't want to break the bank and aren't too worried about ultra quality. 5ms response time and 75hz refresh rate is good for most games except ultra competitive FPS.This is going to be a dynamic review in that I will update my experience as I own the monitor longer. I have a replacement coming from Amazon for the dead pixel afflicted one I got initially and we'll see how that goes. Sceptre's policy on dead pixels is that they need \"5 or more\" to be considered defective enough for warranty service. Worst yet, you have to ship the item back to them at your expense. So I highly recommend while you're in the Amazon 30 day return window to put the monitor through its paces and see if it's the right one for you without any major problems. Once it's out of that window, you'll be at the mercy of Sceptre's RMA department and will probably need to pay $22 bucks (or more) to send it back to fix a $129.99 (or less) monitor.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1581552000000}

{"reviewTitle":"A Decent Option with Disappointing Sound and Design","reviewDescription":"First of all, let me just say that this monitor is so thin, I'm pretty sure I could snap it in half with my bare hands if I wanted to. But don't worry, I won't do that (yet).The good news is that the picture quality is pretty decent. I mean, it's not like I'm watching a movie on a 4K TV or anything, but for the price, I guess I can't complain too much. The 75Hz refresh rate is also nice, although it's not like I'm playing any games that require lightning-fast reflexes or anything. I'm mostly just using this monitor to watch cat videos on YouTube.Now, onto the bad news. First of all, the built-in speakers are a joke. They sound like they're coming from a tin can that's been kicked around by a bunch of angry toddlers. I mean, I wasn't expecting Bose-quality sound or anything, but come on, Sceptre, you can do better than this.And speaking of sound, let's talk about the noise this thing makes. Every time I turn it on, it emits a high-pitched whine that sounds like a thousand tiny mosquitoes buzzing around my head. I've tried everything to make it stop, but no matter what I do, it just won't go away. So now, every time I want to use my monitor, I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones just to avoid going insane.Finally, let's talk about the design. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be \"professional\" and all, but come on, Sceptre, you can do better than this bland machine black color. Why not make it hot pink or neon green or something? At least then it would be a conversation starter.Overall, I'm giving this monitor two out of five stars. It's not the worst thing I've ever bought, but it's definitely not the best either. If you're looking for a cheap monitor that won't make your ears bleed, this might be a decent option. Just be prepared to wear earplugs and invest in some bright-colored paint.The best monitor parameters depend on your specific needs and preferences. However, here are some common parameters to consider when choosing a monitor:1. Screen size: The size of the monitor determines how much screen real estate you have to work with. Consider how much desk space you have and how much screen size you need to comfortably work.2. Resolution: The resolution of the monitor determines how sharp and clear the image is. Higher resolutions like 4K or 1440p offer sharper images, but also require more powerful hardware to run smoothly.3. Refresh rate: The refresh rate of a monitor determines how many times the screen updates per second. Higher refresh rates like 144Hz or 240Hz offer smoother motion and are preferred for gaming and other fast-paced activities.4. Response time: The response time of a monitor determines how quickly the pixels can change from one color to another. Lower response times like 1ms or 2ms are preferred for gaming and other fast-paced activities.5. Panel type: The panel type of a monitor determines the color accuracy, contrast, and viewing angles. There are three main types of panels: IPS, TN, and VA. IPS panels offer the best color accuracy and viewing angles, while TN panels offer the fastest response times. VA panels offer the best contrast.6. Connectivity: The connectivity options of a monitor determine what devices you can connect to it. Common connectivity options include HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C.7. Ergonomics: The ergonomics of a monitor determine how easily you can adjust its position. Consider features like adjustable height, tilt, and swivel to find a comfortable viewing angle.Overall, the best monitor parameters for you will depend on your specific needs and intended use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679875200000}

I work from home, am in college online, and play some PC games. What I used to do (and was hoping to continue doing) was keep my work laptop connected to the two monitors during the work day, then just switch my work laptop with my personal one and continue using them for school\/games.However, ANY kind of disconnection makes it an extreme hassle to get these set back up. I mean any. I disconnected the HDMI cord from my work laptop the first day, and it took 2 hours (of constantly restarting and reconnecting) to get the displays set back up again. I resolved to just use these for work, but I genuinely may have to return them. Even when I just turn off my laptop at night - every morning when I go to turn it all back on at least one of them will not connect (picture is from this morning, just turning my laptop on. This has happened every morning since I\u2019ve gotten these monitors.) and it wouldn\u2019t be as big of a deal if it was just as easy as disconnecting and reconnecting the hdmi cords to reset the displays. But it\u2019s not. I have to restart my computer with the monitors disconnected and powered off, then when my laptop restarts I have to take it off its port and reconnect that, then turn power the monitors on, then connect the hdmi cables. And it takes at least 3-4 times of doing it in that exact order before the monitors finally register that they\u2019re connected and extend my laptop display. That\u2019s an hour every morning just tinkering with a monitor. Which sucks because I spent so much time mounting these things.I\u2019ve never had this issue with any monitors I\u2019ve had in the past. I\u2019m not sure what causes the disruption. I even tried replacing the HDMI cables thinking that may be the cause. But spending an hour each morning restarting my computer to try and get the monitor to register that it is, in fact, connected makes the picture resolution\/other perks null and void in my opinion. If you can keep your main monitor\/computer constantly turned on then maybe these are good monitors for you.

{"reviewTitle":"Not familiar with this brand, but went with them due to reviews and price...no regrets","reviewDescription":"I have two very old, inexpesive 18\" monitors that have lasted a very long time, but one of them started flaking out when hooked up to my hub.  My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account\/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.  Works great for me, but might be a consideration for others, depending on how you plan to mount them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1656892800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great monitor with multiple HDMI-in options, but with lackluster built-in speakers","reviewDescription":"So, as a monitor, this thing is great. It's spacious, lightweight, and comes with a very stable stand. It also has a couple of neat extras, like multiple HDMI inputs and an audio-out jack that lets you run the audio to an external set of speakers. That makes this monitor handy if you have multiple devices hooked up to it (in my case, this has been either my wife and I using our laptops at the same desk, or me having my desktop and a gaming console hooked up at my desk).That audio out connector is also great because this monitor includes an internal set of speakers that were clearly more of an afterthought. Audio from them is mumbly at any volume, partly because the speakers, like with many HDTVs, are not mounted on the front of the monitor, but rather on the back side of the screen.That said, given the size of the monitor, I doubt many folks are using it as a TV set for their living room, and if you do have an external speaker, it's very easy to use the audio port to just pipe the audio that way. If you are using it on your desk, you can easily hook a set of headphones up to it with a long enough audio cable. So I'm not counting any points off for the speakers, just warning other customers about that potential issue.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688860800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great monitor but with a few annoying quirks.","reviewDescription":"A quick word of advice to everyone who buys this monitor:  when you first hook it up to your computer, you will find that the screen (esp text, when scrolling) gets quite blurry and the colors might seem blotchy.  I was thinking that the monitor was defective when I saw it, but, after some homework, figured out that the problem is caused by faulty \"overdrive\" feature (or maybe not faulty?  never actually saw this feature before).  The control for \"Overdrive\" is under \"System\" and it's set to \"medium\" by default.  Turn it off.  Then the problem of blurry screen will go away and after that, the monitor is great.  (While I can't speak to the durability of this particular product, I've had generally excellent experience with Scepter monitors, all of which (I've had 4, including this one) were very durable over 3-4 years that I've used them.  At minimum, they products are worth it, IMHO.*Original review below:The short version is that the monitor is great (it is, fwiw, the most economical FHD monitor available), but some of the features don't seem to be working quite right.  One specific problem that came out right away was that the \"Overdrive\" feature is not working properly:  when you hook it up to your computer, you will find that objects on the monitor get blurry momentarily when you scroll.  After some searching, I found out that this is due to the overdrive feature that's supposed to speed up the response time...except, in this case, it's just making objects blurrier as they move with the mouse scroll.  The overdrive is set to \"medium\" in the factory setting.  You want to turn it off as the first thing you do.  After that, you should be happy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658188800000}

I use this monitor heavily, practically every day, numerous hours of the day (bc I have no life lol), so that should be also factored into this.The one negative thing I can say is that the pixels tend to \"linger?\" a little after I've used it for so long (Kinda hard to explain but basically, if you have a black circle flying across a white background, this circle will be more like a bunch of overlapping circles flying across the background, not sure the cause of it, but it can sometimes make certain games have a slight additional motion blur that is mostly noticeable on high contrasting pictures.) Doesn't make the monitor unusable, but something to take note of, may be worse in another year. Does 75 hrtz, 1080 p no issues with that, sweet spot in terms of size as well for 1080 pWould I recommend it?

They are quite light which is nice.However, two of my three units have dead pixels, and I'm debating returning them all and getting a different brand, since I'm not confident they're being tested adequately before being boxed up, and I don't want to go back and forth ten times to get units without flaws.

{"reviewTitle":"Screen going out after 15 months - do not recommend","reviewDescription":"Initially purchased this as a cheap replacement for my dual monitor setup on my home work station. It\u2019s decent and since I\u2019m a developer, I just needed a display - nothing fancy. I liked the brand due to the brightness and colors so I had purchased another Sceptre 24\u201d, going for the curved version. Since I was going to setup a new computer and desk in my son\u2019s room, I was planning to give this flat panel to him for his PC and I\u2019d purchase another curved monitor to match what I had on my desk. But earlier this month, I had to change those plans and look at alternatives, as this monitor started having issues after 15 months of use (bought in May 2022). I had still planned on buying the curved Sceptre 24\u201d monitor to match my setup and placed an order for that. I also ordered a cheap 24\u201d Philips VA monitor for my kid instead, since I couldn\u2019t give him this monitor that was starting to act funky. This monitor would lose the display periodically while I was actively working on the screen. It became more frustrating when it would increase in frequency, especially during virtual meetings. Most recently, not only would the screen go out on me for a few seconds at a time (multiple times a day) but would start flickering and I\u2019d also have dancing pixels and streams of red, blue, and greens dots in groups along the screen at times. My other external monitor and laptop screen was fine and I knew it wasn\u2019t a graphics card issue.I know sometimes products wear out faster than others and initially wanted to review with 3 stars, but here\u2019s the reason I\u2019ll instead be lowering my rating. Since I was going to replace this monitor anyway, the panel malfunction made my purchasing decision more imminent. So I did order the Sceptre 24\u201d curved monitor to replace this flat panel that was going out so I could get a nicer looking viewing angle for my dual monitor setup. When it was delivered, I tested it out and hooked it up to my workstation. I was only getting a black screen with vertical pixelated lines along the left portion of the panel. I checked my display settings and my laptop was detecting the monitor and I had it in the input source selection. When dragging my mouse over to where the new screen should have extended my display, the mouse cursor disappeared, so I knew it was picking up the display input perfectly fine, it just wasn\u2019t displaying anything on the screen. Bottom line: it was defective out of the box. Packaging was not damaged in any way and my Ring cam showed my delivery driver handle it with care and gently placed it on the ground.  So I\u2019ve gone through two back-to-back Sceptre brand monitors being defective. It\u2019s probably my luck of the draw. I still have one working Sceptre monitor at the moment, but this will eventually be replaced, as I\u2019m unsure of how long it will be operational for.So, for this product and this brand, I\u2019d say it\u2019s decent for a display, but don\u2019t expect it to last a long time. It\u2019s true that they say you get what you pay for at most times. This isn\u2019t the exception, as much as I would have hoped it would be. While it can serve as a decent budget monitor, keep in mind that it may not live up to the longevity of other more pricier well-known and higher quality manufacturers. Ultimately, I do not recommend this product in the long run. I will not buy from this brand again. Please do some research and invest in better quality and more well-known manufacturers. I\u2019ll also be rating the other Sceptre 24\u201d curved monitor as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692748800000}

Their lackluster response left me feeling utterly dissatisfied. Instead of acknowledging the faulty unit, they insisted on repairing it, which would have been a hassle in itself. But the worst part is that they expected me to cover the shipping and insurance fees for the defective product. This is unacceptable!The manufacturer's refusal to take responsibility for their faulty product and their insistence on charging the customer for their own mistakes speaks volumes about their poor customer service. It's evident that they prioritize profits over customer satisfaction. This experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I strongly advise anyone considering purchasing a monitor to look elsewhere.Save yourself the frustration, disappointment, and wasted money by exploring other reputable brands that prioritize their customers' needs and provide reliable products. Don't make the same mistake I did by investing in this subpar monitor from Sceptre.

In the mean time my boss has to use some other monitor.Most companies I deal with replace defective equipment and send a return shipping label for the old part. If you don't ship it back you get charged for it. But this company thinks it's OK to make you return their defective product on your dime and leave you without equipment for a month while they decide if they will fix it.Well they finally decided it was the monitor and not the PC or cables and had me send it in to be repaired. They did send me a box to return it in and did pay for shipping both ways. However after several weeks and getting the monitor back,I put is on a brand new PC and tried it with both a VGA cable and an HDMI cable and it is doing the same thing I sent it in for.

I'm using this on a boat running navigation  software on a Raspberry Pi 4. For that purpose, it should work well. Screen has good clarity and does get rather bright when set. Including standoffs for vesa mounts to clear the stand mount is a nice addition. The speakers are a joke for anything but a very quiet home-desk where you're sitting less than 5' from it. They aren't very full sounding, and even at max volume they get drowned out by any background noise. Luckily having an audio out jack helps with this. The only other thing I would've liked to see though would be a remote to adjust the settings instead of having to reach around to the back. Until you have a feel for them, or keep the manual handy, you have to fumble a little to get through the menu. Even just a basic menu-up-down-enter remote would've been good.For the price, it's a decent 1080 monitor, very lightweight, and multiple inputs is great.

Tune it using your computer instead.3) Minor complaint, the frame of the monitor is plastic. I'm happier about the other model with its metal frame, which is magnetic.4) Again, minor: certain visual settings can only be accessed by choosing a \"custom\" video mode to access brightness, contrast, etc.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1587600000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Decent for the price","reviewDescription":"I've only had the monitor for a day but I'm happy with the purchase. I initially tried to cancel the order but the seller had already shipped. I figured I would give it a try and send it back if it wasn't up to spec. I'm coming from a 12 year old Samsung T260HD monitor that is 25.5 inches, 1920x1200 @60hz. This was top of the line at the time and paid $329 while this was one was only $109. The old monitor had screen tearing in games (no g-sync or freesync) and FPS play wasn't ideal, especially in COD Warzone. If you've never played on a higher refresh rate monitor before, it makes a difference. I tried overclocking the monitor to 85hz and then 80hz but neither took so I tried out the rated spec of 75hz with freesync and let me say.. I could notice the difference right away and even picked up my first Warzone Solo victory. Aiming was much more smooth and I could keep my reticle glued on other players. If you're using this for light gaming and you're coming from a 60hz panel, you'll be pleasantly surprised. This appears to be a TN panel because the viewing angles are poor. They're completely fine when viewed straight ahead - since this is being used as a computer monitor, it's not a problem for me but buyer beware. No dead pixels or edge bleeding to speak of. Blacks aren't super dark but decent and the factory setting was ok as far as brightness and contrast was concerned. I configured to my liking and I'm satisfied. The stand is wobbly as others have stated and I didn't even bother with speakers, nor should you. I'm not expecting this thing to last but I'm hoping to get 2-3 years out of it. I was looking to get a higher refresh rate monitor (144-165hz) but after doing research, you can't take advantage of the higher refresh rate unless your frames per second average is just as high (144+fps). With a Ryzen 5 2600 and an aging Rx 570, I'm getting an average of 75fps in COD Warzone with the settings at high. In this case, the monitor is a perfect pairing for the 75hz refresh rate.In order to take advantage of the higher refresh rate you will need to open up your AMD or Nvidia software and create a profile that is set @75hz. Once this is created, go into display settings on your computer -> advanced settings -> monitor and then select the new 75hz profile from the drop down. Last, you will need to enable freesync from the monitor control panel (it's in the menu options) and then enable it in the AMD software (not sure about Nvidia). If you're lucky, you may be able to overclock the monitor to a higher refresh rate. Just create a profile for 80 or 85hz, select it in display settings and see if it takes. If it doesn't, the monitor will revert back to the previous refresh rate in 10 seconds. From what I've read, this doesn't harm your monitor and it depends on the manufacturer as to how far you can overclock it. Don't expect much from this panel, however. All-in-all, it's an upgrade for me in just about every way. Some people say a 27\" screen at 1080p for gaming isn't ideal. I beg to differ. The pixel density isn't superb by any means but I didn't notice any difference from a slightly smaller screen (25.5 vs 27) and less pixels (old monitor was 1920x1200). If I had to choose, I'd take the extra real-estate over pixel density which I think only amounts to 6ppi. There's pixel density calculators out there if you're curious. If you can afford it and your GPU\/CPU can achieve 100+fps, I would go with a higher refresh rate monitor. For lower end specs, general use or a second monitor and for the low price, I don't see why not.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1589414400000}

Was also looking for something that had built in speakers.Upon plugging it in for the first time I noticed it had a dark vertical column on the right side of the screen. I thought maybe it just needed some time to 'burn in', and indeed it did slowly fade and go away after 10 minutes or so. After using it for several months though the dark area persists any time the monitor is turned on\/brought back from sleep mode.The built in speakers leave a lot to be desired. The sound quality is not very good at all and the max volume level is about adequate if there are no other sounds anywhere near... but that's also about what I expected. Maybe hoped for a little better but really didn't have my hopes up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692144000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great for productivity, perhaps not for gaming or media creation and consumption","reviewDescription":"Well, the old adage, \"You get what you pay for\", holds true in this case.Physical Appearance------------------------The monitor looks nice, with thin bezels and a simple raised, \"metallic\" sceptre logo at the bottom bezel. The stand is nothing to write home about, and only features tilt adjustment, not height adjustment. The monitor is surprisingly thin for this price point, and would be great VESA mounted, but I'm using the included stand.One thing I noticed is the sturdiness of the stand. My desk has some wiggle in it, and when typing I can visibly notice the monitor wiggle back and forth a bit, which can be annoying.Performance----------------This is where things go down hill. Rather than belabor these points, I'll bulletize:- Very noticeable backlight bleeding around the corners. I work in an IDE (i.e. fancy programming text editor) that uses a dark theme, so the backlight bleeding is very noticeable with the dark background- Washed out colors. Just general lack of vibrancy in the colors and muted overall- Color accuracy? visually, based on how washed out the colors are; I'm going to wager the color accuracy is not good. NOTE: I haven't measured, but let's be real here.- Speakers. It has builtin speakers. They work. That's about the best compliment I can give them. Use headphones.Overall Opinion--------------------I personally got this monitor for my home office. I work as a software engineer and work from home frequently. This is my second monitor, alongside my 5+ year old 900p Gateway TFT LCD monitor.First off, my old monitor performs better in all the above mentioned short comings. Vibrant color and no visible backlight bleeding. I don't know how much the gateway monitor cost originally, as I got it from an old neighbor who was moving out :)So, even compared to monitors of years gone by, this thing is underwhelming.That all said, for productivity use, I can't complain that much. The muted nature actually seems to reduce eye strain perhaps. As we say in the software world, \"It's not a bug, it's a feature!\". The backlight bleed, while annoying, is easily forgotten once I'm actually focused working on something. Color accuracy and vibrancy doesn't matter to me. My general use case is: programming, IM, email, documentation writing\/reading, web browsing, and general productivity usage.Conclusion-------------At the end of the day, it's a 24\" 1080p monitor for just shy of $100. If you're planning on using it for gaming, photo\/video editing, general media consumption, or anything in that area; I'd suggest spending a bit more for a better monitor.On the other hand, if you just want something for general office\/productivity usage. I mean, it's under $100 and it works. So I'd definitely recommend it for that use case.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1551484800000}

I had to manually unplug and plug it in multiple times to get it to work and if your computer happens to go to sleep... you're back to troubleshooting.  I thought something was wrong with my computer or something was wrong with the monitor and I was so upset and then something told me to try a different H DMI cord and boom the monitor is perfect.

I use this as a secondary monitor to help with multi-tasking and also have my PS4 connected to it. There are obvious pros and cons to this monitor, but keep the price in mind.Pros:Matte finish to help against glarePlenty of options to adjust pictureBlue light shift has multiple levels of adjustment to make picture warmer if desiredVESA mountableBuilt in speakersPriceCons:Speaker output qualityLED indicator (subjective)For an IPS panel (stated by vendor in questions section) this doesn't have the greatest viewing anglesThe included stand is a bit wobblyAll ports face downward (subjective)The Pros of the monitor are pretty self explanatory so I'll go over the cons.-Although advertised as a 75 Hz monitor, it's running at 60Hz in 1080p. But this could possibly be due to the cheaper hdmi cable I got for this monitor.-The speakers don't have the greatest sound quality, but I didn't expect much for the price. The speakers work fine if you just want to hear something from your game, but I don't recommend them as primary audio output.-There is an LED indicator on the bottom right corner (LED projects light downward) that illuminates solid blue when it receives signal, blinks blue when it's awake and awaiting signal, and is solid red when the monitor is off\/asleep.-Like mentioned above, the vendor answered a question about the panel and stated it's an IPS panel. I also have an LG 27GL83A-B IPS monitor and the viewing angles are much better than the spectre. But again, keep the price in mind.-The included stand is a bit wobbly but I ended up mounting this monitor so I stored the stand. This monitor did not include hardware to VESA mount so ensure the monitor mount\/stand has hardware or get hardware.-The power, HDMI, and VGA port face downwards so you may need 90 degree adapters for the HDMI ports to prevent the cables from sticking out from the bottom of the monitor.-Something else noting is the buttons on my monitor are in a horizontal orientation, but still in the bottom right corner.OVERALL: I researched a bit before deciding on this monitor and I'm very happy with my purchase. I've already recommended this monitor to other friends looking for a budget friendly 27\" monitor and if I had to do it over again I'd still stick with this monitor.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1583452800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty good for general use although I wouldn't exactly rave about them","reviewDescription":"I purchased two of these monitors for a dual display home office setup and they function similarly. Black levels are poor, picture quality is acceptable and backlighting is shockingly very even. The led backlighting either isn't zoned or at least doesn't strike me as zoned (I don't remember whether or not this was advertised as zoned but I suspect it wasn't). With all that said, I didn't expect these to be amazing monitors. As general purpose 24\" budget displays these are pretty good. I haven't used them to game so I can't attest to the sync on the 75hz mode.I purchased these for a home office setup where I'm looking at emails, spreadsheets, command shells and web browsers all day peppered with the odd VTC call. These do those tasks admirably. I'm sitting 34-44 inches away from these screens 10-12 hours a day and my eyes haven't started to feel any strain so that's a plus.Build quality on one of them is displaying (ha pun not intended) a bit of bezel separation. I only noticed this about 2 weeks into ownership but it isn't enough for me to go through the hassle of unmounting it from my monitor arm and swapping it out if an RMA were approved, but it is enough for me to drop a star.I will also note that there is no real re-enforcement to this chasis. When mounted to an adjustable monitor arm I would recommend only rotating,swinging or pivoting by grabbing opposing bezel corners rather than opposing bezel edge as otherwise you will introduce a bit of flex.  This is something I always check when mounting new monitors for the first time and holy heck did these not even pass my minimum comfort zone for rigidity on even the lightest adjustment when going by the edges - corners only for sure.Other than the bezel separation these panels hit my expectations for a inexpensive general purpose 24\" displays with dual HDMI inputs. I haven't performed any calibration on these displays so my \"acceptable\" rating on their picture quality could potentially be improved upon and I've used preconfigured picture settings.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1596758400000}

This was not hard but can be intimidating and must be done with care not to snap the monitor faceplate.  Once the back was separated from the front, I needed a small wrench to remove the nuts from the pivot pins for the internal mountain bracket.  This was not simple and required extreme care not to damage the ports and electronics next to the pins.After removing the internal mounting hardware, was able to secure the back and faceplate.  Then I was able to mount the monitor to my existing stand.  Note I lost one HDMI port as the port is precariously close to where the mounting plate fits, covering half the second HDMI port.

Stand a bit wobblyMy biggest issue with this monitor is the buttons being located on the back. If using multiple of these ( I have 2 side-by-side in landscape) the buttons are a pain in the ass to use. I use one as dual purpose for a PC and RPI. To switch inputs is an exercise in contortion if you use the left monitor as I do. I would have preferred them on the bottom edge but I have the feeling this was done so these screen could mounted in portrait with multiple monitors. If the buttons had be arrange horizontally instead of vertical this would be less of an issue.The power brick that comes with these monitors is the wall-wart kind where the plugs are on the brick. I would have liked to see a brick with a short pig tail like a laptop brick so less outlet space is taken up.  the cable is plenty long enough however.The stand was super easy to attach and in the future I expect it to be just as easy to remove should I need to. However it is a bit wobbly at the point where the stand attaches to the monitor. Though I attribute that to it being such a large monitor and there will be some flex no matter what. It is by no means excessive. Some day I may buy monitor arm so it's great that there is a vesa mount option.I so far I love these monitors. The brushed look and matte screen make them look very clean. For anyone concerned they would look very smart in a business setting.

I could not set it up to 75Hz, only getting 60. There is noticeable pixel ghosting while scrolling.There is no height adjustment, no DP port. Speakers are terrible. Again, per specs they are 2x2W, but in reality it's probably much less.

The outer packaging advertises the item inside and is held closed with clear shipping tape.  The outer packaging had normal wear and tear, meaning scuffs and small edge peels, but nothing that would infer that the inside product could be damaged.  Once opened the product is tightly packaged in a Styrofoam shell with a static cling screen protector.  It comes with screws to mount on the stand, mount on a wall mount and even a magnetized Phillips screwdriver (that was a major plus for me bc I can always use a new screwdriver) as well as an HDMI cable and power adapter.  The size of the 24\" monitor is very nice, with barely 1\/2 inch trim around the screen.  I work from home using a laptop, so I was very excited to work with the monitor but when I plugged it into the power strip...nothing.  I plugged into the wall...nothing.  I plugged it into another outlet on a different wall...nothing.  I took it to the bathroom and plugged it in...nothing.  Kitchen - nothing. Living room - nothing.  I contacted their customer service via email that very night.  They replied within 24 hours, asking me to register the item and provide them with the model and serial number.  Due to the 1 year warranty they mailed me a new power adapter free of charge.  It should be here within a week.  I will update my review when I see if that was the problem or not.

{"reviewTitle":"Works so far...","reviewDescription":"Purchased two 24 inch monitors to hang on a dual monitor desk stand, for home and light business work.So far- they work as advertised; the only thing that I am concerned about is the power supply- most monitors typically have those three prong heavy duty power cords that go to the back of the monitor with the power systems built inside the monitor itself; these  24 inch monitors do not have this but instead have what I would describe as a 'cell phone charger' that plugs into the wall instead.  The chargers get somewhat warmer to the touch, but not hot, yet,  after a couple of days of use. It makes me wonder if this is going to fail over time,  as these types of charger setups usually do - or if and when they will get warmer  to the touch, etc. The cords leading up from the plug in wall 'charger\/pack' is small as well- I am not an engineer but it appears that they are as minimal as possible and are running the converted power ( D.C.?)  to the back of the monitor, which is also causing me some concern.  They are not what I consider heavy duty by any means- more along the lines of a cellphone cord strength,  running from the wall to the back of the monitors. I assume this is a design so they can change the chargers out for different country power systems. etc.At the end of the day- I will keep the monitors but will touch the packs from time to time. Hopefully the wires do not move much as I would fear a short circuit that you get with a cell phone cord with a lot of use.Buyers will need to keep the boxes as it says specifically states on the boxes that they are needed for any warranty returns, etc.BTW - it did come with a generic HDMI cord, a small set up manual, 4 screws and 4 extension screws for mounting options; the screws are minimal as well...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1593648000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good quality for the $'s. So far so good.","reviewDescription":"Main reason for selecting this monitor was due to my desk having a limited space (mainly the height) for the monitor to be able to fit. I could actually fit a larger monitor in the space available, but it seems like they all have several inches of space between the bottom of the monitor and the stand it's mounted on and are not adjustable. Previously, I actually cut\/modified a stand in order to fit a larger monitor in this space. Unfortunately the Sceptre monitor doesn't have an adjustable stand, but at least it has less useless area between the bottom of the monitor and bottom of the stand!I've only been using for about a month now but for a smaller low cost monitor the picture quality is quite good. At least I think so. Should mention that I'm using this for running older PC games (Age of Empires, Sims 3, GTR2, etc.), word processing, working with photos, etc. Driving sims like GTR2 and GT Legends might push the graphics limits but I'm not on You Tube streaming movies or online w\/IRacing.I have an older set of speakers (from the friggin' 1980's that not only still work but work very well - Logitech makes\/made some awesome stuff!) so no idea how good the monitor's internals work but should be nice to have them as a backup.Overall it appears to be perfect for my needs but YMMV.

But, since new computers with pre-loaded Windows 11 are still not readily available, I had to bite the bullet and buy this monitor to tide me over.Out of the box, I needed to fuss with A LOT of the hardware settings to get it to kind of match my old monitor settings.  You need to call up and scroll through a hardware menu to do so, and the location of the setting buttons on the back of the monitor does not make this task any easier. Still, with all the fuss and muss, it only took me about 10 minutes to figure it out and adjust the monitor to where I wanted it to be.Cons: The computer stand could be more robust and stiffer, but for my use, it is not a show stopper. No on-board USB ports, but I knew this ahead of time so again it was not a show stopper.Pros: Price, reduced power consumption (when compared to the older 120 v monitors), and weight. At my age, weight matters with you have to move desktop computer equipment to clean your workspace and this monitor is substantially lighter than my old 27\" Viewsonic monitor and uses a lot less power too.Mom really loves this new monitor, so I guess that is what really matters!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1629849600000}

{"reviewTitle":"All around decent with a few shortcomings","reviewDescription":"I bought this monitor mainly for the attractive low price, like most Sceptre monitors. I wasn\u2019t too fussed about the refresh rate of this monitor since this is a second monitor that isn\u2019t used for gaming, mainly work\/productivity. Looking at the pictures from Amazon I didn\u2019t realize the low placement for the vesa mount, so it wouldn\u2019t line up with my other monitor (Asus VG248qe) horizontally, so I decided to use the monitor in portrait mode being it was for work not gaming. My initial impressions were decent, colors were a bit washed out and undersaturated, but with some adjustments of the color settings the monitor looked decent and gets the job done considering what you pay for itA couple things to note:1. Not ideal for horizontal dual monitor setups with different monitors. Unless you check the VESA mount position on the other monitor or use one of the monitors in portrait mode, the monitors will be slightly askew2. Not ideal for gaming, unless you play casually every now and then and don\u2019t care too much about frames or picture quality, mainly due to the reason of the low refresh rate, pity full colors, especially noticeable in deep blacks or darker colors, and whites which have a blue tone to them, and although it is a 1080p monitor it\u2019s true resolution is questionable it has sort of a hazy grain no matter what I try and do to fix it.3. Because of the lack of a display port and the odd refresh rate cap you have to make sure you buy the right cable as VGA doesn\u2019t have the ability to surpass 60hz and only certain HDMI cables can reach past 60hz so make sure you buy the right one.Summary: it\u2019s an all around decent monitor, although I personally wouldn\u2019t use it to game, it still has the potential to be decent in game. With this monitor you truly get what you pay for, if you plan on getting into gaming more seriously I say take the investment of getting a higher end monitor if possible as it\u2019s 100% worth it, otherwise go for it","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1586304000000}

The two new SCEPTRE monitors had bad HDMI ports: Monitor A had 1 of 2 ports that worked and Monitor B had no working ports. To be fair...1. I tested both new monitors on 3 different laptops (2 Mac, 1 PC) all of which worked 100% with the existing old monitors - these were supposed to be simple monitor upgrades.2. Used 4 different HDMI cables (2 provided with the monitors and 2 currently in use with my current monitors).3. I also tried 2 HDMI to Mini Display cables as well as 2 different adapters - all of which work with other external monitors.4. The one port that did work was loose and if the cable shifted or accidentally got knocked, the monitor would go out.I did reach out directly to SCEPTRE and they were kind, nice, and responded promptly. This was an Amazon purchase so the return was quick and easy.All in all, I do believe this is a good product and a great value. I hope you are in the lucky 70% category.

I make one go away and three more pop up. I'm leaving most of my original review up, but I'm bumping it down to 3 stars and I don't think I would recommend this monitor now.)I bought this as an affordable emergency replacement for a decade old 22\" HP. It was so old that any modern LED monitor would be a huge upgrade, but I'm kinda shocked at how great this monitor looks. I feel like I've just sat down in front of a high tech viewing screen in a freakin' space ship. It's SO BIG. Everything is SO BRIGHT. The picture is incredibly crisp. I'm a casual gamer, I watch a few movies\/YouTube\/streamers, run my business, and look at cat videos - I don't need top quality and I'm not even sure I'd fully recognize top quality. But this monitor FEELS top quality. It's also a huge screen with a small but sturdy base, which I personally enjoy. It doesn't have a lot of tilt action, but it's enough for me. The speakers are, well.. they're technically speakers, I guess. Truly, they're awful. But who buys a monitor for the built-in speakers anyway?

It was very frustrating, and Amazon didn't want to replace it since I had already had it for awhile. Got in touch with the manufacturer and they wanted me to send it in to be fixed. They estimated a 4 to 6 week turnaround time. Why not just send me a new one and repair the old one? Anyway the screen is nice, but it has since gotten to the point where it just never turns off.

Great buy specially for gaming!","reviewDescription":"I have a GTX 1060 laptop, set up is easy and there was no need for me to calibrate anything, I even dare say this monitor looks better than my own laptop screen at 1080p.At first i thought it didn not support 75Hz and the colors were washed out and it was too bright, also on the nvidia panel it said 1080p at 60Hz however this is what you gotta do to fix it.\"CALIBRATION\"1. Connect via HDMI2. Open Display settings and make sure that they are set so that only the 2nd display is turned on, do not put duplicate or extend.3. Open Nvidia control panel and go to \"Change Resolution\"4. You will see two lists, one will say HD, UHD etc, the other one at the bottom will say \"PC\", (changing the first list will project your laptop screen to the second screen however your laptop is 60Hz and the monitor is 75Hz that is why its limited to 60Hz and colors are washed out, changing the second list will basically use your laptop to power up the monitor at full 75Hz 1080p with the right color calibration.)5. On list two \"PC\" change the resolution to 1080p and 75HzAnd there you go, now you can use your 75Hz monitor for gaming, make sure to change the settings indvidually in games to 75Hz or they will still run at 60Hz and the colors will be washed out.Now onto the review*** REVIEW ***The screen resolution is full 1920x1080p at 75Hz, the colors are very accurate, it looks no where near like a TN panel, I would say its in between a TN panel and an IPS panel but closer to IPS.It comes with speakers which are ok for the price but I recommend headphones or your own speakers which are probably better if you got this for gaming.This is what comes in the package- Monitor- 4 screws for mounting- Two screws for setting up the monitor (non adjustable height(- HDMI to VGA cable- VGA to VGA cableI really recommend this monitor even if not for gaming, its a great price for what you get and it even comes with two cables.However one thing to note is that the difference between 60Hz and 75Hz is hard to notice in games. Playing Witcher 3 and Rise of Tomb Raider at locked in 75FPS wasn't anything much more amazing than 60FPS. However it is still an improvement.One last thing to confider if you\u2019re debating on a 75Hz vs 144Hz monitor- If you have a graphics card such as the GTX 770,970,1060 Most games (witcher, call of duty, battlefield wont go back 80 fps on ultra \/ high graphics) so you wont be able to take advantage of a 144Hz monitor, so I suggest this one. UNLESS you play on medium\/low settings.- If you have a graphics card such as a GTX 770,780,980,1070 and above, I suggest the 144Hz monitor since these can run most tiles at well above 100FPS so you can take advantage of the monitor.*** UPDATE ***Earlier on the review I said the difference between 60Hz and 75Hz was negligible, I take it back.I played on my laptop which is limited to 60Hz and it feels bad and slugish compared to 75Hz, once you go higher refresh rate you can never go backIts one of those things you dont realise until its taken away, great improvement.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"893 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1521849600000}

Spent a few hours trying to figure out if it was a software, driver, windows or computer problem. Couldn't find any solution. Then drove to Best Buy to but a new cable and hub at $150. Plugged the new hub in, same issue. At this point I began to suspect the monitors but how could 2 be bad?! Plugged computer into my TV and it immediately extended the desktop. At this point I went back and checked out the monitors. I was using the supplied HDMI cables. There is a plastic bezel around each input that extends out about 1\/8 inch. The plastic around the HDMI input pushes up against the plastic bezle and makes it so that the HDMI cable is not fully inserted into the monitor. I pushed it in hard and the monitor turned on. I then had to literally break and Dremel around the HDMI plug in the monitor to create clearance for the plug. This level of stupidity by the manufacturer is incredible.

After reaching out to customer service and technical support via email they recommend that I purchase a new adapter, which I did and it did not work. Sceptre said since it was out of warranty, I need to take it into a computer shop and have them fix it, they will not be handling it.I called 7 different repair shops locally and none of them do monitor repairs. I called customer service and they are absolutely horrible. They said they don't do repairs and I would just have to buy a new monitor and there was no way around it. So the option was just third party repair or to get a third party warranty and they would have nothing to do with it.

I diddled with the brightness and contrast until we were pleased. So my son played with it for 5 hours. We were happy. So my son closed the laptop lid and went to bed. Then when my son opened the laptop lid we got a black monitor screen. So I tried to get it to work. The menu never worked anymore. If I fired it up, the screen Sceptre would turn red but it wouldn't start up. It would sometimes say that my USB wasn't plugged in. I tried both of the 2 ports but neither one worked. After fussing with it for 2 hours it still didn't work. So I thought it was my laptop who had a problem.  So I moved to a TV set with a USB port. I tried that and it worked perfectly.So I assume the  Sceptre  monitor had a bad solder joint on an internal circuit board.  It has an awesome screen but I can't spend hours to have another one break again.  My time is worth than the cost of the this whole monitor!

That's the background.So I don't have a lot of experience with desktop monitors (this is my second in about 3 years and the one I had before this was a cathode-ray monitor hooked up to my Windows Vista desktop) so you can take everything I say about picture, size, etc well salted. That being said, I actually love this thing.  It's a little on the large side for my tiny cubby of a desk, but it's great. The picture quality is great. I love playing video on it, all that good stuff. Also, having two HDMI connectors does not hurt when you're switching between screens. The bevel size is an improvement on my old monitor, but it comes with the drawbacks. The buttons for the monitor are located on the back, which is a design protocol that I hate, and always have hated, but that is neither here nor there. My problem is that markings on the front of the bevel, denoting which button is which, are nigh invisible. I can only see them if I move my body so that it's at a certain angle and I am staring straight at them. As such I prefer to go by feel, and I usually get it right. Switching between screens could be easier, and can't be done in less than three button pushes. It is stable: I've only had the screen crash once switching between my desktop and my laptop, and it's a lot easier to reset the connection when it's and HDMI cable as opposed to a DVI. All in all the negatives are minor for me, but I guess worth taking a star off.

It's not a terrible monitor for what you paid for. In some ways it's better than the LG in some ways, brighter whites and slightly more saturated darks. One issue I have with it is that I can't get the 75Hz refresh rate that is on the box and in the manual. Another issue I have is that it's not as crisp as the LG, when watching videos the image is slightly more crisp and cooler as far as color. Overall this monitor is a great beginner monitor if you buy it at the $90 that I did, just make sure that if you are running a dual monitor setup that you have a stand that let's you adjust the height of the monitors individually because the VESA mount is low on the monitor and that most likely will put it at a higher viewing angle than your other monitor... trust me I know.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1658102400000}

This monitor works for desktop applications, and it\u2019s so-so. I had one stuck pixel as did my best friend who followed suite in buying one too. Needs some tweaking but works great for my work needs.

Easily configurable to a myriad of needs.That said, it is a TOTAL PAIN to mount.Now, if you want to simply use the included pedestal base, fine. No problem, the installation is fairly simple and straightforward.The REAL problem comes when you want to use the VESA mount. I suppose if you intend to use a variable frame wall mount, it should go well. It's mounting on a swing arm bracket that proved difficult. If you do not have 1\/2\" spacers and long mounting screws, you will have to take more drastic measures to make the mounting plate fit properly. I need about 30 minutes, a Dremel-style power tool and a metal-cutting wheel to cut the pedestal mount bracket off, then, using a metal-grinding bit to smooth out the rough bits. If you do this carefully, it will go quickly and cleanly. You just have to be careful and TAKE YOUR TIME.Once I was able to mount mine, it worked beautifully from the minute I turned it on. It has a line of buttons up the right-hand rear, with the power button on the bottom.I have this connected to an Acer Nitro 5 17\" tablet with dedicated nVidia GTX1650 4GB video card, so I can us my laptop with a wireless mouse and keyboard without squinting at a typical laptop display. I have it positioned, so that I can raise the lid without bumping into it. It is quite lightweight, as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1595376000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good deal - speakers are the only disappointment","reviewDescription":"I was looking for a good, inexpensive monitor for someone else and this fit the bill.The picture quality is fine for the specs given.  In fact, I was pleased to see a good tilt function and the HDMI cable included.  It  even includes a small screw driver for attaching the base.One minor item is that I wish the power switch had been on the front.  For the older, less tech savvy user, it can be good to have the power switch (and maybe others) on the front instead of tucked far behind on the back.  I had not thought of that while shopping.The bigger disappointment was the speakers.  I knew to not set high expectations but I thought for sure they would be better than a cheap laptop's speakers for youtube and zoom.  In fact, they were significantly worse than the 15\" Dell Inspiron's built-in speakers.  For the older, hard of hearing person, this was quite a disappointment.I would say it is a good buy as long as you are not counting on the speakers.  I would have gladly traded the screwdriver and HDMI cables for slightly better speakers.Still, overall it exceeded expectations at this price point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620604800000}

I've tried several different HDMI cables, none of them connect with my computer. The instructions say that when you press the \"M\" button, the OSD menu pops up. WRONG...nothing!

The only button that seems to do anything is the power button, but all that did was display the brand name across the screen, but almost instantly that is replaced by a message window \"No Signal\", followed by \"Check Input Settings! Entering Power Saving Mode\".  Per the booklet, it says if there is a problem, the HDMI cord may be compromised, to try using a known good cord.  Tried that.  My good cord I use for my TV is a working cord, so that wasn't it.  I tried all trouble shooting options.  My brand new HP laptop recognized a device connection, but no action on the Monitor screen.  There was an option mentioned that was to use an ancient analog connector (not included), so that is no help either.
