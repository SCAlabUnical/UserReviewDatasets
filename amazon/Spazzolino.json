{"reviewTitle":"Oral-B works well as always.","reviewDescription":"I invested in the Oral-B Pro 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, and after incorporating it into my daily oral care routine, I can confidently say it's a game-changer. This electric toothbrush combines cutting-edge technology with user-friendly features, delivering an exceptional dental care experience.First and foremost, the cleaning performance of the Oral-B Pro 1000 is outstanding.

This feature is especially beneficial for those who may not be aware of their brushing habits, promoting a gentle yet effective oral care routine.The built-in timer is another noteworthy feature that encourages optimal brushing habits. The two-minute timer ensures that I brush for the dentist-recommended duration, and the 30-second intervals prompt me to switch to different quadrants of my mouth, ensuring a thorough and even clean.The simplicity of the Oral-B Pro 1000 is one of its strengths. The on\/off button is easy to use, and the single cleaning mode streamlines the brushing process. The brush head is also easily replaceable, and it's compatible with a variety of Oral-B brush heads, allowing for a personalized cleaning experience.The battery life of the Oral-B Pro 1000 is impressive. A single full charge lasts for several days, making it convenient for travel or forgetful moments when I've neglected to charge it. The charging indicator is a helpful feature, ensuring that I'm always aware of the battery status.Maintaining the Oral-B Pro 1000 is a breeze.

{"reviewTitle":"Powerful and easy to charge","reviewDescription":"Pros*Powerful*Good grip*Lightweight*Easy and convenient charging base*Long and thin handle is surprisingly good for reaching the back of my tongue without making me gag too much.Cons*Cleaning modes seem gimmicky but do work well as power settings if you don't like the more powerful setting.*The brush head doesn't make full contact with the base. There's a tiny gap that wasn't there in my older Pro 100. This doesn't seem to affect the functionality at all, nor does it feel loose. It's more of an aesthetic issue.*The pressure indicator should be more noticeable, maybe there should be an LED indicator. Right now, it's supposed to be a pulsation, but it almost sounds like a change of pitch. Sometimes it's hard to tell if it's making that sound.This is replacing my 4 year old Oral B Pro 100 electric toothbrush that uses AA batteries. What I was able to notice right away was how easy it was to charge. It's almost like a magnetic charger, without any exposed metal bits that could corrode. The 3 power modes are useful, but I mainly use the most powerful setting or daily clean mode, although in that setting is harder to notice the pressure indicator, which is basically like a pulsating noise and sensation that changes when you put too much pressure on it. The second power setting makes it more noticeable, that's supposed to be the sensitive mode. The third power setting or the whitening mode has a stronger pulsating or hammering sensation, this mode slows down, then ramps up again, but in average it seems a little slower than the Pro 100 at full charge. I don't know if it actually whitens the teeth though, I think it's just a gimmick. For $40 I can fully recommend this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"38 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702166400000}

I must add, however, that I also use the waterpik flosser which I think greatly helps.  I've seen some negative comments about having to tap the power button a few times to get it to turn off, but that shouldn't be a surprise since the description mentions the 3 brushing modes.  I do wish it would automatically shut off after the 2 minutes like the Sonicare does.  I also like the variety of brush heads that are available for the Oral B brushes.

{"reviewTitle":"I like this better than sonicare so far! Going from sonicare to this basic oral b model.","reviewDescription":"I was skeptical to switch from sonicare to oral b given how basic this seemed to be, but I have no regrets so far. Sonicare is good in terms of cleaning in between gums but I always could not get my teeth white. After trying oral b, it is way different as it gets in the corners of your teeth and it does a polish kind of brushing so my teeth seem to be whiter.  For this basic model its actually pretty great as its basic in terms of one button to push (although it has 3 modes you can switch between) the first mode seems strong enough yet gentle for my teeth and gums.  As for noise, many were saying it was loud, but honestly it was not. My sonicare made a more annoying whining noise than this, so I'm happy and can't complain about the noise. Battery life seems basic but just put it in the charger every few days or so. Only thing I didn't like is that I can never tell when to stop brushing, as my sonicare would turn itself off, but this one gives gentle haptic feedback, but doesn't really turn off after the full 2 minutes.  So I really can't tell if it wants me to switch brushing areas or stop brushing.  But overall this was a great switch so far and I'll be sticking with oral b so far.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705190400000}

I don't have to charge it too often, which is convenient. The design is sleek and looks nice on my bathroom counter, not too bulky or anything.The reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because, while it works great, i don\u2019t love how small the head is and I kind of feel like the proportions are weird in my hand.

{"reviewTitle":"Does a very good job on plaque","reviewDescription":"I have always used a standard manual brush.  I was skeptical of electric because it seemed like the little head only moved in short back and forth spins (instead of complete circles) making it less effective.  In addition, I assumed that you could not apply any pressure, or the head would stop moving.My dentist recommended I try one to help with plaque build up that I seem to accumulate quickly on the inside of my lower front teeth.  So, I bought this one (my wife has had one a few years).  Some observations:- It does a very good job keeping plaque off.  I actually started using this brush halfway between dentist appointments.  I found that it could not remove already present plaque (at least not what I had), but that once removed by the dentist, this brush does a great job keeping it off.  Much better than a manual brush.  For that alone I am sold.- The small size is very good for getting around back teeth \/ wisdom teeth.  It also gets you to focus on a tooth at a time (vs. the sawing motion across many teeth) - which actually took no more time.  Overall, a session might take very slightly longer than manual, but is certainly more thorough.- You can press down pretty hard, and the brush keeps oscillating.  Although, in my experience, there is no need.  I tend to use less pressure than a manual brush.  While the brush head is doing a short back and forth spin (vs. a total 360), that seems just as effective (perhaps more so, since you get both directions of spin very quickly on all surfaces).- The brush does a pulsing vibration after 2 minutes.  You can just ignore it and keep brushing.  It also does much lighter pulses every 30 seconds, to help you time your session into groups of upper front, upper back, lower front, lower back.  Again, you can ignore all this and just brush at your own pace.- If two people in the same bathroom are using this type of brush, there are two good options.  One, have both people use the same base, and just switch out the head (they are color coded for this reason).  Or two, give each person their own unit, but keep just one charging base out.  The charge need is so infrequent, that its easy to just leave one brush standing on its own, and the other on the charger; then just switch out when a charge is needed.  This clears up counter space and cords.- We have purchased the generic (and less expensive) replacement heads.  In our experience, they were identical to the originals in materials and make.  I am sure there is a lot of quality variation, but it was not hard to find good options.- My wife and I have what appear to be identical models, except we did one black, one white to make them easy to keep separate.  Mine, the white, only turns off by pressing the off button 3 times (since it cycles through modes using the on\/off button).  This is the only thing I really do not like.  The black one turns off with one click.  Perhaps it is a setting, but we can find no way to change it.  So, I find myself holding the brush in my mouth (to stop splatter) while finding the button (see below), and pressing 3 times.- The on off button is a little hard to press.  It is flush and shallow.  I always manage to get it on and off, but sometimes it is surprisingly hard.  Recently, it would not turn on, and I thought it must have lost its charge.  Turns out I just had to press very firmly.  This can be a challenge when turning the unit off.  You tend to keep it in your mouth (to prevent splatter), and so finding and pressing the button is sometimes a little harder than you would think.  I think for most people, this is just a negative to be accepted.  But for people who are older, or not dexterous in the hands, I think this would actually make the brush impossible to use.Overall, I am happy with it, because it prevents plaque, end of story.  If I could change one thing, it would be a single press, easy press on\\off button.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"135 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690243200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Precision Cleaning Meets Convenience","reviewDescription":"I recently started using the Oral-B Pro 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush and have found it to be a significant upgrade from manual brushing. The toothbrush offers a range of features that cater to a more efficient and effective oral hygiene routine.Effective Plaque Removal:One of the standout features of the Oral-B Pro 1000 is its ability to remove up to 100% more plaque along the gumline compared to a manual toothbrush. This is largely due to the dentist-inspired round brush head technology, which reaches areas that rectangular manual brushes often miss. The result is a thorough clean that leaves my mouth feeling fresher and cleaner.Gum Protection:The sensi cleaning mode and Gum Pressure Control are excellent additions for anyone concerned about gum health. The toothbrush automatically stops pulsations when brushing too hard, protecting gums from excessive pressure. This feature has given me peace of mind, knowing that I'm cleaning effectively without damaging my gums.User-Friendly Features:The integrated quadrant timer is a game-changer. It alerts me every 30 seconds to change the brushing zone, ensuring an even clean across all areas of my mouth. This feature has helped me maintain a more balanced brushing routine.Brushing Modes and Personalization:With three easy-to-use cleaning modes, the Oral-B Pro 1000 allows for a customizable brushing experience. Additionally, the availability of various brush heads for purchase means I can tailor my brushing to specific needs, such as deep cleaning or gentle cleaning.Design and Size:While the toothbrush is highly functional, the design feels a bit outdated compared to some newer models on the market. Also, the size of the brush head is slightly too big for my mouth, which can make maneuvering around tight spaces a bit challenging.Wish for Improvement:A separate button for changing the vibration frequency would be a welcome improvement. Currently, adjusting the settings requires multiple presses of the same button used to turn off the toothbrush, which can be a bit inconvenient.Conclusion:Overall, the Oral-B Pro 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a solid choice for anyone looking to enhance their oral hygiene routine. Its effective plaque removal, gum protection features, and user-friendly design make it a valuable tool for daily dental care. Despite its slightly bulky size and dated design, the benefits it offers in terms of cleaning efficiency and gum health are significant.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700265600000}

This toothbrush does indeed have a pressure sensor, but it\u2019s subtle, and the instruction manual does not describe in enough detail how it works, hence the confusion in these reviews. This is from Oral-B\u2019s website:\u201cAll our toothbrushes from the Pro 1000 and above include the pressure sensor. These toothbrushes will stop pulsating when pressing too hard, which will feel and sound noticeably different during brushing. By 'pulsation', we are referring to that the brush head itself is moved forward and backwards very quickly, towards and away from the teeth.\u201dIf you turn on the toothbrush and push on the stem with your finger (as if brushing too hard) you\u2019ll hear a quiet click, and can feel something disengage inside the brush head (I suspect that\u2019s the \u201cpulsations\u201d disengaging). If you then put the brush in your mouth, and push it too hard against your teeth, you\u2019ll hear the motor get louder\/make a slightly different sound. It\u2019s more subtle than I\u2019d like, but that is how the pressure sensor works.

{"reviewTitle":"Don't waste your money!","reviewDescription":"I recently purchased the Oral-B Pro 1000 CrossAction Electric Toothbrush, and I must say I am thoroughly disappointed with my purchase. I decided to give this toothbrush a chance after my old Sonicare finally gave up the ghost, and the reviews I found, including those on Wirecutter, seemed promising. However, my experience with it has been far from satisfactory.First and foremost, the noise level of this toothbrush is incredibly bothersome. It's super noisy, which makes the whole brushing experience rather unpleasant, especially in the early mornings or late at night when you're trying to be considerate of others in your household. The awkwardness in its design also caught me off guard. It feels cumbersome and unwieldy in my hand, making it difficult to maneuver around my mouth comfortably.One of the major drawbacks is the oscillating brush action. It feels jerky and inconsistent, which is not only uncomfortable but also raises concerns about its durability. The timer feature, intended to help you change brushing zones, feels like the toothbrush is about to seize up and die at any moment. It's disconcerting and doesn't inspire confidence in the product's longevity.In hindsight, I regret not investing a bit more money in another Sonicare or a different electric toothbrush brand. The Oral-B Pro 1000 CrossAction has proven to be one of the worst electric toothbrushes I've ever tried, and I'm frustrated that I can't return it since it's now used.In conclusion, I strongly advise against wasting your time and money on the Oral-B Pro 1000 CrossAction Electric Toothbrush. Instead, consider spending a little extra on a Sonicare or exploring other reputable electric toothbrush brands. Your dental hygiene deserves a product that not only works effectively but also provides a comfortable and enjoyable brushing experience, which sadly, the Oral-B Pro 1000 fails to deliver.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"31 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694044800000}

As I said, the brushing part is fabulous and my teeth feel as though I\u2019ve just had a cleaning at the dentist every time I use the brush. The things that I don\u2019t like at all are: One - the continual flashing green light when the toothbrush is charging. I can\u2019t charge my toothbrush in my bathroom due to lack of counter space and so have it in my bedroom. The flashing green light means that I can\u2019t have it charging when I am trying to sleep. A steady \u201con\u201d light or even better a light that indicates it\u2019s done charging would be a much better design. Two - the toothbrush indicates when it\u2019s time to switch to a different quadrant of the mouth by slowing and then speeding up again. This is very irritating as it interrupts my flow for brushing my teeth. I always spend longer in each quadrant of the mouth and I wish this feature could be turned off if it\u2019s not needed. The WORST thing; however, is that the toothbrush is no longer charging properly. I can\u2019t even get a full brushing done without the brush losing power. Oral B does offer a 2-year warranty and they are willing to repair the toothbrush but that means that I have to send it in to them and then it will take 7 to 10 days before I get it back. I can\u2019t get along without this brush for up to two weeks. When I explained this to the \u201cadvisor\u201d at Oral B they were not at all sympathetic and quoted \u201cstandard policy\u201d. So, does that mean I should spend another $50 to get a replacement for the weeks that I need to have this brush or will that toothbrush also fail. I wonder how long these toothbrushes actually last because this one has failed in 16 months. Oral B doesn\u2019t seem to care about standing behind their product. In addition, the first time I tried to contact them via the phone, I sat on hold for 28 minutes and then they hung up on me. If you need to contact them, use \u201cchat\u201d.

The only thing I like about it is my teeth feel polished afterward. That said, it's 1) Loud. Really, really loud. I swear it feels like it wants to escape. 2) The modes don't light up on the handle, so I don't know which one I'm actually in, so I choose the one that seems the least violent - this toothbrush \"rumbles\" unnervingly. 3) You have to reset the mode every single time you use it, there's no memory. So, in order to brush your teeth once, you are pushing the on button, then three more presses to get to mode number 3 (aka \"least violent\") if that's the one you want and then a fifth time to turn it off. For anyone whose hands don't work super well anymore, it is literally painful to do this repeatedly.So, if you want something that seems to clean your teeth pretty well, don't mind the noise, and don't really care what mode you're in, and have strong hands, you may be perfectly happy with it.

You can not find the power button without taking the toothbrush out of your mouth because it is also smooth and level with the toothbrush body and difficult to find due to the aforementioned slippery situation and unless you want your bathroom decor to be dental speckle I really can't recommend doing this.There are supposed to be multiple power settings but the only one my toothbrush had was \"Let's see if your brain has the same shock absorbancy of a woodpecker.\" My brain does not.There is also supposed to be a \"quad sensor\" which is supposed to be aware of you long you have been brushing one section of your mouth and then give a little skip to tell you when it is time to move onto another part of your mouth.  Yeah...no.  Oh, it skipped and stuttered alright, when ever it pleased with no rhyme or reason.  This would cause the toothbrush to jerk and your hand to slip which would make the button hard to find and see above for the rest of it.I wrestled with this thing for three days because I was convinced I was doing it wrong, I mean this is an Oral B, I've used this brand my whole life, how could they have screwed up this badly?  It finally got to the point where my mouth was feeling rather sore and I just could not get myself to give it another go.  So, I sent it back.I  can say that it wasn't entirely awful.  Your teeth will be clean.  Really, really, clean.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"38 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679875200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Designed to breed MOLD. Disgusting!","reviewDescription":"Before you buy this brush, search the reviews for \"MOLD\". This brush is a safety hazard! Do not purchase!There is a fatal design flaw in the brush heads that this toothbrush requires. There are two cavities in the brushhead that allow organic material and water to become trapped inside. Eventually, even if you disassemble, clean, and dry after each use, you WILL get a buildup of black mold inside the brush; black mold that goes INSIDE YOUR MOUTH.The photo was taken after running water through the holes and then tapping the brush head on the sink. All the black dots you see are BLACK MOLD that came out of the the brush head.If you contact Oral B support, they will tell you that this is somehow not covered under their warranty.Are you kidding me? Do not buy this product. My recommendation would be to spend a bit more on a brush that doesn't have holes\/mold-traps built in, like the Sonicare.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704844800000}
{"reviewTitle":"What a waste!","reviewDescription":"I\u2019m probably overly critical of consumer products in general these days as they all seem designed for the landfills. So take this for what it\u2019s worth\u2026The battery eventually died on my old one that was identical to my wife\u2019s (pictured between mine and my daughter\u2019s here). I have an 8 year old who was super excited to get a \u201cgrown up\u201d toothbrush, so I got her the kid version of ours. Then, since she and my wife both have white ones, I simply wanted a black version of the same toothbrush. Cause\u2026 well I just like black! And why not match my suite of Manscaping tools!Turns out, that was more complicated than I thought. This brush was my third black toothbrush from this company trying to find one that wasn\u2019t just slippery plastic (the other models didn\u2019t have the nice rubber grip). Though I had many recommendations in favor of other brands, I wanted us all to be able to use the same charger.This toothbrush is fatter than my old one, so it doesn\u2019t feel as nice to hold. It shows white residue all over it no matter how much I rinse and clean it. I\u2019m a shower brusher, so you\u2019d think it would be easy to rinse (See aforementioned Manscaped products that are designed very well).In addition, it turns out they don\u2019t have the same brush tip choices in black either. So yeah\u2026 black was a fail!Lastly\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what device-dependent world makes anyone \u201cneed\u201d an app to brush their teeth, but hey, I gave it a shot. Not convinced AT ALL that any of these modes are doing anything different for my teeth except maybe the gentler mode for the gums. But the app didn\u2019t accurately pick up areas that I was brushing and requires you to actually grab your phone and turn the app on to utilize its features. With no plans to jump out of the shower or start my app before I get in\u2026 this is pretty useless.Overall this is an overpriced gimmick for those who really just want everything they use to feel high tech!K.I.S.S.Keep Is Simple Stupid! :-)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644019200000}

{"reviewTitle":"It's not quite what it's described as","reviewDescription":"UPDATE 2: Returned as defective. On the second charge, it took much longer than the advertised 22 hrs, and battery died within seconds of first use.UPDATE 1: I'm bumping this up to 4 stars for two reasons (original review below): 1) I like this just as much as my Phillips, and if I'm willing to give that 3.5-4 stars, I ought to give this 3.5-4 stars too; 2) Now that I'm looking for it, there is indeed a 2-minute timer.  It's a shame that I have to pay special attention to it, but it is definitely different from the 30-second timer.  I'd give this a 3.5 if I could, but since I'm feeling guilty about the original 3 stars, I'll go ahead and bump this up to a 4.A few days into using the toothbrush, and I rather like it.  I was afraid it would be too loud based on other reviews, but it seems quieter than my previous Phillips Sonicare.  The rotary action also does seem to clean better and isn't as abrasive as I thought it would be.  So why three stars only?  For me, I think it ordinarily would've been rated 4 to 4.5 stars, but I'm a little annoyed at two things which are used to market the Pro1000, so I've docked a star.First, they advertise that there is a 2 minute timer.  On the Oral-B website, it says: \"The electric toothbrush also alerts you when you have brushed for the dentist-recommended time of 2 minutes.\" I'll have to pay extra attention to it but I haven't noticed that it's markedly different from the 30 second timer.  Not a big deal, I can just keep track of 4x 30 seconds, but since this is marketed as a feature, it'd be great if it were more prominent.  I'm told that the 2 minute stutter is longer than the 3- second stutter, so will look out for it.  This feature is probably there, and I just haven't noticed, but that's still noteworthy that it wasn't obvious. In comparison, the Phillips would turn off after 2 minutes.Second, they advertise a pressure sensor. On the Oral-B website, it says: \"Pressure Sensor: Slows and stops pulsations if you brush too hard.\"  The key thing to note here is that the brush doesn't just pulsate.  It also rotates and may oscillate.  So, assuming the pulsations actually stop, then you are still damaging your teeth while brushing because the other motions continue.  For me, I think this effectively negates the value of having the pressure sensor in the first place.  If this is feature is important to you, look for a model that gives you a indicator light that you're brushing too hard so that you can manually adjust.Again, for both of these features, they didn't technically misrepresent; still the product's not quite what I expected.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1562803200000}

If you intend to hold  the product while you brush your teeth, plan on using something to grip it, like a  non-slip pad of some sort, as it quickly becomes slippery and unmanageable.

I checked the \"oscillating, rotating\" claim with a piece of floss. This brush does not rotate(spin.) This brush slightly oscillates. So if you wanted a toothbrush that spins, as I do, this one does not.

First is the battery, it's a Ni-Cd battery. These have less capacity than Li-ion batteries and can develop \"memory\" and reduce their capacity if you recharge them before they're empty. The batteries are not replaceable and will be the first part to wear out. If the batteries could be replaced and were Li-ion, it would be less electronic waste and maybe make the price tag reasonable.Next is the charger. It's wireless in that there is no plug that connects to the toothbrush. However the charger is always on when it's plugged in, wasting electricity and overcharging the battery. It's almost like they intentionally designed the toothbrush to burn itself out after a year of use. I use an outlet switch so I can turn off the charger saving power and the battery.As far as the other features for, it cleans teeth great.

{"reviewTitle":"I kind of hate it, but it DOES clean teeth","reviewDescription":"The feature ratings are- Deep Cleaning: 5- Timer Function: 3- Bluetooth connectivity: 1I'll address those in turn, then address the title.Deep Cleaning: jeez is this thing effective. You have two different intensities, depending on how hard you press the brush against your teeth. I use it in tandem with a rigorous flossing routine and a hard bristle brush for large debris removal. It offers a genuinely clean feeling (like I just got out of the hygienist's chair) most of the time, with me just paying mind to the timer.Timer Function: you'll get a hard-to-miss vibration every 30 seconds. One \"play\" of this sequence for every quadrant of your mouth to guide your cleaning, with the fourth being more pronounced, to tell you \"you're done\" (with the dentist recommended 2-minutes of brushing). It's solid but has significant shortcomings.1. If you stop brushing before you finish the cycle-of-4 (or if you brush for longer), the brush isn't smart enough to know that. There doesn't seem to be an internal \"smart reset\" mechanism, and there is no means of manually triggering such except to let the brush run and to turn it off as soon as you hear\/feel the 4th-cycle pattern.2. There are occasions when the brush seems to be smart enough to detect *something* about restart the *count* to 4, but it doesn't reset the 30-sec timer. That's just strange.So why 3 stars? Because I've bought cheaper tooth brushes that are more consistent (e.g. just turning off the motor after the cycle-of-4) with their timers' behavior. This one does more, but inconsistently, and was more expensive. 3 star value for 3 star functionality.Bluetooth: functionality doesn't exist. No idea what they're talking about.The Title: why do I \"hate\" it? Water capture. Water, and tooth-pasty saliva, get caught in the weirdest places in this brush, such that I can rarely complete a brushing without much of it trickling down my hand, wrist, and arm. Might I also mention that I have to store the brush head on a towel, so the trapped water will flow out in a managed space, rather than caking (e.g.) the brush with tooth-pasty water spots? The only mitigation I've found is a near-constant inhalation as means of suctioning the moisture to stay in my mouth. This is the first electric toothbrush with which I've had this problem. The dripping effect varies from brush head to brush head (which need to be swapped rather often, especially if you are undergoing orthodontia) which suggests a manufacturing quality-control issue.I would not buy it again, knowing this is what I was getting into. I wish it wasn't the case, because you can tell they tried to make something quality, but effort and execution are different things.If someone could prove to me that it's just faulty hardware or my poor technique, I would gladly improve the rating.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704412800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Too Hard on the Hands - Gave Up After One Month","reviewDescription":"I don't leave reviews unless something really stands out. This toothbrush is fine for my teeth. But it's TERRIBLE on my hands. My old Oral-B spinbrush lasted well over a decade and I bought this as a replacement when it finally died. After less than a month, I am ordering a replacement. This will wind up in the trash because...1. It's too hard to hold. If you are a senior, have compromised hand strength, nerve issues, pain - or any hand issues - this is not the toothbrush for you. My old toothbrush handle was covered in a thin layer of some sort of rubber-like coating that gave it some grip. This new brush is completely slippery. It has some little design-element dimples in it but they do nothing to help the grip. Add in water and toothpaste and this is really hard to hold. And it's hard to brush your teeth well when you don't have a consistent grip on the handle to turn it to reach various tooth surfaces. I can't understand why whoever designed this thought a shiny smooth plastic handle was a design improvement over something so obviously more functional.2. The power button is slightly indented instead of sticking out. For me, it's almost impossible to feel on a slippery wet handle with some toothpaste foam on it. And when I do find it - it's very hard to press to turn it off. It usually takes several tries.After using this for less than a month, I gave up and ordered an Oral B Vitality FlossAction that's half the price, has a surface with grip, a stick-out power button, and a timer that automatically turns it off after 2 minutes. I'm hoping this will be better for my hands.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1709510400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Weirdly drippy, dumb controls, and short battery life","reviewDescription":"I ordered this after using a spinbrush with rechargeable AA batteries for several years, and then using some cheapo sonic toothbrush for a while. I thought it would be great in comparison due to Oral B being an actual brand and it being fairly expensive.Wow was I wrong. Reasons I hate this thing and am getting rid of it:1. I don't know if it's my mouth shape, brushing technique, or what, but this thing always tends to drip along the back and I always end up with a gross trickle of toothpaste-spit on my hand and on the handle.2. The controls are dumb. It has 3 different speeds. Even the cheap generic sonic brush I had would remember your last speed and just default to that. I'd click to turn it on, click to turn it off. You could change speed by double clicking. Great! But not this POS. You have to cycle through all the speeds every time. You can at least turn it off by holding down the button for a couple of seconds, but COME ON. WHY? Really dumb controls.3. The battery only lasts less than 2 weeks, brushing 2x per day. That seems really short? My previous 2 brushes were weeks, maybe months, between recharging. Minor inconvenience, but still annoying that after a week the thing is already slowing down. I could have left it on a charger all the time but I like my vanity to be tidier than that, and don't think I should have to have a cable management system for a gd toothbrush.Anyway, I left it 2 stars because it's a working electric toothbrush, but I'm tempted to give it a 1.

{"reviewTitle":"The charging system on this brush is the ABSOLUTE WORST!","reviewDescription":"This was my first time buying and using an electric toothbrush.  The package arrived promptly (as usual), and contained the toothbrush (the handle and the single included brushhead are separated), a small leaflet with instructions in multiple languages, a coupon and registration instructions and a charger.  The toothbrush did not have any charge when it arrived, and so, I plugged in the charger and put my brush handle on it to charge while I read the instructions.The instructions do say that it may take a while for the charging indicator to start blinking when the charge is low.  It took 30 minutes for the light to start blinking (I was quite close to assuming that the product was DOA and was about to pack it up for a return), and then it took 20 hours for it to finish charging (the charging indicator goes off when it is fully charged).Before I rant about the charger, let me say that the brush itself works pretty well.  Assembling the head onto the handle is trivial (except for the stupid ring that, for some reason, is separate from the brushhead instead of being part of it, so that you can drop it while trying to slip it on and go after it on your hands and knees - whoever designed this must be an idiot or sadist).  The brush is not silent.  I measured it at between 30 and 40 decibels using an app on my phone.  And it sounds louder than that when you put it inside your mouth and turn it on!As the instructions indicate, the brush pauses every 30 seconds after you turn it on so that you remember to move the brush from one quadrant of your mouth to another.  At the end of 2 minutes, it pauses and stutters a lot more to let you know that you should be done.  There is no way to turn off the timer or adjust its timings.  I have taken to ignoring the timer and brushing my teeth until I feel I have done the job thoroughly.  I feel that 30 seconds per quadrant when each quadrant has three surfaces to clean (outside, inside and chewing surface) per tooth is a little too rushed.  Thankfully, the brush does not stop running at the end of the timer, so you can ignore the timer without having to switch the brush on at the end of two minutes.The brush also has a pressure sensor so, if you press down too hard on your teeth, the brush turns off.  In this model, the on\/off switch just switches on or off the brush.  On more advanced models (the user manual does not make this clear at all), the on\/off switch cycles the brush through multiple brushing modes also.  The brushhead has special bristles that lose color as you use them, so when they lose all their color, you know to replace the brushhead.  A set of 3 replacement brushheads is about $20.  In all likelihood, you will need at least 3 or 4 brushheads per year, so take that into account when you figure out the long-term cost of this brush.Now, back to the charger.  This brush uses some kind of wireless charging technology, probably as part of making the toothbrush waterproof.  My shaver is wet and dry one that can be used in the shower, and it has a regular charger that plugs into the shaver without any issues.  And it charges the shaver (which has a much larger battery than this toothbrush) in about one hour from 0 to 100%.  This brush takes 15 minutes to start charging, and it charges endlessly.  After two days of use, I charged the brush again, and it took more than 16 hours to charge up fully.And on top of this stupidly slow design, the charger will only accept 110 - 130 volts input.  You cannot travel internationally with this charger unless you not only carry an outlet adapter for the pins, but also an actual transformer to get the voltage down to 110 volts from the 220 to 240 volts used in many other countries.  In this day and age, this is nothing but criminally greedy behavior on the part of Oral B to try and sell more of these useless chargers to people just to enable them to travel internationally.  And the rechargeable battery is not user-replaceable either.I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  Oral B needs to fix this insanely long trickle-charging process.  And they need to come out with a charger that will accept 100 to 240 volts, 50\/60 Hz input.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"47 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1544054400000}
{"reviewTitle":"I really wanted to like this, but too many negatives.","reviewDescription":"I have used the Phillips sonicare for years.  It finally stopped working and I had to decide whether to spend the hundreds of dollars to buy another or switch brands and go with oral b. The price tag of around  $100 for the oral b vs $300 or more for the Phillips convinced me to try the oral b. Also the replacement  brushes are much more expensive with  the phillips. The oral  b arrived hygenically sealed and was packaged well.Now for the negatives and positives of both brands,  1). The Phillips wasn't packaged as well, even though the price was much higher on the Phillip's.  2)  The Phillip's heads fit my mouth perfectly, where as the heads on the oral b were just too large.  3)  I felt like I was driving  a Kia with the Oral-B,  and felt like I was driving a Toyota with the Phillips. The Phillips is intuitive and not at all cumbersome. I felt like water and toothpaste were spraying everywhere with the oral b.  The Phillip's is just more sleek!4)  the worst thing on the oral b is the button that turns the unit on and off.  I have no idea if the brush is supposed to turn itself off. I couldn't find anything about it in the directions. So far,  it has never turned off on its own.  Maybe that's because it's so annoying that I have to interject and manually turn it off before my time is up.  And that leads to another big negative. You don't just push an easy button to turn it off. It has to go through 5 or so levels of painful finger pushing to get the thing to turn off.  I do not understand why!  It probably does an ok job,  but with a face full of foam and a non focused brush, I find myself not looking forward to brushing my teeth. Also the oral b hurts. Not like I need to toughen up my gums, but rather like it's just too large and hitting areas it shouldn't.5)  Since I purchased my Phillips  sonicare many years ago, they have come out with many different brushes. I spent hours trying to figure out which one was right for me.  I got so fed up with their non user friendly descriptions  I gave up and purchased the oral b. I will keep it because I've already used it,  but maybe it will turn into an expensive cleaning tool for around the sink and faucets. It also seems louder and certainly more clumsy than the sonicare.

When I bought the Pro 1500 nearly a year ago, I asked Oral-B why it's not on their site because I was concerned I had just bought a discontinued product. They assured me that it was in fact a brand new item that they had just released and that they were going to add the Pro 1500 to their site \"soon\".I realize that it's nearly a year later and they still haven't done it even though they are still manufacturing it, but I have been to their site several times per month since then and I can tell you that I'm honestly not surprised it's not on their site yet. I get the impression that anyone could do a better job with their site up-keep than whoever is doing it now. I have even noticed that it's kinda somewhat falling apart. Some elements no longer work and haven't worked for months. Their products are fine, they just need better people to handle and operate their website.Update #1: When I wrote this review, the price was the same for the Pro 1000 and Pro 1500 (including both the black and white Pro 1000s). Today, the price for the Pro 1500 nearly $20 more than it was when I wrote this review, and currently close to $30 more than the Pro 1000.[Original review below]I bought this to replace a very new Vitality. It was a *HUGE* upgrade over the Vitality, but then I saw the Pro 1500 and learned from Oral-B that it's quite superior. The Pro 1000's specs are:- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean- 8,800 oscillations per minute and 20,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode- A pressure sensor that's supposed to just stop the pulsations when it's triggered- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes- A NiMH battery (old technology)- A battery life of 28 minutes (7 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 22 hours- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on\/off if the battery needs to be charged- The CrossAction brush headThe Pro 1500's specs are:- 2 cleaning modes: Daily Clean and Sensitive- 9,900 oscillations per minute and 45,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode (these speeds are faster than any I've seen so far in the specs of any of Oral-B's electric toothbrushes, including the Genius 8000 - they all seem to top out at 8,800 oscillations per minute and 40,000 pulsations per minute)- 7,400 oscillations per minute and 33,000 pulsations per minute on the Sensitive mode- A pressure sensor using a red LED that turns on when the pressure sensor is triggered- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes- A Lithium Ion battery- A battery life of 56 minutes (14 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 12 hours- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on\/off if the battery needs to be charged.- The CrossAction brush headThe Vitality is extremely basic:- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean- 7,600 oscillations per minute.- A timer that hesitates the motor 3 times every 2 minutes- A NiMH battery- A battery life of 20 minutes (5 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 19 hours- No charge indicators or battery life indicators- Mine came with the Sensitive Gum Care brush headIn comparison, the Vitality seems like a cheap generic electric toothbrush. Don't consider buying it.When I upgraded to the Pro 1000, it was amazing. I wanted to burst at the seams and write an extremely rave review, but then I learned about *and ordered* the Oral-B Pro 1500. After using it, I can tell you that the Pro 1500 is *FAR* better than the Pro 1000. I honestly feel the Pro 1000 should be discontinued and no one should ever buy it. I mean really, the Pro 1500 is only $10 more right now and it destroys the Pro 1000.I would have given the Pro 1000 4 stars instead of just 3 if it had a Lithium Ion battery. They charge faster and last longer without charging.So yeah, I am not sure I would recommend the Pro 1000 if you can get the Pro 1500. The Pro 1500 is a much wiser purchase. I'm *extremely* happy with mine.

I bought this toothbrush primarily for the oscillating motion, since that's what dentists use (I literally had the thought as a child, \"why don't our toothbrushes look like the dentist's?\"). After using this Oral-B for a few days, I'm glad I bought it, but I also hate it.I hate that it *stutters* when it's time to switch tooth quadrants, vs the Sonicare that makes a gentle change in pitch. I hate that it doesn't stop after going through four quadrants, that it just stutters harder, and you have to turn it off manually (unlike the Sonicare). I hate that the noise is louder and harsher than the Sonicare. I hate that there is only one button, so you will always have to press it at least four times total during brushing in order to turn it off. I hate that I can't tell the difference between the brushing modes at all (the pitch seems to go *down* slightly when cycling, so is the first mode the strongest? I can't tell. Only thing I can tell is that the third setting seems to vary in velocity, which, why?). I REALLY hate that the instructions refer to it as type 3757, and in every distinct section of the instructions it never refers to that type number, but it does consistently refer to three *other* type numbers, leaving me totally in the dark on this toothbrush's functionality (particularly what the different brushing modes are, if they are different). I hate that it claims, on this very Amazon page, that there is a pressure sensor, but as hard as I press absolutely nothing changes (unlike the Sonicare); AND the instructions specifically say that the pressure sensor is only for type 3791. I also hate that the battery life is allegedly significantly worse than the Sonicare (supposedly one week only for the Oral-B, and I used to get a month on one charge brushing twice a day with the Sonicare).All that being said, it is more aggressive, and the oscillating motion does feel more thorough. In short, my teeth definitely feel cleaner after brushing with this vs the Sonicare. That plus the fact that brushheads are cheaper means I will stick with this even though I hate it.

He especially recommended an Oral B because it is supposed to stop if you apply too much pressure.Well, it turns out I do like the small brush head a lot, and I don't  mind the noisiness of the Oral B.

It is absurdly difficult to locate and press while operating the brush. I miss it almost every time, and when I manage to locate it with my finger, I have to press multiple times to get it to work. Can't imagine who thought it was a good idea to redesign a basic and functional feature in this frustrating way.2. The charging base quickly accumulates grime. I mean *very* quickly; after 3-4 uses, there is a dark oval of grime visible where the brush handle sits. This did not happen with the previous version of the brush. I can't even figure out where it's coming from, since toothpaste and water are not, you know, black. Part of me worries that there is something leaking out from the brush handle, though I can't see anything there. Either way, having to clean off the base every couple days is annoying.The good thing is that the brush still cleans my teeth as well as before. So I give it credit for that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708646400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great for the price","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve used Oral-b toothbrushes for quite a while and I have always liked them. After my last one died (it had lasted almost ten years) I was looking for something new but didn\u2019t want to pay a lot. I settled on this one after looking at the pros and cons of the different models. It is much like the other models I have had with a couple of exceptions. First it doesn\u2019t beep at each 30-second mark. Instead it pulses. Even after using it for six months I\u2019m always thinking I\u2019ve missed the pulse. The second issue is a bigger one. The toothbrush is supposed to have a pressure sensor that stops the brush if you press to hard against your teeth. I\u2019ve tried and I can\u2019t seem to get that to work.Oh, and I really like the color of the toothbrush. The black stands out nicely. However it seems to be impossible to find black replacement brushes so as soon as you need to change the head you move into the two-tone-toothbrush mode.So mixed review from ne on this one. Oral-b is a great toothbrush but I might have been better off spending a little more on a better model.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708214400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Annoying to use","reviewDescription":"I had the older version. It was easy to use, great grip. Battery status was easy to see. Turning it on\/off only required one press of the button.This model is so disappointing. I thought it would be an upgrade, but it\u2019s nothing but annoyance. I\u2019ve used it for almost a month. The body is slippery to hold when your hands are wet, they are also not comfortable. It\u2019s not easy to tell if the battery is almost out, so there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll try to brush and it\u2019ll just stop. To turn the toothbrush off you either have to hold the button or click it 3 times.I am contemplating tearing this apart so I can put the new battery in the old one, and I\u2019ll just chuck this.

{"reviewTitle":"Mediocre at best","reviewDescription":"As has been repeatedly emphasized by other reviewers, the battery life of the Oral B Pro 1000 leaves a great deal to be desired, and based on its short life and incredibly long charging time, it is difficult to recommend it. Additionally, it is very noisy and the vibration is quite intense. Charging time is a minimum of 22-24 hours, and even alternating days with my other power brush, it seems as though I'm charging it quite frequently. The only reason I kept the Oral B brush is because I like to alternate between a round brush head and the Philips Sonicare style head, which I use with an Aquasonic Black Series device (which has a strong motor and great battery life so far). I much prefer the Aquasonic brush (which I also prefer over the comparable Philips model, excluding their cheap brush heads; fortunately the Philips heads work great with it) which was only $10 more in cost. I got the Pro 1000 on sale for $30, and I wouldn't purchase it again unless it was at least $10 less than that. In the end, if you are set on a round brush head and don't care to spend an extra $200-300 simply for a quiet motor, an accompanying app and a few other bells and whistles, this might be worth it to you. In this reviewer's opinion, it's certainly much better than a manual brush.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703203200000}

Having a touch of OCD & needing things 'cleaned well' - you won't know your teeth weren't 100% clean, until you brush them with this lol.I will say, it takes an overnight to completely charge and stop the blinking green charging light.  The settings also take a bit to get used to. The first one is for regular cleaning. I skipped the second push for sensitive cleaning and clicked it a third time for the 'polishing' setting to finish off.  Excellent!Also the push button to turn it on and off and change the settings is a little tricky to use, especially if your woman who has nails.

{"reviewTitle":"Okay, But Aim Higher (Maybe)","reviewDescription":"I bought this not sure whether I'd like an electric toothbrush, so not wanting to spend a lot of money.  After almost three years of use I'm happy with the device, except for one thing.  This has \"standard\" batteries, which I believe means Nicad.  Their life is getting weak at three years of use, and the warning light no longer even comes on before it will stop running due to a low battery.These units are on sale right now, but I'm going to wait for the 1500 to go on sale, which has Lithium Ion batteries.  That should have a longer life if treated properly.  And I did try to treat the Nicad batteries as they should be treated, but it still didn't help.  A reminder of how bad Nicad batteries are.Edit:  I ended up buying the 5000 on sale--it was $15 more than this model also on sale.  After using it I'm upgrading the rating I gave to 5 stars because this works just was well as the more expensive model, which has a lot of unnecessary features that border on frivolous.  Besides the upgraded battery though, the 5000 has three lights to indicate battery charge, as opposed to just one light which will give a warning of low battery if the battery is not near end of life.  You can decide whether those two things (possible battery life beyond three years and three warning lights) are worth the extra $15.

One day, I was in Rite-Aid and saw their store brand electric toothbrush for only $9. Electric toothbrush technology has improved so much over the years, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was pretty underwhelmed. It was so loud. My teeth didn't feel nearly as clean as they do after using a Sonicare.I came across a lighting deal for the Oral-B Pro while browsing Amazon. I had high hopes for this toothbrush since Oral-B is a direct competitor to Sonicare. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS SO LOUD! My bathroom is right next to my daughters room. I literally can not use this toothbrush at night because it wakes her up! My teeth don\u2019t feel as clean as they did with the Sonicare either. The battery life is terrible as well. The Sonicare would go months between charges whereas this one lasts a week if that. The $9 Rite-Aid brand toothbrush works just as well as the Oral-B Pro and is significantly cheaper.There are only two things I like about the Oral-B vs the Sonicare. The Oral-B is very compact and travel friendly. It\u2019s closer to the size of a regular toothbrush whereas the Sonicare is massive and a pain to pack. Aesthetically, the Oral-B is a much nicer looking toothbrush.After coming from the Phillips Sonicare, I cannot recommend this toothbrush. The Sonicare does take some getting use too. The sonic vibrations create a weird sensation in your mouth.I retired my Oral-B to a drawer and ended up buying a no-name brand Sonic toothbrush. It\u2019s almost identical to the $250 Phillips Sonicare DiamondClean but cost less than $40. I\u2019ve had it almost a month and I love it.

I chose this model replacement based on the reviews.  It works well and keeps my teeth clean and my gums from hurting.  Three improvements I'd recommend.  First, put some grips on the handle.  Several reviews mention how it slips from the hand.  My old Oral-B had grips on it.  Even regular old-fashioned Oral B toothbrushes from the store have grips.  But this thing is slick as heck.  Second, you have to hold down the button (while keeping the slippery brush in your hand) for a while before it turns off (because it has three speeds - not sure why anyone needs three speeds to brush their teeth, but if you push the button once or twice you get a different speed).  The old Oral-B you just pushed the button once and it turned off - very simple.  The third suggestion is to have some way to keep crud build-up from accumulating on the charger after brushing.  Was a problem with the old Oral-B and also with this one.  No matter how much you wash it or dry it, you will have crud build-up in 1-2 days on the charger or where you place it.  Anyway, those are improvements and not deal breakers.  I like the brush for the price and it does its job.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 because of the needed improvements.  (I do like that it plugs directly into a regular wall outlet unlike its competitor which requires a USB adapter - that is one reason I stayed with the Oral B).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687651200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good toothbrush, if a little messy. Lasted 3.5 years","reviewDescription":"This review is for a model purchased in February of 2019.This toothbrush is really good at cleaning your teeth and feels good to use. The timer function is not something I cared about, but it was noticeable, which is good if you do care about it. Replacement heads, of which I went through a good amount of, added up to a non-insignificant yearly cost.My major 2 gripes, which is kind of just 1 gripe, is how messy this thing can be. It may be - in part - the heads that I was using (Oral-B Sensitive Gum Care & Oral-B Crossaction), but they are built hollow with a number of openings that allow the froth from brushing your teeth to get inside of the toothbrush head. This can spill out the base of the head onto the handle\/your hand if not elevated, which is really annoying.Additionally, when you are finished brushing and wash the head to clean out that froth (I recommend washing or wiping down the handle, too) - no matter how clean you try to get it, there will still be some scum that tends to collect on the charging base.Anyways - after 3.5 years of using this thing, I'm pretty sure the battery is on its way out. The pressure indicator sensor lit up, and when I tried to use it it shut off for good after a couple of seconds. It works again, but the charge doesn't last as long and is very spotty. The soft plastic cover on the front buttons & battery indicator also recently flaked and peeled off, which will eventually expose the electronics inside of the handle (it was stored away from sunlight for those 3.5 years, too) - so battery depletion or not the toothbrush is on its way out. Probably gonna try a different brand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688947200000}

I have braces so using most toothbrushes and trying to angle them in a way to clean under the brackets just doesn\u2019t work well, until I tried this electric toothbrush. It has a sleek design and spins extremely fast and it removes most, if not all of the plaque on my teeth, even under my brackets!! The thing is if not well maintained the toothbrush will build up some bacteria along the toothbrush body so cleaning it ever few weeks is extremely helpful.

{"reviewTitle":"Not too bad","reviewDescription":"I gave this Oral-B a try and it wasn\u2019t bad at all. The toothbrush is powerful and noise level is standard for Oral-B electric toothbrushes. The only drawback for me is that the handle can and does get slippery since there is no rubber to keep your hands from sliding on a wet handle! Some other reviewers commented that it\u2019s hard to turn off, I did not find that to be a problem. It has 3 speed settings so all you have to do is press and hold the power button for 2-3 seconds and it will turn the brush off (you don\u2019t have to press the button 3-times). I decided to return the item because of the handle being slippery. I found another Oral-B at Costco that has the rubber handles and for only $20 more it comes with 2 power toothbrushes.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1705104000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Decent electric toothbrush","reviewDescription":"I like the shape of the round toothbrush heads.  I use the sensitive heads and the generic brush heads I had on hand fit the electric toothbrush. I purchased this to replace the Oral-B 1000 I had been using for several years as it no longer held a charge and sometimes wouldn't start without placing it on the charger for a few seconds.  I immediately noticed a huge difference in the rotating speed with the new toothbrush.  I guess I didn't realize just how slow my old one had become because it wouldn't charge.  One thing I miss about my previous Oral-b 1000 is the rubber part of the handle.  The new one has no rubber grip and becomes very slippery while I'm brushing.  I have to stop and rinse it off when my hand moves closer and closer to the brush head.  Also, the power button is slightly off so it takes a few tries to turn it off.  It stays charged for a few days, but when the light blinks you really have to put it on the charger or it will stop working very suddenly.  It takes a long time to charge fully (The light will continue to blink while it is on the charger for over a day.) Overall it seems to clean very well.  Occasionally I follow up with a firm manual toothbrush I keep to scrub the backs of my teeth better.  I prefer using an electric toothbrush because it has stopped the progression of a receeding gum line above my top front teeth over the years since I switched to using one.  Overall, I prefer the older version in the same model but this is the new design.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700438400000}

This is probably my fifth model through the years.  Usually I get 4-6 years out of the models I have purchased in the past from Oral B.  This one though is going to have to be tossed out in less than a year.  For the past month, the rubber continues to rub off while I am brushing and there is a large bubble forming close to the power button.  Note that this defect is deemed normal wear and tear by Oral B even though this product has a two year warranty.  So they offered me a $25 coupon if I bought a replacement from their website.  Oral B stated that hand soaps, hand creams and household cleaning solutions should not be used when brushing your teeth or handling the electric toothbrush.  Interesting, usually I floss before I brush so I always wash my hands, then floss and then brush.  So I think Oral B's response is just status quo and now I will do my due diligence before I purchase a replacement and consider other options beyond Oral B, especially for other brands that may be more expensive initially but have cheaper replacement heads.  Note that my current tooth brush has been giving me great cleanings (I only use the extra soft Oral B brush heads) and I love the timer but I find it unacceptable that this would be showing such extreme signs of wear and it is not even a year old.

The design of the brush is intended to render the brush obsolete when the battery wears out, which it routinely does in about 2 years.I'm handy, so I have even learned to unsolder and replace the batteries to extend that lifespan.Even then when the replacement battery wore out I purchased another brush.When I received the new brush, I plugged it in, sat it on my vanity and it promptly slid off the surface towards my wall plug and hit a tile floor from a height of over three feet.  After a strong oath, I looked at the charger only to discover that, unlike it's two predecessors, it didn't have the rubber feet installed to keep it in place on a vanity.  There's still a place for them on the plastic casting, they just weren't there.I checked the packaging, and the documentation, and there were no feet to install and no mention of them.So I wrote to Oral-B's customer service.They responded as follows:\"We are constantly looking to optimize our products so they provide great quality and meet the needs of our consumers.  We have removed the rubber feet rather than increasing the cost of the product, while still delivering a great value. We do not have rubber feet\/grips available to send. \"I've purchased 3 of these brushes -- the price has declined from over $100 to less than $40 over that time. So the manufacturer thinks that telling a repeat customer that saving less than 2 cents to create a product that will not sit on a bathroom surface without trying to commit brush-a-cide is in my interest to avoid a price increase on a product where the tooling has been paid for for more than a decade.Willingness to lie about trivia and utter disregard for the customer is disqualifying.

{"reviewTitle":"I wish I had gone electric sooner","reviewDescription":"I bought this on Cyber Monday, and have been using it pretty consistently for two months now. I was hesitant at first, because of some reviews I read, but I've got to say that I am very happy with this purchase.My dentist recommended that I use an electric toothbrush because I have made my gums receed by brushing too hard, and exposed the nerves at the base of teeth.  Hot, cold, and pressure, especially from brushing my teeth manually was causing pain.  He said that it's virtually impossible to brush your teeth too hard with an electric toothbrush, and since using this one, I would have to say he's right.  I have tried to put a lot of pressure on, and it doesn't hurt my teeth.  I went back to brushing my teeth by hand, and it did, even when I tried not to apply pressure.  I absolutely hated it.  I wish I had bought one of these years ago.  Not only has it vastly improved my brushing experience, but my teeth feel so much cleaner now than they ever did before.  Like others have said, it's that squeaky clean feeling like you just came from the dentist.  It's great!  I had no idea what I was missing before.Some reviewers have complained about battery life.  I usually keep the base plugged in all the time, and I just always return it to the base, so I don't really notice, but the times I have left the base unplugged, it seemed to take a week until it ran slow and needed to be charged.  *At first I thought I had a problem with my battery dying... then I timed it and realized that it pulses every 30 seconds for you to keep track of how long you are brushing.It does not feel like a jackhammer in your mouth unless you bite down on the head.  As I said, I have extremely sensitive teeth, and I think this is much better than brushing by hand.The handle is a bit slippery, but it's really not a big deal.  If you drool, just angle yourself so it doesn't go down your hand.Overall, for the price I paid, I am satisfied with this product.  I like the size and the shape of the head, and angled bristles.  I feel like it really gets every angle, and down to the gumline nicely.My only complaint is that I have never had a toothbrush wear out so fast as this one has.  I have only been using it for 2 months, and it is already really worn out.  The color changing bristles are yellow and less stiff than before.  The replacement heads are pretty expensive, and the package only comes with one.  No replacements.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644710400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Failed after 16 Months","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve had a hard time writing this review because in one way this toothbrush does a fabulous job of getting my teeth clean; however, I am not happy that after less than two years of use my $50 toothbrush isn\u2019t working. As I said, the brushing part is fabulous and my teeth feel as though I\u2019ve just had a cleaning at the dentist every time I use the brush. The things that I don\u2019t like at all are: One - the continual flashing green light when the toothbrush is charging. I can\u2019t charge my toothbrush in my bathroom due to lack of counter space and so have it in my bedroom. The flashing green light means that I can\u2019t have it charging when I am trying to sleep. A steady \u201con\u201d light or even better a light that indicates it\u2019s done charging would be a much better design. Two - the toothbrush indicates when it\u2019s time to switch to a different quadrant of the mouth by slowing and then speeding up again. This is very irritating as it interrupts my flow for brushing my teeth. I always spend longer in each quadrant of the mouth and I wish this feature could be turned off if it\u2019s not needed. The WORST thing; however, is that the toothbrush is no longer charging properly. I can\u2019t even get a full brushing done without the brush losing power. Oral B does offer a 2-year warranty and they are willing to repair the toothbrush but that means that I have to send it in to them and then it will take 7 to 10 days before I get it back. I can\u2019t get along without this brush for up to two weeks. When I explained this to the \u201cadvisor\u201d at Oral B they were not at all sympathetic and quoted \u201cstandard policy\u201d. So, does that mean I should spend another $50 to get a replacement for the weeks that I need to have this brush or will that toothbrush also fail. I wonder how long these toothbrushes actually last because this one has failed in 16 months. Oral B doesn\u2019t seem to care about standing behind their product. In addition, the first time I tried to contact them via the phone, I sat on hold for 28 minutes and then they hung up on me. If you need to contact them, use \u201cchat\u201d. As usual, this huge company (Procter & Gamble) doesn\u2019t seem to care at all about their customers and only about their bottom line.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"159 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1548720000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Received Defective One -- SCARY!!!","reviewDescription":"I have been using Oral B plain battery operated toothbrushes for years and have always been happy.  I finally decided to purchase an electric one and went with this Oral B 1000 option based on the reviews and my experience with Oral B battery operated brushes over the years.  I was very excited about trying it out, but when I received the toothbrush last Friday, it wouldn't turn on.  No worries, just means I need to charge it.  I left it on the charger from about 9pm Friday evening until about 8am Saturday morning.  No charge.  The toothbrush would not work.  This is pretty basic to operate, but I read the instructions again thinking -- did I place on the base incorrectly?  Does it take longer to charge?  Nope, did everything correctly.  So .... left the brush on the charger all weekend.... still nothing.  Unplugged everything, and today (Monday), I brought the brush, box, etc. and called Amazon to figure out how to return (honestly, never had to return anything to Amazon, so was not sure of the process after I had opened the item).  The customer service person was very helpful and professional and quickly handled the refund as I was not sure I wanted a replacement or maybe consider another option.  She instructed me to just toss the defective device.  Just before I did so, a co-worker happened to walk by and saw the box on my desk, mentioned he has the same one, so I took the brush out of the box to ask him about it.... and the UNPLUGGED toothbrush felt really warm -- REALLY warm.  It was not on, or at least, was not making any noises.  It kept getting warmer!  Long story short, we figured out how to get the bottom off with a screwdriver and basically ended up tearing the insides of the toothbrush apart to get the battery out and broken away from the terminal leads which were soldered to the ends.  The battery was very warm -- almost too hot to touch.  After we got it apart, the brush and battery both cooled back down.  Thank goodness I felt the brush before I just dumped it in the wastebasket as I now believe it would have caught fire!!!  I hesitate to say not to purchase the product as I truly think this was a fluke and not typical of Oral B products in general. But was  truly scary and has me re-thinking using an electric toothbrush at all -- maybe I will just stick with the good old plain battery operated ones!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1580083200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Poorly designed, don't buy","reviewDescription":"I previously had an Oral B Vitality, which was great. I wish I had bought another, but I thought the Oral B Pro 1000 would be an upgrade. Wrong!The Oral B Vitality has a large, ridged silicone grip on the back and sides of the toothbrush. This is a helpful feature when brushing if toothpaste and saliva sometimes run out of your mouth down the toothbrush. The power button is silicone covered and because the button is raised above the body of the toothbrush, you can easily find it when you want to turn it off.The Oral B Pro 1000 lacks both of these important features. Instead, it has a smooth plastic body with some slightly recessed divots on the back. For decoration? They don't help you grip the toothbrush. The power button is recessed and very hard to find when the toothbrush is vibrating and slippery with toothpaste and saliva.The Oral B Pro 1000 is more powerful than my old Oral B, but that doesn't make it a better toothbrush.

It randomly switches back and forth from an expected level to a very loud rattle.  At first I thought that the brush wasn't inserted correctly, but that was not the problem.  And the little tiny ring that I failed to see and put on the brush right away, also didn't make a difference.  I bought the aqua one, and I bought a pink one for my daughter.

It does a far better job of gently brushing my teeth than brushing with an ordinary toothbrush. My dental hygenist recommended using an electric toothbrush to prevent gum recession.I like the 2 minute timer feature. The toothbrush beeps every 30 seconds to tell you to switch areas of your teeth and gives a final beep at 2 minutes when you can finish brushing. I ignore the 30 second beeps since I'm moving the toothbrush around anyway, but I always brush at least until the 2 minute beep to make sure my teeth get a good cleaning.I find the on\/off button easy to turn on, but it takes two or three attempts to get it to turn off. I don't know why the toothbrush is harder to turn off than on. I like the pink color of the toothbrush in my pink bathroom. The toothbrush came with one brush head that is too hard for my liking, but Oral B offers a 3-pack of sensitive head replacement brushes and I plan to order those.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697328000000}

I went with this model because it seemed like a minor upgrade, having 30 second interval alerts.  Not that waiting for the 2 minute alert was bad, but sometimes I tend to zone out a little while I brush my teeth.  See, several years ago I decided that all my rage and fury and worry was taking over my life so I devoted the 2 minutes during tooth brushing to thinking about things that bugged me and then moving on with my day.  Seems weird, but it totally worked for me.  Having reminders ever 30 seconds means that I can multi-task and work in extra things to think about.  Don\u2019t make it weirder than it already is.But here\u2019s the problem: this toothbrush has turned into at least 30 seconds of my allotted grumble time.  See, unlike my previous brush, this one doesn\u2019t have any real grip.  Which means if you are brushing your teeth and the brush handle gets wet at all (which it does), you hand will slide up and suddenly you are accidentally gripping exactly where the on\/off button lives.  Which means on an average day, I might turn off the brush a couple of times during a two minute brushing session.This gets annoying really fast.The pink color is honestly a little off too.  It is more of a soothing, baby nursery pink or really pale person flesh pink. Kinda gross to be honest. But that is the least of my concerns.But does it brush?  Yes.  It brushes.  The spinning head is perfection and just like the spinning head of my previous electric toothbrush. My dentist gave me high marks for oral hygiene.

However, as I realized immediately when I used it for the first time, the brush keeps slipping out of my hand because there isn't anything to grab onto! I had to stop brushing a few times and reposition it so it wouldn't slip into the sink and make a mess.I was also disappointed that the one setting of this brush (which I decided was fine for me) is very intense, much more than the highest setting of my previous Oral-B model.

{"reviewTitle":"Unimpressed, but fair.","reviewDescription":"I did a little comparison between a few electric toothbrushes today and ended up settling on the name brand. After one use, I\u2019m not sure I made the best choice. I chose it because I trusted the Oral B brand, I preferred the round head, decent charge time, and the reviews. It arrived and I\u2019m not significantly impressed. It came with one brush head, a charger and that\u2019s it- I guess I knew that based on the description, but I was still surprised compared to what others offer. No case for travel, and not even a cap to cover the bristles so they aren\u2019t exposed. It works as intended, but I\u2019m wondering why I spent $40 on an Oral B when there were other brands available with good reviews, good charge times, and 6-8 brush head replacements for half that price- even if they last half the time, it\u2019s already a better deal for your money. Not a noticeable difference between the settings, it just seems like you have to press the button multiple times to get it to stop. And the vibrate pattern to let you know you\u2019re done with your 2 minutes is hardly distinguishable from the 30 second patterns-on a sleepy morning or evening, I could easily dissociate through that warning and end up spending 8 minutes brushing. Also, as someone else mentioned, the \u201cneck\u201d does seem a little too big around. I disregarded that when I was reading reviews, but it\u2019s the first thing I noticed when using it- it makes it harder to put your mouth around it and to move it around. Smaller brush head should require a more dainty neck, you\u2019d think- it sounds strange to need to consider this, but compared to my previous brands, it\u2019s a noticeable difference. Also, the stand\/charger is super lightweight and it bothers me that a decent breeze is enough to topple it over. Really annoying when there\u2019s no cap protecting the bristles- I don\u2019t want it falling all over my bathroom! Going back, I\u2019d probably try another brand. Not sure if I can return it since I used it, but may consider it if it\u2019s an option.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696464000000}

I had to return this. It rattled against my teeth noisily and the \"motor\" hesitated repeatedly while brushing. I realise it's supposed to let you know when to move the toothbrush but this was doing it every few seconds and in no discernable pattern. I concluded that it wasn't working properly. My Sonicare is actually much quieter, doesn't bounce off my teeth and does a better job. Using the two side by side, the difference is night and day. Besides, do I really need a toothbrush to tell me when to move it (even if properly working)? NO! I have no \"interest\" in either company.

{"reviewTitle":"Defective TImer and Really Loud like a hammer jack!","reviewDescription":"Okay, I'm just being facetious about the Hammer Jack but it is loud!  Have been using an electric toothbrush for several years.  My current dental hygienist (who replaced my regular hygienist) suggested I switch to an Oral B.  So I bought this model.  Wanted something simple and didn't want to pay for an app I won't use.  First thing I noticed was the timer doesn't work.  About the 3rd time using it I just kept brushing while checking the clock.  After 4 minutes (still brushing my teeth), it still didn't time off.  I like the rotary aspect of the brush head but it is harder to get to my back teeth.  My usual model just had a regular head like a toothbrush.  It was so much quieter, too.  The Oral B does seem to do a good job cleaning but I've been using it only 2 or 3 times a week because it is really loud...much louder than a dentist drill which I hate...he uses the drill occasionally to smooth out my tooth.  The other issue is the rectangular hole on the head.  What is that for?  Eventually that is going to mold...so gross.  Between my old and the Oral B, I prefer the old because it is totally USB and lasts several weeks on a charge (brushing minimum twice a day).  I'll probably be taking the old one with me on my upcoming trip.  Even with the old electric toothbrush, I must be doing a good job brushing because I haven't had a single cavity over 40 years.  I've had a tooth chip twice (was told it was because I ate something cold and drank something hot right after--don't ever do that!).  Had fillings replaced twice, but no major dental work done (knock on wood!)  Not really happy with the Oral B but will continue to use it several times a week since it's not something that can be returned.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697155200000}

I ordered this toothbrush and was excited to give it a try.Overall, I don't love it. The instructions that came with it were clearly the same that they give with all models, so it was annoying because it would give different instructions for different model numbers- and this one wasn't one of the numbers given! It's not like it's super complicated... but it is annoying to have a product line that isn't shown in the instruction document.I don't like how noisy this toothbrush is. I have to get up before my partner on the weekdays. I asked him if the noise bothered him, and he said no, the only part that bothers him is when it goes a different speed. This is the 30 second interval timer that lets you know to switch quadrants. He doesn't mind the white noise of the toothbrush, but the different rhythm catches his attention when he's still trying to sleep. For myself, the noise overall is annoying. I also don't like that I feel like I can't spit anything out, because if I take the toothbrush out of my mouth, it's still going and will spray stuff everywhere. I find that I have to turn around and face away from the sink so I'm not tempted to spit.I also don't feel like I am able to get to the backs of my molars as easily as I could with my manual toothbrush. I have TMJ and have trouble opening my mouth wide. I have my first cleaning since starting with this toothbrush in a few weeks, so we'll see if the dentist notices any problems back there.Finally, I have to point out that this toothbrush is advertised as green in color. It is not green. It is blue. I thought that would be the case based on the photos in the listing, but I went with it anyhow. Buyer beware, if you care, this is NOT green.

The brush runs fine, bristles don't hurt my gums or cause any bleeding, all good there.So why am I writing a 3 star review for a product that so far from very limited use is solid? Like the title says, presentation. I'm not one for excessive packaging and wasteful boxes so that's not what I mean. What I mean is presentation of information. The included instructions are god awful and do a terrible job explaining how to use the product. The name of this product is the pro 1000 as far as I or anyone else knows and the box claims that there are 3 modes. Yet it does not explain which modes are included with this brush, how to activate the modes, and when activated there are no instructions to which mode is activated and no indication on the brush other than the speed and behavior of the pulses\/rotation of the brush. The manual refers to \"type\" 3710, 3708, 3791 only, and 3791 pressure sensor when describing which modes are available to a brush and I assume all the various oral b models fall into these four categories but at I can only assume because there is no clear indication as to which this brush falls under unless the pictogram on the left refers to this brush. By the way the pictograms on the left are never explained or referred to in the instructions at any point, they're Ikea style pictograms except this isn't a product you need to put together and all parts just fit, this is a product that requires actual instructions. Like pictogram labeled 1, does that show that the light is shining when charging, or when full? What color? Or does it shine when just plugged an docked? How long do we need to charge? When do we know if it's full? All this is important so you don't degrade the battery and kill the brush in a few weeks.

The timer thing never shuts off. YOu get the thirty second warning so you can switch for each part of the mouth. But after 4 cycles, it never shuts off. You have to futz with the slimy small button and push it 3 times to turn off.  Absolutely terrible design, and the button had no texture, so its easy to miss.The Philips works so much better, should have just bought another one, even though far more expensive.The oral b also operates with an awful grinding feeling, the philips is a nice buzz.

Now my brush is always fully charged it started making really loud kinda like grinding noises which wasn\u2019t normal and then it shut off completely I was like OK so I put it on the charger for a bit used  a different toothbrush wondering maybe my kids took it off the charger port and then put it back and I didn\u2019t know so I tried it again it did it again and the tip started shaking so I took it off I put it back on and it is just not working right oddly it makes me a little nervous like it\u2019s gonna explode in my hand which obviously I know that it won\u2019t well I hope I don\u2019t think it would but that\u2019s kind of what it feels like and sounds like like. I want to contact OralB I don\u2019t see that option and the Amazon help doesn\u2019t have the option of help that I need for this so I\u2019m hoping that someone from the company will reach out to me.

Amazon can\u2019t do anything with it because it\u2019s from Oral-B and Oral-B want me to sent it to one of there 4 service centers in the US.

{"reviewTitle":"Battery issues hinder brush performance","reviewDescription":"Purchased based off a wire cutter review. Initial impression of the toothbrush was positive. It\u2019s simple and it cleans. About three days in, the light started flashing red indicating a low battery. After fulling charging overnight, I was surprised to feel a noticeably weaker speed 3 days after and then see the same red flashing one day after that. I use the toothbrush for 2 minutes, twice a day.Unless you are fine with just leaving the brush in the charger (not an option with how my bathroom is laid out), then I would pass on this product. Tried the Burst electric toothbrush a few months later and it goes up to 4 weeks between charges for around the same price as this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686182400000}

She didn\u2019t like hers so I wore both of them out.  I was thinking the new one would be improved, but no. The thing is even more slippery than the old ones. Then instead of adding a textured surface, they decided to make the switch twice as long, recess it and make you press it three times on the end to turn it off.

{"reviewTitle":"Not for those with small mouths","reviewDescription":"After researching toothbrushes for an embarrassing amount of time, I purchased this brush because it was recommended as a good, basic budget brush. After using it a four or five times, I am unimpressed. This is no different than the $5 battery-operated models. It has no features, besides off\/on and stopping when there is too much pressure. No timer ever was present; the \"brush modes\" do not exist on this model; and after a day and a half of charging, it still isn't fully charged. What's confusing is that the user manual says these features are on the model. It wasn't until I looked into reviews that I learned the manual is a \"one-size-fits-all\" one Oral-B uses for all its models.The thing that is mostly influencing a return of this item is that the brush head is large and clunky, and difficult to fit into and use in tight spaces. I am a petite person, with a small mouth; it was very difficult to get this around my back molars. I didn't feel like the result was as clean as my former Sonicare brush, which does have a smaller head. Also, the brush head vibrates like crazy and the brush is pretty hard. If I could get this back in the area, it was pretty rough brushing, or the tight fit triggered the pressure sensor to turn the brush off. All in all, this just didn't work for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1638144000000}
