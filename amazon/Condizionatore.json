{"reviewTitle":"Doesn't cut it for the upper end of the square footage range","reviewDescription":"This product claims to be able to cool 500 square feet. I am trying to cool an area that consists of small living room\/dining room, a connected small kitchen and a hallway. Ceiling height is 8 feet. The total square footage is around 450 square feet. I've used this product for over a month now, in a variety of different temperatures, and I can say that it cannot drop the temperature in this area more than 2 degrees. So if I start at 82, and run it constantly for hours, the best it will do is drop it to 80.Of course there are many factors associated with the area, besides the square footage, that will determine the needed BTUs. I have several things going against me. It's a mobile home, so I'm sure the insulation isn't great. I have old single pane windows. Part of the area is the kitchen, but we rarely use any heat creating devices during the day, and I still observe the poor performance. However you should also consider that I don't live in an extremely hot climate. 90 is the hottest it will ever get, and thats pretty rare. A hot day is 85, humidity 40 to 60%. All I was expecting was to be able to keep the area at 76, even 77 would be fine, but it can't. I do try try to turn it on early, before the area starts to heat up, and that works better, but the temp still creeps up throughout the today to over 80 degrees!Before you wonder if I'm using it correctly, I'm sure that I am. I have both the intake and exhaust hoses setup and sealed at a window. The unit is on the a\/c setting. Temperature at the vents averages 50 degrees, which is good. I've tried all 3 fan speeds. It just doesn't have the capacity. I even tried wrapping the exhaust hose in insulation, to prevent radiant heat from escaping into the room, but it didn't seem to make too much of a difference. I have a fan near the unit to direct the cool air towards the living room area, which is where we are most of the time, and that helps. I'm sure in a normal to large size bedroom it would do fine, maybe a room around 250 square feet, but forget about 500, unless you have \"ideal conditions\". What do they consider ideal? A room insulated like a liquid nitrogen tank, when the outside temperature is 75?Because I haven't used it very long, I can't attest to the quality\/endurance. But it appears to be fairly well constructed. Many people complained about the window kit, but I believe they upgraded it. The hoses and window piece are high quality durable plastic. It wasn't long enough for my window size, so I had to extend it with plexiglass, which took a few hours and 2 trips to home depot to figure out how to cut plexiglass with out breaking it, drill holes, bolt it, and then I applied adhesive weather stripping around all the edges of both the plexiglass and the window kit to seal it.I've never owned a window a\/c, but I've been doing a lot of research, and they appear to be far superior to these portable a\/c's. Far fewer reviews complaining about the inability to cool the area, and I've read multiple articles claiming that window units do much better than portables. Although I don't understand why. A BTU is a BTU. I know it has to work harder to pump air through the hoses, so engineers would have to design beefier components relative to a window unit to get to 14000 BTUs. But if a portable and a comparable window unit are both rated at 14000 BTUs, they should both be capable of exchanging the exact same amount of heat. One shouldn't significantly outperform the other. I suspect they are overrating these. Or if I'm missing something, someone let me know.Also realize this thing is big, especially when you consider the bulky hoses coming out of the back. It's all inside your house, so it's taking up usable space, whereas a window a\/c is occupying space that you wouldn't normally use for anything else.I want to clear up some misconceptions many seem to have about the dual vs single hose units. I've heard many say that dual hoses seem inefficient because \"why would you want to cool hot air you're pulling in from outside.\" This is not how it works. Any a\/c system has two distinct air circulating systems. One pulls in air from the room and runs it over evaporators, where the heat is extracted out by the refrigerant. Its called an evaporator because the refrigerant heats up and evaporates into a gas. The now cool air is then blown out the vents. We should all know from high school physics that you cannot just destroy energy, that heat has to be transferred elsewhere. The now gaseous refrigerant is run throw pipes to the condenser. This is where the hoses come in. In a dual system, the intake hose is drawing in outside air to blow over the condenser. The heat from the refrigerant is extracted by the air. The now hot air is blown out of the exhaust hose. The refrigerant cools, returns to a liquid and is pumped back up to the evaporator to continue the cycle. In a single hose system you are drawing this air from the room, and pumping the hot air outside. This creates negative pressure in the room. This causes air from outside to enter your home threw gaps in doors\/windows to maintain equilibrium (if it didn't the negative pressure would get greater and greater, until the energy required to pump the air out would exceed the capacity of the a\/c and it would fail!) So while you are running your single hose a\/c you are actively drawing in hot outside air, this makes single hose systems inefficient relative to dual hose. Dual hose avoids this because its drawing in just as much air as its exhausting, causing no net loss. You might argue that the air drawn in from outside may be very hot, and that would prevent as much heat from being extracted from the refrigerant. This probably could be a factor, however for me the outside temperature is never really ridiculous. Also note that normal split a\/c systems use outside air to cool the refrigerant, just like dual hose portables, and they seem to do fine.In summary, unless you absolutely can't, I see no reason to choose this over a window unit. It struggles to cool an area below the total square footage it claims to handle, it generally costs more than comparable window units, and it takes up usable space.7\/15\/16 UpdateI've resorted to using this like a cold air fan. I have it right next to my couch, blowing directly at me while I sit on the couch. This creates a 70 degree micro climate, as long as you are on the couch. And you also get the benefit of the noise drowning out your thoughts and being blasted by a wall of 90 degree air when you stand up to go somewhere else in the house! Because the vents give you so little control of air direction, I created a cardboard add-on that directs the air straight ahead, instead of blowing up towards the ceiling.I'm pretty sure this creates a good amount of negative pressure, despite being a dual hose. I noticed air flowing in from a crack under a door while the a\/c was running. I turned off the a\/c and the airflow under the door stopped. Maybe it reduces the amount of negative pressure relative to a single hose (I can't say for sure) but it definitely doesn't eliminate it. This might partially explain the poor performance. I'm sure I have everything hooked up properly so I don't think it is user error.It still runs and no components are broken or malfunctioning. I don't need to use it that often because it rarely gets hot where I live, so I don't have a ton of hours on it. But when I do use it the compressor never turns off because it is so terrible at cooling the area it will never bring the temperature down to the thermostat setting. I'm wondering how long it will last.8\/14\/2018I've switched to using this in a 210 square foot bedroom. This is a normal house with decent insulation and good windows. It's performance is acceptable in this room, in that I can set it to 74 degrees and it will get the room down to that. This is with outside air temperatures in upper 80's and sometimes low 90's, humidity usually 40 to 60%. Without a\/c the room temperature would be in the low 80s.Another annoying factor is the noise. It's pretty dam loud when the compressor is running. Definitely interferes if you want to listen to something on a laptop or TV, Especially in a not huge bedroom where it may need to be placed within a few feet of your bed (remember it has to be within a foot or 2 of a window, which limits placement options). And don't discount the size, it is very big and bulky, so use in a small bedroom might be difficult.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"30 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1370131200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Lots of stupid design choices make it inefficient. There are better, cheaper options.","reviewDescription":"I am so dissapointed in this AC. It has a great consumer rating and came with a remote, so I had high hopes, but it completely failed to meet them.  Do not buy this unit. There are quite a few, frankly baffling design choices that make other ACs far better options. Will it cool a room? Kinda? But you can find a unit that is half the BTU that does a better job.Problems:1 - the thermostat has a 5 degree +\/- envelope in which it will shut off the compressor and keep the fan running on low to save power when it nears your target temp. Problem is that means the unit is constantly shutting down the cold air to blow hot air through itself back into the room. You can actually feel the heat spikes when it happens, as well as smell the moisture from inside the unit.2 - speaking of moisture, the condensation release plug on the back is on the very bottom of the unit. On top of that, there is only one. Most units I've used had a second one near the top. This means if you want to empty the condensation reservoir by hand like I do, you can't just tip the unit back. The plug is against the floor. On top of the the air hoses don't slide off the unit like most do, they lock in place. That sounds good on paper, but it means when you go to empty the reservoir the thing is stuck in place and you have to literally raise it up somehow to get a pan or cup under the water spout. And those locking air hoses get stuck, at least on my unit, so they are a bear to get off. I am always worried I'm going to break the locking clips.3 - for some reason the air vent points straight up instead of forward. I know in theory this means the hotter air in the room raises up and pushes the cold air that's being shot at the ceiling down, causing circulation. In practice tho all that happens is the cold air mixes with the hot air before you ever feel it. If you put your hand more than two feet away from the vent you literally can't feel the cool air anymore.4 - For some strange reason as the sun sets every day this unit completely stops working. At dusk every night the inside temps are consistently and suddenly higher than the outside temp despite the unit still running full blast. I have no idea why this happens. Because of this we have to shut it off at sunset, just after the hottest part of the day, and open the windows.Before this unit I had a QVC brand one that was by no means a good AC. It was rated at almost half the BTU this new one is, and yet it did a far better job cooling the room. This one bottoms out at a set 61F, but on days when the outside temp is in the low 90s it has never been able to bring my inside temps below 72-74 degrees. By contrast the QVC unit only went down to a set 62 degrees, but  always kept the room temp around 64. Now I'm not saying to get a QVC unit. After all I replaced it because it died on me and it was way more expensive than it should have been. But the fact that this unit performs worse than the old one does, and has all the added design flaws on top of that, should go a long way to show you that you can find better units for nearly $100 cheaper.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721260800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Be careful if you are really putting it in a small room. It's BIG.","reviewDescription":"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this item. Many sites recommended this, as did many reviewers, which I did take into account. I knew I should get a dual hose unit and while I knew they were bigger in size, for just a bit more money, I was under the impression the performance warranted it. It seemed obvious to me that while a portable AC unit (single or dual) is expensive any way you cut it, better to have one that did what you wanted or else a slightly cheaper one was still hundreds of dollars of wasted money. The video on this site really made me feel at ease, as if yes, I CAN DO THIS! I'm a WOMAN TOO! Well, I will tell you, while I knew this was 100 lbs, you don't actually think about what that feels like once it is dropped off at your door. It's really heavy. This machine is SO TALL. I'm 5'3\" and it was just a monster. It is a pretty machine. It's not ugly. But it is SO BIG. So much talk about cooling off a SMALL ROOM. Think about that. Imagine a mini fridge in that small room (one stacked on top of each other, really) and do you have space for that? Even still, I went ahead with the assembly. I spent over 40 minutes trying to get the attachments on the tubes. I wanted to crush them and throw them out the window. It hurt my fingers, it frustrated me and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. The video made every step seem so easy. It wasn't. I am glad I got the extra foam tape because there are gaps in window if you use the extension, its small but its there. So you need the tape. Unsightly though. Maybe try to get cream colored instead of silver. I read a review and put the piece of construction paper to act as a pseudo-wall between the exhaust hoses. I positioned the unit (thankfully on wheels) and turned it on. I have a side sliding window so I realized that I would need to get curtains or some other cover and that made me sad because its just another thing to do\/get. It makes no sense to have so much sunlight streaming into an already hot room, which I can't use the blinds now. But for this review and for my initial set up, it was night time, so I wanted to see what this machine can do. I mean, DUAL HOSES, right? I put it on 73 at first (it was about 90 all day and currently at set up time, the room was about 75 with fans going). I turned off the fans so I can get a good sense of chill. It did feel like a colder fan. But it did not feel like AC. I let it go for about 40 minutes. Came in. Again, just felt like a cooler room but not AC type of cool. I put the temp down to 69 and came back in an hour (had the fan speed on full too). It was just ok. And honestly, I just hated the sight of it. The tubing, so bulky (I wish they were thinner tubes but I understand that is not practical), and it just took up so much space. It's a big big machine. I turned it off around 10pm when I went to bed and it was just ok. The noise was loud but not bad. You could get work done with it and you could be on the phone. Some sleepers might like it (those who prefer high fan sounds vs light humming sounds). The next morning, I came in, and of course. sun streaming in, the room was getting hot. I tried to adjust the tubes to look a little neater and they came apart from the connectors. It was so hard to get them to connect again. I thought about just duct taping it and never doing it again. But then for a $600 machine, why do THAT. The whole point of this was it looks cool and works. I put it on and in an hour, it really didn't blow my mind. So, this was morning, sunlight coming in and I just decided. its not for me. The bulk, the tubes, the so-so chill. I honestly think maybe a smaller single hose, that is at least  a bit better than a fan might be better. This was supposed to be SO COLD. I didn't get that. So for me, it wasn't worth the money or the eye sore.  Two stars because if you are doing this yourself (and around 5\"3), its really hard to take out, assemble and even harder to try and get back in the box to return. All cut up and in pain. I did remember to drain it, which alot of water was there for just my little bit of usage. And you should take that one review to heart. A shallow dish (about half inch off ground) is best with a tube. It's too heavy to tilt to completely empty and it will go everywhere. If you are concerned about your fancy floors, maybe get a mat\/rug to put under this. It will leak if you aren't careful when you empty water.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1505001600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Buyer beware!","reviewDescription":"I bought this AC unit and to be fair to date 6-12-2014 I don't know just how good it cools. I live up in the mountains and so far this year we have only had a couple of warm days and have not needed this yet.When I received this unit I let it set several hours in place before I plugged it in and fired it up. Reason being is to let the oil in the compressor settle to the bottom because I had it fairly leaned over on it's back in the box it came in getting it up the stairs of the house to the room I wanted it in.After the better part of four hours sitting in place I powered it up. It sounded fine for the first few seconds until the compressor started up. The compressor was fine but the outer plastic casing\/cover buzzed like you wouldn't believe! After pushing and pulling here and there on the cover in several places it would quieten up. But as soon as I let go of it, back to buzzing like mad.Long story short this is not the easiest thing to return just by it's size and weight and where I live, so I took the cover apart to see if I could find the problem. I found two things. One was one of the screws that hold the front and back covers together was broken off. It had to be done at the factory when they put it together and over torqued the screw so it busted off the mount it went into on the opposite cover.The biggest thing I saw wrong with this is inside there are three what I would call supports that look like ribs that come across from one side to the other. One at the bottom, one in the middle and one at the top. They had what looked like door weather stripping insulation on them to keep them from touching the front cover. This material is very sub-par in my opinion! Very cheap and takes no effort at all to collapse it with your finger. Just by luck of the draw I happen to have some of the very same stuff only this was made by 3M and is a very what I would say dense foam rubber and was 5\/8 inch width if memory serves which is just about exactly the width of what cheap stuff is that came with this unit. I peeled the tape off of the weather stripping I had and just stuck it right on top of what came with the unit just for the extra thickness. I put the front cover back on and screwed it back together. I used 1\/4 inch hex head screws as the Phillips head screws that came with it were cheap soft headed screws that just started eating the heads out upon taking the screws out. The piece that was busted off inside I just left it off. It seems fine without it and I figured that if I epoxy'd it back on, it would be a matter of time before it got weak and broke and then have it start buzzing.After getting it back together I fired it up and nice and quiet like it should have been from the get go! Now to be fair I have not really used it since but at the time I ran if for a few hours and it stayed nice and quiet. At least as quiet as a unit like this is going to be.One other thing to mention, The front LCD panel on this lights up in blue which is fine but I think the manufacture ought to just have it light up for five to ten seconds when you start it up or make an adjustment to it like temp, fan etc. then go out, other than have it stay on constantly! We have this unit in our bedroom and I had to put a piece of black duct tape across the LCD screen because otherwise it glows like a spot light. In the daytime it would be no big deal but night time, it is! The remote has the exact same LCD screen display on it so I don't care what the unit itself is showing since the remote shows the exact same.So, I don't recommend this unit! I base that on how cheap I saw it to be made internally and by the lack of proper dampening. At this time I cannot tell how well it cools as I have not had the chance to really put it through it's paces yet but will edit this in the future as the summer approaches.By the way, the room I have this in is right at 300 sq ft. So it should cool it with no problem. Especially since I have external window coverings that keeps the sun off of the rooms windows.Also wanted to add, in the booklet that comes with the unit it mentions that if the unit is quite noisy it could be the outlet it is plugged into does not have sufficient wiring or rather heavy enough gauge wire to handle the amperage draw which definitely can be true but not in this case. If memory serves the unit max draw is 10.8 amps which would be initial compressor start up but then drop down afterward. The outlet I have this plugged into is 20 amp with 12 gauge wire about thirty feet from a 200 amp panel. Definitely not the problem with the units covers buzzing so much.By the way, The unit I received is not like the one pictured here. Shape is the same but where it shows it being silver is a black or more like a dark charcoal gray. I like mine better actually!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1402531200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Have to drain way too often making it unusable","reviewDescription":"This AC unit was amazing when I first got it. Probably the best unit I owned, cooling my large bedroom very quickly. Then suddenly about theee a half weeks after having, the unit needed to be drained. No big deal as that happens some times. Unfortunately since that day it has needed to be drained every 30 mins to an hour, making it impossible to use at night when sleeping. I contacted Whynter who told me to send the product back as it seems the self evaporating feature stopped working. Problem is this thing weighs just under 100 pounds and I obviously don\u2019t have original packaging since I\u2019ve had it for a month now. Really unfortunate and feels like a waste off $500+. If it kept working the way it was the first 3 weeks it would\u2019ve been 5 stars but that is definitely no longer the case.

{"reviewTitle":"Tested: Whynter 14,000 BTU Portable A\/C","reviewDescription":"*** Important addition to my review ***I think this is not a 14,000 BTU A\/C unit.  If you look at the product info, it states that the unit's max power consumption is 1250 watts; two different sources make this seem equivalent to 4265 BTU.  I don't know how they rate these portable units, but the power consumption number does not support the rating.http:\/\/www.goodhousekeeping.com\/home\/air-conditioner-calculatorhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BtuI knocked a star off of my review upon discovering this.  If anyone can correct or comment on this, I may re-adjust back to a 3-star review.*** Original review ***Rather than give you guys a subjective analysis, I'm going to give you test results.  I am using this unit to cool a 150 sq ft apartment bedroom in Seattle, WA.  The outdoor temperature on weather.com was 88 degrees throughout nearly the entire test (the starting temp in the room was the same).  I am measuring temperature using a digital thermometer I have on a window fan unit that I set inside the room away from the cold air stream.time (min) -- temp (deg F)0 ----------- 8815 ---------- 8530 ---------- 8245 ---------- 8160 ---------- 8075 ---------- 7990 ---------- 79I will say that the actual temp felt cooler than 79, but we'll go with the objective measurement.  Excel gives me the best fit to an exponential that flattens out at 78 F, so it looks like the unit can cool 10 degrees below the natural temp.  The time constant is 36 minutes.The temperature flattens out due to heat getting back into the room from the outside environment, and I would tend to think that this loss would scale with square footage.  But the size of the air mass that the unit is trying to cool (and that is gaining heat from the outside) is going to proportionally affect the rate of temperature change, and this, too should scale with square footage.  I expect then that max cooling will reduce with square footage roughly linearly.  That comports with at least some of the reviews I've seen and makes the 500 sq foot rating seem generous.  Below is a table of approximate cooling:room size (sq ft) -- cooling (F)100 ---------------- 15200 ---------------- 7.5300 ---------------- 5400 ---------------- 3.75500 ---------------- 3There are of course a huge number of variables that dictate exactly how much cooling you get.  Not worth listing here.  I'm just trying to give you a guide.  If I had to take a wild guess, most apartments are more alike than different.--- WARNING: DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU ARE A GEEK ---I think that the temp of an apartment under cooling should follow a differential equation of the form:T' = -E*W\/C + (S\/I)*(N-T)\/CT [F] is temperatureE is a dimensionless efficiency constantW [BTU\/h] is the heat removal of the Whynter unitC [BTU\/F] is the heat capacity of air in the apartmentS [ft^2] is the surface area of the apartmentI [F*ft^2*h\/BTU] is an insulation factorN [F] is the natural temperatureThis has a solution:T = N - E*W\/(S\/I) * [1 - e^-((S\/(I*C))*t)]My bedroom has a surface area of 630 ft^2, and the air inside has a heat capacity of 14.3 BTU\/F.  The time constant in this formula is I*C\/S = 36 min = 0.6 h. So,I = (0.6 h)*(630 ft^2\/14.3 BTU\/F) = 26.4 F*ft^2*h\/BTUThe cooling capacity is E*W\/(S\/I) = 10 F. So,E*W\/(630 ft^2\/26.4 F*ft^2*h\/BTU) = 10 FE*W\/(23.9 BTU\/F*h) = 10 FE*W = 239 BTU\/hThe thing is rated for 14,000 BTU\/h (manufacturers use BTU as a shorthand for BTU\/h).  Per the entry at the top of my review, at 100% efficiency, the unit should be a 4265 BTU\/h unit.  If you're measuring the air output, it wouldn't surprise me if the real number would reflect 20% efficiency within the unit.  The actual output, before considering the efficiency of ejecting the hot air out of the room and whatnot, could easily be ~1000 BTU\/h.  At any rate, I measure composite efficiency (E) at 5.6% using the 4265 BTU\/h figure.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1405209600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Struggles to Cool My Living Room","reviewDescription":"I live in a fairly small apartment that gets warm but not sweltering in the summer. I bought this unit in hopes that it would be able to effectively cool my living room space. I measured out the square footage of my place (standard ceiling height of 8') and found this unit was rated for well over the size of my space.Much to my dismay, this very expensive unit struggles to cool the room effectively. At 1300 Watts, the power draw is more than what I would consider to be fair for the performance. I would rate 1 star if it didn't work at all. I just have to leave it running all day in order to keep comfortable (usually paired with a fan anyway). This unit is also pretty loud. Not unbearably so but I wouldn't be able to sleep with it running.Installation was pretty simple but dealing with the dual tubes is a bit of a hassle. It also does not come with foam insulation to put around the window bracket, so you may want to invest in some weather stripping. The large size and considerable weight of this product also made for some difficultly with installation.Overall, I would not recommend this product. I don't seem to have a faulty unit or anything. This is just what to expect from one of these coolers. If you can manage it, try getting a window mounted unit instead as they are far more effective and efficient.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1628726400000}
{"reviewTitle":"You like bugs and frustration?","reviewDescription":"The air conditioner is very very big. The set up of the exit and entrance big tubes is very frustrating.  You're supposed to be able to rotate the accordion like intake and exhaust tubes into the air conditioner but it ends up being that you have to force it in and it pops out with the slightest movement. Buy some duct tape for this issue.  The other unbelievable thing about this air is that the intake and exhaust window kit doesn't have an external screen.  I've had two ugly looking tiny bugs that have got into the LCD screen on different occasions and just can't get out. See picture.  Why no gasket (or maybe it failed).  I half expect to find a bat fly out if the tube pops out on the intake hose. The carbon filter that comes with this is a joke. I could buy some screen down at Home Depot to fix this I guess.  The lack of density of the material is such that I could see easily through it.  It seems to me that it doesn't have enough power for an appropriate carbon mat.  The  air conditioner works satisfactorily and will get my living room which is about 300 ft.\u00b2 down to about 70\u00b0. It's better than 90\u00b0.  I am going to return this and try another brand.

I bought this (top rated, most frequently reviewed) dual pipe (one exhaust, one intake) portable air conditioner to replace my previous single pipe (one exhaust) unit because I realized how incredibly inefficient the old single pipe unit was.Single pipe units 'rob' air from inside your house \/ room you are cooling and exhaust them outside. This causes hot air from outside to be sucked inside your house through any crack or crevice it can find because it creates a vacuum inside the house.Dual pipe units like this Whynter ARC-14S unit are supposed to negate this problem by intaking relatively cooler outside air through the intake pipe, blow it across heat coils, then exhaust the much hotter air back outside through the exhaust pipe. This is much more efficient than a single pipe unit (on paper).I owned this unit for 2 years before I noticed that when I have the Whynter unit off and my central AC on, hot air is constantly streaming in through the Whyter unit into my house. This is no different than opening a window and leaving it cracked a half inch.The reason this is happening is because they didn't create an airtight seal between the cold part of the unit and the hot part of the unit. Why would they do this? I have NO CLUE.

Luckily I bought this through Amazon Prime so the return was really easy.The room I was trying to cool is a well sealed 400 square foot living room with an average height ceiling.Here are the problems I have with this unit:1. It was damaged when it arrived. There was no damage to the outside shipping box but the unit itself had a bunch of scratches on the body and chunk of plastic missing from the bottom of the unit.2. This unit is huge... It's almost twice the size of my 12000 BTU DeLonghi unit and works no better. I inspected the inside of this unit and just as I suspected it full of empty space. They could have made this thing a lot smaller if they really wanted to.3. At 14000 BTU along with dual hoses (supposedly reduces bleeding air) it cooled no better than my 12000 BTU single hose DeLonghi unit I bought from Costco. I ran each unit for a day (same outdoor temp and relative humidity) and used an infrared thermometer throughout the day to test the ambient temps. The DeLonghi unit consistently kept the room cooler.4. The vent points straight up. I don't know why they thought this was a good idea, cool air is just being pushed into the same area over and over. It actually reduced my attic temp which is nice but I need it to cool my room.5. Cheap plastics are used. The plastic body near the vent had already started wrapping after half a day of use.6. Price is way too high for what this unit does and looks like. For $350 at Costco I got a 12000 BTU DeLonghi portable ac unit that's better in every way.Pros:1. It blows cold air. Not going to lie it blows nice and cold but as I mentioned above it blows in a single upwards direction. It's a waste.2. It's quite for a portable AC unit of it's size. I would say it's just as quite as the DeLonghi unit I've been comparing it to.3. The hoses fit well. A lot of portable AC units skimp on the hoses and the fitment is terrible.

I had also bought the warranty from Square Trade, so I contacted them and they said they can't do anything until the first year warranty is up.

Of course, once I investigated the reviews here on amazon, I saw all of the people who had the same problem that I did with the condenser not working anymore. The unit does still work - it just shuts off constantly as soon as the (small) tank fills up.

The air is not directional and only goes up, which is kind of a downer but considering the cold air ends up falling to the bottom of the room since its heavier than hot air makes is an efficient way of cooling. I've never had to drain the unit once in dehumidifying mode at even when at 70% humidity. It's not the best dehumidifier though, you can't set a percent humidity and the unit just cycles intermittently to remove humid air, and it doesn't remove all too much, maybe 10%. Best to just run it in A\/C mode.Please note! You need to let the unit sit for a while upright before using them so the refrigerant can drain down, otherwise issues may occur. Says this right in the front page of the manual. I let both of mine sit for 24hrs.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1587340800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Only Lasted A Year Before It Started to Mold...","reviewDescription":"I had it for about a year and that year that it lasted was some of the best AC my room had ever experienced! I have laptops and desktops going and so it would become a boiler in there. But when I got this thing? Absolutely chilly and icy, even when the Temps started hitting up to 120 F! Issues I had with it though? It is WAY too bulky for a small room. My room is a little more than twice the size of a standard closet, and it was a pain putting and an even bigger pain getting it out. It also developed a dirty sock smell after a year and despite me cleaning out the meshes and hoses, the smell persisted. I knew it wasn't good to be breathing that stuff in, so I've put it in the garage where I'll either pay for it to be cleaned professionally or have to toss it out. I have to say, it was the most expensive purchase I've made on something like this, and I was fairly disappointed that it didn't even last four years. Would I buy it again? No, I'm going to look for something smaller, even if it's not cheaper, and hopefully it doesn't mold right away...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691625600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Cooling Mode is different than it used to be! Sleep is not as peaceful now.","reviewDescription":"I purchased my second ARC-14S to add it to a new room in my house. The new unit functions differently than the old unit, when in cooling mode. On the old unit, when the desired temp was reached, it would turn off the compressor and switch to fan only mode. On the new unit, when the desired temp is reached, it will turn off both the compressor and the fan. Then about 15 minutes later, the fan kicks on for a few minutes to circulate the air. If you are relying on this as a white noise machine in your room at night, know that the new version is unreliable at best. I reached out to the manufacturer, who informed me that the new units are meant to work this way, and there is no way to change it. The manual I received still states that the fan should run when desired temp is reached, but the manufacturer stated they are working on updating this. Beware buying these if you like\/want the fan noise throughout the night.  Honestly, feels like a bait and switch by the company to make this change with no way to modify it.

{"reviewTitle":"Don't repeat my mistakes!!","reviewDescription":"Don't repeat my mistakes!!  I bought this AC in Feb. 2017.  *** My mistake:  buying and not running before the 2 month infant mortality clause kicked in and read the fine print of the warranty.  Warm weather arrives in June and by then the warranty (fine print) required that the product be returned at my expense to the Mnfr for repair.  So in add'n to the $458 purchase price an add'l $355 was invested for the unit to be checked out.  I called Whynter and was informed that I should file a claim and that future communication should be done thru email.  Various emails, thermometer purchases ensued before I was given an RA#.  The unit was returned damaged (bent) and tripped breakers and\/or cut off.  I switched the unit from a 15 amp to a 20 amp circuit (10.8 spec'd),  An electronic even (smoke\/auto shutdown) occurred.  Inadvertently a family member restarted it.  It has been running and cooling well for approx 30 hrs now???????None of my correspondence w\/ Whynter was technically based - - as in- the product should or should not perform in this or that way.  Further each call was seemingly a new occurrence with little evidence that the customer service rep had any record of my correspondence.  The product itself was recommended to me by a web research\/rating of portable AC's 2017.  I personally do not recommend Whynter as a choice and would suggest a better known mnfr whose customer service organization is more experienced.  I did buy a Square Trade 3 yr warranty and after one month and three tries am hopeful that I'll be reimbursed for the $350 shipping cost for the return\/repair,  Also of note is that Amazon problem resolution was not helpful.. Amazon's position was identical to the mnfr, Whynter. i.e. they, the mnfr, has ownership of the problem.  I had hoped that Amazon would at least take some interest in problem resolution from the viewpoint that one of their vendor's performance was questionable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1498608000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Poor Cool Output and Horrible Window kit","reviewDescription":"I live in a 750 sq foot apartment that was built in the 60's with oversized windows..  Living in Northern California, the older buildings aren't equipped with an air conditioning.  Apparently the developers didn't think we would get many warm days to warrant installing wall a\/c units.  I bought the Wyntner portable a\/c thinking it would help at least cool down my living\/dining room area as that seems to get most of the sun during the day and we are in for a much warmer summer this year.  Well, after spending 30 minutes installing the kit and putting an acrylic panel as the exhaust panel is too short for my 60\" long windows ony to have the exhaust tubes pop out of their holes because the darn screws are too short.  The plastic panel is so cheaply made that it is very easy to strip the holes when trying to tighten the screws in place.  I manage to get the screws to stay in place but just barely.After all that, I turn on the machine and it starts to output some light cool air.  I push the wrong button as I can't see which one is the fan and which is the cooler and the machine turns off the cooling feature.  I check the manual and try the cooling feature button but it won't turn on.  I have to turn off the machine and wait a few minutes and then turn it back on.  I went and checked the output and it is barely cool.  I have had the machine on for over an hour and it is only 4 degrees cooler in my living room area which is about 300 square feet.  This is a 14000 BTU machine and it is hardly cooling.  In my old apartment I had a 5000 BTU window a\/c unit that managed to cool a 600 square foot apartment down from 100 degrees to about 78 degrees wiith a 30 minute time frame.

{"reviewTitle":"like it had been stressed","reviewDescription":"I purchased this air conditioner to replace a much smaller window unit that I had for 5 years or so in our master bedroom. The AC arrived in the box with no visible damage. When I removed it from the box I noticed that the plastic around the cold air vent was discolored, like it had been stressed, and was close to breaking. I hooked everything up and used it for several days. After the first week the unit started to rattle when the compressor kicked on. After examining the unit I noticed that at several of the seams where the plastic panels met, the tabs were not inserted to hold the panels together with a tight fit. I examined all of the seams and tried to slide ever thing back in place as well as I could. When I powered on the unit again, it was still rattling when the compressor kicked on. I went through the manual which said to make sure the unit is on a level surface to lesson the noise. When I grabbed my level and tried to see if it was sitting level, I noticed that top of the unit was not square and had a slight curve to it, so that you could not set a level flat on top. I leveled the unit the best I could and still had the rattle when the compressor kicked on. I finally had to wrap the unit with three ratchet straps and tighten them until the rattling stopped. By this point I was outside my return policy (I did try and return it.)As the summer has started I have noticed that this unit does not cool nearly as effectively as my window unit. I knew that it would be less efficient at cooling when I bought it, but thought I had negated that issue by buying the unit that had three times as many BTUs as my previous AC.Overall I am disappointed with this AC's horrible build quality and sub par cooling ability.

{"reviewTitle":"Two hose system, but may not cool you down, and may trip your circuit, multiple times a day.","reviewDescription":"SUMMARY (final update 8\/17\/22):I recommend the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 instead.  You WILL thank me later.  With the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001, I can now turn off my other Whynter ARC-14S even on 90 degree days, unless it's around 100 degrees!  It's so cold on 90 degree days I have to turn it down or off in the mornings and evenings!Anyways, I purchased 3 of these Whynter ARC-14S units, so read my review carefully as I have more experience than most reviewers.  My first purchased in 2017 was good, and lasted me until 2022 when the fan started making a grinding noise.My second purchased in 2021 immediately started tripping the same circuit when I first tried it where my first unit wasn't having much problems.  After tripping the circuit, it goes into this mode where the compressor runs for 2.5 minutes with cold air, followed by the compressor off for 7 mins and blowing warm 75 degree+ air.  I had to swap my first unit back, which immediately began cooling the room.  The second unit doesn't blow cool air all the time.  It mostly does better on less hot days, but struggles on hot high 90s days, especially if humidity is over 60%.  In the evenings, sometimes even when the temperature outside goes down below 70 degrees, it was still struggling to keep the inside air under 77 degrees due to it blowing warm\/hot air, so then I have to shut it off completely and use a fan to blow air from the outside.  When it's working well, the compressor appears to be on most of the time.  When the compressor turns off, sometimes it blows 70 degree air for about 7 mins before the compressor kicks back in.  On some hot and humid days, it blows 75 degree warm air for 7 minutes while the compressor is off, basically warming up the place.  However, I keep this 2nd unit in my bedroom to help me sleep at night on warm nights so I've learned to deal with it.My third unit purchased in July 2022 showed the same symptoms as the second unit.  However, it runs the compressor for 3.5 minutes and then blows hot 84 degree+ air for 10 mins.  To be fair, it starts blowing 70 degree air after the compressor turns off and starts warming up to mid 80s after a few minutes.  This obviously causes the place to warm up and ambient temperature to go as high as 80 degrees (while the outside can sometimes be only 85 degrees, or sometimes even cooler).  Although, for one day, like a miracle, it kept the ambient temperature around 75 when the outside was 100 degrees. I noticed the compressor wasn't going on and off in that mode support claims is normal for that single day.  But that was only for 1 day.  After that, it couldn't keep our place cool, even if the outside air was only 80 degrees because it goes into the mode of 3.5 mins compressor on and 10 mins compressor off blowing hot air.  See images I posted.  As a workaround after thinking about this Whynter unit somehow detecting the ambient temperature or environment and behaving a certain way, I decided to loop a hose from the vent to the back where the air intake starts.  I was hoping to trick the AC into running the compressor longer.  This seems to mostly work.  Sometimes when doing this, the compressor stays on for 10 mins, and then hot air for 10 mins with compressor off.  To resolve this manually, I set a 10 min timer to turn on the AC for 10 mins with the compressor running cold air, and then turn it off manually for 10 mins.  Rinse and repeat.  Yeah, yeah I know this is annoying, but it seems to work better than only 3.5 mins of compressor on.Anyways, I couldn't live like this because that's still 10 mins of no AC, and manually having to dink around, so I returned this 3rd Whynter ARC-14S for a refund.  Amazon sent UPS to pick it up.  The shipping boxes were destroyed so I had to go to Home Depot to buy a 24x24x46 box, along with a sturdy chalkboard, which I had Home Depot cut into 23x23 to place at the bottom.  That cost me about $29 total.  I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this Whynter ARC-14S to anyone because 2 of the 3 I purchased blows warm or hot air intermittently, especially on warmer days when you need it most!  I've changed the stars down from 5 (for my first unit) to 1 (for the warm\/hot air my second and third units blow, heating up my place).I purchased the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 ( Item B09L15X5MD ), which is a dual hose system inside a single hose, to replace a Whynter ARC-S14 I returned to Amazon.  OOOOMMMMMGGGG.  It's like night and day, like going from an abusive relationship to a loving, mutual-respect, healthy relationship.  I can cook food on the stove and turn on the lights now during 100 degree days!!!  With the Whynter ARC-14S, I had to turn off all the lights, sit in the dark and heat because the Whynters (plural, two of them) couldn't cool the temps down, and only eat cold, easy to make food.  The DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 screams quality.  It's like a Mercedes vs a Ford.  It doesn't go into a mode of compressor on\/off blowing hot air like the Whynter ARC-14S.  It's constantly blowing cold air like those A\/Cs you find in good hotels.  In fact, the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 kept us so cold in the mornings and it evenings (even as it's 84 degrees at midnight right now), I had to turn it off or from 60 to 70 degrees.  Today, the outside temp is 98 and it kept us around 74 degrees all day (as opposed to the Whynter that usually struggles in the evening, raising our room temperature to 76 and as high as 80 sometimes).  In the evenings during hot (and sometimes only barely warm) days, the Whynter ARC-14S almost always goes into this 3.5 min compressor mode on, 10 min compressor mode off, blowing hot 80+ degrees air.  But, not the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 as it blows cold air non-stop.  My only regret is I didn't find the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 sooner.  It comes with a bar code to extend warranty to 30 months, with free shipping for repairs, etc.  I haven't scanned it yet though.  I'd recommend the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 over the Whynter ARC-14S any day.All those years and hours of sitting in the dark and heat, like primitive hunter-gatherers around the fireplace that I can never get back, while TWO Whynter ARC-14S units were running full blast, wasting electricity, where only this single DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 is able to do the job much, much, MUCH better, makes me sad-happy.  Sad for a wasted, suffering for nothing life all these years, and happy these insane days and nights are finally over.Having one Whynter ARC-14S off most of the time should save a lot of electricity, more than switching to Geico, and pay for itself in no time.DETAILS:I've had this unit for THREE+ years as of July, 2020 (purchased March 15, 2017).  It's the best portable A\/C unit I've owned.  I've owned 2 other units in the $300 range to compare.  I like that it's a two hose system so it's a little more efficient.  I did notice however, because of the way it sucks air in one and out the other, it'll allow insects and spiders into the home.  How I solved that was we bought some \"Earthwise Reusable Mesh Produce Bags\" from the local grocery store and simply put it around the outside of the hose (before plugging it into the circular holder piece), kinda like you would wear a sock.  That solved the problem.  No more spiders and stuff the second year around.UPDATE 7\/22\/2020:  This unit has finally started to show it's age.  This is the first year it's not kept us cool.  95 degrees outside and it's 80 degrees with this thing running full blast.  Before, it was keeping us at least 5-7 degrees cooler.  Going to see if I can troubleshoot it....UPDATE 7\/26\/2020:  I purchased a second unit (for lack of any good 2 hose units on the market at the time).  The second unit looks identical to the old one, with the old hose system fitting it perfectly.  To my surprise the new unit runs the compressor for about 2 mins and 30 seconds, and then shuts off, and runs at room temp air for about 7 mins before running the compressor again for 2 mins and 30 seconds and then shutting off again.  Reading the reviews, this appears to be \"normal\".  However, my old unit I purchased more than 3 years prior didn't behave this way.Differences:The exhaust on the old unit is really hot, meaning it's doing it's job.  In fact, it's so hot the exhaust can burn you.  Instead feeling room temp air after 2 mins and 30 seconds, I still feel cool air.  The exhaust on the new system is on the higher warm side.  The air is cold for 2 mins and 30 seconds, and then the compressor turns off and all I feel is room temp air for 7 mins.My room thermometer kept going up with the new unit, going to 82 degrees (100 degrees outside). I switched back to the old unit, and within 5 mins (the compressor is still running or whatever is happening, the cool air is still blowing), and the temp is now down to 79 degrees.  Within a few mins, the old unit cooled down the entire place because it isn't spending 7 mins doing jack squat. I know this because when it's turned off, there's ZERO AIR FLOW on the exhaust hose.While I recommended this unit years ago, now I cannot, without any good conscience, recommend anyone buying this unit because it will not cool you on a hot day.UPDATE 9\/16\/2020:Originally when I replaced the old unit with the new one, the new one tripped my circuit breakers within a few minutes.  I didn't think much about it, but I put the old unit back (and it worked w\/o tripping breakers), and moved the new unit into the bedroom.  I noticed after 1+ day of not using it, the new unit started behaving much better where it could actually cool the room.  I'm not sure why.However, fast forward to almost 2 months later, and my old unit started tripping the circuit breakers multiple times a day (originally starting when it was close to 100 degrees outside and now even when it's only 80 degrees... or in other words it's getting worse) where it had been sitting and working for 3+ years without issues.  This is with minimal power draw from anything else, perhaps 2-3 lights on only.  THEN... the new unit (which worked without tripping anything for almost 2 months) started tripping the circuit breakers on a totally different circuit.  AFTER the new unit tripped the breaker, I noticed it's back to that 2 mins and 30 seconds cold air, followed by 7 minutes of warmer than room temperature air.  I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT THEN, BUT I THINK TRIPPING THE CIRCUIT SOMEHOW \"BROKE\" THE NEW UNIT just like it did the first time I used it on the old unit's circuit.  It's been a few days now and the new unit is still \"broken\".  Worse, the old unit is now tripping the circuit even with EVERYTHING ELSE turned off (in sometimes as little as 15 mins after I reset the breaker), so we're like basically SITTING IN THE FRIGGEN DARK as evening comes and it'll trip the circuit.  I'm not sure if something electrical in my house is broken, or if it's the AC units themselves.  I've since disconnected both ACs and turned everything on and nothing's been tripped, so definitely the ACs are contributing.Note:  It's loud as heck, but you get used to it.  It's like a louder version of white noise at the office.UPDATE July 12, 2022: My first unit purchased 2017 finally starting to show its age with just cool (not cold) air coming out, and grinding noise when turned on for a few weeks now. Today it got so bad I turned it off and the grinding noise continued 30+ seconds until the entire fan unit came to a standstill.The second unit purchased 2 years prior is still doing great, very cold air, with no problems or electrical tripping of the circuit in our bedroom.  I suspect now the reason it had trouble initially was the first circuit couldn't provide the unit enough electricity, manifesting in it only working for 2 mins and 30 seconds, and then the compressor turns off and all I feel is warm, humid air for 7 mins.Also, in case I forget to note, this second unit turns itself off (most of the time) when the room gets cold.  It'll turn itself on when the room gets too warm beyond what I set the temperature.  The first unit just kept blowing the fan regardless of setting.  Good for when I need to keep the place cool while I leave for a few days.Update: early July, 2022:  I'll be purchasing a 3rd unit to replace the 5 year old 1st unit.Update:  July 20, 2022:  3rd unit arrived.  Upon turning it on, the compressor kicked in and it was cold for a few minutes.... until it tripped the circuit.  After tripping the circuit, it went into the mode of turning on the compressor for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, and then blowing a funky smelling nasty humid, slightly warm air for a good 9+ minutes or more before turning on the compressor for 3 minutes and 30 seconds again.  As a result, it did not cool the room as many have complained about.  My 2nd unit ran for 2 minutes and 30 seconds with the compressor while in this mode.  Anyways, I think my suspicions are confirmed.  If it trips the circuit, it goes into this mode where after the compressor runs for a few minutes and turns off, warm 80 degree F air gets blown out of the vent and heats up the place for 10+ minutes.  Anyways, I tested a different circuit using a heavy duty extension cable (not the weak type, but commercial type meant to handle the juice), and it did not trip that circuit.  If I unplug the power cable to the 3rd unit for a few minutes, it still kept it's 3 minutes and 30 seconds cycle, and in fact after starting it \"for the first time\" after plugging in the power, the compressor didn't come on.  I left it unplugged overnight.  After doing that, it was able to run the compressor upon powering it on for a few minutes before the compressor turned off.  I suspect this mode has to do with not having enough juice from the outlet.Having said that, the picture showing the 1250 Watts at 10.8 A is the 1st unit I bought in 2017.  It rarely tripped the circuit just by running, although did a few times during 100 degree days, but does so especially if we use lights and devices on that same circuit.The picture showing the 1300 Watts at 11.6A is the 3rd unit.  I don't have an image of the 2nd unit because it's currently against the corner of a wall and I don't want to go through the trouble of getting to the backside.  But as you can see, this is the typical problem with Amazon allowing sellers to simply switch products or update them.  They get to keep the reviews and Q\/A, which may no longer be valid to match their current products.  Some sellers go as far as switching products entirely so reviews are completely bogus.  Keep this in mind when you're reading reviews from 5+ years ago.  Most likely they are no longer valid.  Even my 2nd unit I purchased a year prior was running the compressor for 2.5 minutes while this 3rd unit runs if for 3.5 minutes.  I'll update the review once I can get the 3rd unit to run the compressor continuously.Update: July 25, 2022.  No go.  3rd unit still doing 3.5 mins AC compressor cold air (ice cold like my 2nd unit), but then 10+ minutes of room and then very warm air (mid 80s F air) and chemical smell.  2nd unit in comparison does 2.5 mins AC compressor cold air followed by close to 10 mins low 70s F air. Not good at all for this 3rd unit.  See images.  I have it now on a dedicated outlet and it's not tripping the outlet.Update August 15, 2022: I've decided to return the 3rd unit before my 30 days is expired. I bought a different brand dual hose AC and will update here with that one in a few days. I didn't have the original boxes so I had to buy a 24x24x46 shipping box from Home Depot, along with a strong quarter inch chalkboard was support for the bottom.  I had Home Depot cut it into 23x23 for me.  I secured the unit with light, hard foam from other stuff I've purchased over the years and taped the foam to the fridge sides of AC unit to secure it against all sides of the shipping box.  I also put a 2 inch thick soft but sturdy foam between the chalkboard and the wheels that coincidentally is exactly the size footprint of the AC unit.Amazon is supposedly sending UPS to pick it up but CS said they can't send anyone to pack it up for me (guessing due to size), so I had to pack it myself.Anyways, good news and bad news. Good news, this unit was able to keep the temp around 75 degrees F for most of the day when it was 101 degrees outside. I had to turn the unit on all night before and woke up to 69 degrees temps.  The compressor appeared to be on most of the time, and not giving me 85 degree warm air.  Very strange this intermittent working issue.  The bad news is we had 3 days in a row of 100 degrees so as the night temps remained around 70 degrees F outside all night, the ACs struggled and kept doing the 3.5 min cold + 10 min warm mode.  The second and third days, the morning was fine, but both ACs went back to the warm air mode, usually in the late afternoons.  It seems when there's higher humidity outside, they struggle more too.What's really bad is even after the days were only 85 degrees, the ACs sometimes go into this mode, much sooner than later afternoon.  The 3rd unit also did the warm air mode some nights, all night despite outside air being 60 degrees, so I had to just turn it off completely and open the windows instead to blow outside air in.I notice when it's cold, the unit works better (unless it's not working at all....), with the compressor not going off. However, sometimes the compressor goes off and the Whynter blows hot air, even when outside temps are in the mid 70s at night, so no exact rhyme or reason. I also noticed once the room temp goes above 76 or 77 degrees F, the 3rd AND 2nd units start going into this 2-3 min compressor cold mode and then 10 minutes of compressor off mode. The 2nd unit blows slightly cooler air during compressor off mode.  The irony is these units work well when the temp outside and inside is generally cold, but not so well when hot, exactly the opposite of what you need!  It's like a broken phone or car that works when you don't need it, but doesn't work when you absolutely need it to.I read something in the manual about depending on the room temp so I did a test be looping cold air from the AC back to the air filter suction area (see images).  This appeared to help the 3rd unit keep the compressor on for 10 mins before blowing hot air for 10 more minutes.  So I had to use a timer countdown to manually leave the AC on for 10 mins, and then shut it off manually for 10 mins so the AC unit would hopefully start the compressor again, and keep repeating this non-sense.  Very annoying, I know.  Otherwise it's 3.5 mins compressor followed by 10 mins warn air.  I timed all this down to the second so I'm not making this up.  If you open the air filter, you'll see something behind it.  I'm guessing that's the temp sensor.  I'm guessing it you can loop cold air back to that exact spot, you can trick the compressor to stay on longer.  But, the hot exhaust is next to it so it'll suck hot air in, which is a poor design and is the cause of this problem I'm guessing.  But, this is a pathetic workaround so I decided to return the unit.  Inconsistent results was very frustrating.  I bought a DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 to try.I had emailed Whynter support.  They are completely useless, use canned responses and didn't answer my questions. This is also a factor for returning the 3rd unit. I will not buy this AC again, or anything from Whynter.  As for my second unit, I'll see if looping back cold air directly to the temp sensor helps.  So far it keeps us cool at night in the bedroom, which is a good thing.  But it'll go into the slightly warm air mode too, just not as bad as the third unit.I'll update the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 unit in a few days.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"344 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1576195200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Failed Compressor: warranty refusal","reviewDescription":"Failed Compressor: warranty refusal-----------------------------------I bought one of these units and used it for less than a week while mycentral air conditioner was being repaired. The unit was able to coola small room and that was enough until the repair was completed. A yearlater at the beginning of summer I tested it and it still worked. Thisyear I tested it and it did not work. So, I emailed Whynter CustomerSupport and this is my account of what happened.Summary-----------Whynter refused to honor the three-year warranty on the compressor. Beforethat became obvious, Whynter Customer Support did every thing they could todelay, frustrate the process, and waste my time. Most of the questions andinstructions from Whynter Customer Support were virtually non-sensical,designed to obstruct, nearly absurd. This went on through many emails,many questions, including instructions for taking the machine apart for internalcleaning. I was able to get the machine about 90% apart for cleaning, but itwas very difficult. After that, Whynter support asked me to try the unit outin a larger room. The unit does not blow cold air and somehow moving it intoa larger room is going to fix it? Then they wanted a picture of the unit andits setup in the window. The unit does not blow any cool\/cold air at all.Adjustments to the window, the room, or the exhaust\/intake hoses are notgoing to change that. At that point I could see that Whynter is adishonorable outfit and they are not going to honor their warranty. Theyjust tried to waste my time until I went away. So I am posting this here. If youinitiate a support request for your Whynter machine, you are likely to gothrough something exactly the same or very similar.These are the saved emails in chronological order as best I can arrange:1) Original support request---------------------------Hello support@whynter.com,I have a Whynter ARC-14S portable air conditioner. The serial number is:I bought this Whynter ARC-14S from amazon. Amazon charged me for it on 1August 2020. I'd like to register a warranty\/support request. The user manualsays that the unit's compressor is under warranty for three years. I am stillas of today within that three year time frame.The problem is that the unit does not blow cold air. The fan runs but theunit is not cooling.Here is what I've checked so far:* filters are clean* air intake and exhaust are not obstructed* room temperature is about 81 F degrees* cooling mode is on* internal water reservoir is empty* unit's cooling temperature is set sufficiently low* time delay read out is 0:00hrThe unit does suck air in from the intake and it does blow air out theexhaust; however, no cold\/cool air comes out from the top and the air blownout the exhaust is not hot\/warm. When it was working properly, the air blownout the exhaust was hot\/warm. So, I'm guessing that the compressor is notactually turning on because the exhaust air is not hot\/warm.I have a second Whynter ARC-14S unit that is working properly, so I prettymuch know what it's like when the unit works properly. I have central airconditioning here at my home. I used this unit in a small bedroom in 2020for about a week when my central air conditioning unit needed repair. I didn'tuse it again, but I periodically tested it and now it has failed. My secondWhynter ARC-14S is a backup unit in case both my central air conditioner unitand the first Whynter ARC-14S fail.I think that this unit's compressor may have failed. Can you help? Please letme know what I must do to get the unit repaired.Thank you,---------------------------2) First Reply from Whynter---------------------------Thank you for contacting us about your Whynter ARC-14S portable airconditioner. We are sorry that your air conditioner is not cooling properly.Please let us know what temperature the air conditioner is set to, yourcurrent room temperature and the square footage of the room.Please make sure that the filter is clean and that the unit has been drainedof any collected condensation. Also ensure that the exhaust hose is as shortand straight as possible and that there are no bends or leaks in the hose(s)Please unplug the unit for 3 minutes to reset it; afterward, please provideus with the following information:1. Set the unit to COOL mode and to the lowest temperature.2. Confirm the compressor comes on after approximately 3 minutes.3. AFTER the compressor comes on, confirm that the unit is blowing cool airfrom the front air output vent and warm air out of the rear exhaust hose.4. If the unit is blowing air from the front and back, place a thermometerinside of the front air output vent and provide us with the temperaturereading after 15 minutes. *Note: The unit has a 5F temperature cushion whichwhen the unit achieves 5F within the set temperature, the compressor does notcome on so please make sure that your room temperature is above 67F. Thissaves energy and extends the life of the compressor.5. If no air is blowing from either the front air output vent or the exhaust,please inspect the fans for rotation and any visible damage. *Note: Theexhaust fan only operates when the compressor is running.If the compressor is coming on and the unit is cooling some, the evaporatorand condenser may need to be cleaned. Please use the attached instructions asa guide to open the housing of the unit for maintenance cleaning if you feelcomfortable doing so.You can vacuum the condenser and evaporator to clean and dust; please makesure that the fins are dry when vacuuming.You can also use an evaporator\/ condenser cleaner available at most hardwarestores for the condenser and evaporator, if they are really dirty.You can clean the base with a vinegar and water solution and draining.Please register your warranty by providing the following:A copy of your purchase invoice or 'Final Order Details' page if the itemwas purchased from Amazon.com.Please reply or refer to your case number if you have any questions.Thank you and stay safe!---------------------------3) My second email to Whynter---------------------------Hello Jose G.,I've attached a copy of my amazon purchase invoice for the Whynter ARC-14S,serial number XXXXXX.> Please let us know what temperature the air conditioner is set to,  70F> your current room temperature  81F> and the square footage of the room.  90 square feet> Please make sure that the filter is clean  OK, yes, it is clean.> and that the unit has been drained of any collected condensation.

{"reviewTitle":"Ugh...I had such high hopes. Would love to hear back from Wynter customer service.","reviewDescription":"Update: I had to send it back. Went to Lowes and got a lower BTU window unit. Easier install than getting the hoses set up in my windows with the Wynter. It did the job all summer. It will do, but I have to say, it does not blow air as cold or cool down the room as fast as the Wynter did.I did so much research before making this purchase. I learned way more than I ever wanted to know about portable and window ac units, amps the units pull, amps on a circuit, how to calculate amperage 2 hoses vs 1 hose, etc. This unit was rated highly, not only on Amazon but other websites and YouTube reviews.Long story short, I have the ac set up and running after way too many aggravating considerations, modifications and headaches. Good news is it cools my bedroom addition, that is not well insulated, beautifully. Larger footprint and sound are not an issue for me but it is pretty big and maybe 2x as loud as my air purifier? I like the white noise bc it is loud enough to drown out noises outside of the room,  but not so loud I can't get to sleep.Now, the long story and multiple headaches. First hooked it up, kept tripping the breaker. In all my research on the product, I missed that they suggest the unit go on a dedicated circuit. Idk about you but my house is not wired with a bunch of, at least 15 Amp circuits (unit needs 11. something, lets round up to 12 amps) that can be dedicated to one appliance. Doesn't that kind of cancel out or at best, severely limit the portability? So, my not soon enough to be ex husband (Headache number 1) comes over, switches out the breaker to a 20 Amp, turns the unit on, texts me and says it's cooling. Great!Totally worth the headache of having to ask him for help, right? Um, no. I get home and only the fan is on. Turn the ac on, flips the breaker.Meanwhile, my favorite uncle got wind of my issue and is straight freaking out bc just changing out the breaker is a fire hazard. The Headache is all, \"if you don't trust my electrician skills....\" Not really bruh. You didn't even know how to test the ac my dude. Back to YouTube trying to make sure I don't burn the house down. It most definitely is a fire hazard because a 15a breaker uses 14 guage wire and the 20a uses 12 guage. You can't trust that just bc the wire guage at the breaker is 12 that 12 guage was run all the way to the outlet. So, without my xray vision spectacles, I have no way to know w\/o ripping out walls or something. Hazard is because, if the various things plugged into that circuit go to pull more than 20 amps, any section ran and inspected for a 15 amp breaker could catch fire. Apparently, please dont take my word for it. Please consider consulting an actual electrician who probably doesn't want your house to burn down with you in it.Ok, what to do? Headache with his superior electrician skills, says only the bedroom is on that circuit. If I am not running anything else, it will be fine. Ok, make sure nothing else is running in the bedroom. Turn it back on flips the breaker and my son, in the room next to mine, yells out, \"are you doing something mom?\" Why? His whole pc gaming set up went off when the breaker tripped. Strike 2 for Headache's alleged \"electrician skills.\"What to do? Check outlets and discover 2 of the 3 in my son's room are on the same circut. Locate, purchase, pick up a surge protector with a cord long enough to run all the way across his room to the outlet not on my room's circuit. Get that all set up, try again. Ac runs a while, it's cooling, no breakers are tripping! Perfect time to enjoy a nap in my properly air conditioned room! Settle in, get comfy, about to doze off....ac cuts off. Bad words are said, throw the sheet back go to get up and notice, there is a red light blinking on the unit. Look it up in the manual. Don't I remember something about that being missing from the manual from a review I read? Yep. Not there. Google to the rescue points to the drain tank being full. Why would the drain tank be full on my self-evaporation, no drain needed PORTABLE AC? Back to the manual.2 possibilities, humidity is too high or loose wire. For humidity issue, disconnect intake hose from window frame so it is using air from the room, in my air conditioned, humidity controlled house. So, wait dual hose is better though, right? No time for that now. Drain the tank (not easy bc the drain is practically on the floor. And, I'm doing this by myself bc, remember,  Headache doesn't live here, I hate asking for his help and now he is all weird bc my questions have apparently insulted his \"electrician skills.\"). No worries. I am resourceful, find a collapsible bucket, tilt to drain. Try again. Not extremely humid in here, should be fine. No need to admit defeat to my makeshift, questionable electrician who wanted to know why I got that instead of a window unit and wondered how it drains (still appearing a bit cocky when I assured him I know condensers do whatever it is they do and water has to go somewhere but this unit is self-evaporating). Runs a while, turns off, red light flashing. Did this cycle with draining a few times...got old quick.Ok, not the humidity then. So, loose wire. Manual says contact customer service. Must be pretty common since it is in the troubleshooting guide. Reassured bc there is a warranty. I'll be hot flashing in a nice, cool, refreshing 68\u00b0 instead of 80\u00b0 in no time.Sent the email a week ago. No word yet as to what to do. Contact Amazon 3 days in, still in their 30 day return window but it took a hand truck to get in the house and the box is almost as tall as I am. Guess who I have to ask to help if I have to send this thing back? Yup, Headache to the rescue, full of smug, \"I told you so,\" no doubt. Amazon did offer 30% discount, if I keep as is, which doesn't impact the warranty. I elected to wait to see if iI hear back from Wynter.Meanwhile, said self-evaporation, portable, dual hose unit on casters, is atop a strong acrylic storage box I had, with a child's stepstool cramed against it that is somehow keeping it from rolling so I can keep the plug open to drain it and empty the water about every 2 hours.2 stars because it is running, cooling my room and Headache, the wanna be fire hazard creating electrician, doesn't know it is not evaporating properly...yet.Wynter, please email me.I will plan to update whatever inconvenience happens next. Cannot recommend as is and it pains me to say, but Headache may be right....the window unit may be the better option. At least it drains outside (I guess?).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689206400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Read the extra-long and older reviews!","reviewDescription":"I thought, \"How could I go wrong???\" with an AC with over 10k reviews and 4.5 stars?!I went wrong by not reading enough of the reviews, or enough of the older reviews, and by not looking through all of the images from reviews.When I unboxed this unit, it was immediately noticeable that something was very wrong with it. One side of the front panel was just open, like a mini-fridge door that's not shut all the way. I found photos (after the fact, of course) that look exactly like the unit I received, broken in the same place, and, in one of the photos, a man is holding the EXACT SAME piece of plastic that I fished out of the fan on the unit I received.The entire front panel of this unit does not fit. Like, it's not the correct panel for the unit and should be on a slightly smaller one, because it lines up fine on one side but is not wide enough to line up on the other side where the back panel is screwed into the front panel - those screws are visible on the broken side with the broken bits of plastic they were screwed into on the front panel still on them. It's more than obvious that the panel isn't the right size and yet the manufacturer\/assembler forced it anyway and this is the result.In addition to that, this is listed as a 14,000 BTU unit yet the ENERGYGUIDE sticker right on the front of the unit says 9,500 BTUs. So. Did someone stick the control panel for a 9,500 BTU onto the body of a 14,000 BTU unit? Is that why it very clearly doesn't fit? Who knows? From many, many other reviews, I gather nobody does and Whynter isn't very forthcoming with anything even close to resembling customer service, so...I am disabled and unable to do anything with this weirdo broken unit and Amazon has been kind enough to ship a replacement without requiring the return. Otherwise, I wouldn't be up a creek without a paddle, I'd be in the ER with heat stroke.After getting all of this dealt with, I actually hooked the unit up and turned it on (which is when I found the plastic part because it immediately started rattling and I shut it right back off) and... well... it cools, alright. I can say at least that much about it. Again, though, going from some of the other, older reviews, I suspect this unit is going to fail in the same way many of theirs did, and the issue could be mismatched components.Anyway, be wary and be ready to start the return process if you decide to buy one of these - unbox it very carefully and check it as well as you can without removing ALL of the packaging. That was my mistake. I work the night shift and sleep during the day and my apartment building was not built to stay cool, it was built to stay warm, and it really does! I only have 3 windows, all on one side and in 3 different rooms. I was so excited to finally not be a hot, sweaty mess every day that I got home from work at 7am and methodically opened everything, the window kit, all of it, to get ready, and THEN discovered the broken panel. Unboxing is one thing, and it was a really hard thing for me to do, but RE-boxing??? Uhuh, no way, I cannot do that without extreme pain and risk of further injury.So, thanks again, Amazon, for making this right for me.Whynter?

{"reviewTitle":"Requires more energy for less cool","reviewDescription":"At first glance, this looks like a mega beast of a portable AC. It looks quite posh with its digital screen and sleek curves. Don\u2019t let that fool you.  I got this to replace a one and a half year old 8000 BTU window unit from Medea. According to the specs, and even the reviews, this should\u2019ve been sufficient to cool an RV. Not only did it fail at this, it performed worse than the failing window unit it was replacing.  As you can see from the graph in the picture, this used quite a bit more energy than the old window unit. And that is saying something because the old window unit is an energy sucker. I thought because the main unit would be out of the sun and inside the cool RV, we would be saving energy on top of energy. Boy was I wrong.  Initially, I was horribly surprised by the size of the unit. But that is my fault because I didn\u2019t check exactly how big it was. It is a enormous. If it was hollow, I would have no problem fitting my 5\u20194 lady body into the unit. It is incredibly heavy, and if it didn\u2019t have wheels, there is no way you would wanna move this anywhere. It would definitely not be portable. I\u2019m questioning whether this is technically portable as it is with wheels.  The hoses are of substantial quality, and I was impressed by their heavy duty-ness. They bend any which way you need them to, and they are quite long. The portion included for attaching to a window is maddening. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to get an airtight seal with what\u2019s included. We used a portion of the Styrofoam that came in the packaging to seal this part to the window better. You\u2019re going to need a lot of duct tape, and even then this is not going to be a strong fit for any window.  I had this AC running in the same place the window unit was, under the same conditions, using exactly the same items as the days previous. There was absolutely nothing different about the days that I switched the AC\u2019s, besides, the AC itself being switched out. The outdoor temperature was also quite similar. Disclaimer: we live in the desert and it\u2019s currently 107. I do not have high hopes for any air conditioner under these conditions, so I took that heavily into account. I ran the old window unit on max cool, lowest temp, highest fan, which is what I put this unit on from moment one.  As you can see on the day that I plugged it in mid day, there was already an energy usage increase. The next day, when this AC unit was used solely for the entire day, you can see that there was another increase in energy usage. A substantial amount. Essentially I paid $400 more for a larger unit that takes up more space that is less efficient and doesn\u2019t cool as well.  I have no clue why this unit has such great ratings. Besides the fact that it looks nice, after you get over the sheer size, there is nothing to write home about. There are actually many things to complain about. I plan on returning this, which will be a feat in and of itself.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688083200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Poorly Designed","reviewDescription":"This unit is poorly designed for several reasons. First, the instructions warn you not to extend the hoses more than necessary. They say extension of greater than 9\" may affect functionality. I do not see how it would be possible to extend the hoses less than 9\" unless your unit is backed up directly against the wall, meaning this is not truly a portable AC. It is anchored to your window as much as a window unit.Second, the window panel is made for an enormous window. It consists of two overlapping pieces you extend to fit the window frame. Each piece is 20\" wide to fit the two hoses. At a minimum, they have to be extended to about 32\" to accommodate the hoses. The instructions say you may have to cut the other piece to make it fit. The instructions should say you will definitely have to cut the other piece (unless you have extremely wide windows). My window frame is 26\" so I just used duct tape to seal the remaining 6\". This is incredibly ugly. I wish the company had simply designed the window panel better since the unit is reliant on windows and can foresee great variability in window design.Speaking of, my third issue concerns the listing. It should emphasize how the air conditioning function of the unit relies on a window. It is shown in photos being used without being attached to a window, like when it is by the baby's crib in one photo or near the woman reading on the couch. This is misleading.Fourth, be prepared for the unit's size and weight. It is extremely heavy and bulky. It will not be easy to store or move.Fifth, it will not work with casement windows. It only works with sliding vertical or horizontal windows.TLDR: Overall, I think I have to return this and elect for window units that are better designed for actually using window frames. The listing does not properly advise you on how much this item relies on the design of your window. Ideal specifications needed in the windows in the space where you want to use the unit should be listed so you can decide if this is right for your space before buying. If you don't have a place to put it, it doesn't matter how well it works.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719619200000}
{"reviewTitle":"condensate overflow that drain won't handle","reviewDescription":"Slightly over a year ago, I purchased a Whynter ARC-14S after having read many good reviews.  I live in Northeast US.  Used for a couple months last year (starting in August) and it worked fine (I kept the air inlet inside the house for hopefully increased efficiency).  This year, I began using in June with higher dew points than last year.  About two weeks after the one-year warranty expired, the unit wouldn't start.  I replaced the filter and then thought to drain the unit, which I did outside but the unit is quite heavy and I am 76 with a bad back and some straight lifting was required, which was unpleasant but necessary.  On the path through the house, I noted puddles of water left along the way.  When outside, I unscrewed the cap, tipped the unit and saw water coming both from the drain and the adjacent entry point for the power cord.  I drained as best I could, returned the unit back inside and it worked sort of ok for a couple more days until it stopped again, this time with more water on the floor even though the drain cap was on.  I rolled it outside again, this time removing the outer shell (front and back) via about 15 screws (three different lengths) going into plastic threads.  I saw that the waffle-like base contains multiple chambers, each of which was filled with water, none of which seemed to communicate with adjacent chambers except by overflowing.  I tipped the unit on its side to remove all water I could see, reinstalled the casing and returned the unit inside.  This time I placed the full unit inside a high-walled black tub and left the drain cap open.  That particular day was quite humid and the unit seemed to run ok (about 6 hours) until I went to turn it off and noticed the floor somewhat damp and water \"spitting\" from the vent.  The next morning, the tub had about 1\" of water in the base (I had the AC unit on 2x4s).  I screwed the drain plug back on, lifted the unit from the tub, rolled it outside again (at one point, I built a wooden ramp to at least avoid the inside-to-outside lifting).  This time water again flowed from everywhere when I tipped the unit.The unit seems to work ok but requires draining (and lifting) every day.  This morning after leaving the plug installed, the bottom of the plastic tub had about 1\/2\" of water (that is, not coming from the drain) (so just leaving a tube connected to the drain and running it outside would still result in water overflowing inside the house).  I have been in contact with Whynter and they have provided some guidance but with the warranty conveniently expired, their compassion only extends so far.  They have advised that annual interior cleaning would help but I am quite skeptical of this after such a short operating history (and did not notice any obvious dirt or dust on the coils when the unit was disassembled).  I also believe that annual removal\/reinsertion of the aluminum screws into the plastic threads would eventually strip the threads.  Thus, I am left with having to drain the unit daily when in use as my back keeps getting more sore and I keep (for some reason) getting older.  My expectation is that I will pay our local trash man about $100 to haul this off in the spring.  But perhaps spending over $600 for a few months of cooling one room is considered a good value by some.The only \"good\" thing I can say about this unit is the help I've received from Whynter (albeit not really helping very much).  It will come as no surprise to anyone having read this far that I will not be purchasing another Whynter unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1629590400000}

The replacement unit arrived a couple of days ago and was defective out of the box.  The working machine is covered in a kind of clam shell wrapper with two pieces of plastic.  The seam on one side had an eight inch long and one inch deep compression on the front piece.  I could put my finger through the opening.  The machine did run, but since it vibrates that long break on the outer shell cannot last long until it begins to rattle itself open farther on the connecting seam.  I have never had the experience of buying two consecutive items where each one fails immediately.  Yet this product gets extremely high star ratings and \"most helpful\" positive reviews.Amazon is once again providing amazing return service and will send the original pickup team (not UPS) to get the unit off my second floor (100 pounds and fifteen steps).  I've ordered a Honeywell model instead and hoping they have better quality control.I did note that if I switched the type of reviews on the page from \"most helpful\" to \"most recent\" many reviewers noted the same problems I've experienced.  You might want to try viewing more recent, especially on manufactured products.Update on June 26.  The unit is defective (the fan doesn't run after the compressor shuts down) and Whynter told me to return it.  Amazon sold the unit and is providing it's great service.  I had to destroy the packing to get the appliance out of the box, but the return service will take the product, package it, and carry it away.  So even if you get a defective product, if you get it through Amazon, be assured they will handle the problem.Just got the 14S model of this portable A\/C unit.  The largest problem I've encountered with the unit is my age.  At 70 I am not as strong, flexible, or smart so the very easy installation process took me and my wife longer than expected.  Please read all the instructions.  Also.  It really matters (at least to me) the sequence you assemble the hoses and components.  Get the right sequence and installation is easier.I had two minor problems with the unit and emailed tech support and got clear solutions the next day.  That is a plus.  The unit is running now and working fine for its first operation.  Sound level is good to my ears, steady, surprisingly quiet for the work, and smooth.  It's a more pleasant kind of white noise.I replaced a great Honeywell unit that is no longer available.  After 8 years (!!!) of great function, it was starting to act old (the thermostat got weird).  I read external reviews on this Whytner unit which were positive across a ranger of consumer websites.I doubt you will find this review since as of June 2021 there are over 5,000 on Amazon.  Given the 4+ Star average rating, you will probably find the most negative reviews at the top of the page.  I'm sure some folks do have serious problems and sometimes the factory makes an error, but so far so good with this one.  And again, a lot of positive non Amazon consumer websites that do not appear to be \"sponsored\" reviews.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1624406400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Just say no.","reviewDescription":"I read a lot of the reviews here and was excited to find this unit. I decided after last summer this was the one to get. I put off my purchase till the end of February knowing summer was on the way. I felt if I waited any longer, the price would go back up. (It did.)I received the unit on March 6. Set up wasn't a problem. I immediately noticed the air isn't directional. It shoots straight up which was annoying, but I have box fans to move the air where I want it. The air was cool but not frigid like I hoped. I expected more ,but thought \"this will do.\"I'd used the unit intermittently without any real issues - until around a week ago. The unit began cool for the first minute or 2 and warmed up. This got progressively worse and now the unit is essentially useless. It moves a lot of air but it's HOT air.Ofcourse I did some trouble shooting. Hoses and filter were unobstructed, setting was correct, desired temp setting was where it needed to be, etc. All correct.My return time with Amazon had expired so I called the manufacturer. Customer service was very friendly and wanted to help by emailing trouble shooting tips etc. When I asked how long it was covered by warranty she told me the full warranty expired after 2 months. Now I have a \"limited warranty\" till a year after purchase. That ofcourse means money out of my pocket for shipping to and fro as well as whatever other bogus fee they make up.So to sum it up, I have a $400 paperweight that actually heats my house better then it cools it. Quality control is all over the place and they know it otherwise their warranty would last a lot longer then 2 months. A full 2 month warranty sounds absolutely ridiculous. Recent customer reviews also reflect a problem with quality control.Frankly, this is one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I do not recommend it. If you do decide to purchase this product do so with an extended warranty from the vender (If possible.) It got 1 star because I had to give it something to post a review.Give the Honeywell 12mn's a try.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"1,585 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1527724800000}

No solid answer as to why this issue occurs.My best guess at this point is that the coolant line has a pinhole leak that's slowly draining, or the coolant was not adequately filled in the first place. The radiator fins were bent and dented up on arrival too. Either poor manufacturing quality or a poorly refurbished unit resold as new.Either way, I'm annoyed and unimpressed.

It was frequently colder outside then inside, read it again... walking into my house that had AC running for 72 hours, it was colder outside.The biggest problem is air circulation, I think.  The vent on this thing is awful and just shoots cold air directly up above it, and without the good air circulation the cool air never works its way through the room.

{"reviewTitle":"Not as good in humid environments","reviewDescription":"Bought this as an emergency backup for power outages on the Texas Gulf coast.  It is large and heavy but has nice coasters on the bottom, so pushing it around our wooden floors was very easy.  No way this baby is going upstairs.  It blows cold, but since it draws air from outside the house the incoming air is pretty damp.  It's definitely better than nothing during a hot summer power outage.  Just something to keep in mind if you live in humid areas.  We ran it a few days in our bedroom after the power came back.  Humidity in the main part of the house with central ac was about 50%.  In the bedroom with this unit pumping in additional cold air (with hoses attached to window) the humidity was closer to 63% due to the moist air it was pulling from outdoors.  It does dehumidify (outdoor humidity that day was 80% due to a rain storm, so our bedroom was a little drier than outdoors) and probably works great in parts of the country with low humidity.  Dry climate would be ideal.  It's a little loud.  When the compressor is off it sounds like a fan.  When it kicks on its not terrible but it does have a rhythmic low droning that annoyed me at night.  One minor beef is that the drain plug is at the very bottom of the unit.  It's not difficult to reach, but the design seems to require you to tilt the unit to get all the water out.  At 80 lbs, its a bit of a chore.  Other than that, we store the unit in the closet.  Again, its an emergency backup and better than nothing.  Would probably work great in dry climates where humidity is not a problem.  Blows nice and cold and not too loud.  If you don't have to mess to often with the drain, this could be a good unit for you.  Not sure if I would buy it again, but all these portables will suffer from the same limitations due to the way they operate, and this one got good reviews by others.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1722297600000}

I'd want to use it for longer to really put it to the test. We've only used it a few times right now. However, the instructions for putting it together were not accurate at all. I eventually had to give up and just put it together myself. They gave me screws to use for the intake and exhaust hoses, but they literally were too short and effectively useless. The construction itself feels cheap. Like the actual working parts inside seem like they're in good condition, but the plastic that the air conditioner is made out of and the parts are pretty cheap compared to the other portable A\/Cs we have (Black and Decker and another brand). It also uses a lot of energy (but really all portable A\/Cs do, so not sure you can get around that). I do think having two hoses helps, because unfortunately due to the way our apartment is laid out, we need to have it in our kitchen which can get pretty hot, even though we try not to use the stove\/oven during the hottest of days. This definitely seems like it has an easier time cooling down the space, but since it's only been used a few times the jury is still out...stay tuned to see if I update this review, I guess, lol!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723939200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Read this review if you're on the fence. It does what its supposed to, but has some major drawbacks.","reviewDescription":"Setup is abysmal. Ive set up a number of portable AC units, and this setup sucks. Cutting right to the point, these are the issues I have with this machine in order of nuisance:1) The window insert is cumbersome, poorly designed, and leaks like a sieve. I had to position the unit vertically in my window, which may have been more difficult than a standard window, but it took me over two hours before I was done. I had to cut the window insert down to size (which the directions do list as a possibility) and that wasn't difficult. However, extensions that slide into the primary piece (the one containing the two vent holes) are narrower than the primary . This means that when the window is setup with the primary insert in the middle, any extension above and\/or below are narrower by 1\/8\" causing massive amounts of air leakage, and are actually large enough to let in some flies and mosquitoes.2) In relation to my previous point, the AC doesn't contain any weatherstripping, foam insulation - nothing other than the insert. My final setup ended up requiring me to place four wood shims - one to plug each gap - and then place duct tape around the perimeter of the window insert to both help hold it in place (because it wanted to wobble) and to seal the leaks.3) It doesn't have the cooling power of other 14k BTU 'portable' units. Im not comparing it to window units which cool much more efficiently. I used an infrared thermometer to check the air temp coming out, and even pointing straight into the core the lowest temp it registered was 52 degrees. Every AC unit that I've ever used, both window and portable and my car, pump out air cooled to between 34 to 40 degrees. Im guessing this has something to do with the \"eco-friendly\" coolant that they advertise.  In either case, while it did keep my 500sqft space relatively cool, it could never get my indoor temperature colder than 74 degrees, even running all day on high while set to its lowest setting of 61 degrees.4). The fan stays on all the time. There is no energy save mode, so instead of shutting off the fan like many units do, this one continues to run the fan and only shuts off the compressor. I can't attest to energy efficiency - I'll just say that sometimes its nice to have quiet when its cool enough.5) To use the dehumidifier setting, it directs you to remove the intake hose. It can use the fan setting by pulling indoor air through an air intake on the back of the machine (i.e.,  as a closed system without the use of hoses) but for some reason the directions require you to remove and cap off the intake hose before you can use that function. It does, to my surprise, come with caps designed to fit over the ports in the window for when you remove the hoses, however (and this is a big however) the hoses are surprisingly difficult to detach from both the back of the unit and from the window insert. You have to push down HARD and turn the hose in order to release the tabs holding it. If you just try to pull them off you could very easily break the tabs which are necessary to hold the hose in place. Further more, after my explanation of setting up the window insert, try to imagine using the same technique I just described to remove the hose from the insert. Two of my four shims fell out because there was so much movement as I tried to detach the hose.6) There are a couple of pieces that IMHO should be included, but instead are noted in the manual as available for retail purchase through the company. My main gripe is an intake air filter. This is a dual hose unit so one hose takes in air from outside but has no included filter except for the \"pre-filter\" and dust filter than every unit has. That means you can suck in pollen, bugs, or any other impurities that may be present where you live.7) I don't love that the air comes out of the top, but thats not terribly uncommon and my star rating doesn't reflect that. The AC that Ive replaced this with blows from the top too, but the air comes out much colder.PROs:1) It did cool there air enough to be tolerable, so if 75 is the coldest you ever set it then this shouldn't bother you.2). It is a very nice looking machine if you ignore the hoses (and the duct tape in my case). It has a sleek design, a very nice interface and LCD display, and it easily wheels around on floor or thinner carpeting.3). I have no doubt whatsoever that it is one of, if not the single most efficient portable AC units available. Dual hose units will always be more efficient than their single hose counterparts, plus this is manufactured in California which has much stricter efficiency requirements than the rest of the country.Bottom Line: I think this machine is probably well suited for a climate like California, where it is manufactured. If you live somewhere with mild winters, not many bugs and not especially humid, than this could be a great machine for you. Perfect if you are able to set it up and just leave it there year round. The hose caps are included so that if you store the machine during winter, you can just cap off the ports and not worry. Thats not an option for me in New England. Even if i sprayed foam insulation around the insert, its still just a piece of plastic.I really liked the idea of an energy efficient, dual hose, portable AC. In the end, however, I returned it and replaced it with a single hose 14k BTU. Im guessing it draws more energy to cool the house, but unlike this Whynter, it cools well, assembled quickly, and comes with everything you need for setup. If you're going to pay close to $500 for an AC unit, it should contain everything you need.One last thing I'll add, is that its super heavy - about 100 lbs, and trying to repackage everything to send back is no fun.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1437609600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Works great if outside under 90 but can't keep up when temps over 90","reviewDescription":"I bought this to cool a family room area and appreciated the dual inverter system. It worked fine to bring down temps when outside 90 or less and not too humid but when temps rise outside it can't keep up and maxed out unable to bring inside temp below 80 despite running non-stop.The issue is instead of recycling indoor air and  progressively reducing the temp, it is trying to cool down the outside air it constantly draws in without any benefit of air return. It's like trying to air condition the room with a window open.  Temps get over 100 in the summer here so I can imagine it is of no use when constantly trying to cool 100 degree air to below 80. I got so fed up I finally decided to disconnect the air intake hose and let it draw from inside air. What a difference that made.  Now instead of trying to air condition outside temps nonstop it is able to gradually bring down inside temps by cooling down air that reduces in temp as recycled. Just like a centeal ac system recycles inside air to progressively bring down temps, letting if draw from cooler inside air brings down temps faster and with less strain on unit.I would not recommend a dual hose system if you live in an area where temps get above 95 in summer. The dual inverter is nice to prevent water accumulation but the 2 hose system actually leads to inefficient cooling and non stop use trying g to reach a temp it can never achieve.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719360000000}

Central air A\/C, roof\/window mounted evaporative coolers, or window mounted refrigerant-based coolers will all outperform a portable unit - and possibly be more efficient. However - there are situations for which those options do not apply, and thus the Whynter ARC-14S.Home & climate information: I live in dry Colorado, so I haven't needed the drain hose. I've used the unit 5-10 times on days that have reached 90 - 102 degrees outside. The unit is in the living room of a single level ranch home, with two ceiling fans positioned at opposite ends of the floorplan. These two fans, running on low, provide good air circulation throughout. I also have a whole-house fan installed which I run overnight, and that I'm quite impressed with. You can read my review of that product here:Back to the Whynter ARC-14S. First - the bad:1. It's got to be tough to design a window mount for so many various sized\/constructed windows. That said - Whynter just gave up and shipped something that's about 50% effective. It works, but you have to add some material (foam, gorilla tape, whatever) to provide a seal around the borders of this thing so that when you shut the window - it keeps wind, water, and dirt from getting in. Disappointing.2. The remote. If I turn the unit on manually, the remote has no idea what the settings are. IE - the remote might think the fan is on when the A\/C is actually on. You have to cycle through the settings a bit to get the remote caught up. I never use the remote - it's a waste of time if you don't use it exclusively.3. The display temperature isn't consistent. If the fan is on, you'll get the ambient room temperature. If the A\/C is on, you'll get the \"target\" temperature instead. That's just a silly, inconsistent design that was likely never user-tested. I purchased a small portable digital thermometer which helps me assess room temperature.4. It's loud. Yes, I know others have mentioned this - but it bears repeating since the product claims \"quiet and efficient cooling\". It's the most obnoxious appliance I've ever owned.From my previous comments, you might be thinking I don't like the Whynter ARC-14S - that's not true. It's just that this unit is pretty rough around the edges; like a best-man showing up at the wedding in a tux, but unshaven, unkept hair, no cufflinks, crooked tie, scuffed shoes. Similarily, Whynter concentrated solely on cooling power and curbside appeal, hoping people would dismiss it's shortcomings. And shortcomings it has aplenty. All said, does it actually cool effectively?I have the ARC-14S in a 13' x 18' living room which has double french doors leading to a office. The living room has an open walkway to the kitchen and hallway that cannot be closed off. I generally run the living-room ceiling fan on low to circulate air during the day.Use #1: Cool the office. When it gets too warm, I turn on the ARC-14S. I use a freestandingto gently push air from my living room into the office. This method cools the office 5 degrees very quickly (30ish minutes), and further if I run the Whynter unit longer - though I generally prefer shorter cycles. An air circulator, something like the, will do a lot better at pushing air into those extra rooms.Use #2: Cool the living room only. For this, I close the double french doors to the office and turn on the ARC-14S. The unit cools my modest sized living room quite rapidly - providing a comfortable amount of cool air which is circulated around the living room by the ceiling fan.In pure cooling terms, it makes things comfortable on the warmest of days, and I'm happy with that aspect. However - it is finicky. If I'm home and can turn the unit on JUST AS the interior temperature starts climbing into uncomfortable levels, the unit cools quickly and adequately. However - if I return home after being gone all day, say at 5pm when the interior is very warm & stuffy, the ARC-14S struggles to cool things down. This is a pretty normal scenario for using the Whynter unit since it seems designed to cool-on-demand, vs. hold a room at a constant temperature. Take note:  the Whynter ARC-14S has never hit it's 61 degree target. After two solid hours of operation, set for 61, the air coming out was 65 - and the room was over 70. Information on sites like consumerreports.org support the observation that \"portable A\/C units fail to cool to advertised temperatures\" - so understand the compromises if you decide to take this path.For very limited scenarios (smaller rooms, good air circulation), I happen to think that the Whynter ARC-14S is a good option. It's a fraction of the cost of central air A\/C - though it performs at a much lower level. If you keep your cooling and energy efficiency expectations in check - the ARC-14S should work out well for you. Direct comparisons to window-mounted units will result in disappointment. While the ARC-14S cools my modestly sized living room and office well enough, I find it loud, brash, and too rough around the edges to merit more than three stars.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"34 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1374105600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Has a sour musty smell when not actively cooling","reviewDescription":"When it's cooling, this machine is great. The problem is, half the time it's not cooling.The instruction manual says it has a 5\u00b0 \"cushion zone\", and within 5\u00b0 of your desired temperature, the compressor will turn off and it will be fan only.This means if you want to set it to 61 (the coolest setting), it'll actually only go to 66, at which point the compressor will turn off. When the compressor turns off, that's when the sour musty smell begins.My first thought was mold or bacterial growth, but I just received this unit literally yesterday. It has been less than 24 hours since using it, and whenever the unit isn't actively cooling with the compressor on, the fan emits a sour musty smell.This wouldn't be a problem if the unit would turn off the fan when it wasn't actively cooling, but that's not an option. The fan stays on all the time.This also wouldn't be a problem if it didn't have that stupid 5\u00b0 cushion zone, and it actually cooled down to 61. When you have a large room, you need to set the temperature low so the opposite end of the room still gets cool.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719100800000}

As I looked on Amazon the Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air Conditioner as a lot less, now it is listed a lot more and I would not have purchased it the new price!The Whynter has designs flaws, more so as it looks a lot like the  Haier, the air does not come straight out rather mostly straight up.  One can tape it so most, not all, of the air comes straight out, which is the major issue.  A small yet \"personal peeve\" the  Whynter only shows what you set the temp to be not what the temp really is whereas the Haier does both.The Haier is a little larger yet the hoses are higher up so the reach to the window is less giving more space than the Whynter, again a small issue yet causes issues with high windows.  There are 9 foot extensions vs the 5 foot that come with both models, just more cost and is not listed as a possible issue and one would not know until it was being setup.Having now had both brands the Whynter is a 1\/2 a star (1\/2 a star for 5 ft hoses and very poor manual instructions) whereas the Haier is a 4.5 star (1\/2 a star for 5 ft hoses and very poor manual instructions).What many folks write about is why use the intake right below the extreme hot exhaust, and\/or why bring in hot outside air, so many suggest not using the air intake.Very hard for a normal person to know the \"Best\" way to use the system, both from a cost as well as a cooling perspective.Lastly, the plastic window holder that goes in the window is very poor, I made one out of plywood (3\/4 fits my window groves) which has worked great!I agree with the other reviewer that had to tape a box to get the air to flow out vs up.  Also the Haier-CPN14XC9 shows both the current temp and the temp you set it to, while this one only show what you set the temp to.  It is a little smaller so the tubes do not reach up as far as the Haier-CPN14XC9, all-in-all I would purchase the Haier-CPN14XC9 (Costco has it currently for the same price as the Whynter after taxes as it is $549.00 at Amazon and $399 plus tax at Costco).

{"reviewTitle":"Huge, Heavy, not recommended - read on","reviewDescription":"Was really looking forward to finally having a decent A\/C unit for the handful of days where it becomes unbearable hot at night here in the PNW. Nothing but problems.Firstly I just can't get this to run on a standard 15A GFCI socket because of the current load. I will say that it's more likely our breaker at fault than the A\/C because when I measured the A\/C load of the ARC-14S it was within spec, but just be aware that unless you have a dedicated feed available and\/or a 20A circuit, this may expose any weakness in your breakers.Next the hoses fit really badly. On the unit itself, they are almost impossible to get off whereas at the window adapter, they fall off if anyone so much as breathes near it. The design is somewhat sub-optimal - on the unit the catches you would press to make the hoses easy to release are sadly obscured by the back cover.It's way louder than any A\/C we've ever had. Just bear that in mind. It does a good job of cooling though and that is after all the point of it.I would forgive absolutely all of that (we actually have it wired in to a 20A socket on the outside of the house) but what I can't forgive is that after 3 days of use, totaling maybe 6 hours of cooling, it dumped about a pint of water all over an expensive wooden floor and kept on running. To add insult to injury, actually trying to empty the water bucket is ... a challenge, instead of being able to easily remove the bucket and carry outside, there's a tiny port right at the bottom of the machine you have to open - well OK, but being so close to the ground (maybe 1 inch) you can't actually fit anything underneath that can cope with the amount of water that could come out.Maybe there are circumstances where none of this matters - for example if you can permanently hook it up to a drain hose or have a convenient floor level drain, but I regret buying this and am trying to return it after just 2 months in the house and about 3 days of use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658448000000}
{"reviewTitle":"It's a fan at best.","reviewDescription":"Ordered this unit because our 12,000 btu unit of a different brand leaked horribly last year. It gets really hot and humid in our apartment and it's not unusual if its up to 10 degrees hotter inside then out. We have all windows shut and locked, with this A\/C, so far it cools the living room down. However, I thought it was set to dehumify since it's humid inside, it was actually set to cool. So set on 61, on cool, and with fan set to high, it just cools down our living room area a few degrees. It's only gotten up to 80 degrees outside and in and I can't imagine this unit working for actual summer temperatures. Our 3 year old 12,000btu still blew freezing cold air even though we noticed a decline in efficiency. If I were running it now, it would of been under 70 degrees and it even cooled down our stairs and upstairs hallway. This new unit can get the room to 70-72 depending on the temperature, but our old one was capable of getting to those temperatures in 90+ degree temps.I went through the reviews and thought it would be ok for our living room that's maybe up to 300 square feet. I should have listened to all the negative reviews instead.Pros: 1) It looks nice  2) Sturdy window insulation  3) Nice packagingCons: 1) Does not cool room effectively  2) Remote doesn't change temperature or mode. Only worked for fan speed a couple of times. It's useless.  3) loud, but it's expected.  4) with 2 window tubes it's harder to move into a tighter position. Needs more set up space  5) cannot change aim of airflow unless you move the whole unit.I would NOT recommend buying this Air Conditioner.Edit: it's currently 73 degrees outside, 76 inside and the ac has been running for nearly 12 hours now. It's been set for 61 degrees on cool with the highest fan speed. I also noticed the fan speed doesn't seem that fast for a high setting.

{"reviewTitle":"Not Happy with this Unit","reviewDescription":"Today at 2:50 PMI purchased the Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air Conditioner (ARC-14S) to replace an old 8000 BTU window unit.  Based on the 599 customer reviews and with Amazon touting this as the best-selling portable AC unit, how could anything possibly go wrong?  After the quick installation was finished I turned on the unit and set it to 720 .  The room was a toasty 850 since it was hot all day.  As the unit came to life I attempted to change the fan speed since it was running at max and was very noisy.  The unit is advertised as having a 3 speed fan.  Much to my surprise I find out in the manual that the 3 speed fan is only available after the compressor reaches the set temperature.  My small (14\u2019 x 14\u2019) living room has a door that can be closed.  I sat patiently waiting for the 14,000 BTU\u2019s to start icing down the room.  After 15 minutes of waiting patiently and seeing no change to the room temp I walked over to the unit to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything during the installation.  The unit was blowing cool air.  I had expected a blast of Artic air since as you may remember this is a 14,000 BTU unit.  I reread the manual to make sure I hadn\u2019t missed an important detail in the manual.  No nothing wrong here.  I planned on just being patient.  After about 30 minutes of noisy blowing the temp went down a degree and I figured I was on my way to an icy evening.  I raised the temp higher just to see if the compressor would kick off and the fan would remain on.  This happened just as advertised and I was able to slow the fan speed down to minimum.  Now I decreased the temp and again the fan speed went to noisy max as the compressor kicked on.  After a few noisy hours the temp slowly began to fall.  According to the manual there is a 5 degree differential for where the unit kicks on and off.  This seems to be a rather large gap.  After playing patiently with this unit for more than a few days I have decided to return the unit and reinstall my old quiet 8,000 BTU window unit and get some rest.  I have been fooled again.  Don\u2019t be fooled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this AC Unit.

The document was a \u201chow to\u201d for the buyer to actually take off the back encasement and check wires to see what may be loose etc. In reading the warranty it clearly states any tampering or unauthorized persons taking apart the unit will void the warrant.

I live in the Sierra Foothill region of California where it reaches well over 100 degrees every day and we have massive wildfires in the summer which leads to smokey air. I am currently using this unit to cool down my living room and kitchen area which is approximately 750 square feet. The space is too big for this unit and during the heat of the day, I cannot get the room temperature below 80 degrees (with the unit set to 61 all day)especially not without ceiling fans. I do not recommend buying this product unless the room is 500 square feet or smaller and you have ceiling fans. In addition to the ac unit, I had to purchase a Honeywell Tower fan to circulate the air in the kitchen. We also learned that if there is a wildfire in the area,generating smokey air, you will have to remove the intake hose and cap it at the window and leave it open to suck air in from the room, and not from outside. I live in the county of Mariposa where we were evacuated from the massive Detwiler fire. When we returned home and turned on the ac unit, it sucked in the smokey air from outside and made my house smell like an ash tray. I called customer service and they advised me to remove the intake hose and cap it at the window. It still smelt a little smokey in the house, but wasn't as bad as before. If I had to make my decision over again, I would have bought the LG 15,000 BTU Window unit instead. On the positive note, I think this unit would be great if it was in a smaller room with lower ceilings and fans. It's not too loud and was really easy to set up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1501718400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Some DIY tweaks definitely needed to overcome cheap materials","reviewDescription":"I received my unit yesterday.  I'm using it to cool my living-room\/kitchen until I get a new HVAC system for downstairs.  The unit gets nice and cool.  I've been running it on the highest fan setting at 69 degrees.  The fan is definitely loud at this setting but no more than a powerful fan.  The plastic exhaust hose is hot to the touch so I switched to insulated expandable ducts.  I'm using the supplied window vent unit so I'm probably sucking the hot air right back in.My rating is related to secondary product materials.  (1)  The instruction manual seems to have been written by a minimalist--very lean on details.  It mentions the drain plug but does not offer any further information on how to drain the unit if  needed.  I live in a very humid climate so I would not be surprised if I had to manually drain it.  (2)  The \"fixtures\" (I'd call them grates or hose connector clips) have 4 holes each, but I received only 4 screws in all.  The screws were inadequate and they easily fell out when the window slider was moved.  I've replaced them with longer screws and nuts.  (3)  The manufacturer made no effort to make the \"window slider\" energy efficient.  The fixture screws were screwed into the slider, leaving small holes once removed.  There were extraneous holes in the slider that I sealed when I sealed the gap between the fixture and the window slider.  (4)  The window slider needs to have move room above and below the hose connectors.  I had to add some styrofoam to raise the bottom edge of the hose connector to the window stool height.I will probably end up making a custom window slider to move the intake\/exhaust hoses further apart.Except for the annoyingly cheap screws and window slider, I am happy with my purchase so far.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1529625600000}
{"reviewTitle":"infuriating to connect the hoses","reviewDescription":"the unit does a great job of cooling and dehumidifying. I bought it because it was the most energy efficient unit available.  However connecting the hoses to the unit and to the window intake\/exhaust is infuriating.  One has to \"screw\" the 5 inch diameter hoses into the sleeves, which then have to be forcefully pushed into the window or unit mounts at which point the hoses pop off the sleeves. One needs a decent amount of hand strength to pop the sleeves into the unit\/window mount.  When its finally set up, if one moves the unit even a few inches  or if i shorten\/lengthen the hoses, it puts pressure on the hoses and they pop off the sleeves. I have to spend time most days trying to reconnect the hoses.  It just needs a different design to connect the hoses more securely and easily and i would rate it much higher.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690329600000}

That said, you can be up and running if you have caulk and insulating tape.  Tape on the long surface edges of the window unit itself, and caulk for the hose junction.  This would be a 5 star if not for the absolute kindergarden level of this kit.  I am very tempted to see if I could 3d print the proper fixture as this isn't that complex.  Just may need to do several pieces (9\" print area, 33\" window)The AC unit itself seems to be moderately well built -- better than expected for the money.  All the electronic features do as they should.  Depending on the humidity on average in your area, you may need to invest in a manual drain solution.  The manual has the details.  But if you are in a stupid humid area, it may not be able to exhaust it all.  I would have to ask around on the capable volumes (100 Liters\/day) & whether its an issue in my area (not likely).  Milwaukee, WI is not a dry area, but not the most humid either.Although I got a rather beat up packageright off the UPS truck, the important bits were all mint.  So props to the packaging guys, finally someone that can deliver something fragile in one piece :DFollowing just the manual, it took me about 45m to setup, including digging up tools to cut the plastic down, and caulk, caulk gun, tape, and tape measure.  Easy, as the only other thing needed was a philips screwdriver to mount the exhaust linkage ports to the window kit.

Delivered fast and shipping was free.  Impressed with packaging.  Simple to set up.  Now.  I'm sitting in my family room waiting for a couple hours for it to cool down.  It was 79 degrees outside today.  After a couple hours it is still that temperature inside.  Sun has already gone down.  Google says it is now 72 outside.  So after waiting with no cooling inside,  I open a couple windows and turn on a couple box fans.  Less than 10 minutes later the place is cooled off.Bummer.  I was hoping the over $500 spent on the portable a\/c (incl tax) would work better than two $20 fans.  I plan on trying this earlier in the day tomorrow before the heat gets through the walls.  I hope I can improve my rating........DAY-2Update.  Pretty much same temperature outside and inside today as it was yesterday.  Family room was 80 degrees by noon. AccuWeather listed 78 today.  But with sun coming in windows and heating up the walls, it actually ends up warmer inside than out.  So, curtains closed, nice and shady, I turned on the A\/C and set it to 75 to see what it could do running full blast.  In about 90 minutes, it had lowered room temperature to 79.  And that's where it stayed all day, till a little after 5pm when I gave up.  Same as yesterday, I turned off A\/C, opened windows, turned on the two old box fans.  In just a few minutes, the temperature in the room dropped to 77.  That is the temperature it was outside at the time.So this A\/C unit apparently can't cool down a 400 sq ft room more than 1 degree cooler than the temperature it would be with no cooling at all.  Yes.  The walls and ceiling are insulated.  And the windows have double-pane glass.  I am disappointed because I really wanted this A\/C unit to work as expected because this summer is going to be a really hot one (So. Calif).DAY-3Debating if this A\/C is worth keeping.  Light gray coloring around front corners of top vent.  Like stress.  No problem, I guess.  Plastic doesn't seem to align on top right.  No biggie, I guess.  Moved A\/C unit into master bedroom.  It's half the size of the family room at 206 sq ft.- 3:20pm.  77 in bedroom.  AccuWeather says 70 outside.  Normally all I would do is open a window and turn ceiling fan on.  Instead, left the room all closed up, doors and windows and curtains, turned on A\/C full blast, set to 68.  Just me, my laptop, and one light on in the bedroom as I watch the temperature.- 3:45pm.  Temp in room dropped 3 degrees to 74. Not that it's important with the room all closed up, but AccuWeather says it is 69 outside.- 4:15pm.  Bedroom temp at 72.  BTW it's 80 in family room (all closed up) and 78 in living room (one fan in window) and still 69 outside.- 5:15pm.  Bedroom is 71.  Nice. But not going to get to 68.  All other temps in house and outside are the same.  Shut A\/C off.  Opened the curtain and window.  Turned ceiling fan on full blast.- 5:45pm.  Using only ceiling fan and one window open, the temp is 72.  Hmm.  The A\/C unit at least beat that by 1 degree.  But that is not making me happy at all.My thoughts on the A\/C unit from today?  It is ALMOST powerful enough for a 200 sq ft bedroom but not for the size room advertised.  It is way too large and noisy to be used in the bedroom.DAY-4 left unit turned off.  read other reviews looking for any hope.  gave up.  drained it.  packed it up.  setup return.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1400371200000}

Do your research.","reviewDescription":"Important notes:-No it is NOT an equal replace of an air conditioner (e.g. window units).-\"Portable\" simply means you can move the unit around from room to room.  Nothing else.-Know the dimension of the room you are cooling.  This is very critical as results will differ.-Portable AC still requires venting so it needs to be by a window.-Compare your cost to cost ratio.  It maybe more expensive to buy a portable AC then it is to replace your existing unit.Portable AC units does NOT replace an air conditioner such as window units and are inferior in every way except for portability (which is what you are paying for).  You should be careful and know what you are getting when you buy a Portable AC.  Despite the high BTUs it does not (and will not) give you desired results you would expect regardless of what companies state.  Do not buy this thinking it be the same as walking into a friend\/family's place with ac (assuming they have a window unit or central air conditioning) as you would be deeply disappointed.Then why so many high positive reviews?You must understand that although it fails to give similar results compare to other types of AC it however STILL cools down a room.  If it's 90 degrees out, a room that's 80 degrees with a portable AC on (set on the coolest option possible, which is 62 degrees) is still far better then living in a hot room.  Therefor companies, such as Whynter, have done no wrong as the products they make still does what it was built to do.  That is why they can get away with what they are doing as they haven't lied, but simply meant it in a different way and can count on consumers to simply accept it, as a room with some AC capability is better then no AC.What you need to know.It cools down your room to \"livable conditions\" but will not give you a chill.  I've tested the unit in big and small rooms with accordance to Whynter's compatible room chart.  The unit takes a long time to cool a room down despite the 62 degree thermostatic control you can set it at.  So it is crucial that you know the dimension of the room you are trying to cool down.  What I get from reading many people's reviews is that they typically cool down a small bedroom which, of course, if your using a 14,000 BTU unit it will get the job done.  But if your trying it on the biggest possible room (500 sq ft.) or more it will suffer.  The fan in these units are weak and I suggest you use another fan along side this unit to help circulate the air to get better and faster results.  I've read a tip that if you pair up an \"air cooler\" that it helps the portable AC unit.  I've done this and it does help but that's an extra $100-200 of additional expense.On a 90 degree day at around noon I've tested on a roughly 550 sq ft. room and it takes 2+ hours to chill about 5-7 degrees at max and final room temp at 85.  On a room about 300-330 sq ft. room and it took 1 hour to chill 8-10 degrees and final room temp was at 82.  Note that these room's temp would not drop any further no matter how long I run the AC.

{"reviewTitle":"... review in that I do not think Whynter makes bad products, although every manufacturer has designs that are ...","reviewDescription":"Let me preface this review in that I do not think Whynter makes bad products, although every manufacturer has designs that are better than others. I bought this unit and ARC-110WD, a 11k btu model in one purchase. The 11k model has done a fantastic job, and to be honest, it cooled circles around this 14k model. Blew it out of the water.When I unpacked  this AC, the first thing noticed was that the fit and finish was terrible. The chassis is a lower grade blow molded plastic and it seems like some of the various sections were forced together, as there was evidence of distress in the plastic. The louvered vent at the top also did not move smoothly in addition to being unevenly mated to the chassis. Not a good first impression.I was willing to forgive all the cosmetic discrepancies as long as it did its job as intended. Well, it did not get high marks in that regard either. First off, the thing is LOUD; numerous rattles and the chassis vibrates excessively. Much experimenting was tried to quiet the thing down, and eventually shimming up 2 of the wheels so it actually sat slightly unevenly and the use of a towel under the unit got the vibrations down to some semblance of tolerable.On to the next problem: The location of the condensate drain. To be frank, its completely asinine, being like 2 inches off the floor. Now this machine supposedly utilizes evaporation of the condensate to aid in cooling, but if it is even slightly humid, then don't expect this machine to keep up, because it won't. Be ready to just make a mess draining it, since a cookie sheet is what you need to drain this thing and carrying a cookie sheet of water = complete failure. After a few times of mopping up water with bath towels, the final solution was to put it on a beater night stand I had, with the towel under it and some spring clamps to chock the wheels so the POS didn't vibrate itself off the night stand. I yanked out the plug, inserted some clear tubing into the drain bung and let it drain into a HVAC condensate pump I got at Lowes. I drilled a hole in the window vent backer plate for the tube and the pump would dump the water outside.The biggest insult was that it cooled like garbage. It DID cool, but the 11k seemed like it was shooting out penguins and sno-cones while this loser just traded 100 decibels of noise per hour to cool the place down a degree. The 14k had to cool off only 100 more square feet than the 11k but it struggled and it never seemed like it was blowing cold air. Cool, yes, but not cold.Final Verdict: This machine is probably where Whynter learned what to not do or it was just a rebrand until they found some better outsource. Maybe it is not even their design, as it is also sold under the name of Edgestar and Royal Sovereign. This unit is not a total pile, but it is enough of a pile to the point where I decided to replace it and try to sell it on Craigslist. No one would buy it after seeing it in action, so off to the dump it goes since I don't have time to waste entertaining people just to tell me now because they can see the obvious that its a POS. Maybe I just got a dud and everyone else has had good luck, since most everything is hit or miss unless you want to plunk down some serious cash.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1461456000000}

I'm quite disappointed. We are in the second day of a five day heat wave (the second already this summer) and my little two room apartment does not feel cool and dry at all.  I have it properly sized for the square-footage of the apartment, properly installed in a casement window which I retrofitted quite snuggly, and--since I discovered in the manual provided that it is optional--I've removed the intake hose.  I have a separate fan on it's highest setting to move the air from the small bedroom in which the AC is installed into the small living area where I spend most of my days.  Even at the lowest setting of 61 degrees and with the fan on high, my apartment is still 80 degrees and the humidity is in the 60's.The condenser runs constantly even if I set the temp to a more reasonable (and hoped for) 72 degrees and the fan on low.  To top it off, the unit is loud and the condenser has a low, pulsing sound to it that makes sleeping with it on difficult.The unit is quite large and quite heavy and the icons for the control buttons on the unit are etched in the buttons and are the same color as the buttons.  So, I have to put on glasses and turn on a bright light to locate and use the correct buttons.  What's the problem with prominent labeling?I'm supposed to rate the energy efficiency of the unit.  I have no idea since it will be a month before I can see my electric bill.  But, given the fact that the condenser never ceases to run, I'm expecting a high bill.  I'm also supposed to rate the remote control.  Frankly, I found it confusing to use so I don't use it.And finally, because the unit doesn't work all that well at reducing humidity, some water condenses on the unit surface next to the conditioned (cold) air vent.  I keep having to towel it off.It's not 98 degrees in my apartment with a dew point of 73, but almost $600 is lot to pay for something that \"kind of works a little bit.\"TWO MONTHS LATER:  Aside from the fact that this unit doesn't cool as hoped, once again I want to point out that the noise from the condenser is extremely annoying.  It puts out a fast, pulsing, rhythmic noise that eats into one's psyche like a dripping faucet.  It is loud and constant and maddening.

I was immensely excited to finally receive the much praised, rave-reviewed Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air Conditioner (ARC-14S) just before the summer heat season began, but was left with such dissatisfaction that I didn't mind packing it all up, carrying it into my car, and make the trip to a UPS Drop-Off just to get it out of my sight.I'll make this brief and to the point:-*- It arrived sooner than expected via free shipping (thanks to Amazon.com!)-*- Well packaged and sealed!-*- Markings and scratches on plastic casing (seemed a bit odd since I bought a NEW unit, but didn't want to feel like I was being too picky)-*- Louder than expected (not even large, bulky window AC units are as loud as this portable unit I had, even while standing on carpet, not hardwood floor)-*- DID NOT COOL! I carefully read the instructions, multiple times, and gave it a solid try about 10 times throughout the week it was in my possession. It cooled for a few moments (~3 minutes), and then it started blowing hot air out! Both hoses were properly installed on the unit itself and out the window with the mount just as instructed, so I was confused as to why it could be blowing out cool air in order to cool the room, but then a few moments later push heated air back out through the same front-facing vent. Looked online for help, read through the manual (again & again) and still no luck in figuring out what was wrong. Took a look with a flashlight inside the unit through the back exhausts where the hoses attach and I did notice a few parts looked dented and not in \"new\" condition. Again, this seemed odd because despite the scuffs and scratches on the casing of the unit, there weren't any dents, so I didn't understand how the internals could have been dented themselves if the whole package was neatly sealed when it arrived to my home.After getting a reading of the temperature of a completely sealed bedroom where the unit had been running on cooling mode at 65 degrees for a little over an hour, it was in fact 2 degrees hotter (76 degrees) than before we turned the unit on and closed the one window (proof that my unit was in fact slowly but surely heating up the room when again this was the ARC-14S model, not the ARC-14SH model that had an additional heating option). My family and I concluded that this may have been in fact a refurbished unit (due to the internals looking dented) that just had no hope of ever successfully cooling again. What a disappointment and if this is how Whynter makes their products (possibly using USED parts into building supposedly NEW units as I had purchased), then I'll make sure I spend my ~$500 elsewhere, even if it means taking on a lower BTU unit but as long as it looks new and most importantly, works!2 STARS instead of 1 because it could've been that these Whynter units usually do in fact work, but unfortunately mine could have been just the defected one out of the bunch. I'll give them the unfortunate benefit of the doubt.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1436486400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Okay for what it is... but it is SERIOUSLY LOUD","reviewDescription":"This is the 2nd brand\/model of room A\/C I've tried.  First one was a Honeywell single hose unit.  This one definitely cools better than that. So, that said, there are a number of thing I hate about this thing. I try to use this in my bedroom, the warmest room in the house, a smallish room, and it's just too dang loud.I should also mention, I live in Seattle, and the temps in the past weeks I've had this thing have never got past like 85, and it's cooled off well below 75 at night, usually to mid-to-low 60's. The room itself gets up to 90 or so, but just saying... I'm not fighting triple digit temps during the day so your mileage may vary.So, the things I have issues with:First and foremost, I cannot stress enough how astonishingly loud this thing is.  OMG is it loud.Second, it doesn't (seem to) have an energy saving feature where the whole unit can shut down when desired temp is reached. Maybe I'm stupid and missed it, but the fan runs all the time. And the fan is pretty loud in and of itself... not to mention, it's just the right pitch that even wearing ear plugs to try to sleep with it on, it cuts right through them and into my brain.Third, the fan just sucks.  I blows mostly straight up, and it's difficult to get it to point \"outward\" toward the front of the unit. I really don't think I'm stupid, it's just poorly designed.Forth, When the compressor comes on, the compressor fan is also very, very loud. It roars.Fifth, the compressor inexplicably stops sometimes, and stays off for an extended period, and the temp really climbs. I've checked the condensate reservoir and nada... I don't know what it's problem is, but if I click the temp down about 5 degrees, it will come back on with a vengeance and freeze me out.Sixth, I didn't use it (I made my own), but had I used it, the window kit leaves a lot to be desired.Is that it?  Gosh, I don't know. Oh, with the big-ol'd hoses, it's not exactly flexible to position this thing.  Oh yeah and WHY OH WHY DON't MANUFACTURERS OF THESE THINGS PUT *HANDLES* ON THEM!?!?!?!?  This thing is heavy. Getting up the stairs in a challenge not as much because of the weight, thouogh, but because it's HUGE and and unweildy.So.... there you have it.  I would return it if I could, but I had to go out of town for 2 weeks before trying it, and got rid of the box for some stupid reason. Now I'm thinking to sell it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1375833600000}

The best news is that we ordered these for next-day delivery, and they did indeed arrive the very next day. Very happy with the delivery aspect.One thing that we did not count on was the requirement stated in the instruction manual to allow the unit to sit upright for a day after delivery before attempting to use it. But I guess that's pretty typical for these things, so I can't hold that against the manufacturer.Because of the nature of the application, we were not expecting miracles. We just wanted to keep our equipment from overheating. The good news is that these units did okay. Not great, but okay. The two rooms were held at a temperature about 10 degrees cooler than they were without the units. The bad news is that the quality control done by this company seems a little suspect. Of the two units that we received, one of them was defective. The units are supposed to have three fan speeds, but the one that was defective had only two settings - on or off. Fortunately for us, the defect did not affect us because we pretty much needed the two units to run full-blast all the time. After the chiller replacement was completed, our plan was to use these units elsewhere.

It's a decent unit, keeps my room cool and I am still using it at the time of review. It has a bit of trouble keeping the place cool if the weather is consistently in the high 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit due to high ceilings, but overall not too shabby. The biggest gripe I have is the noise level. Granted all AC units will generate noise, and I am literally sitting next to this unit. But the main reason why I bring up the noise is because my cats would rather sleep in 90 degree Fahrenheit weather then be in the same room as the unit for prolonged periods of time. Unfortunately the noise is generated from the machine's thin plastic frame. Yes, of all things, the frame vibrates like crazy because it's not as solid or thick as other units I've encountered in the past. This has always been a problem ever since I purchased this, and I've tried alleviating the noise by leaning it against walls, padding the floors (does not work), and finally resorting to wrapping gaffer\/painter tape around the unit with varying degrees of success.

I know this unit was highly rated when my wife and I purchased it, but it was truly a let-down.My wife and I had previously purchased a 10,000 BTU Honeywell Portable a\/c for our bedroom (this exact model, which works great:), and we wanted something a little beefier to cool the remaining 400-450 sq ft. of our apartment. We purchased the Winter ARC-14S after reading so many positive reviews, and were truly disappointed to find out that it made such a small dent in the temperature of our apartment... especially when this unit is rated for 500 sq ft. rooms.We tried leaving windows open at night, since it gets to about 60* in the SF Bay Area, and running the Whynter after getting up at 7am (to see if maybe starting the day at a low temp would help it not get overworked), and we still felt very little cooling happening. In fact, it did not cool the same room as well as the Honeywell unit I linked up above, even though the Whynter is a 14k BTU unit and the Honeywell is a 10K BTU.When we were taking it apart to return this unit, it was remarkably difficult to disconnect the hoses from the window mount and the back of the unit. Considering those are both steps you would take when storing it for the winter, I am glad that we decided not to keep it, because we are fearful that we may have broken it if we had to assemble and disassemble again.This unit is great if you are planning on standing in front of it (but not sitting in front of it, my wife did that and it had no effect), or if you like paying more for electricity in your hot room.

{"reviewTitle":"It\u2019s awesome, just 2 minor remarks.","reviewDescription":"To start, I never had any portable AC\u2019s before. I recently moved to CA and the place I moved into does not have central AC. So as CA turns into an outside oven again and my house turns into a sauna I needed something to cool it down. I invested into two AC units, this one and a cheaper Soleus Air 8k BTU one. I will be comparing the two after using them for about 4 weeks now.My rationale behind this purchase:I use the Whynter in a fairly open space, from a small dining room, connected kitchen and connected big living room. I purchased the highest BTU rating I could find for the price with a good rating and at the time it was this Whynter. I figured I would need most of the BTU\u2019s I could find as I am using it to cool a little more than the directed sq ft.The unit itself:The unit is solid, well built and seems to be made of very high quality material. The hoses are very sturdy and definitely of higher quality then the Soleus ones. Where the Soleus seems hose seems wrinkle a quicker and tends to lose its shape, the Whynter one is sturdy. I take the window kit off sometimes and have been moving it around the house for different setups to see where I could get the maximum cooling. Taking down the window kit and collapsing and expanding the hoses almost every day seem to have 0 effect on the hoses. The hoses stay in shape, no wrinkles, no tears, nothing. Window kit however seems out of place with the rest of the unit, lower quality plastic and missing utility (read more below).The AC itself though is HUGE, I forgot to check the measurements prior to ordering and was kind of surprised when the package came in. It\u2019s like the half the size of an average refrigerator and pretty heavy. It\u2019s definitely not that portable and does hog up quite some space. Sure it\u2019s got wheels and the wheels do their job just fine. However I wanted to place it in the living room to see what it would do there, but my living room is lowered and there are 2 steps down from the rest of the house. No way I\u2019m trying to get this thing down (and up again) those steps by myself. Compared to the Soleus that (with a much lower BTU rating!) is super small and lightweight, very portable this Whynter unit is not that super portable.That said I can totally understand the size, this machine packs some serious cooling and all the power needs to come from somewhere. The more power the bigger the unit.Oh yeah, it comes with a remote. I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s a very limited in functionality, super simple remote. All the controls on the unit itself are good enough; I don\u2019t use it at all and will probably loose it. Compared to the Soleus one that has allot of functionality on the remote itself, including a display, timers and settings that aren\u2019t available directly on the unit.The cooling:This unit cools well, I\u2019ve tried two things: cooling a bedroom where I could close the door, within the directed sq ft and my 3 open area\u2019s well above the directed sq ft.I tested the bedroom by letting the room itself heat up well above 30 C  (86 F), rolled the unit in and start it right up. The room I tested is about 6x6m (20x20 ft), has the full afternoon hot sun, just blinds (closed), no outdoor sunscreen and about 38 C (100 F) outside temperature. I closed the door to the rest of the house and set the Whynter to about 22 C (72 F) and let it run. In about 30 to 40 minutes I could hear the compressor shut off and just the fan running, which means the Whynter cooled it down to the temp I set it on. The room was fresh and cool when I walked in, it easily cooled it down in a short amount of time. From time to time I could hear the compressor run for about 5 to 10 minutes again to provide the room with another shot of cold air and shut off again. Perfect.Cooling my 3 open areas however is a bit different. I knew the Whynter was never going to cool this down as easily as the smaller bedroom. Technically it requires allot more BTU\u2019s to cool then the 14k of the Whynter. However I seem to be able to keep a 9 C  (18 F) degrees difference with the outdoor temperature. Some tricks required though (read more below), like an outdoor sunscreen, supporting fans for air circulation and a further reach (Vornado\u2019s are awesome in pushing air around) and starting the AC when the room is still cool in the mornings. It runs all the time in a setup like this, as the unit never reaches the configured temperature anymore, I don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s a fair trade off against sitting in a sauna and waiting for someone to throw some water on the stone. The room remains fresh and much more bearable then without the AC. The AC actually performs beyond my expectations. I did not expect it to keep my space cool at almost 1,5 times the advertised sq ft.The noise:It\u2019s an AC and well AC\u2019s make noise. The noise level is loud, but given this has 14k BTU cooling power I also expected it to make noise. The noise may be loud but I do not find it annoying, it doesn\u2019t have any high pitches, rattles or grinding noises to it. Compared to the Soleus unit that sounds like a hamster is trapped in it with its training wheel. It\u2019s a white noise, low static sound of the fans and a fade sound of the compressor. Sure you will have to pump up the volume on your TV if this is in the same room (or wear headphones) and you probably do not want to do a conference call within 3 ft of the AC when it\u2019s running. But it is manageable.The less good:Okay, so I am very satisfied with the Whynter. Why did I give it only 4 stars and not 5? There are 2 things that annoy me enough to deduct one star:1> The window kit is made of out cheap plastic. It is not in the same build quality as any of the rest of the Whynter AC and the hoses. I have sliding case window that are 44\u201d high and I have to use both of the extension panels. The fact that you have to screw the extensions on with two, actually too small, screws is quite a downer. Other than that the window kit is barely long enough to fit into my 44\u201d windows. According to the instructions you have to \u2018cut\u2019 the extensions if your window is smaller to the size needed. The fact that the AC is portable means I want to move it around and not all windows are the same size. Unscrewing and re-attaching the extension panels are just too much of a hassle to easily move it and if you where to cut it you would be out of luck. Which kind of defies the fact that this is supposed to be portable.Compared to the Soleus AC unit, which came with a brilliant window kit, the Whynter one is just a joke. The Soleus one has butterfly bolts on both extension panels, so you can quite easily chose the length and is about 60\u201d (I could even fit it in my sliding doors). I wish Whynter could come with a similar window kit as the Soleus one.2> The exhaust air duct. It is situated on top of the unit and can blow directly up or with a 45 or 15 degree angle. I guess this is fine if you want to use it for just one room. However the reach of cold air of this unit is not very far and in my case I want to direct the air to a specific location. Having an exhaust air duct that is from the middle of the unit and that blows straight forward out of the unit with more guiding capabilities I could get allot more cool air on the specific spots then right now. Instead I have to use Vornado fans to push the cool air out further where the unit itself can\u2019t bring it.Conclusion:The unit is well built, hoses are sturdy, It is slightly heavy but it rolls well enough to move it throughout the house. It makes noise, but none of the irritating rattles or squeaks that annoy me. It\u2019s more static low humming and blowing of the fans. The window kit is a bit wonky and isn\u2019t up to the same standards as the rest of the material. But the unit cools really well for me, it works like a charm and way beyond my expectations.Tips and tricks:- Keep the heat out. That what doesn\u2019t come in doesn\u2019t require cooling. I picked up a white sunscreen from ikea that you can setup to avoid direct sunlight into my living room. This made a huge difference.- Avoid direct sunlight, close those blinds and curtains. So that the room itself doesn\u2019t heat up that easily.- Use extra fans to get the cool air where you want it to go, create a proper air circulation, I picked up two Vornado fans and they do a great job.- Start the AC when the room is still cool. Keeping a room cool requires less cooling than cooling down a hot room. I start the unit at around 10am\/11am before it heats up outside and it can keep a bigger space cool.- Try to avoid generating more heat where you can. Things like running a dishwasher (they have heated dry\u2019s at the end of the run) or using the kitchen generate allot of extra heat. That extra heat requires extra cooling on top of what the AC is already facing from the outside.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"176 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1401062400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Excellent A\/C - Highly Recommend It!","reviewDescription":"**2021 update at the bottom! \ud83d\udc4dI am in a two bed open plan flat. I use this unit to cool the living\/dining\/kitchen area leaving the bedroom doors closed. I've had experience with two other (different brand) 'portable' units and the main complaint with those is they didn't cool the space and the water tray needed emptying all the time. If the tray was not emptied several times a day they would just shut off. I waited one full season before writing a review as I really wanted to see how well it works. It's a year later and I've just dragged it out of the closet and set it up again and its running beautifully. Running from 9am-8pm with the temp set to 68\/70 I empty the tray once every 4-5 days. It has never once shout off on me and I have had ZERO trouble with it. (2021 Update: I no longer empty the tray as it\u2019s self evaporating)I made a few modifications given my previous experience with these units and would like to share them with you:1. I added a filter to the INTAKE side. I bought a sheet of basic air filter (this is a washable DuPont carbon air filter). Often the reason units stop working is they become dirty in the bowels of the machine you just cant get to and a cheap filter goes a long way to extending the units life.2. I REALLY made an effort with the window installation. The units I've had in the past came with a sticky on one side foam strip to bridge the inevitable gap which allows air through. My only complaint with this unit is that it did not come with one of these (why I subtracted one star). So what I did - and it worked brilliantly - was to use the foam packing that the unit came in. It came with two densities and worked perfectly using dble sided sticky tape and a Stanley knife on the top, bottom and sides.3. My third tip is about emptying the water. Nothing comes with unit to help. What you need it a shallow rimmed dish (The Ikea KALAS plate is PERFECT) and a smoothie straw (Bed Bath & Beyond) which is just wider diameter straw cut to desired length. This fits the spout  like a glove. It can be done alone but better with two people. When emptying  you will need the shallow dish, a straw and a container to toss the water into so you're not dashing to the kitchen 5-10 times. Have one person at the back - I use my 9 year old - and one larger person a the front. With shallow dish and straw in place the larger in front person tips the unit towards the rear. The rear person says when to stop and will empty the shallow dish into the other container with out having to get up then tell the 'tipper' when to resume. Do this till empty.4. This unit comes with two holes, one intake and one venting. There is a flaw in the design in that the exit holes out the window are RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. Imagine two mouths glued side by side one inhaling one exhaling. The inhaling\/intake side is going to breath IN the hot exhaled\/venting air. What I did was to saw off a portion of the PVC slider (it was just going in the bin) and attach it like a wing between both outside holes. Perfect!Many have made mention of the noise. The sound doesn't bother me and I have it next to my desk where I work all day in my living room. It' very subjective.I have tried to attach 8 descriptive photos. Yes, I would recommend this product.Here is a helpful Whynter YouTube video installation video: [...]2016 UPDATE: I ordered this in June of 2013. I was prepared for disappointment as I'd had two other units (different brands) that were utter disappointments. It's three years later and each year I pull this unit out of the closet it fires up flawlessly after a less than 10 minutes of install time done no less by my 11 year old. I have however, changed how I handle the filters. The same (filter) sheet I initially bought is still providing the material needed. I now only cut out one disc and this I place OUTSIDE\/OUTDOORS. What I mean by this is that I place the filter where the air\/INTAKE is from the outside NO LONGER inside the machine. This is much easier and does the trick! I will adjust the photos ASAP to show what I mean. I've received A LOT of queries about what type of filter. Don't overthink it; any filter you can cut to size that's recommended for air filtration can be used. This is an amazing unit and is the best money I've spent!!2021 Update: I\u2019ve moved and it\u2019s now installed in a new window. I had to come on here to say I\u2019m writing this durning the RECORD BREAKING heat wave here in Seattle. Yesterday it was 113\u00b0. I\u2019ve had this a\/c on for THREE DAYS STRAIGHT and it\u2019s worked brilliantly. Now I\u2019m in a badly insulated old building so knowing about this heat wave, I made insulated panels for all windows and sliding glass doors with 2 pieces of Refectix w\/cardboard sandwiched in between. Is my flat cold with the a\/c ? No, BUT given the conditions it\u2019s doing a great job keeping us from dying. I have large fans dotted around the flat to circulate the VERY COLD AIR the Wynter blows. Remember, you can look above and see I bought this 2013!!  PS : I no longer empty the drain tray; it\u2019s self evaporating!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2,349 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1398988800000}
{"reviewTitle":"UPDATE a separation in the casing on top of unit #2. The black clips that hold the White hoses in place ...","reviewDescription":"Newest updates been one year running  good. 4\/23\/18.One big suggestion First of all the carbon filter that comes with this unit is garbage it literally falls apart so when you think of it this debris is getting sucked into the back of your compressor and it will plug up the grill that looks like a radiator I would recommend going to Home Depot or Lowe's other stores have them as well get the green and black 3M filter you will have to cut it you can make several filters out of this I feel it is a little thick therefore I would suggest split it into with a drywall knife for Sharp scissors maybe have someone help you as you're splitting it into to pull it apart. It is important this filter  needs to pull in as much air as possible  and you don't want to have too thick of filter in there  reducing air flow The upgraded filter they sell  for this unit  which is $44 way over price again  I would think they would  give you a better filter with such a expensive unit. Latest update 8\/28\/17. So far  the two units I have are working great  I got things straightened out and got another one sent back from Amazon  again I'm not happy with  Whynter support team themselves,,  but I am happy that Amazon backs it all up and thank goodness for Amazon for working with me as I send the unit back to them and they sent me another on. OK my first unit I have not had to drain it  yet I have been running it since May 2017 average temperature 87 \/104. We don't have high humidity here though keep that in mind. I would have given it five stars except for the way I was treated by Whynter. This unit is little noisy you will have to turn up your TV but that's what you pay for when you get a bigger unit you have to decide do I want something quieter but won't work as well or turn the TV up and keep the place feeling nice that's the way I'm going when I walk in after day I want a nice cool temperature to Relax Inn I'm keeping my place at 69 degrees, damn heat makes me honry I guess that's the price we're getting older. Anyway all the stuff below is just some issues I had and things to look for.  I would definitely recommend this unit have a great day peace God bless you all..... older  update as of 7\/12\/17. I did get a second unit for my bedroom one unit was not enough  so I just got the second one  and I am very disappointed with the outside casing defect on top  it is separated  as well when I pull up  the  black vents on top of the unit to adjust the direction of air  there is a big problem it catches on the side  and I feel this is due to the outside casing issue as in one of the pictures you can see  the right side does not come all the way up  you will see the left side is higher I will attach a pictures below I sent them an e-mail I will update you on what Whynter support says,,  this is clearly a defective unit and I fear that were the casing is separated and should be tight with no Gap could get worse. And to be clear my first unit I got back in May the unit is fine.  as mentioned  later on I only had an issue  with that clip  again I feel this is a problem with these units  when you do insert the hoses on the back  they are extremely hard  to get the hoses back out  because it recesses deeper into the unit and you have no room to push the Clips in to take the hoses back out, those clips can extremely be easy to break. PS I will add the extra photo of how I did the window installation for the second unit after putting in the window kit with the to sliders once you put them in the centerpiece where the two hoses attached you'll notice there will be two gaps on each side because the two slider pieces it makes it narrower so I put weather stripping on both sides, then I used silicone caulking on any type of cracks you could see through, and then I bought the six inch insulated duct rap as well get some aluminum duct tape that will stand up to heat and if you want to put duct tape on top of that you will be fine since you can buy duct tape and almost any color  it looks better  then the aluminum look, and I feel no heat after putting the the insulation wrap on and then aluminum tape on top of that around the house meaning heat exhaust hose and using it  to put over inside of the window sliders kit,  as well  really helps for insulation after all the window kits you really need more  protection over them to protect from the weather elements  and it' well be more cost-effective hope this helps. ....... Older update on my first unit I got this unit in May therefore it has not  been warm enough  to use it. I did hook it up as of 5\/29\/17. Today it was 82 degrees on 6\/2\/17. And it works quite well  again when it gets warmer  I will update my status  I did run my hoses  through a wall and vent them outside of my outside vinyl siding,  as well wrapped insulation tape I bought here around hoses before putting them through the wall, A lot of work but I feel it will work better and be more efficient with only using half the hose length  I thought the window kit looked pretty shabby and I sort of looked like I was in a lab, lol with those big white hoses, The black clips that hold the White hoses in place on the back of the unit are extremely hard to get detached once it is in place  just not a lot of room  to push the black clips in  to pull the hose out, and mine had a crack in it therefore in the winter time when I have to detach the hoses that clip will just break off. Because of the crack it is just flimsy and is not holding the hose anyway. To be clear I'm talking about the back of the unit where the two black intake and outtake vents are.  frustrating after all that money.  the window kit that I had to modify with weatherstripping because of the design it does not entirely fit flush when you put in the extra to panels. (As I mentioned in the update above I ended up running hoses through the wall to outside and took the window kit out). I did contact them a few days ago about the clip and received an email to send back part number have not heard back from them as of 6\/3\/17. So I will update this as well to see how their customer service is and give you a further update when weather gets warmer.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"37 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1495324800000}
{"reviewTitle":"It\u2019s a great cooling system, but\u2026","reviewDescription":"We bought this A\/C because our house\u2019s insulation is very old & the 3 Ton Carrier we have running? Can\u2019t keep up with the heat once temperatures are over 89\u00b0. At that point, you can\u2019t even feel the large A\/C unit at all, but the minute we installed this & turned it on? You can immediately feel the difference in the entire downstairs. We have vaulted ceilings in our living room with an exposed 2nd Floor balcony, so a lot of the cold air rises up & escapes. This is the exact same reason why I only gave this A\/C four stars. It\u2019s because of the way the vent was set up. You can only direct the air flow in certain directions because it\u2019s automatically pointing up. If this would\u2019ve have a front blowing vent? Instead of a top vent?? It would\u2019ve been perfect for our needs. We are still keeping it because it\u2019s such a well made AC, but we had to buy a vent deflector to get the air to travel where we needed it the most. Some other features are that it holds 71 Pints of condensation water & is capable of evaporating it with an advanced system. So draining is very minimal unless you have a humidity level over 70%. Then, it needs to be drained regularly. It came with a remote and is quieter than the portable Media we had in its place, while also being stronger with a better fan. Besides that? It\u2019s a great unit and we are happy we bought this to offset the extreme temps we\u2019ve been getting during the summer.

{"reviewTitle":"Great! But the placement MATTERS","reviewDescription":"The placement matters! If it is working fine, but your room isn't getting cool, try to rearrange it! I had this unit in the middle of my living room, and the lowest temp would get was 73. It would only drop my room temp about 4 degrees. I called customer service, waited about 2 minutes on hold. The representative asked me a bunch of questions to make sure the unit was working properly, and it was. She said I needed to have the unit at least 20 inches from the wall. I did, but it still just wasn't getting my room that cold. The next day, I rearranged my living room, resulting in me rearranging the AC unit. I moved it to the corner of the room, which also required the hoses to move in a different type of position than they were previously. I don't know what the right position is to get this thing to work, but moving it worked! Since then, my room has gotten to as low as 68 degrees! I left and came back home to a COLD living room! There was one day that it wasn't making my room super cold. I turned it off and turned it back on, and it started working great again. Overall, I think the machine is powerful, and it is definitely worth the purchase. However, it does seem to have a mind of its own sometimes. Also, I live in a high humidity state, and I have yet needed to drain it even after a full week of using it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1722988800000}
{"reviewTitle":"So far so good","reviewDescription":"I've only had this for a few days so will update my review if need be. It is definitely a large heavy item and the box was a bit difficult to get up the stairs by myself,. Setup didn't take long. Cutting the window extension thing was annoying, couldn't find my jigsaw so I just drilled a bunch of small holes along the line where I wanted to cut it, then snapped it between my hands. I did let the AC sit and settle for almost a full day after setting it up before I turned it on for the first time.Worth it! The air this unit blows is very cold. My office is about 300 sq ft and sweltering and miserable and humid in the summer but now it is really pleasant! However, I'm a bit disappointed by a few things so can't give 5 stars:  the exhaust hose should be insulated. The intake valve should come with a filter. The metal screws to attach the valves to the window fixture were not very nice and I had to run and get my drill to tighten them all the way. The window fixture should have rubber weatherstripping type stuff along the top and bottom.  These are small things I can take care of myself, but they would have cost the company very little yet would have made the overall product seem much nicer and more thoughtful.  I also wish the AC had handles on the sides bc it is gonna be VERY tricky to get it downstairs with nothing to grab onto.  Maybe it lives upstairs forever now.Anyway looks like i have 30 days from purchase to get the extended warranty and I might. Some of the  reviews on here (mostly concerning product longevity) are a bit concerning. But this is a tremendous quality of life improvement.  I no longer feel as though i am walking into a sauna when I go up the stairs into my office.

It's moderately cold but doesn't blow hard so in the dead of summer when it's in the upper 90s and 100 degrees, it gets to 80, leaving my a\/c to just run non stop. I used a window unit the last 2 summers and it didn't cut it.This year I decided to buy this and it's been amazing!

My indoor thermostat says it's 74 in here and it feels so much more comfortable.Sound wise  - comparable to a window unit, just slightly louder than my central a\/c.It is heavy but has wheels on it so moves easily in my house. Install was fairly easy. The only issue I had was I had to cut the plastic to fit my window and I didn't have the tool for it but I figured it out.It is hard to empty the water reservoir. There's a hole in the back to empty but no bowl fits under the hole well enough to empty it into. My partner got a plastic tube to fit around it. He didn't get any water out of it when he tried to empty it. I haven't emptied it in probably 6wks.

I was excited by the double hose on this one (which is suppose to be more efficient).  However, I would say it only works okay.  It is quieter than the LG, but it is not nearly as cool. If you stand right next to it the air is great, but once you get more than 2 feet away there is little difference in the air temperature.  I am using it to cool an east facing bedroom (maybe 400 square feet).  With the LG, when you would walk into the room you could feel the cool air. With the Whynter, you can barely tell a difference between the hallway air and the room air. It was easy to connect and set up, but I just wish it had more oomph!To be fair, I like really cold air - like the icy air from the LG. My wife (who hated the LG) likes the Whynter, She likes that it is quieter and she does not like the super cold air from an air conditioner, so she would likely rate this higher.  So, if you are like me and want a 65 degree room on a 100 degree day - keep looking, this isn't the product for you.

{"reviewTitle":"Dont buy a portable AC if you live a dusty environment","reviewDescription":"If you live in a small space in a dusty environment, avoid buying a portable AC at all cost. I bought this portable AC this summer and after using it I realized  that I had made a bad choice.There is a huge design flaw in this product (and possibly all portable AC). The condenser side that draws outside air is not kept in a completely sealed chamber. So, even though it is dual hose, air is still sucked in from the room. This in turn causes outside dusty air to be drawn in constantly when its in use, making my room dusty and smelly. I had to spend a lot of time cleaning my room all throughout summer.If this was single hose, the problem would have been a lot worse. For a dual hose unit like this, this problem can be resolved if the condenser side is kept in a tightly sealed chamber so that air can enter it only through the intake port.Also, cleaning the unit wasn't easy. The evaporator grill was easily accessible and I was able to clean it thoroughly with an AC coil foaming cleaner. But the blower fan also needed to be cleaned which was not easily accesible.

{"reviewTitle":"Fix The Manual","reviewDescription":"Very happy with the air conditioner.  Disappointed with the manual.  Per the manual it is suppose to do this in cooling mode : \"This air conditioner has a 5\u00b0F temperature cushion; if the set temperature is within 5\u00b0F of the ambient temperature, the unit runs in fan only mode. This saves energy and prolongs the life of the compressor of the air conditioner. Once the set temperature is achieved, the compressor will turn off and the fan runs continuously to circulate the air within the room.\"  My unit did not do this so I contacted customer support.  Took a couple of weeks but finally they got back to me and  replied: \"This air conditioner has a 5\u00b0 F temperature cushion; if the set temperature is within 5 \u00b0 F of the ambient temperature, the fan will switch to low speed and run approximately 5 minutes before it shuts off. The fan will activate again in approximately 15 minutes and run for 1 minute to circulate air in the room and detect the ambient room temperature. If the room temperature is higher than 5\u00b0 F of the set temperature, the compressor will turn on and the fan will run in the set speed.\"  Which is what mine was doing.

{"reviewTitle":"two major design flaws...","reviewDescription":"This unit works fairly well, but there are, in my opinion, two major design flaws.  One is that there are two tubes that must be vented to the window.  One tube makes sense; you must release the heat.  Unfortunately, the other tube weakens the effectiveness of the unit.  You see, the other tube brings air in from the outside... air that is typically quite hot (why else would you be running the a\/c, right?) AND this intake tube is located right next to the tube pushing out hot air... so now you have doubly hot air being brought in from the outside!  I understand if the intention was to bring in fresh air as opposed to air that has already been circulating inside, but theoretically the air inside should at least be somewhat cooler already, making the unit more effective.The other issue is that this unit blows air up and out of the top.  Even though there is a slight adjustment one can make to the angle it blows, you cannot get it to angle anything but up.  Up is where the hot air is.  Up does not cool the hottest air, it only pushes it around.  I purchased another unit that blows the air straight out (and the unit is shorter so the air comes out just about knee height or you can angle it higher if you want).  This unit is fewer BTUs and consumes less energy (costs less) and is FAR more effective (it's the Keystone KSTAP12A 12,000 BTU, if you are interested).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1436659200000}

Is there a black market for screws that I don't know about?Otherwise, the new unit works moderately well, I think a bit better than my (other brand) single hose unit. Hot weather has not arrived. I used a 240 sqft insulated building for a test, about half the size this unit should cool. Temps inside and outside were 80 and the unit reduced temps about 1 degree every 10 minutes.

{"reviewTitle":"Has issues for the price they ask","reviewDescription":"I have only been using this unit for a few days so far and I am happy with it performance overall, but there are some issues.I have owned many portable units and have done a lot of research in my purchases of these units. The dual hose system is a MUST. Without it, your pulling cooled air to the outside on a single hose unit to cool it. This creates a vacuum bringing warm into your room and home to replace it though any openings.When shopping, watch the ratings on portables as there are TWO. One is it's actuall size rating and the other (lower number) is it's ACTUAL cooling rating. This is because portables are less efficient than window units.For this unit:PROSIt is able to keep up with the higher humidity here well unlike others I've had.It has a higher actual cooling capacity to physical rating than others I compared.Dual hose design allows fast, far more efficient cooling. I am able to keep this unit set higher for same cooling than my old.Climate control setting stays in range.CONSThis unit is noisier than others I've owned but not unbearable.The remote is pretty cheap. Buttons are sloppy and I've already noticed they sometimes don't always change a setting on each press. In two cases it also operated button next to it. Will have to call company.Hoses don't even come assembled like every portable unit I have ever owned.Two BIGGEST fails:Window install kit is VERY small. Every other unit I have owned included kits that extended up to 72\" and one was even larger. Larger windows are most common now so this is just them being cheap.The biggest fail of all is this company NOT including a pre filter for the air intake on this dual hose unit. I was shocked to find out they make you pay an extra $33 for this 100% necessary part. This part stops your unit from sucking in fine dust, pollen, bugs etc from outside. At over $500, it's RIDICULOUS this isn't included.They include a generic so called \"carbon filter\" for \"odors\" which will do nothing as it's horribly thin and that its even cut too small. They could eliminate that and include the essential part that costs them 43 cents to make.PS I bought the filter at $33 as I don't have time to mess with making something as others do, and don't want crap in my unit. I got it today. It's cheaper material than the units vent hose couplings. It fits loosely. The so called filter screen that's inside is cheaply installed and looks like it will fall out in no time. Complete ripoff and horrible this company does this to it's customers. I doubt I would buy from this company again.

{"reviewTitle":"2.5 \/ 5 Outstanding performance, but has plenty of faults","reviewDescription":"This unit definitely does its job cooling a room. We have this in our 434 sq ft master bedroom as we like it in the low 60's to sleep, but have the central AC set to 70 for the rest of the house. This unit has no problem keeping the room at 61 even in 90 degree weather, and I haven't noticed a drastic spike in electric usage. (I frequently monitor our meter) The unit also surprisingly hasn\u2019t required the condensation tank to be drained. Our unit has run every day from 7PM-6AM for 2 months and I just drained it for curiosity sake and only got about 12oz out of it. That said, the unit certainly has its fair share of cons as well:- Very loud. After 2 months of the unit seemingly getting louder I got out the dB meter I use for setting up stereo systems and the unit averaged 73-77 decibels with the compressor running. (think hair dryer, vacuum, loud restaurant) Anyone that claims they can hear the TV across the room with this thing running simply isn\u2019t telling the truth. I had to hang speakers directly above our headboard and use an external amp to hear the TV over the unit running. The unit is completely across the room from our bed and still frequently wakes my wife and I up.- Window mounting hardware is AWFUL. I can\u2019t understand why the window mount isn\u2019t accordion-style like the rest of the industry . . . or come assembled. Fortunately for me, I have a radial arm saw and some construction experience, so I was able to cut everything to size, get it assembled, silicone all of the joints, buy and install weather stripping, and buy and install security hardware to keep it in place, but it was no picnic even with the correct tools and knowhow.- As other reviewers have mentioned, the cool intake and hot exhaust ports are literally side by side with no barrier. This unquestionably leads to poor performance and excess electrical usage. I ended up measuring the distance between the mounting panel and the window screen and installed an exhaust tunnel to direct the hot exhaust air away from the intake.- Connections are loose \/ have gaps. I ended up having to silicone nearly all of the hose and coupling connections due to the fact that they mate rather poorly.- Whynter charges a whopping $33 for the 50 cent optional intake filter that should be included for free with the unit. That said, you should either pony up the money for it or slip a thin mesh between the fittings. After about 500 hours of use ours was rather filled up with pollen and dust.- Complete lack of instructions.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"307 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1528761600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Does the job but noisy with a few poor designs ...","reviewDescription":"My central AC broke and while awaiting for the AC repair guy (over-booked at the beginning of the season), I thought that buying a portable unit would be a stop gap solution to the week-end heat challenge. A window unit did not seem like a solution (I tried a few times and dropped a few) as I was looking at the movable feature. So, I carefully reviewed the portable AC units and this unit came up at the same rating than theon ConsumerReport (rating 52) but the Amazon rating gave a better edge to this one so ... I decided to go with this one.The unit has a few drawbacks and I will start with those as I think customer should be aware of those:- First, please take note of the weight: it is 100 Lb and hard to carry by one person. Moving the unit to an upstairs will be a challenge. Its competitor noted above weighs 71.7 pounds (1\/4 difference makes a big difference). One thing to consider.- The windows kit is simply awful and clunky - I worked on this for a good 45 mnts before making really air-tight and actually stay in the window. Forget about that promo-video with a smiling woman (your first hint you are being tricked), it will not be as easy and \"simple\" - it will require insulating foam (buy it right away). The two vent design is also very poor: the exhaust is essentially next to the intake making the flow inefficiently sucking back in the hot air expelled. I did not plug at all the intake. Also, the hose fixture is not very flexible, the unit will need to be a foot away from the wall as a result (imaging this in your leaving room).- The drainage is of poor design - putting a flat dish below the drain?? Really?? I would have wished for a removable drawer like theor at least, a high up reservoir with a tube for drainage. So, I do not recommend using it as a dehumidifier myself ...- This unit is NOT silent  - but none of the units are (so don't get your hopes high).Now, on the reasonable side- It works :-) , the cool air comes relatively fast, if you turn the unit off\/on, it comes back with the previous settings, the remote is easy to understand and use (though I do not use it).- The unit covers for 500 square feet alright and in fact, I have an upstairs with a master bedroom and an office (more that 500 sq ft) and it cools fine - note that I am not trying to chill things at 70 F here, but more of a 77-78 F (or < 80). For this purpose, it works just fine.- As far as you can carry it somewhere, the unit rolling is easy and smooth (no streak on wood floors or terrible thing like this)- The directional air-vent is functional (not impressive but fine)- Very easy to access the filer, clean and replaceOverall, I feel this unit should have a \"Ok\" rating as it would have deserved from being more quiet and with a hassle-free window kit (their \"easy-install kit\" is not easy and not practical, poorly designed) but, passed the problems, it also works reasonably well. I opted to put the unit in the room I am not in and since all my windows are of the same size, the initial work on the window fit turns out to be very handy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1464480000000}

I live in NY. The AC came nicely packaged - no damage and shipping was EXTREMELY FAST... I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER! (Shipping was free also) Super!From the raves I read - some comments were honest but those who over rated the item - I DEEM THEM LIARS! First of all, the item is huge and a bit heavy... (huge here means the item is TALL ... BUT IT'S NOT WIDE) most people said that so that's not a problem and it's true. The setup was not too bad... viewed on Youtube how to... However, the COOLING SYSTEM FOR SUCH A HUGE AC SHOULD BE BETTER, ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE AC IS 14,000 BTU! Note the \"HUGE\" here means it's very tall almost half of my Grandfather clock - LOL! But it's not wide... it's more on the slender side (smiling).The room where my computer is and where I spend most of my time working on my computer - the size of the room is about 12 x 12. It's upstairs also. Today the temp reaches 100 and I had to use the fan to go along with the AC to give a comfortable feel. ONE OF THE GREAT DRAW-BACK ALSO IS THAT THE AC BLOWS UP TO THE CEILING and there is no way one could position it to direct the air down or across the room.It cools the room but not adequately - it needs a fan to help it out. I find a small widow AC does a better job than this big AC. 14,000 BTU should push more air.Mobility is fantastic... the wheels are super in moving the item around - the greatest prob is that it does not cool adequately. It does HUM but not to the point where it disturbs or stop on from sleeping either. It has a nice glow of blue light and if you are like me that need a night-light in the room, then this is great... no prob. The item is very very slick and beautiful... could be placed in any decor and fits it beautifully - very shiny and nice!Draining water is not a prob either. I have had this for almost a month now and I have not had to drain the water yet. Guess that's coming up. I did find out too that the drainage tube is way down on the floor so one would have to get this up on a block to drain or use a very thin basin to do the draining.To be fair and honest... I would only give this a three stars since it DOES NOT COOL adequately. For all the other things like: not have to drain often, nice glow light, mobility and the nice slickness (slender) this makes up the stars to three - NOT COOLNESS! I have no afilliation with seller, Wynter, Amazon (only purchase from here...) and this is my honest and true review. I am not paid and I used my own hard earned money to purchase this therefore, there is no need to lie or give a dishonest review.God bless you and direct you as you make your choice based on my honest review of this item and seller.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1341014400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Works, but Too Pricey for What You Get","reviewDescription":"I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am with this product. I recently purchased the Whynter Eco-Friendly 12,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner, and I love it (see my review). The 12,000 BTU was for my apartment and it worked so well that I decided to invest in the Whynter 14,000 BTU for my 400 sq\/ft office.  What a mistake!To give this unit credit, it does work - like a 9,000 BTU unit. Definitely not worth $500. (If it was $300, I would give it three stars).My office is 400 sq\/ft with a vaulted ceiling. This unit did not bring the temperature down one degree. If I stood directly in front of the unit, the air was cold. However, if I stood two feet away, I felt nothing. The main problem with this unit is that the cold air shoots straight up and back. I tried placing a fan on the unit to get the cold air to move forward instead of up, and this helped a bit, but not much.I was determined to give this unit a fair chance. I figured that it was the high ceiling that was preventing the cold air from cooling the room. So, I swapped the 12,000 and the 14,000. I brought the Whynter 12,000 BTU unit to work and took the Whynter 14,000 unit home.I was amazed at how awesome the 12,000 BTU unit worked in my office. Within two hours it took the temp down from 80 degrees to 70 degrees and kept it at 70 degrees throughout the day.The poor 14,000 unit did not help my apartment much. The 12,000 BTU got my apartment down to 65 degrees. The 14,000 unit couldn't get my apartment below 75 degrees.My advice: Save your money and buy the Whynter 12,000 unit. It works!***UPDATE***I've had this until for a couple of months now, and I finally got it to work properly.  It happened quite by accident.  I was so frustrated with the ventilation system that I taped a plastic \"hood\" on top of the vent to keep the cold air from shooting straight up.  This helped a bit, but not enough.  I then decided to take the vent-piece out.  When I did so, I accidentally broke one of the pegs off the vent.  Out of disgust, I shoved the vent back in the unit upside-down and backwards. To my amazement, the unit began to cool my apartment.  The cold air now shoots forward instead of straight up. (see pic) The unit now takes the temp in my 400 sq\/ft space from 80+ to 68 in less than an hour.I raised the unit from one star to three stars.  If the vent had been designed properly to begin with, and the price dropped $100, this would be a five star unit. (I can't feel the difference in cooling between this unit and my Whynter 12,000 BTU - which cost $100 less.)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"49 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1308873600000}

We use this unit exclusively when the outdoor temperature is below 80 degrees. When it is hotter than 80 degree outside  and set the Central AC to 78 and this unit to 66 degrees for sleeping.Our bedroom is about 500 sq feet with 20 foot high vaulted ceilings, we do have a ceiling fan. We set this to 66 degrees about an hour before bedtime and it gets to that temperature quite quickly.We are very happy with the ability to cool our large bedroom, however, there are many design flaws that need be worked around.1) This unit is LOUD! The sound meter app on my phone (can't say how accurate a phone app is) reads this unit at 62 decibels 5 feet from the fan (which is where we are sleeping). It is white noise so we have gotten used to it after a week.2) The blue LED light on the front is BRIGHT! I would be exaggerating to say you could read by this light - but not by much. The hack we used on this was to put a stack of about 6 post-it notes over the light. It blocks the light but you can still lift them up to see the display when needed.3) The compressor stops completely when the reservoir is full, but the warning light has not come on. The instruction manual states that a warning light will display when the unit is full, but that has not happened. I simply woke up in the middle of the night on the third night of use drenched in sweat. The fan was blowing, but no cool air coming out. In the morning I checked the reservoir and it was full.It took less than three days to fill using only 8 hours a night with humidity of around 60%. This just using the cooling function, NOT the dehumidifying function.4) The reservoir is ridiculously difficult to empty. It's at the bottom of the back of the unit, the clearance to put a container to catch the water under the unit is less than an inch. Even my shallowest cookie sheet doesn't fit, and it if did it would overflow. It takes two of us to drain with my husband tilting and lifting the unit and me holding a receptacle to catch the water. It drains at least a couple of pints so you need a large enough receptacle to catch it and use caution to not overflow. Other reviewers have posted several hacks that include purchasing special plates from Ikea and hoses. I would think this type of thing should be included or the unit better designed - why not just leave about 2 - 3 inches clearance? Or let the hose go out several inches so you don't need to put a receptacle under the unit? Or build in a removable reservoir?Overall, it works well enough for its purpose and it's too heavy and inconvenient to return. I think we can hack it enough to overcome the flaws. But I wouldn't buy this unit again and I can't wholeheartedly recommend it to others.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1438992000000}

No problems there.  It was easy to get the box off and get the unit off the cardboard and foam base despite its 100 pounds weight.  Also inside the main package was another box containing the window kit, hoses, and adapters.  Missing were the manual, remote control, and screws to fasten the window kit together.  I went to the Whynter website and downloaded the manual there so I was able to get the unit set up in about five minutes and blowing cold air.  I also found a customer service phone number.  The phone was quickly answered by a young lady who, I assume, was located in the US.  No accent, at least.  After explaining the missing items, she showed her lack of customer service skills.  She failed to offer any apology for my problem nor did she show any interest in whether I was able to get the unit installed and operating.  She did offer to send me the missing parts ... after I sent her a copy of my Amazon invoice so she could verify my correct shipping address and register my warranty.  When I asked her to confirm that she was requiring that I provide my invoice BEFORE she would ship the missing items, she again said it was so she could verify my correct shipping address and register my warranty.  I pointed out that it was not me that was having a bad day and failed to put everything in the box before it left the factory.  When I asked why she couldn't take that information over the phone and get the missing items shipped, she again repeated the same excuse.  Only after I said that I would contact Amazon to arrange a return so I could purchase a different brand did she finally agree to take my information and ship the items.  She also took my email so she could send me a tracking number.  Today, Tuesday, I got that tracking number.  The estimated delivery date is next Monday!  I didn't even know UPS offered a delivery service that slow for a package that only weighs about one pound.The A\/C unit has operated fine so far.  It dropped the inside temperature 10 degrees in less than an hour. While noticeable, the noise of the compressor is not intolerable.  I only hope the unit continues to function well as I can only imagine the hoops I will have to jump through if I have to call customer service for warranty service.

{"reviewTitle":"An excellent product with an awfully stupid design flaw","reviewDescription":"Let me start with the pros1. Cools pretty damn well :-) kudos!2. It operates much quieter than I expected it to3. Pretty nice design aesthetically pleasing4. Easy to installNow the cons1. STUPID DESIGN FLAW: Temperature sensor is too close to the exhaust hose (See below for more details)2. The window fixture has exhaust and intake very close and there is a high probability that the intake may suck in some of the hot air going out thus severely downgrading the efficiency. I would prefer a 4 to 6 inch clearance between the two. I am planning to make a custom fixture later to solve this problem.3. The hose connector on the body of the AC is parallel to the body, so the hose connect at an awkward angle that hampers the airflow into the indoor intake vent, another energy inefficiency.4. The cold air vent has to be opened manually (not a big deal just a teeny tiny inconvenience)5. I think it uses the full 1500 Watts (I will use a power meter later and update this), when I connect it in the same room where my desktop is connected it caused my circuit breaker to trigger (15A; US voltage[110vrms]). Usually home appliances are limited to 1300 Watts.Regarding the design flaw (1), the temperature sensor is hooked to the indoor intake side, too close to the outdoor exhaust hose connector. The outdoor exhaust hose connector gets very hot when indoor air is sucked around the hose it gets warm and this hits the temperature sensor thus the unit never turns off the compressor. When my room temperature reached 76F, a temperature setting of 78F did not turn off the compressor and the unit kept on spewing out cold air. It only went off when I adjusted it to 81F, so I thought I can set it to 81F and can get a 76F cool room. But that didn't work very well either, because after the compressor is off the outdoor exhaust hose cools down and the air sucked in reflects the room temperature. So, the unit will turn back on only when your room temperature hits 81F.They could have used a little longer wire and connected the temperature sensor on the other side (near the outdoor air intake hose side) for a 500$ product this is an unforgivable design flaw.For now I'm planning to put some thick insulation around the outdoor exhaust hose and see if it helps.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1596672000000}

It sounds like an old motorbike.I have another one that sounds normal and works the best of all of them.My fourth one arrived with cracked pieces inside that you can see where the hose attaches so I haven't even tried to connect it.I've been reluctant to contact Whynter because I've heard you have to pay for shipping both ways and being disabled I have no idea how I would pack these and get them somewhere to ship or have the funds to do it.I wish they would also do something to make the filter panel stay on better. It does not latch well and I've had to put tape on all of them to hold the door closed. Also, the filters are pretty cheesy. Dust starts accumulating on the fins pretty fast and I try to clean the filters and vacuum the fins once a week. Once the dust gets on the fins it can be nearly impossible to get it off. I use a dry toothbrush as I vacuum to get what I can.I do like the dual hoses and like the small opening required in the window versus a full sized window a\/c.I wish they would insulate one of the hoses and label it and the hole for it so the heat from the super hot air doesn't go into your room (counterproductive). One hose gets VERY hot.Buttons are easy to use once you get used to them. Back lit and easy to read. Wish it showed the actual room temperature instead of just showing what it is set at.If I could give 5 stars to Amazon alone I would. They worked with me for almost 2 weeks when UPS could not manage to get this from a Dallas warehouse to my Dallas home. UPS was the worst ever. Amazon was incredible making this right for me. They eventually shipped out a new replacement unit via Fed Ex and it arrived very quickly. Unfortunately, it was delivered upside down with the cracked housing around the compressor. I don't have the heart or energy to deal with getting it replaced AGAIN. (this is the one I haven't installed yet)So if you can get this unit delivered without incident or damage and you get one that works without some loud sound issues, you will be pleased at the cooling capability.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1503619200000}
{"reviewTitle":"I Cannot Recommend This AC Unit\u2026","reviewDescription":"This unit is big, bigger than you think. The hoses are big, bigger than you think. It works well sometimes. Only after a day or two of use will you notice that you\u2019ve had a terrible night or woke up hot over and over with the Whynter ARC-14S. The unit, on cooling mode, will automatically turn down its fan when the set temp is reached (the manual does not mention this). The unit will sometimes, at its discretion, turn the fan off completely, for hours, and allow the heat to rise up to 5F before it turns the ac back on. Don\u2019t worry though, the fan will turn on between medium and high every 15 minutes for 30 seconds all night long while the temp rises. Just to \u201ccirculate the air\u201d. Yes, I wrote to tech support and they said that was normal and the fan nonsense was to \u201ccirculate the air\u201d.No, this is not an energy saving function that can be turned off. The Whynter ARC-14 has a mind of its own and does what it wants when it wants. Sometimes it\u2019ll turn on and off constantly and keep the room within .1F Other times you get the high temperature fan nonsense I described above.It does cool well. It does not require draining in most climates. It is made fairly well. It is powerful and affordable\u2026 I hate it and I do not believe it works properly at all. Sent it back.

{"reviewTitle":"Its ok, but doesn't cool the space it says if you have walls.","reviewDescription":"I am in an old home that is brick, so the house stays cooler than most to begin with.  So I figured this would be good to cool my 600 square foot upstairs.  We originally had a window unit that was huge and kept the upstairs almost cold, as well as pushed the cold air down the stairs and I didn't have to run the downstairs window unit as much.  Not the same with this.I am not saying this doesn't work because it does.  Yesterday it got up to 90 and the upstairs in the one room that this was blowing into stayed 73.  But what is surprising is that it doesn't really remove the humidity as much as I thought it would.The other rooms were definitely warmer, although I didn't record the temp. (I may do that today.).  I have 3 bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs.  Two of the bedrooms actually have door between them, and that stays open.I also found that blocking out sunlight really helps to keep things cooler.  I taped aluminum foil to the east and west windows, and I have blackout shades.  So that helped.  But the rooms are almost caves now.Also, on the unit itself the exhaust hose gets pretty warm, which in my mind heats up in the room.  I just took some bubble wrap and wrapped the exhaust hose and that helped as well.I also have a fan running 24\/7 blowing the cooler air around.Bottom line, this doesn't work like a window A\/C.  Other reviews have stated that and I am confirming.  If you had a window air conditioner that did the job, and thought that this would replace it, it won't.However this unit does cool.  Just don't expect it to be a window unit.  My main reason for buying was to have an air conditioner that didn't stay in the window during the winter.  This will come easily out and store in a closet, keeping our windows closed.If you are looking to use this just keep all this in mind.  Most likely I will pick up a small window unit to cool one of the additional rooms, which should give me enough to match the previous window unit, but still allow me to close the windows in the winter.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1401840000000}

{"reviewTitle":"This is all about managing your expectations folks! It's basically better than nothing...(so far)","reviewDescription":"I would imagine most readers of this review faced the same perplexing questions I did when shopping for a portable AC unit to combat this miserably hot summer. There doesn't seem to be any one unit or brand that stands out above the rest...The reviews on any given unit can range from enthusiastic raves, to calling them expensive paperweights...So, in a nutshell, it really is a crapshoot, and you sort of roll the dice with any of these machines I think...Now, specifically on this Whynter unit, here are my observations:First of all, it is a bit overpriced for the build quality, design, and ease of assembly. The window kit (as noted by others) is complete garbage, and you are pretty much forced to make your own if you want to optimize the unit's already somewhat mediocre performance. (See photo)  The hoses didn't want to screw into the plastic vent pieces too well, so get your HVAC tape ready to use liberally. It has a very cheap feel and some ill fitting parts like the filter on the back. For something that purports to cool up to 500 sq ft, this thing barely cools down my 320 sq ft, master bedroom after blasting for about a half an hour...Now for the \"glass half full\" portion of this review.  Does this AC ultimately provide (some) relief from bruising, sleep depriving heat in a small space? Yes it does...While your room won't get \"cold\" as it would with a central AC unit, a mini-split ductless, or even a good quality\/high BTU window unit, it will take the edge off the heat, and make life more bearable in your home. Just don't expect miracles...I live in a condo, so I had no choice but to use this type of set up due to HOA restrictions...I haven't had any complaints about the noise it generates but these things are pretty darn loud...I can't speak to durability really because I have only had it a couple of weeks, but I bought an extended warranty, (which I never do) just in case. I also put a water heater drip pan underneath to protect my hardwood floors, just in case things go wonky and it decides to leak. Make sure you insulate the exhaust hose, and put it above the air intake one.  To summarize, you are hedging your bets with just about any of these portable AC units.  This Whynter unit seems probably slightly above average, but only time will tell. It gets (a somewhat subdued 3 star C+ rating.)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1534636800000}

{"reviewTitle":"I would not recommend this unit for a large room","reviewDescription":"This is a review of the Whynter 14,000 BTU ARC-14S. I have had this unit for 3 months now, during the summer months. It is still running now, but it really isn\u2019t spectacular keeping the room cold, it seems to lower the temperature about 5 degrees or so. Its 80 now, and the unit shows it\u2019s 75 in the house, I guess that is better than nothing. But for the price, I would have expected better performance and a little quitter. The sound is about the same as 3 to 4 large fans running. This was put into a room that is about 20\u2019 X 25\u2019 and it\u2019s a bugger to install. At the same time I got the Whynter, I purchased a LifeSmart 8,000 BTU A\/C for the bedroom, at about one third the cost! That unit out preforms this unit hands down. The first thing I noticed was that it took about 5 minutes to install the LifeSmart A.C. it was basically a plug and play unit. With the Whynter, it took about 2 days to get it installed. I had to make my own window fitting, attach the hoses to this fitting, and connect the hoses. The window fitting that came with the unit was only made for a small regular window, I didn\u2019t see that in the specs, it said it was adjustable, maybe a foot or so! My window is not that big, and it is a lot smaller than the one the LifeSmart A\/C is using. This unit might be good for a smaller room, but for the price I would expect it to handle a little bigger room than the 8,000 BTU unit. The 8,000 unit cools a 16\u2019 X 18\u2019 room, probably this is a good size for the ARC-14s. I have both units running right now, the bedroom that has the 8,000 BTU unit and the temperature is 69 degrees, and in the living room, which has the 14,000 BTU unit (ARC-14S), it is 75 degrees. I would not recommend this unit for a large room, it may work in a smaller room though.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1439942400000}

Very disappointed.EARLIER REVIEW:Bought the air conditioner and had two people carry it up the stairs carefully. It sat by the corner window for the summer without being touched - cooled the room as expected, but was a bit loud.I have hardwood flooring, and at the end of the summer, disconnected everything and rolled it away from the window. There were no snags, or bumps, but the plastic housing for the wheels broke causing one of the 4 wheels to sink into the unit. No damage to the unit, and it works still but now I cannot move it easily, and it has to be propped up with a block to stay balanced.I reached out to Whynter and I was told that I had to package the unit and spend $80 to ship it back and forth because it had been too many days since purchase. I had not kept the original package or shipping material so this is a little onerous. I am disappointed in the construction of the unit as there was no misuse.The rest of the plastic shell is also cheap, the vent fell apart almost immediately, and was not repairable. The bottom of the casing is splitting apart. Again the unit still works ok, but for this price point, I would have expected better.

{"reviewTitle":"Badly designed vent and wheels.","reviewDescription":"I bought this because the reviews seemed to be generally good. I needed a portable air conditioner I could move from my office during the day to the bedroom at night. The bedroom is only 300 square feet and the office is roughly 500. The first thing I noticed is that it cools the bedroom down nicely, but not any better than a standard $300.00 window air conditioner. The office however it seems it can no keep up and I have to have the vent directly on me all day (Southern California so its hot), so the 14000 BTU rating might be based on what they estimate output to be but not actual cooling ability. I had a 8000 btu window unit that used to cool just fine but opted to remove it and buy this unit instead of a second unit for the bedroom.On to the blower, the fan is not great. The blower does not seem to get air across the room leaving cool\/warm spots and it seems a lot of this has to do with the vent itself. It is not designed well and no matter the position it tends to just blow air straight up. I had to rig a cardboard piece across the gap in front of the vent in order to re-direct air in the direction the vent is pointing.Now for the real reason I give this one star. The wheels. I have been using this on and off for the last month and moving it back and forth between rooms, within a week or so one of the wheels broke. The plastic mount it is attached to simply pushed into the machine. Within another week, the second wheel went, I assume from having to handle the weight from the first one.

The hose should not be round at the window end, but oblong, with a smaller profile. The window piece is easy to put in, but a real pain to take out of the window. The sliding piece is stopped by the screws and thus we had to take out all the screws to get it out of the window. Second time I was so frustrated I just yanked the damn thing out of the window, almost breaking it. Extremely poor design with no product testing.Second, the hose hookups into the machine are impossible to pull out. This is noted by many people online. You have to pull so hard, its ridiculously difficult. Even online videos say pull hard. But this isnt a normal pull hard - its really hard. Like putting your knee on the unit and almost breaking the attachments. There is no way to fit my skinny fingers into the clasping unit to even try to help the removal process. Extremely bad design and very disappointed.Exept for the entire hose system - which is a major part of set up and breaking down - its good. But I would not buy again if I could find a better design.Also, buy the separate filter for the intake hose. Why isnt this include? Its a cheap piece of plastic that they sell way overpriced at $25!

{"reviewTitle":"Good AC, bad dehumidifer","reviewDescription":"I purchased the ARC-14S to hopefully replace a dead dehumidifier and dying window AC with a single unit for a 1000sqft finished basement.  I purchased it on recommendation from a family member that owns one and loves it.  Unfortunately it doesn't work very well as a dehumidifier for me.  I tried it on dehumidify and cool modes, with all kinds of configurations of the hoses connected out the window, but unfortunately it was never able to get the humidity below 60%.  It either made the room warm up to 80F and 70%+ humidity, or it cooled the room down to 68F and still 65-70% humidity.  I even contacted Whynter support and they basically told me to use different configurations of hoses (exhaust on but intake off, exhaust off but intake on, both on, both off) and while some were better than others, none worked well for dehumidifying.For cooling, it works great.  It's able to get the basement down to 70F or below within a few hours.  So if you need an air conditioner and can't manage a window unit, this is good.  But if you have humidity that you want to remove, it's not that great.Also of note, it's a massive power hog.  I wish I realized it before I purchased it or I probably wouldn't have bought it, but it draws up to 11A\/120V, or about 1300W.  That's a lot.  Unfortunately the only place that I can put it are either on a circuit with my kitchen's microwave, or with a refrigerator.  I opted for the microwave circuit because at least then I would notice when that circuit trips, rather than not noticing for a while and losing our second refrigerator worth of food.  I will have to add a circuit for just the microwave, and that's not a problem caused by the AC, but just an unfortunate that it is so power hungry.In the end I'm going to have to purchase another standalone dehumidifier and just use this for cooling as needed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1693699200000}

{"reviewTitle":"The AC works well, but read the warranty prior to purchase!","reviewDescription":"I have mixed emotions about this AC unit.First, the good:1.  It was easy to assemble and get the unit up and running, and it does cool the space as advertised.2.  I have not noticed my electric bill going up much, so it seems to be pretty efficient.3.  It does not seem to be any louder than any window unit I have had, so it is not hard to be in the same room with.4.  It pulls lots of moisture out of the air.  Very good for people in Florida.Next, the not so good:1.  After 1 1\/2 months of use, it kept filling up with water, requiring draining.  The drain is VERY close to the floor, so it is hard to get any reasonably sized container under it.  It holds a substantial amount of water, so you need to be ready to get the plug back in the drain hole to empty your container, or you get to mop the floor.2.  Upon reading the manual, it said that if the unit fills up frequently, you should contact customer service.  Upon doing so, they indicated it was probably the condenser fan, which apparently blows the hot exhaust air onto the water to evaporate it for exhaust, had probably disconnected or failed.  They offered to send a replacement fan. or to accept the unit for warranty repair.3.  Please note that while the unit has a one year warranty, you are responsible for shipping it to California after the first two months.  You are also expected to keep the 'box' the unit was shipped in for return shipment.  I use the term 'box' because the packaging essentially fell apart after the shipping straps were cut.  The styrofoam was all crushed beyond re-use -- I know, that's what it is there for, to crush and protect the unit.  Finally, the box would require half a closet to store.4.  I had asked if there was any sort of drain kit available, and was directed to another website for the kit.  A white, corrugated 84 inch hose was shown, for a price of $20.  I got a 12 inch piece of vinyl tubing.  (To seller's credit, after I complained, they did ship the white hose.)

The 76 reading is from when it was 88 outside around 5pm with inside air temp being 79.1 and the setting on the AC is at 68 which i always have it set to and yes its on the cooling mode with the snowflake. very sad that it stopped working correctly :(","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684108800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Recommend for small bedrooms","reviewDescription":"Pros:* It does an amazing job of cooling my bedroom which is ~150 sqft. I would NOT recommend this for a big shared space such as a living room. I think its rated for 500sqt for something but I am skeptical at that claim.* Relatively easy setupCons:* The biggest issue I have with it is actually software related, not hardware related. The way their cooling algorithms works, they allow a 5 degree buffer before starting the AC. This means that this AC does NOT keep the temperature that you set it at all the time and only checks every 15 minutes or so. You would think that the AC would say \"Hey, I'm set to 75 degree, but the room is 79 degrees, I better lower the room temperature\", but it doesn't. Because of the 5 degree buffer, it waits until it reaches 80 degrees and THEN turns itself on.What does this mean? This means that you can get wildly inconsistent temperatures. You want the room to never go above 75 degrees? You have to set the temperature to 70 (which might be too cold for some people). This wouldn't have been an issue if the temperature buffer was something more reasonable like 2 or so degrees, but 5 is way too much in my opinion. I've been woken up multiple times during hot summer nights because setting the temperature to 78 (which is good enough for summer) made it get uncomfortably hot in the middle of the night when it shot up to the low 80s and the AC decided it wasn't time to turn on.* Lack of directional control for the fan -- It only shoots straight up.

I have old push out casement windows with newer sliding storm windows inside, so  I have the outside casement window ajar slightly and then slid the plastic piece that came with the unit between the frame and the storm window. There is no foam or anything malleable to hold the window piece in, so I fit my sliding window as tightly as I could and secured it with packing tape, which I intended on replacing with foam tape or duct tape, but as far as I can tell it seems to be working just fine.I don't use the remote, but have been enjoying the timer feature. I set the timer when I leave for work and when I come home the unit has been on for about an hour and it's much more bearable upstairs. We haven't hit too many 90+ days yet this summer to really see what this thing can do, but so far my husband and I (who are both generally people who run hot) have been able to sleep comfortably with the blanket on.It does use a lot of I power, although I live in an old garage apartment with presumably old electrical.

{"reviewTitle":"Noisy, hard to believe Good Housekeeping recommended.","reviewDescription":"I bought this air conditioner solely on the Good Housekeeping recommendation that I read about on the Amazon site. Since receiving it and using it now for most of the summer months, there are both good and bad things to report.The good: It has for the most part kept up with cooling our living room and kitchen area, which is what we bought it for. This unit replaces a window air conditioner rated at 10000 btu which had no problem cooing the area. At 14000 btu's, I would have thought that we could have hung meat in the kitchen, but that is not the case. Hot days, the units compressor never shuts off, and is obviously taxed to the maximum trying to keep the temperature at the set 72 degrees, which it never gets to. So I guess the \"good\" isn't really all that great.Now for the \"bad\". There's plenty to complain about since the first day. The unit is noisy, and not just air blowing out from the fan. We have a Gree 10000 btu unit at the other end of the house in our bedroom which is much quieter and frankly blows the Wynter away in it's cooling ability. The Wynter unit also has an annoying bussing sound which is emanating from parts unknown whenever the compressor is running, which is most of the time. I can lean on the unit and usually get the buzzing to stop, but it becomes tiring to stand there all day holding one's hand on the air conditioner to alleviate the sound annoyance. Setting it on an area rug and an occasional 'thump\" on the top sometimes works for a while.The controls on the front of the unit were obviously designed by a three year old, because you need vision like a hawk and have to be able to lean down to about 2 feet off the ground to try to interpret the hieroglyphics that are used in place of actual words for each button function. The remote is equally useless, as the buttons are impossible to understand.The latest issue I discovered is shown in the picture. How in the world a bug got into the control screen on the front of the unit, who knows?

{"reviewTitle":"Has potential, but needs some help.","reviewDescription":"I have had this unit for just over a year. It still works. I think the numbers on these units are theoretical and not actual. This unit seems to have the potential to move 14,000 BTU\u2019s, but not without some help. Many complaints say that the hot air hose leaks at the unit. This is true. The couplers for the hoses are very cheap and do not seal. They are also very easy to break when connecting or disconnecting. The hot air exhaust is also located just below the room air intake for the unit. Without making some changes, the unit will inhale its own hot air and become very inefficient( it just will not cool the room). I removed the outer shell of this unit (probably voiding any warranty) and noticed a host of internal design issues. Mostly just a lack of thermal barriers between the hot lower side of the unit and the cold upper side. One by one I sealed holes and gaps and then applied a fiberglass and foil tape on the bottom side of the internal divider wall. I also removed the plastic spokes on the intake and exhaust where the hoses plug in to increase the air flow. I made a dam with a piece of cardboard on the lower 3 inches all the way across the evaporator intake(cold upper section) to prevent the cold side from inhaling hot air from near the hose connection. Last I used weather strip to better seal the hose connections and prevent hot air leaking back into the room. These changes dramatically increased the efficiency of the unit finally allowed it to reach its potential. I was able to maintain a 25 degree temperature difference inside my 2 car garage on a 113 degree day.I doubt that any of the units you have looked at can reach their full potential without some kind of crafty intervention. So you should expect a large degree of BS in the numbers given. Always go as big as you can afford on the cooling potential of the unit.

{"reviewTitle":"The square footage is roughly half of what this unit is rated for but because of the poor venting it does not cool the room","reviewDescription":"I bought this as it has same specs as a Haier unit and even looks very similar and saved me a trip to a home improvement store and having to transport a 100 pound box.  I thought it would be very similar and both were based on a manufacturer reference design.  A couple of the issues I found:The top vent is poorly designed and very small.  When fully closed it has a 1 inch gap to allow cold air to exit the top but blows straight up.  When the vent is fully opened, the vent is 2.75inches deep but does not redirect the air from the 1 inch gap.  The air from the 1 inch redirects the air from the vent so even with the vent fully opened, the air still blows almost straight up at the ceiling and then is pulled back to the return air on the back of the unit creating a small air bubble.  The room I have this unit in as 12 x 22 with a ceiling fan in the middle of the room.  The square footage is roughly half of what this unit is rated for but because of the poor venting it does not cool the room.  I build a plenum to place over the venum and direct the airflow forward.  Not the room cools as it should.The next issue I found is that the unit creates negative pressure in the room even though it is a dual hose unit.  This should not be the case but it is constantly pulling in moist warm air from outside the room so my relative humidity hovers around 65%.  I do understand the relationship between the cooling power of the unit and the size of the room, but that is not the case as the unit is not cycling on and off and the Haier unit did not have this problem.  This room does have several computers and the sun sets over this corner of the house.This unit does cool quite well, the observed temperature difference between the return air and vent is 24 degrees and the squirrel cage fan used for the vent does move a lot of air.

{"reviewTitle":"Nice Cooler With Unexpected Problem","reviewDescription":"This is my review of the Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air conditioner. The unit blows air out at a temp of around 59 degrees F, so cooling is what would be expected from an A\/C this size. The reason I bought this unit was because of the dual hose system. I expected the input air to be used to cool the compressor and the condenser and not pull air from the room which would cause a negative pressure and pull hot air in from other rooms. However, the amount of air being pulled into the intake hose does not equal the amount of air being exhausted to the outside through the exhaust hose. Now I didn't measure the difference so I can't state the specific air flow through each hose, but it was easy to discover. All I had to do was stand under the central air conditioning system's intake in my apartment and feel the blast of hot air being pulled into the room. My apartment is on the second floor so all the A\/C duct work runs through the hot attic. Obviously, the unit is pulling air from the room along with the air being pulled from outside through the intake hose and pulling air from other rooms. At this point without taking the unit apart, I can't tell if the pulling of air from the room is by design or if there is a manufacturing defect that allows the room air to be pulled through in combination with the intake hose and then exhausted. If it wasn't for the hot air being sucked into my space, this unit would be top rated by me as it has sufficient cooling power. As it is though, I can only reach around 85 or 86 degrees with the outdoor temperature at around 100 degrees. Also with the cold air vent blowing up to the ceiling, I purchased a 4\" x 12\" 90 degree A\/C duct vent at a home supply place that fits perfectly over the top vent and directs the air straight out from the front of the unit. As for Amazon, delivery was fast and the packaging was in great shape. The unit arrived without a scratch.

As soon as the desired temperature is reached and the compressor turns off, all of the humidity that supposedly gets blown out of the exhaust hose is instead collected at the bottom of the unit and blown back into the room.This design flaw is absolutely maddening for a $500 device. I'd much rather have to empty a drain bucket every few hours than deal with 70+% humidity and gross, clammy skin and uncomfortable sleeping environment.I even tried connecting a drain hose to the back and elevated the front casters to push the liquid out but there is simply too much water and it won't drain completely. This allows a bulk of the collected moisture to evaporate back into the room and makes it disgustingly moist.So when the compressor kicks back on, it's now cold and damp.

The cooling is inconsistent with the machine shutting off for long periods making our bedroom have drastic temperature shifts over the night. Where we live it gets around 90 degrees during the night and we keep the room around 66 degrees. The unit will often let temperature reach over 75 degrees before kicking on and we often wake up sweating during the night. The unit will sometimes self turn off for long periods and turn on for inconsistent frequencies, sometimes it seems to just stop cooling until I cycle through its other settings. Also, sometimes the fan seems to run between cooling cycles and sometimes it does not. Sometimes the cooling just never turn on.

{"reviewTitle":"Unhappy","reviewDescription":"So, I decided after I turned 70 last spring that it wasn\u2019t a good idea for me to install window air conditioners. I looked into portable air conditioners and decided that Whynter air conditioners seemed a good bet. Accordingly, I purchased two of them in 2016.During the 2016 season, all seemed fine. I live in Maine where it where it can be pretty chilly, even in summer, so I didn\u2019t use them a lot.As I said, in April 2016, I bought two Whynter air conditioners, but one of them stopped working properly after one night in the new summer season of 2017.  Apparently, the evaporating system was not working. That\u2019s actually a good thing that it stopped working, because I had read horror stories of people finding that their flooring was ruined because of leaks that happened when air conditioners malfunctioned, leaking water on their floors and carpets. I was happy that the carpeting and flooring were not ruined.Anyway, Amazon suggested that I contact Whynter troubleshooting, so I did that. I learned that either I had a bad connection or a bad fan (the one that evaporates the water). Whynter sent me images to do the troubleshooting.Unfortunately for me, the first image showed the air conditioner without the intake\/outtake hoses. Not being technologically savvy, I didn\u2019t realize that that meant I needed to start from there\u2014without the hoses.  That\u2019s probably my fault for being stupid, but still I think they should have been clear and specifically stated to take them off. Later on, that posed a problem, but friends helped me to solve this problem\u2014at length\u2026.But the final image showed an air conditioner that wasn\u2019t similar to mine. When I emailed the tech person, he said it wasn\u2019t a problem. I emailed him back saying that it was because the connections I was supposed to be looking for were in the box I didn\u2019t have\u2026He then decided that I had done all the troubleshooting that I could do and suggested sending my machine back to Whynter. He gave me an estimate for a repair that seemed sensible, even with the cost of sending the air conditioner via UPS. It was a lot of money (around $350 shipping and repair costs) , but still less than the cost of a new air conditioner at $500.So I sent my air conditioner back, and about a month later (delayed because of wild fires in California) I got an air conditioner back. I say an air conditioner because I did not receive MY air conditioner.I was never told that I would receive a refurbished air conditioner back, not necessarily my own, repaired. The one I received was clearly not my own which was practically brand new. Remember, I live In Maine, where I probably use an air conditioner ten or fifteen days absolute maximum during the summer season.This one I received had scratches on it, had a ventilator that would not hold open, and had a non-functioning light that was supposed to turn on in the dark to show temperature, functions, etc.  Furthermore,  I did not receive back the charcoal activated filter which I had not retained at home as I had expected that my own air conditioner would be returned to me, repaired. To do Wynter credit, upon my complaint, they did replace the filter (as a one-time courtesy), but they told me that I could find the other accessories online\u2026 They were pretty snippy about replacing the charcoal activated filter, reminding me that it had to be replaced every two months or so. Like I didn\u2019t know\u2026I spent a great deal of money to keep this air conditioner going, and I would NEVER purchase another Whynter product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1504569600000}

In air conditioning mode, the unit blows 99% humidity (as seen in my photo) when the fan is on high. When the fan is on low it drops to 96% humidity. The room this is tested in is 50% humid. These tests were done with the intake drawing air from the room, instead of outside. That means that it only has to fight the 50% humidity of the indoor air for exhausting humidity, and it still fails. It is not magiaclly exhausting the condensation out the exhaust duct. It is concentrating the humidity and blowing it right back into the room. The manual expects you to not connect the unit to a window if you want to dehumidify. Based on the horrific dehumidification efficiency, in air conditioning mode, with the benefit of room air as intake, this unit will do nothing but heat a room if you use it as a dehumidifier.

{"reviewTitle":"Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air Conditioner","reviewDescription":"I would not recommend this AC unit.I purchased this unit at the end of June after my old portable AC unit finally stopped working after 10 years of use.  In August, out side temperature got hot, sometimes around 90 degree.It did not work at all.  My room never got colder than 5~7 degree below the outside temperature.  I installed everything right as in the manual.Out side was 90 degree and inside was 84 degree while it was on.  My room is 400 sf.  normal hight ceiling.  Insulated well and no big windows.I contacted the customer service.  I got this answer. \"If the unit is blowing cool air out of the front and hot air out of the exhaust hose, then the unit is working properly.Portable air conditioner solutions are differentiate from wall mount units and central air conditioning in many ways. One way is that the thermometer of the air conditioner is located at the back of the unit where hot air is generated. Also, the output air into the room is within 10-15 degrees less than the ambient temperature. Please understand that portable air conditioners work of the air in the room. What generally happens is the unit will draw out the heat and humidity in the air, but the air extracted from the room gets replaced by other air coming into the room from outside through ceilings, tiny openings, under the doors, etc... For example, as the outside temperature goes down, the unit will work more efficiently to cool a room.We suggest that you uninstall the intake hose and leave the unit with one hose only (exhaust hose).  The unit will work as a single hose unit. The dual hose portable air conditioner comes with one air intake hose and one air exhaust hose, the air intake hose pulls air into the portable air conditioner from the outside to cool off the compressor and condenser coil. The hot air generated from the air conditioner is then expelled out the exhaust hose.  Operationally, a dual hose portable air conditioner has two main advantages over a single hose unit. A dual hose portable air conditioner will cool a room faster and will help minimize negative air pressure situation in the room. If the outside temperature is much higher than the room temperature, you can block the intake hose and it will function like a single hose unit.\"To me this answer sounds like \" that is what you will get from this unit, just deal with it \".  Just a fan worked better in a way.I tried as single hose unit, but no difference.  Amazon was kind enough to let me return it even after 30 day from the purchase date.

{"reviewTitle":"Extremely loud, extremely large, extremely bad","reviewDescription":"I purchased this air conditioner to replace an old window unit in our small bedroom window with the hopes of improving our cooling, reducing A\/C noise, and improving our light (due to less of the window being used. Boy, was this an absolute failure.First off, this thing is extraordinarily loud. It is impossible to even be in the bedroom with it on. Its noise comes from several sources:1. The air rushing in and out the two hoses is perhaps the loudest noise, and there doesn't seem to be any way to reduce it. I have tried bending the hoses this way and that, and nothing does it. It's just insanely loud.2. The fan that blows cool air into the room is also very loud - the second loudest thing. Even on low, it is much, much too loud. Even turning the unit into fan-only you can't possibly use this thing as a fan.3. The compressor is very loud. Really, really loud.4. There are annoying hums\/rattles. The construction is just very poor, and the big empty water container and the components rub against each other and rattle and make annoying hums. (Think of the occasional resonant hum you might get on a water cooler when the water is at just the wrong level, or something.) This is the most distracting noise because it's not \"white noise\" like the other noises. I spent a huge amount of time moving it this way and that and pushing and pulling things to get this to go away and it just doesn't go.On top of all this, it's just plain huge. It's probably 3 feet high (higher even than the windowsill!) and more than a foot deep. It makes our radiant heat radiator look small (which of course it is because it has to fit underneath the window). It's just ludicrously large.The vent on top can't be pointed anywhere but straight ahead. Yes, it has extraordinarily small louvers that imply that air can be directed left or right, but they just plain don't work. To aim the air you have to move the whole unit left and right, and in doing so you will probably make the noise from the air hoses louder. The more turns, the louder the noise.Finally, it came in a box that makes it nearly impossible to pack back up and return. It was two separate pieces that fall apart when you cut the straps holding it together. The bottom just falls right out. Now how am I going to return it?The bottom line is that this is just plain a horrible air conditioner. In my 17 years of doing business with Amazon, this is absolutely, bar none, the worst purchase I have made and the biggest waste of hundreds of dollars I have ever spent. I will try to figure out how to return it. I believe Amazon is doing people a disservice by offering this for sale and I sincerely hope that my review will help people decide about this model.

Contacted Whynter support who were very helpful and said the compressor or condenser was no longer working.  They tried to be helpful and give me a discount for a new one, unfortunately the discount only applies to a single store that charges MSRP with a rather large shipping cost, making it cheaper to get a similar unit from Amazon or elsewhere.End of the day, the product should last much, much longer with the limited use it was given and was noisy.

At first, the unit seemed like it would be great based on the reviews, but after a few weeks of giving it a chance and making adjustments, I noticed some very poor behavior:1) before the temperature reaches its lowest setting, the compressor will cycle on and off every 5 minutes.  So on for 5, off for 5.  No AC I know does this  until it's target temperature is reached.  And yes, I checked for hose obstructions like 100 times.  It's not that.2)  When the AC cycles and you have the fan on high, the fan will turn to low.  This is a very disturbing change in sound when you are sleeping.  The best case you can do is leave the fan on low and just have the AC compressor cycle on and off every 5 minutes.3) The unit seems like it is cooling better than it is.  Set the unit to 61 and it will start cycling around 70-72 degrees.  You aren't getting the room to 60 something degrees no matter what you do.  14k BTUs should get a 20x12 room to 60 something degrees (Standard 8 ft ceiling).My conclusion:  don't buy.  Waste of a lot of money.  Even if you're renting (as I am) and don't have any normal vertical sliding windows, find another way.

The first one lasted 2 weeks before the internal fan started making a constant whining noise that drove my wife and I nuts.  Amazon shipped out another at no change and picked the other one.  5 starts for Amazon customer service.  Also the first one as well as the second one when the compressor starts inside the unit the unit vibrates extremely loud.  We tried it on hard wood and carpet and the unit still vibrates so damn loud.  If I would put pressure on the sides of the unit when it was running the vibration noise would stop.  As soon as I released my hand pressure the loud vibration would come back.  I tried pushing the unit up next to our dresser drawers with a sock half way up the unit in between the AC and the dresser to keep pressure on the side of the AC.  It helped a little cutting the vibration noise now.  Now we like noise in the bedroom when we sleep.  I sleep with a 20\" fan on high and the AC was so loud it would wake us up at night.  Ya it was that bad.  The second unit lasted 2 months.  After a month Amazon wont take it back and you have to deal with the manufacturer.  The second AC makes an odd howling noise off and on when the fan is running.  I called Whynter and they want me to ship it back to them.  I have no way to ship it back to them.  The original box is long gone and the thing weighs around 100 lbs give or take.  You'd think they would have someone come out and repair it but they don't.

After all of that time consuming and difficult work, it still doesn't work. I emailed again (calling doesn't help).  My options are for them to send a replacement part for what they THINK MIGHT be the problem but there are no guarantees that it will work.  Also, I have to replace it myself.

Starting in May of 2014 one of my associates suggested that I try out some of the new Portable AC technologies of which could allow me as a technology consultant to use, test and then recommend to my clients. Myself along with my clients ranging from real-estate owners to large scale warehouse businesses have a common need which is the ability to cool one small room without having to run central air and cool the whole building. Also portable AC(s) can serve as a single room backup in the event of central air failure. I purchased my first Whynter ARC-14S in May 2014 with the expectation of purchasing 3 more at another location if I like the first one. By March of 2015 the first ARC-14S was still performing great so I purchased 3 more (two ARC-14SH and one ARC-12SH).Now In June 2015, the very first one stopped working and considering it was just after the warranty expiration, I decided to replace it rather than try to get it fixed because Whynter's return policy states that you need to do the following:1. Box it up in the original packaging (if you still have it).2. Pay two-way shipping if it is over 2 months old ( Labor and Parts are covered)3. Pay labor if it is out of 1 yr warranty (only compressor is covered)For a busy executive with a $450.00 item this process is not worth it. Shipping will cost $250.00Now the last straw is that in August of 2015, I purchased and replaced the first one with a ARC-143MX which performed perfect until Sept 24th 2015 when it started to Draw 18 amps \/ 2250 watts of power from it's dedicated circuit before it shuts itself down.

{"reviewTitle":"Failed with E1 error after a month of use and is just, generally, such a pain.","reviewDescription":"I hate this thing so much. Attached are the pictures I was sent to fix the unit when it stopped working after a month of light use. If you have an animal- or live in a hot place and having an AC is a safety measure- I would avoid this one as it's incredibly unreliable.First of all, it was difficult to set up. There weren't great instructions and the hoses are very cumbersome. Now, I feel like an AC unit shouldn't really *need* to come with assembly instructions- they're usually pretty easy to set up. But this one does- nothing intuitively locks into place- so you have no idea if what you're doing is correct or you're about to break something. The plastic weirdly seems both very cheap while also very rigid and a piece broke off as I was attaching them.After I finally got it set up, however, it worked great. If I never had to touch the thing again- solid 4 star review.Then it stopped working after a month of light usage giving me an E1 error. The instructions I got to fix it was to completely disassemble the unit so that I could reattach the temperature sensor. No problem- I have a drill except a some of the screws are recessed back like 4 inches through a series of like, internal tunnels that none of my many screwdrivers were able to get to.This thing is kind of like a piece of IKEA furniture. God help you if you ever have to take it apart and re-assemble it. Even taking off the filter cover is a pain- it either snaps in place very tightly and is difficult to remove or it just kind of weirdly loosely fits on. Which is correct? Who knows? I just feel like cleaning an AC filter- which is routine maintenance- shouldn't take 10 minutes of fiddling and second guessing myself.I had a window AC unit that was half the price, took up no space, and cooled the same area that worked with virtually no maintenance for 6 years. I would still have it if my apartment complex didn't ban them. Get yourself a window unit if you can. They are SO much better.EDIT: So, the company sent me another unit, which is working great without asking me to send back my old one. My maintenance guy was eventually able to fix it and we donated it to an older person in my complex who did not have AC. I've left up the instructions on how to fix it- in case anyone else runs into the same issue and their instrument isn't under warranty.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1654905600000}

I removed an ancient through wall unit that sounded like a grain truck running and developed my own dual hose system using HVAC elbows. I will note that outside I have an extension to prevent the hot air from immediate intake. This seems to work. The air going out of the unit it HOT. The intake needs a filter. Don\u2019t neglect that. One year we sucked in Yellowjackets and other various insects. This unit has maintained the roughly 500 sq ft and complimented the adjacent room AC of roughly half the BTU to be sufficient in cooling the entire ~1500sq ft upstairs. The only time it gets mildly uncomfortable are the days when it\u2019s over 95. Thankfully those are rare, but the system still keeps it around 70-80 during peak direct sunlight. This is clearly not as effective as say a mini split or central air, but it does the job. We will be replacing the adjacent room AC with another of these this year. They\u2019re that good.

{"reviewTitle":"Solid units IF you make some key fixes!","reviewDescription":"I purchased two of these Whynter units for my home in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it's rather uncommon to have central air in an older house.  I also have two of the TP-Link Smart Outlets monitoring the power utilization of these, and based on my tier of $0.39\/Kw, they cost about $50-$70 per unit per month to operate.  Well worth it with the following adjustments.  Although it's fairly well known that these units are not as efficient or affective as their window-mount counterparts, they seem to get the job done, with a few DIY tweaks:(1) Make your own window mount!!!The window mounts that these units come with have two major issues: (1) the intake and exhaust vents are too close together, meaning that the intake will tend to suck in some of the hot air that the exhaust is pushing out, making the AC's job that much more difficult.  When you build your own window mount, you have the option of spreading these ducts out, and thus alleviating this issue.  (2) the mount is very flimsy and not at all insulated, meaning you're likely to have some hot air from outside seeping in around your mount.  This is especially true if you opt not to use the intake hose, because you will be pulling a vacuum on your room (air being pushed out, but not replaced with external air, meaning your room has a low pressure zone) which in turn pulls hot air in from the outside and makes it quite difficult to cool a room.  Long story short, use both the intake and exhaust hoses!!!  I've posted a picture of the mount I made from a sheet of sanded plywood ($14 at Home Depot), using a jigsaw (Black & Decker, $25 on amazon), and some MD 2097 weather stripping to get a good seal ($3 on amazon).  This mount made a MASSIVE difference in my ability to cool the room, and came with the added benefit of blocking out light (we have shutters that had to stay all the way open for the hoses to be in place).  I'm still needing to build another window mount for my second unit, but I've attached photos showing the improvement.(2) Heat wrap your exhaust hose!The exhaust hose on these units gets super warm when the AC unit is in operation.  That heat escapes back into the room you're trying to cool, having pretty significant effects.  I purchased the Reflectix DW1202504 Spiral Duct Wrap ($21 on amazon) and it was enough to do two exhaust hoses (1 for each of my AC units).  There's no need to wrap your intake hose.  It took a bit of work to get this wrap cut to size, especially for the curved areas (I am nowhere near a clothing manufacturer), but through some trial and error I found that a S curve in the middle of the sheet allowed the wrap to fit snug around corners.  I've attached a photo of the finished product for the exhaust hose.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"964 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1476057600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Works really well but dont expect too much","reviewDescription":"So this does work very well. I was just expecting it to work better for the price. Love the dual hose design but it does take up more room. Was pretty easy to install and configure. Water doesnt build up in the tank because i live in CA so i dont need to drain it. Its always dry here.I live in a studio apartment so i thought it would cool very easy. I do have tall ceilings but i need to close off the kitchen to keep it cold in the living room.I was expecting more from this but in its defense it will keep the place around 75-78 when its 95 outside. The trick is to start running it in the morning when its cold so you're place can STAY cold. If you turn it on mid day its just going to be fighting the heat and you wont get great results.Seems kinda flimsy. Just typical ac components in a plastic housing. Didnt do it at first but its starting to rattle when the compressor shuts off. Glad i bought the extended warranty from amazon because i feel like i might be needing it.Comes with a little storage bag for when you pack it away in the winter.The remote works ok but theres no backlight so its hard to use at night.I guess AC technology has really improved simce the 80s or so since it seems like this is where this ac comes from. It jusy has a new paint job.  The remote has that old style beige color.A plus is that you can run it with one hose if you want but don't see why since this costs way more and you're only paying more for the dual hose feature.If you dont know, the dual hose feature stops the negative pressure created by single hose units. Single hose units use the air in the room to blow outside for cooling the ac. When it does that its creating a vacuum that pulls hot air in from outside. Sooo theyre not as effective as window units. Luckily the dual hose feature in this unit makes it more effecient by keeping all of the cold air im the room and not sucking any out.I expected more from this ac for the price. Was expecting it to turn my place into an ice box. But it still keeps my place pretty cool. Especially during a heat wave, which is where this ac shines.Doesn't get too noisy. Its about as noisy as you would expect. After a while you just naturally ignore it.Thing pulls about 1300 watts just like any other ac when its on max.Has a nice little temp setting so itll shut off at the set temp and keep your place at that temp.

{"reviewTitle":"Quality control issue out of the box otherwise a great unit","reviewDescription":"The \"box in a box\" shipping method worked very well! I had no damage as is often the case with larger items. I did have to hunt for the instructions and carbon filter which were finally located in one of the exhaust tubes, for those of you who order this unit.My chief complaint and why this unit got a 4 star in place of a 5 is due to poor factory quality control.When I unpacked the unit my wife noted a distortion to the plastic around the discharge air vent on the top. I looked closer and realized the plastic plenum that sits atop the fan unit was not seated properly causing everything underneath to bow upward.**I am pretty sure the factory assemblers must have known something was off and struggled to get it assembled judging by the amount of distortion in the plastic**I decided it looked pretty simple to repair and removed a total of 8 screws which allowed me to separate back from front. As I suspected the plenum was not seated correctly and the culprit turned out to be the foam insulating tape that had gotten between the two housings. It was a simple matter to remove all the foam tape and re-seat the plenum. I finished it off with some aluminum tape to replace the foam, reassembled and it looked like new...only better ;-)The efficiency is pretty darn good for a portable, has a scroll compressor. I like the style and lines in comparison to many other weird shaped portables.The noise level was: (as measured with my android)41 dB on low43 dB on medium45-47 dB on high***Installation Update***I found the window kit has a design flaw that allows hot exhaust air to be partially recirculated. To overcome this I went to OSH and picked up a 4\" PVC Thin Wall Elbow and some light filter media. I chose the bottom opening for the exhaust on the window kit and super glued the PVC elbow to the inside of the \"fixture\" pointing down. (See page 6 of the user manual for Identification of Accessories) To be sure it would not break off and for weatherproofing I used silicone sealant around the edge. Installation went as described in the manual although I have to point out the \"window slider kit\" is not very well put together and will require some tweaking and possibly cutting to make it fit.Two things you should plan for.1. Insulate the hot exhaust hose. I chose \"Reflectix DW1202504 Spiral Duct Wrap\" and aluminum tape to tightly hold the wrap together. Insulating the hot exhaust hose reduces the heat radiated back into the room.2. I purchased some light filter media and cut it to fit on the intake pipe for the condenser at the A\/C unit. I didn't want a heavy filter cloth as it would restrict the airflow and impact the cooling capacity. Even a light duty filter will help keep the condenser clean.Overall this unit is quite good on the efficiency scale and it definitely cools the room down...however there are some moderate level fixes that need to be done to get the most from this portable air conditioner.UPDATE IIMany reviewers have noted the noise level and I agree it's noisy when the compressor is running. The reason for this is twofold, when the compressor is running so is the condenser exhaust fan and together they really bump up the noise level.I set about looking for a way to lower the sound level and found that insulating the exhaust hose not only reduces the radiated heat but helps with the sound as well. As for the compressor, looking down into the unit through the intake hole I noticed the compressor sits in a compartment(condenser)that has no sound attenuating materials on the wall, floor or ceiling.My next project is to put\/glue \"some sound masking material\" on these surfaces in the hopes of further reducing the noise.To be continued....","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1400716800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good Support, Questionable Product Quality","reviewDescription":"When we initially received and installed our ARC-14S in June 2021, we were very pleased with the product, instructions, etc.  It worked as advertised provided good cooling to a larger area than advertised, handling some days when it was 110 degrees outside.  When the hot weather was done for the year, we simply vacuumed the filter one last time and left it in place until next needed.  Some six or seven months later, started it up and found no cooling whatsoever coming from the unit.  Both fans and the compressor were operating.Contacted Jose G. at Whynter support since product was still under warranty, although past the free return shipping period.  They were very responsive and we emailed back and forth several times.  They were primarily seeking to determine whether the problem was due to badly blocked air circulation or similar. It was not.  At that point they offered to pay the shipping costs for me to return the unit, even though that part of the warranty was long since past.  A few more messages went back and forth, including one where I photographed the unit with air-flow strips fluttering and a thermometer displaying no cooling.  At that point they offered to send me a brand new unit without any need to return the non-functioning one.  The replacement unit arrived in a timely manner and is functioning perfectly.Lessons learned:  In hopes of preventing this failure from repeating, when our cold season begins, I plan on running the unit for a few minutes once a week.  This is based on a totally wild guess on my part that some component froze up during those many months of being shut down.Regarding the remote control, this works nicely, but you must be within about fifteen feet of the unit and point the control precisely.Bottom line is I am very pleased with the support received from Whytner, 5-stars for that.  Regarding the product itself, it seems good quality, but I am puzzled by the failure to cool when activated after many months of non-use, 3-stars for that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1660694400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Working well in bedroom","reviewDescription":"Purchased this specifically to cool (1) ~350sqft bedroom on hot nights.  It has been used in that capacity for most nights over the past 2 months.With the room at 90F and sun on the exterior wall, it takes about 1.5 hours to bring the room down to 67F.  After that, it does a great job of keeping the temp between 67-68F all night.  Power consumption has been between 5 and 7kwh per night depending on outside temperature, which at our cheap West-coast rates costs about 53 to 74 cents per night.It is a bit louder than expected, but we quickly got used to it.  When first turned on (hot room), the fan runs continuously while the compressor cycles on\/off periodically as needed to cool the air.  If the compressor is not needed for an extended period (i.e., when room is no longer heating back up from outside heat), the fan turns off as well -- then runs for a brief time every few minutes to \"stir the air\".  If the temperature rises again, the unit returns to the \"full time fan \/ cycling compressor\" mode.Remote control works well from 10-15 feet away.  In the event of power outage, the unit resumes operation at the same settings when power is restored.  This also means it can be put on a switched outlet, or smart plug -- but be sure any switch or plug is properly rated for high-amperage devices.  Beware this unit can pull nearly 12A, so it needs the lion's share of a typical 15A household circuit.We have not needed to empty the condensate tray.  In fact, after a few days when I opened the drain port, there was ZERO condensation in the tray.  The unit apparently performs as promised in this regard, evaporating the condensation via the outside exhaust tube, at least in our climate -- with temps in 80's and 90's and humidity 60-80%.So far, two months in, I'm really happy with the unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1660089600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great machine, poor accessories..","reviewDescription":"I really wanted to give this 5 stars and if I were only grading the cooling ability and noise level, I would...BUT, getting this thing properly installed was a chore, mainly because the lack of variability with the accessories. If you don't have the exact kind of windows shown in the examples, you are going to have problems. If the window installation is too long, ur gonna need to cut it and ur gonna need a table saw to do that. If ur like me and dont have a garage full of power tools, ur likely going to have a problem. If its too short, you are going to need to improvise. I had to use cardboard to fill in the gap. Given the pieces you get in the box, I would imagine most ppl will have an extra project on their hands before they can even install the thing. For $400+, I dont expect I should need to do that. Maybe a window installation that adjusts to ur desired length and has all the required pieces to adjust it would have been helpful. Next was the length of the hoses. If you are recommending not extending the hoses more than 9 ft, then why not provide 9 ft long hoses?? Or at least 8.5 ft....Instead, u get two 5 ft hoses. I'm sure I'm not the only one but the first thing I had to do was buy a whole new hose for the exhaust because it wouldnt reach my window. Granted my windows are higher than normal windows and they are set in about two feet but even a 6 ft hose would have reached. Providing a 5 ft hose is pretty limiting and shows a lack or forethought or a lack of appreciation for customers with different window styles. Honestly, having to run out and buy parts before I can even use the machine I just dropped a bunch of money on left a sour taste in my mouth. I almost gave it 3 stars for that but the  thing works so well once u get it hooked up that it wouldnt have been fair. My feedback to the manufacturer is stop being cheap with the accessories! People will pay a little more to save themselves the hassle of needing to make alterations or replace things right out of the box. Oh yeah, and the remote is pretty cheap as well but it works. Its not backlit though, which is another simple thing they could do to imorove the overall customer experience. The price was marked down when I bought it and I see its marked even lower now and I'm glad because, all things considered, had I known then what I know now, I wouldnt pay a dime more than $300 for this machine.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661040000000}

It will work as a two pipe system only if it is installed in a hermetically sealed chamber!  Seriously, it pulls more air from the room than it does from the external air intake hose. If you run a suction test and allow it to pull condenser cooling inlet air from the room and exhaust the condenser cooling outlet into the room, you will discover that the velocity of the inlet is terribly low.  In other words, it pulls air from the room preferentially due to the way it is constructed.  It is a very poor execution of design concept to say the least.So to repeat myself, this is not a true two pipe system.  Their claim that it is a dual hose unit is marketing jive and hype.  Yes, you get two hoses but it simply doesnt operate that way.I have tried to talk to customer service at Whynter and all I get are emails repeating the description of the unit.  I have begged for someone to simply call, no luck!  If you call they will tell you that they will get the technician to contact you via email.  The following emails are sophomoric at best and they are experts at stalling.  You will not get to talk to a person.

Most people raved about how well it worked so I thought I found what I was looking for.  I was sadly disappointed.  I was hoping to use this unit to cool the first floor of my house.  It's just under 500sqft.  The AC unit claims to be able to cool 500sqft so that was the main factor in my decision making.  Set up was rather easy and the unit is very sharp looking but when it came to actually cooling, I was so disappointed, I became angry.  I spent almost $500 on this unit and in the 4-hrs it was on, it cooled my room 2 degrees.  Now I know that it might take a while to cool off a large area, I expected that.  But my 5000 BTU unit in the bedroom cools off my large bedroom very quickly and that is about 220sqft.  I expected much more out of a 14,000 BTU AC unit.  All I could think about was how much energy I was wasting for a 2-degree difference in temperature.  I think the main issue is the design of the air vent.  It's on the top of the unit and when it's fully open, it shoots almost straight up to the ceiling.  I stood in front of the unit and had to extend my arm up to feel the air coming up.  In my opinion, that's a poor design.  Most ceilings are 8' tall so how much energy is wasted cooling the air by my ceiling?  I bet if I was standing on the ceiling, I could have felt a difference.

Inside temperature usually hovers around 72 with this unit.So when it came time to replace the unit I figured a 14k BTU unit should have no issues. But despite running this unit NON STOP on high it couldn't keep the first floor cool despite outside temps hovering around the low to mid 80s. The one day it did go into the high 80s interior temperatures climbed to 76-77 degrees despite running full blast.It makes a moderate amount of noise. Which would be expected for such a large unit, if it also COOLED like a large unit. But from owning 5 or 6 window and portable AC units over the years, I'd say this unit cools very similarly to an 8-9k BTU unit. And if I had paid for an 8-9K BTU unit I'd expect the unit to be overwhelmed, but I paid over $400 for something labeled as 14K BTU.It's not, and it's not even close.But what it does do is burn electricity like it's a 14K BTU unit.

{"reviewTitle":"Great cooling but quirky fan","reviewDescription":"I bought the Whynter ARC-14S to replace an 8 year old ARC-12SD that served me very well, but for the last two summers, the compressor is slow to start. So far, I'm pretty pleased with the 14S even though the Summer has just started. It pumps out air that is almost too cold to stand in front of and airflow is great.However, there is one major operational difference between my old 12SD and the 14S that has been noted on other reviews, which is that the fan turns off when the target temp has been reached and back on when the temp climbs above the target. This is a problem for me in that my brain depends on predictable white noise to sleep well. The fan turning off and on during the night wakes me up (and also startles the cats who are sleeping on me). I contacted Whynter support and they verified that there is no way to override this behavior. I considered returning the unit based on this, but decided that my experience with the 12SD, high positive reviews, price, customer service and overall general satisfaction was enough to keep it.Given time, I think my brain (and the cats) could adjust after a while but I believe I have found a better workaround. If I let the unit run until target temp has been reached and then change it to dehumidify mode, the fan stays on all night and the temp remains at the current room temp. At least that has been my experience on not-so-hot Spring nights. Once the real heat kicks in, I may find I'm wrong. We'll have to see. If not, then I guess i will just have to endure some sleepless nights until I adjust.FYI - This was Whynter's response to my inquiry:Thank you for contacting us regarding your Whynter ARC-14S Portable Air Conditioner. Please note that the air conditioner has a 5\u00b0 F temperature cushion; if the set temperature is within 5\u00b0F of the ambient temperature, the fan will switch to low speed and run approximately 5 minutes before it shuts off. The fan will activate again and run for 1 minute to circulate air in the room and detect the ambient room temperature. If the room temperature is higher than 5\u00b0 F of the set temperature, the compressor will turn on and the fan will run at the set speed. Please also note that there is no way to override this behavior. You may try to set the fan speed to low to minimize the fan noise whenever it runs back.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716854400000}

This AC unit was the only one that showed up on most of the sites.I was looking for a portable: (to roll into other rooms) with dual hoses and BTU above 5,000 to cool 500 to 800 sf.Energy Star (to save on electric bills), and something that is durable, reliable & will last (time will tell)The dual hose design is more efficient in its ability to easily cool down my 500-square-foot living room. The unit is fairly large but rolls around easily on wood floors. This AC is on the quieter side as well, I still watch TV with no problem. This unit offers excellent cooling for my living room, providing a comfortable environment even on the hottest days.The setup was easy. The most difficult part was snapping the hose couplings to the a\/c unit. The vent hoses can be tricky to line up with the tabs and get snapped into place properly. I like that I can remove the hose unit from the window when not in use.Overall, it does what I need it to do, and am very satisfied with my purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1721433600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great Customer Service!","reviewDescription":"I had purchased a Whynter air conditioner two years ago and it had been working perfectly until recently. It started shutting down after running for only 30 minutes, which was very frustrating and inconvenient. I contacted Whynter customer service and emailed with Jose, who was very helpful and courteous. He informed me that my warranty had expired two months ago, but he offered to extend it as a one-time gesture of goodwill. He also suggested some troubleshooting steps to try, but when they did not work, he arranged for me to send the unit back for service. He assured me that Whynter would cover the return shipping and repair or replacement costs. To my surprise and delight, I received a new air conditioner in less than three days! I was amazed by the speed and efficiency of service, and by Jose's professionalism and kindness. Whynter went above and beyond to resolve my issue and made me a very satisfied customer.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723593600000}

Snapping the fixtures into the unit was a VERY TIGHT fit, almost to the point that I was afraid of snapping the plastic tabs. Hoping this doesn't become an issue when I put the unit away for the season. The unit is a bit loud but it's our 2nd unit kept by our bedside as I couldn't install it elsewhere so it's right next to me. We use it when it gets to the 100+ feels since we are on a 3rd floor apartment and it becomes unbearable up here. The unit keeps us nice n cold on those rough weather nights. It does it's job. While keeping it at its coldest setting I noticed condensation build up on top of the unit which I wiped away every morning and haven't noticed any negative impact on function. Although we don't use this daily, just when the heat is extreme. I cleaned the filter and that was easy to do. You do not get any insulation\/foam stripping with the unit which I found strange so I had to purchase my own in addition to the unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1721779200000}

One is an exhaust hose which blows hot air out, and the other is an intake hose - and the side-by-side to the window attachment. I don't understand why I would want to intake the hot outside air (and also possibly some hot exhaust air too) and run it through the ac instead of intaking the (presumably) cooler air from the interior of the house. Oh well, I'm sure some engineer who is smarter than me knows why. Either way, it seems like a good ac, and it keeps our kitchen and living room area cool during the 100 degree days.

{"reviewTitle":"Not bad for a portable AC, but beware portables are generally not very efficient","reviewDescription":"I wanted to get a portable AC because I couldn't get a window AC easily. The apartment I live in required special permission from the landlord to allow window ACs, and happens to have horizontal sliding windows, so installing a window AC was not an option, and after 2 crazy summer months, we were headed into another heat wave (+105F), so I went ahead and bought this. I bought it specifically because it was a dual hose, since I've had neighbors who had single hose ACs and returned them within days for inefficiency.It got here pretty fast, thanks to Amazon Prime. I installed it after waiting a couple of hours (literally could not wait in the heat), and within the days after made some slight adjustments to make it really efficient. Based on the most helpful reviews, I bought an additional filter for the intake hose, shortened the exhaust hose as much as possible, bought an extension for the outside so that the hot air from the exhaust could be directed away from the intake, spent quite some time with foil, padding and guerrilla tape to make sure no air would go in or out unless it was through the AC.One significant design flaw was the window kit. While it was easy to set up, when extended it could not block out the entire width. I'm sure this was pointed out in the reviews as well. But anyways, it wasn't anything that wasn't fixable.I also bought some additional tools to really isolate the exhaust heat, because let me tell you that thing got crazy hot.I installed it in my living room, which is connected to the kitchen. Put together they are less than 300 square feet. There's two beds and one bath, each bed is about 120 square feet. All together the apartment is about 650 square feet. I tested it out on good days (below 98F) with all the doors shut, just testing how cool the living room got. It could bring it down to about 70F, but nothing beyond that. And after placing a couple of fans I had from earlier in the summer, sometimes I naturally left only one bedroom door open and tried to circulate the air to cool it down. I never opened the door to the other bedroom because no one was living there.On most days, it was sufficient enough to both keep the place cool, especially when I'd cook. It was sufficient enough to keep my room at living temperature for me, which is about 74 F. On the really hot days, which we even hit a record of 110 F, I just moved my desk, chair and everything to the living room, shut the bedroom doors and just spent the entire day in the living room. Usually I'd have to wait until 1 AM so that I could cool down my room to a level at which I could sleep.I'm not going to lie, it was a life saver for me. I didn't get much sleep during the one month I had it on account of the noise of both the unit and the 4 fans I placed everywhere to circulate air. But I imagine I'd do a lot worse without it. For anyone who's only option is a portable, it can definitely get the job done for a small apartment. I probably wouldn't have even minded sleeping on the couch as long as it was bearable.In the end, it had the basics to allow me to live through the hell that was August 2021, but it just wasn't in general the best solution. I finally managed to get permission for a window unit, and went along with one of those and returned this one, again shoutout to Prime for that.I knew the window ACs were going to be better, because my neighbor (whose apartment is bigger than mine), had one that he got for a lot less than this, and it actually brought the temperature down to below 70 when he set it to that level. It perfectly cooled down his room on the other side of the apartment, and the living room. This one, I kept it at 61 F the whole time I had it.As for returning it, I knew for certain I wasn't able to pack it. One: the padding was a bit damaged when I was unpacking it. Two: the seal around it had to be cut in order for me to open it. The only return options were UPS dropoff and pickup. Initially I chose pickup, but I called customer service after and told them about the situation. They quickly changed it from UPS to a pickup company. They came, just took it in the original box without any serious packaging, and said they were going to pack it in the warehouse or something before shipping. Overall, good return experience as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1630886400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Big time cooling","reviewDescription":"First I must give props to Amazon. I ordered this unit on Saturday, it was delivered on Sunday, and Hurricane Beryl hit Houston on Monday. I lost power, got my generator running and set up the Whynter portable air conditioner. Set up was easy but with a couple of caveats. I did have to trim the window inserts but that was easy and didn't take much time. Surprisingly the most difficult feature was snapping the hose couplings to the a\/c unit. It took some jockeying to finally get them to snap into place (and an equal amount of time spent removing the unit). The unit started up perfectly using my generator power. Cold air blew strongly and made the bedroom livable after the oppressive Houston heat. I was impressed with how quickly the room cooled down (only about 20 minutes). The unit did produce noise, but it was not overly intrusive. My wife likened it white noise and helped mask the running generator. Overall, the unit is a solid quality build. It is relatively large, about the size of a mini fridge. It rolls easily on hard surfaces and not too bad on my short nap carpet. I've only had it a week and hope it holds up for years but during this power outage it has performed admirably.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"33 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1720828800000}

Not in the  Manual, the reviews or  the  videos.  The water drain spout is located at the very bottom of the back of the machine.  It did not come with a drain hose, which I purchased. I can connect the hose but sadly,  it will not drain into a bucket or any container that is not at ground level.  The machine must be elevated  to drain into a container.  The AC weighs 80 - 100 pounds.  When the water tank fills up, the machine shuts down.  My carpet around the  AC is soaked - the machine produces a lot of water, at least in high temperatures.

{"reviewTitle":"Very powerful, but needed a ton of modifications","reviewDescription":"To start, if you can get a window unit instead, go with that option. Just like any portable, this unit is going to be less energy efficient and nowhere near as powerful as a window unit. My window unit cools a room faster and for way less on the power bill than this. However, I moved into a new rental with an attic bedroom with small horizontal sliding windows, so this was my only option.I\u2019ll start with the cons, this unit took almost 2 hours to install and it took two sets of hands. The hoses do not screw into the plastic very well, and the pieces meant to snap in take a lot of strength to get into place. And you\u2019ll snap one and the other side will fall off. Also, the window panel is not very adjustable. It didn\u2019t fit my window and I know there can be a lot of variation in windows but they could provide something to cut it with or a different method of adjusting it. My only option was to take it to a hardware store to get it cut because I don\u2019t own a table saw. It really should come with insulating foam like every other air conditioner to fill any gaps between the window and the panel but it doesn\u2019t and this was yet another thing I had to buy separately to get it to fit without large gaps for hot air to enter. It would also be better if something was included to insulate the exhaust hose because it does get pretty hot. Finally, the vent should be more adjustable. It can really only blow upwards, and with it being as tall as a mini refrigerator, if you have a low to the ground bed, it will blow up toward the ceiling and not towards your bed. I had to literally duct tape cardboard on the top and sides of the vent to direct the air more towards my bed.As for the pros with all of these modifications aside, I was able to get this unit on sale almost half off. I wouldn\u2019t pay full price for it but it is powerful for the $350 I paid. It cooled my entire attic bedroom from mid-90\u2019s in August heat to 70 in about an hour. It\u2019s also very quiet. It\u2019s quieter than a window unit. Even when the compressor and fan alternate I notice very little difference in sound. It\u2019s like the same level of noise as rain outside. This is important for me because I sleep right next to it and I am a very light sleeper. The timer function is the best thing about it, because my room usually cools off by 4am or so, so I can set it to shut off at that time so it isn\u2019t running constantly. It remains to be seen how efficient it is. I will only be running it at night but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see the increase in my power bill soon enough. It hasn\u2019t tripped my breakers as I saw it was doing to some other people. We have very old wiring in this rental and I was worried but so far so good. I would still be careful what you have plugged in and running on the same circuit with it.Overall, it does what I need it to do. I\u2019d rate it higher if they tweaked the installation kit and allowed more range of adjustment for the fan.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692403200000}

{"reviewTitle":"For fellow San Francisco Bay Areans with weird (and massive) windows. Take heart. It works.","reviewDescription":"Long story short: After last year's (2017) all time record temps during the summer (at one point surpassing 106 F) I decided the long held normalcy of no air conditioning in SF apartments was no longer feasible for our health. (Asthma, COPD, heart issues all afflict our family.) But, like many SF Bay Areans, we have weird\/gigantic windows - 58 inches tall, and horizontally sliding - which are also misshapen, have no screens, no screens that FIT them, etc. etc. Our apartments just aren't built for the expectation of genuinely hot weather here.Between that, our 750 sq ft living space, with an adjoining kitchen (which energy star says should increase our required BTUs) finding an AC that didn't break the bank - as renters who can't just install a professional system even if we could afford it - was nigh impossible. To say nothing of the HUMIDITY here (routinely 80+% even in cool weather,) and that none of us are particularly handy with customization or plywood lol.Thankfully, after much research, we took a gamble on this AC, and with some improvisation and work, I'm happy to report it works wonderfully. (Wonderfully meaning, even set to 70 F, it gets absolutely frigid in here, so presumably even in summer it'll be at least effective enough to avoid feeling like we're dying like last year lol.)What we did:1) Bought the optional intake filter parts https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00URTELE0\/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (Two of them, since for us the main use will be to keep insects out - we have bees and other unwanted bugs outside.) Attached them to the inside of the window kit circles, instead of to the intake and exhaust ports of the AC unit itself. Screwed them in with the included screws.2) Installed the included window kit with the attached filters as directed, with the holes on top of one another, vertically, instead of horizontally.3) Cut several pieces of stiff cardboard into the shape and size of the remaining gap above the window kit's end point.4) Wrapped good quality gaffer tape several layers deep around those cardboard layers to form a relatively airtight block of cardboard https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00GZE3UJ8\/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (Leaving nothing exposed whatsoever.)5) Slid the window shut as tight as we could get it, and used the aforementioned gaffer tape to fill in the gaps around both the window kit and the cardboard (due to the fact that our windows are misshapen) and to secure the window kit and cardboard to the inside of our window.6) Cut some activated carbon prefilter material https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B075CGH938\/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 into the right shape to fit inside the BOTTOM filter\/hole in the window kit, so as to filter incoming air. Fastened it to the inside of the filter housing with the same gaffer tape. I also used this same material to replace the included prefilter in the AC unit itself, since it only came with one square (was supposed to be two, or one rectangle, according to the included instructions) with the same material, cut to fit. No problems so far with this.7) Installed the hoses as directed, with the exhaust going to the top hole in the window (heat rises) and the intake on the bottom.8) Insulated the remaining gaps in the hoses, attachments, and locking mechanisms of said hoses, which came with this AC unit, using the same gaffer tape, as best we could. (We were certain this would never work, because there would be no way gaffer tape could make things impermeable enough to actually get proper heat removal happening... but we were fortunately wrong.)9) Cut a plastic urinal, the kind from Walgreens or CVS with an angled neck, from top to bottom near the side, such that the slant of the neck is retained, but the resulting \"slice\" is incredibly shallow. This is to drain the unit into when condensate accumulates in it (particularly critical living where we do) if you have the unit, as we do, on CARPET, and don't want to take everything apart to cart the unit - which is quite heavy - to an ideal spot for tipping to drain it... which we don't, in part due to the aforementioned health issues. On carpet, this unit's weight makes it sink down, meaning if you try to tip it into the recommended draining receptacles you might run into trouble as we did. But this super thin urinal \"slice\" worked perfectly for us. Anything of a similar nature should also work.RESULTS:Turning it on, even on the default 78 F setting, on cool mode (which also dehumidifies,) was INSTANTANEOUSLY noticeable. I'm an insomniac who needs to be freezing cold at night to sleep, so I set it lower - 70 F - to achieve the ideal temperature I need. I just run it during the afternoon or for a little while before bed, and it stays absolutely frosty in here.It feels wonderful and works like a charm, despite our solution for installation being unorthodox, shoddy, and practically held together with gum and shoestring lol. As an asthmatic and allergy sufferer who also has a dedicated room air filter, I can say that this set up - probably owing to the prefilter material and constant recycling of interior air with new fresh, filtered air coming in - makes the air in my room feel GREAT, better than the dedicated filter alone by far, and actually helps my respiratory symptoms! Go figure.All in all, quite satisfied. One star off only for the lack of sufficient included prefilter, as stated earlier.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1522972800000}

I've been looking for a dual hose unit to augment my master bedroom that's at the far reaches of the ranch.  This unit has a broad range of reviews, but seemed to weigh in more heavily at the positive end of the spectrum, so I went for it.I let it sit for well over 24 hours before turning it on, not knowing in what orientation it had been transported in by UPS.  During that time I built a custom fit insert for the awning window the intake\/exhaust vents were going to.  I used a 1\" piece of foam board and two 6\" starting collar take off fittings that the intake\/exhaust hoses fit snugly inside.This construct fit very snugly inside the window frame and I placed a section of high efficiency foam filter material with rigid plastic lattice backing between the intake collar and the window screen - to minimize dust intake.Everything connected up tightly and I finally was ready to power it up.  I did.  As soon as the condenser fan kicked on I noticed an odd noise, above the sound of the fan itself.  A noise any knowledgeable handi-person would recognize as not being right.  It was more of a rattle than a constant noise, coming from somewhere inside the unit.Off come the intake\/exhaust hoses, out comes the flashlight... and wow, is that squirrel cage fan assembly really wobbling that out of round?!  I cycled the compressor off and as the condenser fan slowed down it became obvious how far out the fan assembly was, oh, and the noise stopped as soon as the fan motor was de-energized.  I estimate the fan assembly to be at least 1\/8\" offset from being centered.  These plastic fan assemblies are typically single piece castings, so there is no provision for \"centering\" them on the motor shaft.  And, any attempt to open the unit up would void the limited warranty.  There's no way the fan assembly could have been damaged during shipping without seriously obvious damage to the unit itself.So, this unit clearly wasn't QC'd.  Else, the idiot who did the QC was deaf.Too bad it had this problem.  I did take some temperature readings while it was running and the unit put out cold air at 30 degrees below ambient temperature.

The purpose of buying these units was due to our building having to replace the cooling towers of the air conditioning unit (1-month job). One of the features of the Whynter units, as well as the B&D ones, is that they have a self-evaporating device that, when working correctly, avoids any water build up. The two Black & Decker units have worked continuously and with no problem. However, both of the Whynter units have had water accumulation problems. Specifically, both units (one first and then a couple of weeks later the other) began to drain excess water within less than 30 minutes intervals that cause the unit to shut down. In addition to having to deal with poor quality and performance of the Whynter units, Customer Service was a disaster. Initially, after many attempts, I was able to reach someone by phone and they warned, from the onset, that given the COVID-19 situation, they would be slow in addressing any issues. They were right, after attempting to follow up several times after that initial call, they finally provided an answer via email about one week later for the first non-performing unit. The answer they provided includes a troubleshooting guide the among other complicated procedures instructs you to disassemble the covers of the units (you will require a long Phillips screwdriver and pay attention as it is a bit complex) to check for any loose cables or anything that appears wrong or having to clean any excess dust on the evaporator. I consider myself pretty handy and was eventually able to disassemble the covers and look for anything that appeared wrong. I was not able to identify anything specific issues, so I reassembled unit back. Somehow, that first unit started to work and is still working. In the case of the second unit, about a couple weeks later, the same excess water buildup started (this shuts down the unit and you either have to drain manually or install a continuous drain condensate pump \u2013 both of these defeat the purpose of the product features of these units). Unfortunately, in the case of the second unit after following exactly the same procedure as I did for the first one, it is not working. The unit produces excess water within half an hour after being drained. Once again, it\u2019s been over a week and a half, and NO answer at all from customer service. I had to improvise and buy a condensate pump to drain the excess water so the unit can work! All-together, a terrible experience with Whynter\u2019s product quality and worse with their non-responsive \u201ccustomer service\u201d.

{"reviewTitle":"Bad design, doesn't work properly, wastes electricity!","reviewDescription":"Unless you want to waste electricity & run up your power bill unnecessarily, don't buy this AC! Here's why: when you set it to the temperature you want for the room, once it reaches that temperature, the whole unit will shut off - not just the compressor, but the fan too! Then, only once every 15 minutes, the fan will come on so it can test the temperature of the room again, & it'll turn on the compressor\/AC if the temperature is too high. But in those 15 minutes where it's shut down, the room can get really hot again!I'm sure this is how they were able to obtain the good energy efficiency rating for the unit - because it isn't using power when it shuts off completely for 15 minutes at a time!Also, there is **no option for the user to override this \"energy-efficient\" functionality** so that the fan (and thus, the unit's thermostat & switch for the AC functionality) remains on\/active continuously.Apparently, these units *used to* work that way (according to the manufacturer's response to questions in the Q&A section). But then they CHANGED THE FIRMWARE or something to make them run the way they do now - shutting off when the set temperature is reached - without bothering to add any option to disable the new behavior & keep the fan\/thermostat running continuously.So basically, the only way you can keep the unit running & not shutting off for 15 minutes at a time, is to keep it set to **such a low temperature** that it has to **keep the compressor\/AC running constantly**, thereby totally disabling the \"energy-efficient\" behavior of the unit, keeping the room colder than you want it, & wasting electricity!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1659830400000}

The first one lasted for five seasons, and then stopped working when I started it up for the next season. I had no problems with its function until that time.The second unit was purchased and used summer of 2022 as I recall. When I pulled it out for the second summer, it would not start up. I did have a warranty that I purchased, but that did not come in to play since it was a little less than a year from when I had purchased the unit and was still under factory warranty. Customer service at Whynter helped me with the process of taking off the outer casing to look for any loose wires. There were none. At that point they simply sent me a new AC unit and I have disposed of the old one. So, customer service was very helpful, but I did need to use some basic tools, mostly screwdrivers to open up the unit so that some of the inner workings were visible. I then took pictures of those and sent them in via email attachment in reply to the person helping me.These units are quite heavy so you would want to take them to the floor you\u2019re going to use them on and simply keep them there after installation. It\u2019s not something I would want to carry up and down the stairs twice a year or even just once a year if possible.The unit works very well. It cools nicely and the thermostat does shut down the cooling function once it\u2019s achieve the desired temperature. Remote control worked well for me. Installation is not real hard as long as you can use some basic tools once again. I did have an unusual situation, so made a Custom opening to the outside from my unit . I used wood and the plastic they provided for their standard unit. Most people will not need to do that though!The fact that they simply sent out a new unit was a real relief. It was getting quite hot and sending it in to get fixed and then having them send it back would\u2019ve been a long time without AC! That was much appreciated :-)It does cool a fairly large area, and therefore it can have some pretty good wind speed on the fan and make some noise doing so, but it wasn\u2019t excessive in my opinion.I could understand a unit failing after five years as being probably within the normal life expectancy of a unit although I would hope a good number of them would last longer than that. Since my second unit failed after one season, that\u2019s why I gave four stars instead of five.

{"reviewTitle":"More Positive than negative for me","reviewDescription":"I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the best thing on the market, but I lived in a tiny upstairs apartment with south and east facing windows in 100+ summer heat, and this is the only thing that made life bearable. It is loud, I was always relieved to turn it off when things cooled down at night, cuz I had to turn my tv up pretty loud to hear over it, but it was still so worth it for me.  I think my apartment was somewhere in the 600sqft range, with only one division separating bedroom from kitchen\/main living room area.  So I had it off the kitchen blowing towards the main living room, and it helped so much in keeping the main living space comfortable.Things I liked about it:\u2014Timer: I would often go to work or run errands and leave it running so it wouldn\u2019t be 100 degrees when I got home. Nice to set the timer to shut off by 10 pm (to not bother the neighbors) or just to run for a few hours to balance out the rising heat a bit while I was gone.\u2014Remote:  I\u2019m lazy.\u2014autodrain:  I specifically chose this AC because it had the auto-drain feature.  There is a water catchment in it, but I never once had to drain it in the 1.5 years I ran it.  Wasn\u2019t until I moved out did we discover there was residual water in it, which drained easily out the little capped valve on the side, and was not much. Many other people complained that the units you have to drain either leaked (no thanks) or would shut off when they got full, which was often. Glad I never had to deal with that.\u2014cheap,  or it was cheap for me.  Amazon was selling a \u201clike new\u201d one when I was shopping, which basically means someone took it out of original packaging, but never used it and sent it back.  So it was a lot cheaper but essentially brand new, think I got it for $380, as compared to the $500 it\u2019s sold for now.  So that contributes to why I like it so much, it was a great deal for a lot of heat relief.\u2014does not use a lot of power. My apartment was all electric and an average bill was about $40-50.  In the winter when running the heater and oven a lot, my electric bill was close to $100!! But I ran this AC almost constantly in the summer, and only noticed a $10-15 monthly uptick in my bill, which was so worth it to not come home hot, with headaches, and get no sleep from the heat.Things I didn\u2019t like...\u2014You are pretty limited in the direction the air can blow.  If the vent is fully open it blows upward, so to blow air more outward across the room, the vent has to be tilted down, which basically shuts it. Bad design. I just use fans to help circulate it around.\u2014 The panel that\u2019s goes into the window with the input\/output hoses is too short for a lot of windows.  Even when I extended my panel as long as it would go, I had about a 1 fr gap of open window at the top. The manufacturer should have longer panels or attachments to extend it.\u2014design of window panel is silly.  Instead of putting the input and output hoses away from each other\/on opposite ends of the window panel, they are right next to each other on the window panel.  So the hot air you are pumping out is right next to the pipe that is sucking new air in to be cooled. Bad design.\u2014it\u2019s kind of an eye sore, this big ugly box with these big cheap looking plastic tubes.\u2014it\u2019s pretty loud.All in all, this thing was great for what I needed, and the pros outweighed the nitpicky cons. I would not recommend for spaces more than 300-500 sqft, or if you have high ceilings.

Even though Midea's quality control is terrible, and their customer service even worse, Midea's Inverter Compressor is measurably quieter than the rotary compressor in the Whynter ARC-14S. I measured the decibel level in the mid-60s for the Whynter and mid-40s for the Midea with both on low.Maybe I got a defective unit. Either way, I'm sending it back.

{"reviewTitle":"Works as advertised ... don't expect miracles!","reviewDescription":"I live in a coastal area that stays pretty cool (70's to 80's) most of the summer in comparison to a lot of nearby inland areas, but the past few summers have seen more 90+ days than recent memory, and when it gets that hot here, the humidity makes it pretty miserable, so the first such \"heat wave\" of this summer got me to finally break down and buy this unit, based on price, features, square footage coverage and good reviews.It came fully assembled in one big shipping box, very easy to open ... you just cut the binding straps and pull the whole top of the box off the unit, which rests on a denser, separate cardboard platform\/bottom.  By the time I had gotten the unit, the heat wave that caused me to buy it had eased off, and I had other stuff keeping me busy for a few weeks, so I didn't get started on installing it right away.  When I did, here's what I did.The unit comes with a PVC panel (20\" long\/wide, I think) with two duct holes in it.  It also comes with two extension panels, e.g., if the panel with the holes is too small to cover the window opening you're using.  The panel\/ducts can be configured for vertical or horizontal installation.  You have to use the exhaust port on the AC unit (otherwise the unit will be discharging hot air right back into the area you're trying to cool), but you don't have to use the intake port.  If you don't use the intake, all the air the unit draws in comes from inside the room, through a big square filter on the back of the unit.  If you're only using the exhaust port, the unit comes with two caps ... one to block the intake port on the unit, and a second to cover the corresponding port on the intake\/exhaust panel.Getting the intake\/exhaust panel installed on our \"non-standard\" window (swings out like a door ... doesn't slide up\/down or sideways) was the hardest part.  I had to remove the lowest pane of glass from the window frame and set the panel in the opening (fortunately, the main panel was the exact width of the window opening ... 20 inches), then block the upper portion of the opening not covered by the panel with a separate piece of plywood that I cut to size.Once that was done, the rest was a piece of cake.  Stretch out the ends of the accordion duct supplied with the unit, attach the screw-on duct fittings at both ends, then hook the completed duct to the port on the machine, and the open port on the window panel.  I plugged the machine in, turned it on, and presto ... it immediately started blowing cold air.  The casters on the bottom of the machine work very nicely on any hard surface, and the power cord and expandable ducting allow you to move the machine around in a radius of about 4 feet to direct the air flow where you want.  The discharge vent on top of the machine has two angles ... with 90 degrees being straight up, the highest angle is about 70 degrees, and the next is about 45.The fan on the unit operates at three speeds:  low, medium, high.  At high speed, the unit moves an impressive amount of air.  The unit is fairly quiet (I've heard many window-mount jobs that are a LOT noisier), and does a good job of cooling, but don't expect it to do a whole lot with any room(s) much larger than its rated maximum of 500 square feet.  Best performance\/efficiency is going to be in rooms\/areas smaller than that.  You'll also see a lot of variance depending on how well insulated\/sealed the area is that you're trying to cool.  The more \"chinks in your armor\" here, the more the unit is going to be running and not quite getting you to your desired room temperature.For me personally, perhaps the best thing about this unit is that it simultaneously dehumidifies and cools the air.  It is also self-evaporative.  That means it discharges the water vapor it's collecting from the air through the exhaust port, so that you don't have to worry about draining water from the unit.  If the humidity is particularly high in your area, the collected water may exceed the evaporative capacity of the unit, and cause an auto shutdown.  If this happens, you just pull a little drain plug at the bottom of the unit to empty the internal reservoir and then restart the unit.In sum, I found this unit pretty easy to understand, install and operate, and that it works as advertised, at least so far.  I'll come back and update this review if any problems come up.  The only reason I dinged it one star is that I found the duct fittings a little difficult to press\/turn into place, and even harder to remove, e.g., if you need to do that to change\/re-do something you did wrong, or take the unit out of service\/store it when it isn't being used.I bought a 3-year \"Square Trade\" extension of the manufacturer's 1-year warranty protection, which was offered at a very modest price, and think that's probably a good idea for this kind of appliance, particularly since it's manufactured in China for sale in the US by a relatively new (formed in Jan 2006) California-based LLC, e.g., more limited \"track record\" on reputation\/warranty\/customer service in comparison to long-established US companies like Honeywell and Carrier.  Hopefully, I'll never have to resort to the warranty ... so far, so good.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1533600000000}

Often, vents are towards the bottom of the machine, needing more space- You can purchase a separate intake filter to help keep debris out of the equipment- The noise level is actually quite low. Not hard to sleep while it is running.Cons:- The unit needs to be drained often when in constant use- The location of the drain spout makes it difficult to drain the machine.

Some details I live in a small bedroom which gets the sun at high noon to sunset, gets around 92 to 98 degree F. (outside temperature is about 98-111) On the Hot days, I owned a 10,000 BTU portable from home depot that can cool the room down to about 89-94. I used a laser temp gun. I bought this same unit and found out it works just the same as a my old 10,000 BTU unit. Also realized the second hose is just for show, it doesn't exhaust anything. Really disappointed didn't return it as the packaging is insane to put back together. Just wasted money replacing something I already had. After a year of using this it my original feelings are the same. This unit is not worth the $400 price tag as I bought a generic home depot 10,000 BTU for $200. Here is my opinion. If all things being equal why would you order this online as if your like me you need to repackage it and wait for ups to come to your building to get it. I think the issue is that the unit can not push the cold air out fast enough.To sum it all up, this was to cool a tight 1 bedroom (size of 3 large steps both ways) and this unit still cannot cool it down from 90. On warm days it can bring the heat from 86 to 72 but when it gets 90+ you almost feel no difference. I would say try a diff 14k btu or just save and get a 10k BTU.

Based upon how it performs, I can believe that.  It works somewhat better than a 6000 BTU window unit it replaced.  The convenience of installation and storage each season is the main reason I bought this model and I was hoping to get 50% more cooling.  Nope!  As others have noted, it takes some playing around to figure out the remote.  Set-up was easy but screwing the adapters onto the hoses was annoying.  Its also as loud as or louder than most window units of similar size.  It would not be good in a home office or TV room.  The instructions claim the fan runs continuously in cooling mode but it does not.  After a few cycles of cooling the fan shuts down.  It only starts back up when the temperature increases and the compressor runs.  This was not expected as having the background noise is nice for some people when falling asleep.  All in all was it worth it?  Only time will tell.  If it doesn't last 10 years of 8 hour a day use over 3 months per year I would say definitely not.  At least Whynter is double boxing these now.

{"reviewTitle":"Works as advertised, no current temp readout,has a complete auto shutoff","reviewDescription":"I just bought two of these units to supplement a similar unit we already own.  A few things to know that isn't immediately clear:1:  The units come with two hoses and a complete set of window mounting hardware.  You do not need to buy anything additional to connect both the intake and exhaust hoses if you have traditional sliding windows that you intend to use as your exhaust points.2:  The units complete shut off when the desired temperature is reached.  They will turn off the compressor first, and just run the fan for a while (a minute or three), then turn of the fan.  I like this because it is more efficient that the similar Idylis model I have, which only turns off the compressor but constantly runs the fan, no matter what.3:  The unit does not have a readout of the current temperature, and the LCD backlight turns off after a few seconds of operating the controls.  Since these units obviously have a thermometer built into them, and are billed as \"high end\", upscale looking etc, this is a poor omission.  The Idylis unit I have keeps the nice blue LCD backlight on when operating, and shows the current temperature after a few seconds of the \"target\" temperature being set.My installation is in crank operated casement windows, which normally cannot accept a window unit, or the vent hardware of these units.  I solved that problem by replacing the \"bug screen\" with a cut to measure sheet of .22 inch thick polystyrene (plexiglass that doesn't shatter easily).  I used the exhaust hardware that comes with the unit as a template to cut circular holes in the plexiglass (drill pilot hole, then use skill saw with medium fine blade at high speed and smallest rip setting).  I then mounted the exhaust hardware to the plexiglass sheet for additional rigidity (originally I was just going to mount the hoses right to the sheet, which would also work, but didn't feel rigid enough).So far, both units are humming along nicely and between them, and the Idylis (a 13,000 btu unit that is single hose vented right now) are keeping our 2300 square foot home nice and cool in 90 degree humid New England weather.One unit has developed a slight \"warble\" in it's tone and also spit out a tiny piece of plastic at me (about the size of a flat 2 stud lego piece) on initial start up, but operates perfectly otherwise.The units look \"nice\" but not \"premium\".  The silver is really a grayish plastic, but it is aesthetically pleasant.  It would have been nicer if it had come with dark gray hoses instead of white (that's what the Idylis came with).  The dark gray hose just looks better and doesn't scream \"temporary duct in the middle of your room!\" like the off white ones that come with the Whynter.No idea on efficiency.  Expecting the electric company to start sending me love letters though as these types of units are notoriously inefficient and I'm running three of them until I can afford to install a multi room split unit system in my 1977 ductless home.The remote is ugly.  Compared to the Idylis, which has a plastic, albeit silver\/gray remote that neatly snaps into the front of the unit, this \"upscale\" Whynter unit has an ugly, 1987 Computer Beige remote that is oddly shaped, does not snap into the AC unit in case one doesn't need a remote, and looks incredibly cheap and ugly.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1595721600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Garage shop","reviewDescription":"Bought the Whynter ARC14s for my garage shop. The sun shines right in and it gets too hot to use the space in summer.I fitted a panel in a window for the intake and exhaust and the Whynter fits right under the window. The door is insulatedAnd with it running the space is reasonably comfortable, should allow me another 5 months of working space for my projects.I need to add some whether stripping around the dood as here is some leakage. It is quiet enough and takes little space.The garage is 500 sq ft. Nice. I made an intake filter too should help keep things clean. I may try to separate the intake and exhaustPorts a couple feet so the heat from the exhaust side is farther away from the intake if it has trouble keeping up in full florida summerHeat.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1714780800000}
{"reviewTitle":"does the job and seems to be high quality and sturdy","reviewDescription":"The reviews on this thing are all over the place. Some say it is barely cold, others say it chills the room... Some pretty strong opinions on this thing. This is also highly recommended by many people and websites so I had to try it. I live in an apartment that is about 1000 sq ft. I'm attempting to use this to mostly cool one large room with some excess sent down the hall with a fan to cool another room. This isn't the whole apartment but it is a majority of it. I never buy these type of units because I prefer window units as they are cheaper and cool better. My apartment does not allow window units so this is my only choice and I wanted to buy a unit that will hopefully last.I was not expecting this to work that well but it actually has. It isn't perfect and I'm not going to say it made it chilly everywhere but in the room it's in it's nice and does the job well. The other rooms of the apartment don't get cold but they feel significantly better than they would without this running. The key is to have a nice network of fans to get the air moving in the right direction.The air does kind of come out straight up but there is some limited adjustment you can do to change the direction. Don't expect to be able to set it to blow directly at you though. This is more for cooling the room and distributing the air all over. I like the design choice here because there isn't always a straight path from a window\/door to where you want to cool. This seems like a good method to overcome that.I plan on getting a smaller cheaper unit to cool a single room but this one is great for large areas. It's a shame that all the dual hose units are so expensive. From what I understand the single hose units can create a negative air pressure that causes hot air to be sucked in from the outside through whatever areas it can get through. The window never has a perfect seal so probably there. The dual hose units supposedly solve that issue and that is one of the reasons they work so well.Weight and sound. This thing is a monster. I feel bad for the UPS guy I saw leaving after he lugged this thing down a bunch of stairs. It is very annoying to move around because it doesn't have any handles on it that I can find. If they would have even put some kind of handle or strap on the front in the middle or lower it would be so easy to move. Instead it's just awkward and you shuffle it slowly trying not to tip it. Other units by them have some form of handles, this one does not.. Not a great choice by Whynter. It's pretty loud but not unbearable. You'll definitely know when it kicks on. You can still watch TV with it in the general area. You might have to turn it up a bit but nothing crazy.Overall I am happy with the purchase though. It cools very well. If you were to use it in a single bedroom with the door closed this thing could make it icy cold. I do wish the price was lower but it seems solidly built and I hope the price does reflect the quality and this ends up lasting many many years.The one I got did have a small issue where a little plastic clip was broken off. It doesn't really affect the operation of it but that isn't ideal for a new product. Not sure if it was a defect from the factory or if it happened in shipping. Amazon support took care of me and I'm happy with how things worked out.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1560470400000}
