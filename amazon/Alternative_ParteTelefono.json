{"reviewTitle":"In love with this phone!!","reviewDescription":"This is my second day using it...and I love, love this phone. It is truly like a mini-computer on your hands. I had been going back and forth with it because of its high price, but not regretting a penny thus far. The battery life will last about a day and a half (with all my apps running), the screen is unbelievable, it is super quick, and easy to get around. I'm amazed with the camera, the sound, and the things it can actually do. My only complaint is: No external memory card, but I can even overlook that because it's perfect in every other way. Really much better than the Apple 15. My advice, save a little longer and get this baby; it is worth the extra wait time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722124800000}
{"reviewTitle":"SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone, 512GB","reviewDescription":"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with its impressive 512GB storage capacity, sets a high bar in the smartphone market, offering a blend of cutting-edge technology, sleek design, and robust performance. Here\u2019s a detailed review of this flagship device:### Design and BuildThe Galaxy S24 Ultra features a premium design with a sleek glass front and back, complemented by a sturdy metal frame. Its large, edge-to-edge display is visually stunning, providing an immersive viewing experience. The phone feels solid and well-balanced in hand, though its size might be unwieldy for users with smaller hands.### DisplaySamsung has long been known for its exceptional displays, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra is no exception. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, making it perfect for everything from streaming videos to gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and responsiveness, enhancing the overall user experience.### PerformanceUnder the hood, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor (or Exynos equivalent in some regions), coupled with a generous 12GB of RAM. This combination ensures that the phone can handle intensive tasks, multitasking, and high-end gaming with ease. The 512GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it ideal for power users.### CameraOne of the standout features of the S24 Ultra is its camera system. The quad-camera setup includes a 200MP main sensor, ultra-wide, telephoto, and periscope lenses. The camera delivers exceptional photo and video quality, with sharp details, accurate colors, and impressive low-light performance. The zoom capabilities, up to 100x, allow for capturing distant subjects with surprising clarity.### Battery LifeThe phone boasts a 5000mAh battery, which comfortably lasts a full day of heavy usage. The inclusion of fast charging, both wired and wireless, means you can quickly top up the battery when needed. Additionally, the S24 Ultra supports reverse wireless charging, allowing you to charge other devices on the go.### SoftwareRunning on Samsung\u2019s One UI over Android 14, the Galaxy S24 Ultra provides a smooth and intuitive user interface. Samsung\u2019s software suite offers plenty of customization options and useful features, although some users might find the pre-installed apps and bloatware unnecessary.### Connectivity and ExtrasThe S24 Ultra supports 5G connectivity, ensuring fast data speeds and future-proofing your device. It also includes other high-end features like an under-display fingerprint scanner, facial recognition, and IP68 water and dust resistance. The lack of a headphone jack might be a downside for some, but it\u2019s a common trend in modern smartphones.### PriceAs a flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a premium price tag. The 512GB model, in particular, is an investment, but it justifies the cost with its high-end specifications and features. It\u2019s an excellent choice for those who demand the best in performance, camera quality, and storage capacity.### ConclusionThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 512GB is a powerhouse smartphone that excels in nearly every aspect. From its stunning display and powerful performance to its versatile camera system and ample storage, it\u2019s designed to meet the needs of demanding users. While the price is high and the size may not suit everyone, it stands out as one of the best smartphones available in 2024.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721779200000}
{"reviewTitle":"The perfect phone that doesn't come cheap","reviewDescription":"PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"515 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707955200000}

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING about this phone is phenomenal. I also run a Radar Omega, a weather radar app on this puppy and it just hums along. I haven't been this happy with a smartphone in years, it's incredible. It's a beast though, know that. It's big and unless you fiddle with the settings, not a one handed phone for most. Teamed with an Otterbox Defender case it's well protected. There's no point in spending this kind of cash on a smartphone and cheaping out on the case.

{"reviewTitle":"A monster phone","reviewDescription":"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is an impressive device that offers exceptional battery life, lasting approximately four days. It supports 45-watt super-fast charging, which can fully charge the device in about an hour, depending on the initial battery level. The speakers provide excellent sound quality for a device of its size, comparable to a dedicated speaker. The device has a large screen with thin bezels, inspired by Samsung's Odyssey OLED monitors. The cameras are remarkable, capable of recording 4K videos at 120 frames per second and capturing photos with a resolution of up to 200 megapixels. The phone exudes a premium feel, although it comes at a substantial cost.

Google phones have always put out the best camera software, but the S24 ultra might compete. The anti-glare screen is a feature I never knew I needed. Even in broad daylight with the phone in dark mode it's perfectly readable. The pen works very well and is a nice little add-on.Some don't like the square edges, but I actually do.

{"reviewTitle":"top of the line","reviewDescription":"I upgraded from my Note20.  I really like having the pen which is the main reason I got it.  It has  a cool feature that I use quite a bit where you can hold down the home button and it will analyze whatever is on the screen or whatever you are pointing your camera at and then show you web results.  Or you can circle something on the screen and it will search for that.  Or it will translate text on the screen which can be really useful.  I am particular about how my home screen looks so I really like the feature that can generate an ai picture and use the color palette from the picture to use for the phone theme colors and it can also automatically redo those gawdy standard android icons to ones that look nice with the current wallpaper.  I like the new messages app that works better with those pesky iphone users :). The camera is of course awesome as well as the zoom.  Speakers sound better than my old phone and the battery life is better too.What I dislike most is the sharp corners, they are uncomfortable even with a phone case on.  Also the weight is only about 1\/2 ounce more than my old phone but it is noticeable.  If those issues were fixed then it would be a five star phone.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724630400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Bought it \"Used\" got lucky, came with box looked brand new","reviewDescription":"I've only owned every version of the Note series (now Ultra) since Note 4 (did not own the bendy screen one, just regular). So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, \"hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them\".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's \"USED\" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was \"USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box\". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne\/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"42 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1712620800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Do NOT purchase the Samsung S24 Ultra!","reviewDescription":"Since my S22 Ultra died, I began phone shopping. The S22 Ultra is an amazing phone, however it had several flaws. Nevertheless though, I thought for my next phone I would again go with a Samsung S24 Ultra. I was a little worried, since there have been a lot of people online talking about the S24 Ultra's screen quality being particularly bad for a Samsung device. Usually, the displays on these phones are some of the best. However, people online would talk about how the uniformity on the screen is bad, that there are color banding issues, or that it's extremely grainy relative to their old device. Honestly though, I wanted to order one and find out for myself. Were these issues really that bad, or was it a small problem blown out of proportion?Hoooooh boy...!When my S24 Ultra came in, the first god damn thing I noticed WAS the grain. Jesus christ, that grain. Yes guys, it is serioisly that bad. I believe some S24 Ultras don't have the grain nearly as bad as some others, but the device I recieved had the most atrocious OLED grain I have ever seen in my life. It would just turn any solid color, smooth gradient, and everything really, into a construction paper drawing. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING, IT IS REALLY THAT BAD. Under the glass, it looks like the manufacturers sprinkled colorful moonsand onto the OLED panel. The pictures I'm attaching this review do not do it justice, it is way worse in person and is there regardless of brightness. EVEN AT MAX BRIGHTNESS!!!It's a shame, because the phone is truly amazing otherwise. The cameras aren't as good as the specs and marketing would have you believe, especially with their default shutter speeds and motion handling, but they are certainly good. The performance is OUT of this world! If you're a power user, the S24's overclocked SD 8 Gen 3 is truly the king of Android SoCs, it is unbelievable. Never seen a stutter or hitch on this device when doing anything. It feels amazing to hold, it's weighty and certainly feels premium. The S Pen is an amazing feature, as well as the AI Stuff, the battery life is great. I really, really, really, REALLLY wanted to like this phone but... Yeah, naaaah. The display that my device arrived with is really that bad. Even my old S10e's screen is as smooth as butter, and as beautiful as I remember a proper OLED screen being. This one is just horrible.As for alternatives, I would suggest the Red Magic 9 Pro ($649!!!), the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12r ($700-$800 and $500 respectively), the Z Fold 5\/OnePlus Open (considerably more expensive, but the form factor on those is killer), any of the iPhones, and even the damn S23U! (Gets all the same features as the S24 Ultra, just on a SoC that is marginally slower for practical use, and without the damn sandpaper screen)Incredibly disappointed.

{"reviewTitle":"Be careful of re-labeled products if you order the US Version","reviewDescription":"I ordered the US, Unlocked version and it was sent via a third party seller.  Upon receiving the phone, the box did not look like another one that I had recently purchased for a family member.  There were clear plastic \"circle\" tamper seals on the box, not the black \"pull to open\" and \"do not accept if broken\" security stickers.  Upon opening up the box, the phone appeared to be ok, correct size, weight and every camera lens did have a sensor behind it, however, it did not seem to have the cut-out below the power button for the MMW 5G antenna.  This is a dead give-away that the phone is not really a US version and would potentially be incompatible with 5G in future areas were MMW might be deployed (its not currently an issue today as far as I know).  I was able to check the IMEI online to determine that the model number of the IMEI was a Canadian variant that has different 5G antennas inside. I was able to process the return, and was worried that the 3rd party seller would give me a hard time or claim that I did something to the phone but they did not so kudos to them. They did not seem to think anything was wrong with the phone when i talked to them, i essentially returned it based on it not looking like an identical phone that i had purchased a month before and they were ok with that.  I do not know if the seller knows their device is really a Canadian version IMEI repackaged as a US version phone, but buyer beware.  Might be best to just buy this one direct from Amazon to make the returns less painful.  The process for this return took several weeks and a few phone calls to get my money refunded to my account, a bit more stressful than a Kohl's dropoff.  If the boxes stickers look off, or printed with blurry text, or the phone doesn't have the cut-out below the power button...you aren't getting an unlocked US version and you should return it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"44 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719878400000}

This is right out of the box what the phone looks like and what my immediate experience is. Mind you this is not an inexpensive phone. The terrible quality control on display here is shameful. For starters the first thing I noticed was the nic of three pretty obvious scratches to the right of the front facing camera just as I peeled off the screen factory sticker. Then I started looking around seeing if there was anything else thinking I might be able to live with it and sure enough there was a few scratches around the metal camera bumpers which yeah maybe I could of lived with that too. But the worst was the s-pen, IT IS STUCK IN THE PHONE :(...... Shameful. And it looks like quality control knew because it looks like they tried to dislodge it and get it to come out. The reality here is that they knew about that and decided to package the phone and ship it out only for someone (me) to discover. Like what were they thinking, someone would just be cool with that. This is a flag ship phone and Samsung is doing this? Very concerning, downgrades the brand in my mind. I had high hopes for this, I'm coming from an s21 ultra and was super excited to get this. Very disappointed as I am pretty invested into the Samsung ecosystem, now I'm thinking about returning my Galaxy watch 7 I just got and just going to the OnePlus 12....cheaper anyways.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724371200000}

Here are some of the major issues I've encountered:1. HDR Video Sync Issues: When recording in HDR, the audio and video go out of sync after just two minutes. This is unacceptable for a flagship device.2. Video Recording Freezes: While recording, the video isn\u2019t smooth at all. It freezes for a second quite frequently, and this is very noticeable in the final video.3. App Performance Issues: Many apps don\u2019t run smoothly. I've had issues with several apps not updating correctly, like emails that only appear after 10 refreshes.4. Lens Switching in Video Recording: Switching between lenses during video recording is anything but smooth. It feels more like a choppy 12 frames-per-second video, which ruins the recording quality.For a phone in this price range, these problems are unacceptable.

It made me appreciate how much better the iPhone truly is. The display, which was supposed to be a standout feature, turned out to be very disappointing. I bought the S24 Ultra to replace my main phone, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and placing them side by side just highlighted the S24 Ultra's dull and washed-out display. Ironically, the iPhone's display, made by Samsung, offers a way better experience with more depth and sharpness, looking crystal clear from every angle. The S24 Ultra's display sadly has a green tint when viewed from different angles, an issue that I believe has persisted since the S8 and S9 models. The speaker on this $1,000 phone sounds cheap and muffled, whereas the iPhone's speaker is clear, warm, and delivers distinct bass. I had forgotten about battery anxiety with the iPhone until I used this phone; the battery drains quickly and barely lasts a full day on a single charge. Switching lenses between cameras are significantly slower and more laggy.

I've been a Samsung loyalist mainly because it's the best Android option, not for any other reason.  That being said, it's time for a change.I wanted to segregate the apps from my old phone and what would become my new phone, so I tried manually transferring data and the only apps I wanted on the new phone.  I planned to use my old phone for GP App use, so less apps would have direct access to my primary cell phone (I'd use mobile hotspot as needed).  It didn't go smooth, maybe it was my impatience, but there was an awful amount of bloatware and AI non-sense that no one needs.  I tried uninstalling what I could and got only so far.  Then I just gave up and used the Samsung app to drag everything from the old phone to the new phone.  It was OK but bloatware reappeared.  I wasn't happy because it neither adopted all of my prior phones settings, and neither all of my new phones settings...just an odd combo of each.My main grievance was that the battery drained so fast WITH NO USE.  After buying this phone, I still used my prior phone mostly at home and my laptop as well.  I rarely used the new phone for anything.  The battery simply drained dramatically for no reason.  I checked what apps were the cause and 1.  didn't list any apps used other than what I actually did use 2.  I think Windows Defender or whatever the Samsung equivalent is, was the primary source?  But even then, the % was so low.  But why go from 100% charge to 75% overnight, while I'm sleeping?  No thanks.  I gave it 2 weeks and this didn't change.  I thought some smartypants AI non-sense would adjust it, like I read somewhere but no dice.Also, somehow this phone\/software kept backing up data I did NOT want backed up and in any cloud.  With the primary competitor to this phone the Pixel, a Google phone, I'm not sure what Android options remain.  I'm leaning towards a Tablet I can carry around and connect via Mobile Hotspot for apps and other uses.I also had mediocre data and cell reception quality.

The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself \"would you do it for one person?\". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"30 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721260800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Bugs and issues, unknown if all can be fixed with updates","reviewDescription":"The bad:Screen colors recently fixed so I upped the stars to 3Reception is middling (compared to my Note 20 Ultra it's a bit worse)Camera white balance is straight green\/blue and images\/video are just darkWide angle camera is not as wide as my Note 20 and no better qualityWhen on speakerphone, the top speaker cuts out if you get close to the top speaker.Generally jagged user experience due to a bunch of Samsung crap that cannot be removed.Bloody expensive for something that's delivered in this state.The meh:Batt life is good (not great, just good) only if run in 60hz and low power mode.In low power mode at 120hz the batt life is merely acceptable.All compared to my 3yr old note 20 in low power 60hz mode which is just below acceptable.The good:The antireflective coating on the screen is genuinely amazingThe 120hz on the screen is uber smooth but unfortunately hits the battThe rest is fine; not different from my Note 20 UltraThere's a thread on the Samsung forum that's thousands of posts long about these same issues I've brought up here. The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3\/7\/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green\/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green\/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland\/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"230 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706918400000}

The fingerprint sensor is a little better now as well.Keep in mind the AI is only free for now. They will start to charge you monthly in 2025 to use it. Which is odd, since they make money off the data they take from your phone and the AI you enter, since you must be logged in to a Samsung account to use it. As well you are training their AI for free. So keep that in mind when buying. I rarely use the AI, so no big deal.Overall, I find my old Note20 Ultra to be far superior for me.

The Samsung switch app made porting all my apps and emails messages calls and everything else from my old phone to this one a breeze just downloaded the app on my old phone connected them both to the same wifi network and clicked begin and it did the rest. As far as connecting it to my carrier (metro by T-mobile) all I had to do was contact customer care and register this phones IMEI number with them and then I was able to remove my Sim card from my old phone and put it in this one and that was it now I have a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra on the metro network.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721865600000}

But most of the reviews on here are very good, so I went with it.Packaging was OK. Comes in the original box, with all the accessories (charging cord, SIM tray pick and paper manual), but was slightly sloppily taped together in place of the original tear-away seals. Phone was missing the plastic removeable screen protector, as expected, and was instead placed in a plastic bag (though, not an ESD bag).Physically the phone showed up in basically perfect condition. No blemishes on the screen, back or edges. The only thing I found was a slight scratch on the silver ring of the outside of the top rear camera. But you can no longer see it after I installed a camera bump protector. Camera lenses themselves were untouched, which is the important part.S-pen works as intended. Phone was properly factory reset and it fired up as intended. Phone has been working flawlessly since it was received. Speakers, cameras, bluetooth, wifi, sim\/network, all good. This was a great deal and I'm happy I went with it. It was like getting a big discount for basically a brand new phone.

I would have like to have a slot for an SD card included, and also an aux port to use wired headphones, etc..I do like the flat screen vs the rounded edge one of the Note9...easier to scroll flat. The speakers are OK, but sound a bit tinny compared to the Note9. It's a little heavy for one-handed use. The Bluetooth is wonky...does not stay connected to devices...consistently and repeatedly connects and disconnects...and reconnects and disconnects...over and over and over again.I'm getting used to it's quirks...was almost ready to return it. A phone that costs over $1k should not act up like this. Also, putting all of the buttons on one side of the phone is silly.

The screen resolution is higher, true but makes little difference in real life applications and videos. Same screen size as my note 10 plus 6.8 and no memory card. Is much heavier than the note 10 and bulky and the flat screen doesn't make much difference. To be truthful most users don't get to use not even 50% of the feature that these phones offer including me. So why not concentrate their resources in a truly better screen experience and interactive features that can be used in a day-to-day basis like email and chats. This phone doesn't justify the high price tag of $1675 retail by Samsung website. At least I got a better price here in Amazon, so I don't feel that bad. This phone will be replaced soon, I'm pretty sure.  I apologize for pointing out the not too good things, but I feel disappointed, I had higher expectations from a $1600 cell phone.

The Note 4 was good in general, but the S7 really took the performance crown. Then came the S20U. Gorgeous display and had a SD Card slot. However, the camera was absolute and still is terrible. Can't focus on anything properly and wide shots were all bent at the edges.S24U Review starts now (I got mine early from t-mobile with build ending in: AWM9)Pros1. Flat Screen is absolutely perfect, no more rounded dust collecting edges and easier to apply tempered glass.2. Camera is superior compared to the S20U (well, any camera is...) and trades blows with the S7 and S8 and the macro camera on S24 helps with getting everything in focus and not just having the horrible higher DOF where most things are blurred out, so basically, you don't have to dance around to get everything in focus.3. It's fast.4. Still allows a nano sim card.5. Modes, I love this app, allows you to customize profiles for the phone based on your criteria and set it to run at a given time, like setting wallpaper, wifi on or off, screen color and blue light filter and so much more.Cons:1. Super AMOLED screen has been crippled to 85% DCI-P3. Looks like a cheap LCD screen. Vivid\/Natural modes do nothing. Blue light filter makes it worse. Whites look bluish. It's like having a Ferrari and the manufacturer puts on governor on it because it goes to fast. It's a super amoled screen, give users the option of washed out, natural, vivid and ultra vivid, not just washed out.Don't take my word for it, go to your local carrier store and bring in your current Galaxy phone or just compare it to other phones in the store, it's that bad. If you have the S23U, it's not really an upgrade, it's more like a refresh that offers a flat display, but almost everything else is the same except for the washed out display and 10x optical dropped to 5x optical but with a higher resolution sensor.2. Camera doesn't take accurate colors, auto white balance doesn't work properly on macro shots.2. No charger (only a charging cable.)3. No SD Card slot.Notes:1. Forget about AI, between privacy and the fact they will be charging you for it at the end 2025, it's not worth. They are basically trying to get you hooked on it for a couple of years and then starting charging you for it once you rely on it. According to the Samsung product page: \"Galaxy AI features by Samsung will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices.\"2. 7 years of updates. Does that mean they allow you to change the battery during year 3 or 4? Of course not, and there's no battery service they offered either to make it last that long. It's a gimmick. Just like 10 year warranties on washing machines for the motor only, while everything breaks down before 10 years.3. I can't say if there's any detriment with the new AR glass, because the color saturation is so poor. If that's fixed, I'll update this review appropriately.4. I find my S20U gets brighter then the claimed max 2600 nits of this phone.Bottom line, I'm returning mine if Samsung doesn't fix the washed out display and the color issue on the camera. If they can fix that, it's a great phone, just don't get hooked on the AI unless you're willing to pay for it in the future.\"The Dynamic AMOLED 2X display on Galaxy S24 Ultra received a certification from VDE Germany for 100 percent Mobile Color Volume in the DCI-P3 color range, which means your images aren\u2019t washed out and you\u2019ll get unbelievably vivid colors regardless of differing levels of brightness. The display can achieve peak brightness of up to 2600 nits, improving the contrast between dark and light aspects of digital content for a more brilliant picture quality, with a 5,000,000:1 contrast ratio to make your mobile experience more immersive. \"\"Update 3\/11\/2024While Samsung did provide an update to address the lack of vividness, it was wrong of them to dismiss users early on saying this was an intended and ignoring all users for a month. With that said, it's still a disappointment. The new anti-reflective screen reduces the wet\/glossy look of the color saturation. For the use case of anti-reflective screens, maybe one hour a day, it takes away the entire rest of the time. If we wanted anti-reflective or for those who really need it for whatever reason, they could buy a anti-reflective screen....now we are all stuck with it, except for the S24 and S24 Plus models. Wonderful. Spend over $1400 on a phone for a glass screen that reduces image quality, while the cheaper models offer a better visual experience.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707091200000}

I decided to use a picture as part of my review for this phone. Again loving this phone and the pictures are amazing.Loving the feel, look and style.Set-up was easy.  There is a slot for a SIM card (although not required to use cell phone) it made set-up so easy for me. I installed my Cricket SIM card, got it connected the network & WiFi and got it going.  The phone eventually prompted me (asked me)  to switch over the to internal eSIM card which would give me greater functionality and I said yes.  Set-up completed.  I'm definitely enjoying my phone and my daughter loves the stylist.  Also Samsung's costumers service was amazing....during the initial set-up I forgot my Samsung account password - with one phone call and in less than 3 mins  a customer service agent talked me through a simple work around.

{"reviewTitle":"Powerful Phone","reviewDescription":"The S24 Ultra with 512GB storage is a great phone with a couple of faults that drive me crazy.Screen:I love that it's flat. I hated the curved phones of the past. The screen gets bright and its good in the sun. The anti-glare coating is fantastic. It might be the best I've ever seen.Battery:Battery life in fantastic. It is easily an all day phone even for a power user. Only thing that might drain it before that is if you do intense gaming on it all day. It claims to be 5,000 mah, but I wonder if it's not a little bigger. My Anker power bank has an info screen and even with conversion loss, it drains the large bank a lot more than a 5,000 mah battery should, more like 8,000 mah worth of drain, which is quite a bit more than what should be expected.Camera:I'm actually disappointed in the camera. I use the zoom a lot. The AI does an incredibly HORRIBLE job with people's faces. They look like disfigured zombies with AI at max. I can't turn AI completely off, but even at the minimum, there is still a slight zombie effect. I can see the actual photo briefly before the camera processes it and I wish I could keep it before the processing. One way around it is to use motion photos and then editing it and taking a snapshot before the final processing. However, I shouldn't have to do it this clunky way. Please fix the AI when zooming!As long as you don't need to zoom too far, the pictures turn out great.Volume:This is the quietest phone I've ever had in terms of volume. I've tried every setting. It is soooooo soft, I can barely hear people talking on the phone. I've tried 3rd party apps that amplify, but they sound terrible and distorted the more gain you put on it. I've gone into the advanced setting, the developer settings, nothing. I've played with auto leveling. Nothing. It's so damn quiet! The max volume is what most other phones have as normal listening mode. I will trade battery life to be able to hear without straining and this is with ANC on.AI:I honestly don't use it that much. It comes in handy here and there, but AI is still at that level where the last 10%-20% can be so ridiculous, it becomes more work fixing what it gets wrong. This is most true with photos and writing. AI cannot write the way I like to write. I end up fixing so much, I'd rather write it myself. The translator functions are very useful, but I don't really need it that much. As mentioned above, AI is terrible with human faces when taking zoomed in photos.I've also noticed since last update, my screen will freeze up on me. I have to shut it off and turn it back on or shut app down and open it back up. Weird.As great as this phone is, the flaws really, really drive me nuts and they are all fixable!The 4 stars is giving the S24 Ultra the benefit of the doubt. My S10+ I came from, the every day experience was almost identical. I only hated the curved screen. Once you settle in and figure it all out, it's a Samsung smart phone.

Otherwise, there are lighter weight and smaller phones that are more comfortable to use daily -- and I say that as a male who is over 6'5\", with hands that match my height. The Samsung S24 Plus comes to mind.I am keeping the S24 UItra because of my interest in photography (this phone has a macro feature, AF on its ultrawide lens, and greater telephoto abilities than the S24 Plus) and my use of the S Pen.  Photos are excellent, including at 5x zoom.  The screen brightness, resolution and anti-glare features are great.  The S Pen allows me to make precise choices on the screen for a variety of uses.

I changed to the lowest megapix speed, but it still locks up. Don't buy this phone if you are looking for a useful camera. The phone does charge fast. Another con is that Samsung did away with the SD card. So the storage in the phone is all there is. Definitely,  this model is NOT an upgrade from the S20. I would not buy it again, and am thinking of returning it.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723075200000}

I did not have problems with data transfer or call connectivity and qualities and audio quality was actually better than S23 ultra. I think other reviews were handed a defective phone or live in an area with very poor reception.The major problem I have is with the practice of data collection. I have identified at least 50 apps that you cannot remove using out of box tools that would collect just about everything you do with the phone. And you can't turn off many of them either. And to use any of Samsung's AI features, you have to give up even more privacy rights. I was not sure exactly which part of AI features are only kept on the phone and won't be sold to Samsung and its third party companies. Battery usage gets even worse when you turn the location on, not because of the sensor but all the unwanted telemetry apps that have attach themselves and vigorously send your personal data for the sake of $$$.If Samsung can make a privacy phone that won't steal or sell your data at your own expense, I would be one of the first ones to buy.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706832000000}

Samsung is only charging between 15-20 watts with my 100w charger... My cheap OnePlus charges 70-80 watts. The stylus is hard to insert. The battery dies fairly quick even when turned off.I added an extra anti glare protector and in the picture you can see my old OnePlus 9pro vs the S24 with anti glare protector on.The camera is fantastic. But for the price of this phone, there should be A LOT more than a great camera.This launched at 5th place for performance. By fall it might not even be in the top 10. If you really want the stylus or a 200mp camera that doesn't matter in day to day use, go for it. But for almost every other user out there, there's already phones topping this... And for much lower prices. Look at the specs compared to the regular OnePlus 12, you'll see it beats the S24 in 9\/10 categories and for $800. Or the Red magic 9 pro for $850.
