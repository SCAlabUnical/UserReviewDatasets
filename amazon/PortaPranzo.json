{"reviewTitle":"Great for work lunch","reviewDescription":"Super cute and heats up well, easily portable for work. I put whatever I'm eating in the inner bowl with the lid and stick it in the fridge overnight.

I get a hot meal without having to go use the crappy breakroom microwave.

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing mini crock pot warmer","reviewDescription":"This mini crock pot has been absolutely amazing to use. The microwaves are crap at my work, since using this thing I've had a piping hot meal every single day. I found with the microwave at my work the top would be super hot and bottom still cold as if it came out of the fridge. When using this the food is hot from top to bottom. The bowl size looks small but it's really deceiving, I'm a bigger guy (230lbs) and the portion size is perfect. The lid to seal the bowl seals really well, but it is easy to think you screwed it on properly and it isn't, you know that it's not on properly when you go to heat it up, then maybe 30 minutes in the lid pops off and makes a pretty loud noise, but no big deal, I screw it back on properly and it continues to go to work. The light on the exterior of the pot is nice so that you know it's on and working. I would say to get the food to it's hottest point you gotta leave it plugged in for about 2 hours. But I've found 1.5 hours heats it to about 90% which is still good enough. Washing the bowl is a little tough once the pot is off it gets cold pretty quickly, I'd say in 10-15 minutes, if you don't wash it right away the food will get hard and stick to the side of the bowl, and it can be a hassle to remove, but not impossible by any means, just need some elbow grease. Other then that I have no complaints with it, I absolutely love it and it's been a game changer for work lunches. Definitely recommend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"150 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707091200000}

I do not like to use the breakroom microwave and this allows me to plug in my lunch when I get to work and it is hot at lunch time.  I have put everything in this from soup to pulled BBQ Beef. If I put anything besides soup in it, like leftover lasagna or BBQ beef then I add a little water for moisture and it comes out perfect!  Reheating rice is amazing - the microwave dries it out but this little crockpot creates steam which keeps it moist.  There is no smell until I take the lid off.  I have so many compliments from others in my office that I have no doubt that I have sold a few more for Amazon....I should get a commission!I do have one design improvement.  The power cord is meant to be rolled up on the bottom and stored under the crockpot.  I do not know why but after a few months it is too lose.  It won't stay attached and falls off when I pick up the crock pot.  Better clips or a retractable cord or something would be better!I highly recommend this little pot!

{"reviewTitle":"Impressive!!","reviewDescription":"I've had my little Crock-Pot in my office for a little over a year now and I have grown to love it more every time I use it. While my colleagues are going out for lunch and spending $12 to $15 for a sandwich for lunch, I'm sitting in my office having a hot lunch for a fraction of the cost. Today I heated spaghetti sauce and frozen meatballs, prepared my pasta in the microwave and by lunch time, while they're all gone searching out sandwiches, I'm eating a hot lunch of spaghetti and meatballs. Tomorrow I'm making shrimp, green beans, coconut milk and I'll have that over rice. I am so impressed by what this little Crock-Pot can do. I chose the blush pink. The only problem I'm having is getting the inner lid off after my food is hot. I'm sure it's me and not the machine. However I do have a hard time getting it off. For me it's extremely hard to twist off. I don't actually see any threads as to how the lid seals. It does seem to twist on, but I can't untwist it to remove it. That does not stop me from using it nearly every day. I live in the North and it's wonderful in the winter months not to have to travel out during lunch time in search of food. I prepare at home, the night before and have a nice hot meal without having to go into the snow, looking for an expensive sandwich or cold lunch.

{"reviewTitle":"I love\/loved my older model, this newer version is terrible and I do not recommend it","reviewDescription":"This is a terrible replacement for my previous model and I deeply regret purchasing it. I regret even more that I was so busy I didn't test out the replacement till the return period had closed. I was ok with replacing my older verion when it was getting worn out, especially because I thought \"oh good, I can still use the old pot\/liner in the new device so I have a backup and can pre-pack 2 lunches at once\".WRONG. I was wrong, the new one is awful. And not just that- it's pretty obvious to me that this new items was deliberately designed to make it impossible for me to use the older pot\/liner with the new device.The new thing has a pin sticking up from the rim, and the new pot insert has a little hole for that pin. The old pot cannot be used because it doesn't have that hole in it. (Though I can use the new pot with the old heater, since the pin\/hole doesn't appear to do anything at all but cause a problem, so the machine works fine without it.) And the pin sucks even with the pot it was designed for. Both models of this item I own have hotspots in them (which is pretty common for electronics in this price range, so I coped). To balance that out, I'd spin the inner pot in the middle of the heating cycle to try to keep the heat even and prevent scorching. It took like 2 seconds and didn't require me to make contact with the food. I can't do that anymore, I have to open the lid and stir with a spoon\/fork.Basically I wasted a chunk of money on a new item which is in EVERY WAY worse than the older model, and is deliberately worse. If you love your older model crockpot lunch heater, DO NOT expect this item to be as functional or useful.

I plug it in at 9 and the vegetables are soft by noon, but not melt in your mouth soft. It doesn't boil my soup. At any rate, there is a design flaw with this product that took me a while to figure out. Namely, the bowl is made of metal but the screw on lid to the bowl is made of plastic. The result of this is that the heat expands the plastic lid much more than the metal bowl thereby creating a tremendous seal by the expanded lid. It makes it very, very hard to unscrew the expanded lid while my soup is still warm. Before I realized what was happening, I had to carefully use pliers to unscrew the heat expanded lid. Not safe. Now I just lay the plastic lid on top of the metal bowl. Even then, it is sometimes still hard to get off due to it expanding more than the metal bowl. The concept is good but the design is flawed.

A threaded lid that screws down and a \"top\" lid that snaps into place. The threaded lid frequently pops off after it heats. At first we though it was user error and we were cross threading it when we screwed it down. But after multiple attempts, that's not the case. We'd tighten it down, look at it from the side to ensure it wasn't x-threaded and more often than not the lid would \"pop\" off quite loudly as it heated up. We found ourselves plugging it in earlier than we wanted to ensure it heated and wouldn't pop off after leaving. We'd come home several times to find the lid off and then you question whether or not the food is safe to eat. We just decided not to keep it. If the lid were redesigned we'd love to get another, but it actually popped off more than it didn't.We do love the portion size, the level of heating and the convenience...the lid was the dealbreaker.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673308800000}

It is.  No thought, just plug it in, and enjoy at break time. One of the other reviews before I purchased this said that it doesn't heat it too hot so that you have to wait for it to cool down.  I actually like my food that hot, but I found it is definitely hot enough to enjoy.  I also worried about the drier foods like rice burning, but it heats all food perfectly.  I have also put frozen prepared foods right in, and again, it is heated perfectly.  Negatives?  although 20 oz is a good size, I wish it were just a tad bigger. Like 24 oz. or so.  That would truly make  it perfect.  Also, once you heat the food, you cannot just twist the lid off. Even if you open the steam valve. I always had to pry it off with a spoon.  So now, when I plug it in to heat, I leave the lid open and just slightly off center on the pot.  No more issue.

{"reviewTitle":"Really impressive! (Just ordered a second!)","reviewDescription":"Update: I love this thing so much I'm ordering a second to take with me since this first one lives at work!  You can definitely forgo whatever metal this container is (they say it's stainless but it's a weird matte metal which FEELS like aluminum, but what do I know)-- I just use sealable oven safe glass 1- or 2-cup containers to transport soups and other food. The provided container does work to transport liquid, but it still terrifies me, so this option relieves me of worrying about it incessantly. That said, it's perfect for a roll on the bottom, then the 1c lipped glass above it.Everyone is right about the thread\/lid\/seal- simply when heating, unscrew the lid and just prop the outer lid back on if you feel so compelled. There really is no odor issue, to the point that I think it's not heating since I cannot ever detect any odors.I like my food REALLY hot, so I give it at least 1.5- 2h. And I don't bother stirring anything. Maybe I'll flip if I cram a roll or flat item in there. Makes a perfect bread\/roll warmer too.Also it IS annoying that you have to unplug it, but I'm considering plugging it into a strip with an on\/off switch.This second one I ordered will be the 'blush' model. I had no peeling\/melting issues w the black, but it seems that the pink and other colors are terrible with the color chipping\/peeling\/washing off. (But why are you washing the exterior?)For these reasons and cost I'm not giving it 5 stars, but I do love this thing and it has made my general life better by providing me effortless hot food working on a freezing winter day\/night. I'd give it a solid 4.25. Plus I bought this with gift cards and credit rewards points.First review:I'm REALLY impressed with this little thing! Something happened to the shipping on the first, so this was the replacement. I ordered it to my work, then had frozen my Thanksgiving dinner into the container (busy cooking all day, so was too stressed to eat it when it was all ready!), so today I brought it frozen, back to work. After about 5h transit back, I placed it into the exterior pot and plugged it in-it was still pretty frozen. When I returned to it hrs later (5-8p), it was perfect! (I had a little CP dipper which I loved and wanted to use for this purpose, but that didn't have a removable container.)I think this would have been ready much sooner, and now that I know this, I will check sooner!The only thing which bothers me is that I'm not sure what kind of plastic this is (PTFE? PFOA? BPA-free? Though the food doesn't touch it, it would be nice to not have to be concerned about fumes which would kill pet birds immediately.)It would also be nice if there were an on\/off button, but I'm not complaining!The size is, frankly, huge for the amount of food I would eat in one sitting, especially at work (20 oz?!???)-- I think I ate about 6, maybe 10 on a hungry\/busy day. But great for soups, I imagine. I'm going to try out something of that sort and update.The pot itself is much smaller than I expected, which is great since it's pretty inconspicuous. I'm not sure why there's a handle, since I'm not planning to carry it around like that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"42 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701216000000}

One time I was struggling for a few minutes to get it open that I had to really pull on the lid and some soup spilled on my clothes and that frustrated me for the rest of the day.But this crock pot heats up my food well, so when it comes to warming up food instead of using the company microwave, I would say I\u2019m content with that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719100800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Bought for husband","reviewDescription":"Bought for husband's lunch. He plugs it at the office or in the truck with an adapter. So far no leaks and portion control is right for him since he is trying to lose weight. He packs soups or other items. I am deducting one star because it is not convenient to store the cable under the pot. It is hard to store and husband is very forgetful so i have to put the cable right on top so he won't foget it. Also some areas of the outside pot have started peeling even though i clean it with a mild spray and a rag. It is not a big deal since it is on the outside and it doesn't affect the performance of the pot or makes it unsafe because the inside is metal. So far happy with the pot after 6 months of use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717545600000}

With a one out of three defective rate, I am taking away a star. It still works, but it will not be as longAlso, it can be very difficult to take the lid off of these at times. There have been times. I didn\u2019t think I was going to get it off at all without breaking the thing.Despite the above, it does heat up very hot to have a nice lunch at work. I can plug it in and have a moderately hot meal about 75 minutes later. If I return to my office 75 minutes after that for a total of 2 1\/2 hours it is blazing hot though not boiling. I have not checked it between the 75 and 150 minute mark due to my work schedule. Somewhere between there is what it takes to get food super hot as it had just come off the stove.Definitely a worthwhile purchase. There are just some quality control issues and they need to figure out a way to get the inner lid off better.Also, the instructions say that the outer lid is not dishwasher safe. This is weird. You should be able to put both the inner and outer lids in the dishwasher. It does not explain why you cannot do so that tells you to clean it by wiping it with a soft cloth.

I use it for everything I possibly can!!!I am a teacher and get 20 mins to use the bathroom and eat lunch. Not having to wait for a microwave to heat up my food has at least saved me ten minutes that I can actually spend EATING and not either waiting for my food to cook or to cool down, or having to stir or blah blah blah. I plug in my little pot and when it\u2019s time for lunch, I can sit down and eat my food with no steps in between!  Not only do I not have to wait\u2026but it\u2019s actually the right temperature when I go to eat it! The microwave is always leaving my food not cooked enough, or cooked to much so that it\u2019s blazing hot!! There\u2019s usually no medium! With this little pot, my food is hot and ready to eat, but not so hot that it\u2019s burning my mouth!  I don\u2019t have to wait for it to cool down like I do with microwaved food.Whatever I have leftover from dinner, I pack in my little pot. The lid vacuum seals and is spill proof.  I have put Chinese leftovers in there, sloppy Joe, soup, rice, BBQ pulled chicken, noodles, etc. I\u2019m constantly trying to figure out what I can cook for dinner that will heat up well in my pot.

I had to give it a bit of pressure to close it.2- I know this is a \u201cslow cooker\/warmer\u201d, but if you would buy this, you have to plant to connect the warmer hours before you want to eat. It will take long time to warm up the food. Literally, I needed more than 2 hrs to start warming up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669852800000}

There's the outside cover, which seals pretty well; and the inside cap cover you twist down on the food bowl. This does not seal, intentionally, probably(?) to allow it to let off a little steam.  As long as you know this, and rinse your used vessel out before tossing it in your tote, you might not get the remnants of your chili on that work you had to take home with you.The cord wrap is nice, and carefully engineered, but I don't have the hang of it yet, so a couple times I brought the food but not the cord, so it was pointless.

If I have bone in chicken and mashed potatoes, it usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour for the food to get hot hot. So this is my second mini crockpot I had one years ago, and there are things I prefer on the new one and then other things I prefer on the old one. I love that the lid on the new one screws on Now. I don\u2019t have to worry about food spilling out of the bowl.  The cord on the new crockpot is detachable now, not an improvement I\u2019m my opinion. I suppose it\u2019s for ease of storage or maybe so it\u2019ll wrap nicer but for the life of me I cannot get the cord to stay wrapped up. It\u2019s like the cord is just a hair too long so the plugs don\u2019t stay in their designated spots. They are forever popping out. That is pretty frustrating.  I\u2019m usually carrying a handful of things from my car to office every morning and having to put it all down to pick up the cord that fell off the bottom of my food warmer halfway through a fleet yard is not joy.

{"reviewTitle":"Overall good purchase","reviewDescription":"This is a very convenient \"lunchbox\" if you don't have access to (or don't like using) a microwave.  It doesn't cook food, just reheats.  This holds a lot of food (at least two cups).  I haven't put any compact foods into it, mainly soups\/chilis and loose pasta like spaghetti or soba (no lasagnas or casseroles). Some stuff requires just a little bit of liquid to help with the reheating. My only two complaints: 1.) You have to loosen the internal lid before you start cooking, otherwise it tend to get stuck.  The last thing you want to do is fight with a lid that's holding back hot food.  This happens with or without that little black venting plug on the top. 2.) After the first use, my power indicator light stopped working.  I tried the unit and it still heats, so this isn't a deal breaker.  Reheating time takes some trial and error but once you work it out, it's easy to use.  I like my soups really hot, so at max capacity, it was 1 to 1.5 hours from refrigerator cold.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709596800000}
{"reviewTitle":"So far so good !!","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve been eyeing this for a while now and finally got around to getting it. The idea of having a hot lunch without going to the microwave in the office break room sounded appealing to me. Anyways, last night I added some leftover chicken congee (rice porridge) into the metal container and covered it with the plastic cover that came with the unit and left it in the fridge. Grabbed it on my way out of the house. When I got to the office, I plugged the crock pot into the wall unit at my desk. After about 4 hours of working I started to get hungry so I opened up the crock pot and man oh man was this thing hot !! I had to use a napkin to hold the side of the metal bowl down while I tried to pop off the plastic cover (hence the 4 stars). But once that lid came off and I can smell the garlic and chicken I knew this was going to be a tasty lunch. The fact that my congee was piping hot the whole time I was eating was nice. Cleaning everything was a breeze. I love how the cable disconnects completely from the unit and that I can keep it hidden while still on the unit.

I bought this newer version and enjoy it a lot more.PROS: It's a nice thing to just easily heat up your lunch\/dinner while you're working throughout the day (or nacho cheese). I do like the screw-on lid (also a CON) compared to the order model where it just was pressed in. NOTE though, you do need to stir your food every now and then to make sure it heats up as fast as possible. :)CONS: Only two things, the screw-on lid (for the one with the bowl) to me tends to be a major pain on getting it undone every now and then. It's like I have to wait for it to cool a bit. The second, as mentioned by other reviewers, is that the power cord doesn't stay well with it being wrapped up.

I usually try to give it at least an hour and have always had my food nice and warm-even heating from frozen.  I keep the base in my office and use the inner container to transport my lunch. I've not had an issue with leaks and that's honestly my one complaint.  I don't know what science rule I'm missing, but sometimes it is a STRUGGLE to open.  Even with the little spiget popped, I was worried I was going to break it trying to fight whatever forces had created the perfect seal. So my lesson learned is to make sure the inner lid is not screwed in too tightly, barely twisted, to make it easier to open.

If you're tired of the microwave shuffle and want to elevate your meal game, this is hands down the ultimate solution. Highly recommended for its convenience, taste preservation, and odor-free warming!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"167 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701043200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Heat time","reviewDescription":"The item looks nice but I give 1 start for heat-up time. 1st I have cold food and plug-in 15min. Still cool ( I mean cool) and at 2nd time I plug in for 35min. Still a little warning ( compare with microwave 45-second heat time) I would not recommend to anyone trying to buy this item for heat up food. I have no idea what is this one purpose for.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686009600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Don't waste your money","reviewDescription":"I had this for about three months when the plastic piece on the insert disappeared. Not sure if it broke in the dishwasher or what happened to it. So I contacted Crock Pot through Amazon, who wanted pictures of the item - the item number - the date code - the sticker on the bottom - proof of purchase...seriously? I just wanted to know if I could replace the piece of plastic. I'm throwing this out and buying something better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679961600000}
