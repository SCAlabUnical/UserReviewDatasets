{"reviewTitle":"VR Is Not Just For Kids.  Everyone Should Have One of These!","reviewDescription":"I\u2019m truly amazed at how awesome this Occulus Quest 2 refurbished headset is.  It\u2019s the same as the Meta Quest 2, but it has the old logo on it.  It\u2019s also discounted about $50, which is why I decided to finally try VR.  I don\u2019t know why I waited so long!  Oh, I know, most of us probably think VR is just for kids, or we don\u2019t like shooting games, or we get motion sick and all that jumping around would be too much for us.  I know, that as someone who\u2019s considered, well elderly, I should just stay away from this nonsense and leave it to grandkids, right?  That is so wrong!  Sure, there\u2019s a lot of violent shooting games available and you could easily make yourself sick riding roller coasters in VR, and there\u2019s a lot of potential for people to abuse community spaces and bully others, but that\u2019s just a tiny portion of what VR opens up to you when you put on a Quest 2 headset.  I\u2019m the first to admit, I had my reservations, but although I\u2019m old, and disabled to boot, I don\u2019t think you ever get too old to try something new, especially something like this that lets you experience things that you\u2019ve never experienced, without having to leave the comfort of your home.  You don\u2019t have to climb mountains in VR, but with this headset you can if you want to.  You can come pretty close to the experience without actually plummeting towards the earth when you jump and miss your handholds.  The view are spectacular in that particular game, but I had to return it because although it says you can play it sitting, I couldn\u2019t really do it from a wheelchair.  That\u2019s not a problem, though, because if you purchase most games or apps you have the option to return it within 14 days, providing you haven\u2019t spent over a certain amount of time using it.  But there\u2019s plenty that even someone as limited in physical ability as I am can enjoy in VR, thanks to this fully self contained headset.  With the Quest 2, you don\u2019t need to be tethered to an expensive gaming computer, and there are things that anyone can find in VR that will amaze and astonish even the most unflappable person.  Right now, there are a wide variety of games and apps, some free, that no matter your age or interests, you will be able to find things that make you say, \u201cWow!\u201d.  You can get an app that allows you to go anywhere in the world, similar to using Google Earth, except that you find yourself being able to look around as if you were there at a famous landmark or your childhood home.  You can take guided tours to places you probably didn\u2019t know existed, or take a tour of the Space Station and see how the astronauts live and work there, go swimming with whales or watch gorillas play in a jungle.  You can meditate, play musical instruments, meet people with similar interests, take courses, draw and paint in 2D and 3D, play golf or dance, surf the internet, or one of my favorite things so far, sit in a movie theater and get the feeling of truly watching a movie on a big screen while actually being comfortable at home.  I know that sounds unusual, but for someone like me who hasn\u2019t been able to go to a movie theater in many years, it\u2019s a truly awesome experience.  I haven\u2019t had my Quest 2 long enough yet, to convince friends and family to join me in VR, but if they do, we can watch movies or play games together in a variety of settings.  For me, the neatest game I\u2019ve discovered yet is VR Fishing!  It\u2019s so relaxing to fish in real places in Japan, South Korea, or the Northwestern USA, in a variety of weather conditions, from shore or in boats, and to catch fish and put them in your Aquarium in your fish lodge.  It\u2019s a nearly magical experience to feel as if you are truly getting a nibble to catching a fish that looks so real that you can forget for a moment that you\u2019re at home, and you feel like you\u2019re actually sitting in a wooden boat in the rain and mist at a lake in the mountains.  VR is awesome for everyone, but especially if you or someone you know loves to travel or fish, or do any number of things but you find yourself unable to enjoy such activities anymore due to physical limitations or even monetary restrictions.  VR is a great way to expand possibilities beyond what\u2019s easily available.  If I were younger and healthier, my dream job would be to bring VR to as many people as possible, but especially to elderly and home bound or disabled folks whose lives are getting narrower and restricted.  VR can expand your environment in ways that have never been possible before.  Quest 2 is relatively affordable, easy to use, and it will only get better as more people expand their lives into the VR environment.  I was surprised at how easy it was get started, and I was able to do most of it right from within VR.  Is it perfect?  Absolutely not. It\u2019s a bit of a money pit.  When you buy the Quest 2, you get a headset, two controllers, and a charger cord.  That\u2019s all.  The controllers are battery powered.  If you want rechargeable controllers, you\u2019ll likely need a charger base with rechargeable batteries.  You\u2019ll almost certainly have to get a head strap because the one that comes with the Quest 2 headset is minimal and it feels like the headset is going to fall off no matter how much you tighten it when you put it on.  If you want to balance it better and give you more playtime, you\u2019ll need a head strap with a battery.  Unless you invest in a charging station, you\u2019ll probably want a case, and lens covers because you can\u2019t allow sunlight to hit the the lenses because that could burn out headset.  There are other helpful accessories, such as controller covers, lens cloths and covers, possibly a fan to keep your glasses from fogging if you wear glasses, or you can buy prescription lenses here on Amazon, or other accessories.  Some are more necessary than others, and depending of what you use your headset for, you may not need every possible accessory.  At this moment, as fun as VR is, it\u2019s still in it\u2019s infancy, but it\u2019s usefulness to others besides video gamers is growing every day.  Meta Quest 2 is probably the most useful and affordable stand alone VR system available, and there\u2019s plenty to be found in it.  I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what it\u2019s capable of doing, and I think that even old folks like me, who might be initially reluctant to try it, can find plenty of awesome things to do if we can be persuaded to try it out.  I\u2019m kicking myself that I didn\u2019t buy one the first time I saw it, because it would have made my pandemic isolation a lot less isolating.  I wish that something like this would have been available when my dad was confined to bed and a wheelchair after his stroke many years ago, because he loved to travel and learn new things, and VR opens up the world to exploration without even leaving home.  With the Quest 2, exploration is easy and fun.  If you\u2019re thinking of trying it out, for yourself or a gift for someone young or old or in between, there\u2019s never been a better time or a better and more affordable device than the Meta Quest 2. [Edit] [Addition] I recently got new glasses, and while it comes with a spacer for glasses, I was using it without glasses because since I had cataract surgery and I thought my vision was good enough without wearing glasses.  Although my distance correction was minimal, nearly the smallest size available, I got a great Black Friday deal on prescription lenses that snap right on to the regular lenses.  This turned out to be one of the best accessories I've bought for my Quest 2.  I highly recommend getting these, as long as your distance correction is a negative number.  I hadn't realized how much I was settling for by not wearing my glasses because I found it uncomfortable.  Now my vision is really crisp, and if someone else wants to try my headset, the lenses snap right off so they don't have to look through my prescription.  I'm still enjoying my headset nearly every day.  It's even got Amazon Prime Video available to watch on a big screen, which is a favorite of mine as I'm a Prime member.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"381 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667174400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Absolutely Worth It","reviewDescription":"I first want to start off by saying not only do I love the product but I'm really impressed by the seller. I was really worried about buying this refurbished because I didn't know what to expect, however if I wasn't the one who paid for it and saw \"refurbished\" I would have thought it was brand new. It came In a sealed box, with all the plastic coverings, stickers to remove, everything, just like a new one.I did purchase this for my son, who is only 12. I was a little worried about the people he could interact with but I was very happy to see that there are settings where you can set it for children to use, there are setting to approve if he can interact with strangers or not as well. Lastly, the most reassuring thing, you can download the app, allowing you to view and hear everything that is being done in the Oculus, from your phone, allowing you to see\/hear what they are doing.I also really appreciate the fact that even though the transaction was marked 3 days in a row by my card company, not allowing the transaction to go through until day 4, my transaction wasn't cancelled or sent to someone else.My son saved up for 6 months to buy this, he worked his ass off in school to get A's to get money and worked his ass off ay home to earn money from chores, I can confidently say, it was very much worth it. He's so happy with it, there are so many cool games and easy to find free ones.It's a great product over all and I can't express how amazing it was being refurbished, If you are on the fence about thispurchase, I sat go for it. It's so fun and worth it, it's fun for everyone in the house ranging from the kids to the adults.

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing product for it being renewed!","reviewDescription":"I love my meta\/occulus quest 2. Also, no need to have Facebook to play games! I initially didn't buy it because of that. Overall I give this a 9\/10!About the console:Set up: Setting it up is quite easy. Depending on your wifi speed, it can take up to 15-30 minutes. You will need to make a meta account. I use my phone and linked it to my device. My device needed an update, so expect that, as well.Battery life: Impressive battery life. My oculus lasts up to two weeks (average 30 minutes play time daily). The controllers do need batteries after the ones included die out, but there's third party sellers who are using rechargeable batters and stations. I may invest in that. The charging takes up to two hours, at most.Controllers: They feel very comfortable to use. It feels natural to use compared to other VR consoles (PSVR1--btw, I am a Playstation fan, but the move controllers suck). For Nintendo lovers, they have ABYX buttons (I also love Nintendo).Graphics--They are pretty good for an entry level VR. I feel immersed playing. The colors are vibrant. Do not expect them to be super higher graphic like newer VRs (this did come out around 2020\/2021). I'm sure the Meta quest 3 will have advanced graphics.Immersive--This is where I feel Meta's VRs take the cake, especially the Quest lineups. Wireless playing is soooooo much less of a hassle compared to using cords, and cables. I can also stand, jump, walk around, and feel like I'm part of the game. I can also sit and play some games when I feel lazy. In other words, I have a choice. This is where it really sold me with the Meta compared to my PSVR1 I used to own, and why I didn't buy a PSVR2. Also you can take it with you for others to play (will need to buy a travel case)! You also have a \"home base\" you can customize. From futuristic, to a secluded resort, to a Kyoto resort (this is mine currently), I found it very relaxing to do that. I also love the different avatar selections you can use and they have a wide range of diverse choices.Comfort--This is where I feel the meta does lose compared to the PS lineups and other lineups. I cannot play it more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. The solution is to buy an elite strap, but why not just make it comfortable to play with from the get go? This is where the minus one point comes from.Games--Now the fun. I'll be honest, Sony outdoes the quest with RPGs and shoot 'em ups, in my opinion, but the quest outdoes Sony with social and casual games. So, it depends on what you want out of a gaming experience.I hope this review helps someone out there thinking between a Quest vs PSVR, likes to compare the two, or is hesitant with the whole Facebook thing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"84 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687046400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Fun for older folks, too.","reviewDescription":"I was impressed from the moment I put it on. The VR experience is immersive enough that a rock climbing game greatly reduced my acrophobia.I'm in my mid-40s and was a computer geek from age 7 but I haven't cared to play games for 10 years. I bought this on a whim, half-expecting to return it out of lack of interest. Instead, I get countless hours of entertainment out of this thing each week, and I've mostly only used it for games, so far. You can watch 3D movies and documentaries, use all kinds of productivity apps, enjoy endless travel videos, witness celestial events and anything else you can think of. Most services like YouTube and Netflix have an app for the Quest, and those that don't can still be accessed through the web browser.The Quest has an app store with free and paid content. Additionally, you can access free VR games through websites in the browser. You can also link the Quest to your PC to play some of your computer games in VR, and you can access quality VR games through your PC via services like Steam.I recommend this for lovers of non-physical games of any type, including card and board games. And it's worth considering the Quest+ subscription. For $5\/mo you get a bunch of premium games that would otherwise cost hundreds, with new ones rotated in each month.I think people with mobility problems could see a real quality-of-life improvement from this machine. With the built-in microphone, lonely kids will benefit more from this device than from other multiplayer game systems where communication is not verbal and auditory.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723334400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing!","reviewDescription":"This is my first experience with modern VR after the disappointing attempt back in the '90s. For me the Quest 2 was the right balance of cost vs quality. I am a lifelong PC gamer and this exceeded my expectations as a standalone unit and even more so as a PCVR device. Out of the box the experience was better than expected but, If you do your research and learn how to use the settings I would find it difficult for most players to be disappointed. Even quite a few of the standalone apps have impressed me. This is highly recommended for any first time VR enthusiasts who didn't want a huge first time investment.

If you've never played VR, games with a lot of movement will cause nausea...keep this in mind. The store has a decent variety of games but they can be pricey and some games require a subscription...keep this in mind too. Overall, I do recommend this product!On an added note: This is my second purchase as Amazon Renewed and I must say that it has been a two out of two excellent experience.

When you look inside of it it looks so real! The handles are easy to control in the headset fits your face really well as long as you had just the straps! You will sweat though a little bit after you wear it for a while so don't wear it for too long. I do wish that it fit better on kids heads because the first we put on our kid it fell down and cracked because her head was too small. So maybe they could Implement some smaller straps for children to make it kind of more Universal that would be great you can't see on the outside which works well. I wish it would have came in a different color as well White straps seems to get dirty I would have did a gray or a navy blue or black in color also I would have wished they had more storage for the price.

For me it lasts anywhere from an hour to four hours. In the winter the lenses are prone to fogging up if you sweat right away and it makes everything blurry. Do make sure you have space while playing because I have punched my ceiling a few times, bumped a wall, and punched a support beam which really hurt. I've experienced a little stick drift on the left control and sometimes, somewhat rarely, the headset refuses to connect to my Wi-Fi despite everything else connecting. Really recommend buying beat saber and contractors (it has black ops zombies) if you buy a headset.

The silicone and foam appeared as new also, while the silicone face ring was still in the original paper sleeve.The headset arrived with about 45% state of charge, I set up as new and installed Gravity sketch for work and did all the usual FB login stuff and it was working within minutes. After I was done with the setup, I charged it fully and the battery did get to a full 100%, even though it was noted that these were at least able to hold 90% charge from new. The entire box arrived as a new one would, but the tape seals did indicate that the item was refurbished.I\u2019ve added some anti-slip hexes and cat tongue tape in the photos, as these are the only photos I have of the unit. The addition of these helped grip so much, there\u2019s less fatigue for extended sessions from gripping the hand units too tightly or fear of them slipping out of your hands. I\u2019m not a fan of the silicone sleeves or socks that add too much thickness, and even weight, especially when used in 3D sketching and modeling, where slower and more precise movement is required.Totally worth it if you get a good one and the full warranty and packaging are \"as-new\".  Saved myself $50 for a tool that's needed for work while I return the one I've been borrowing for Gravity sketch training for auto design modeling.

{"reviewTitle":"A Good Standalone VR Headset but Not Great for PC Use","reviewDescription":"This was my first time using VR since the first gen Oculus Rift, and while this headset has massively improved in terms of optics, screen quality, sensors, and more, the PC experience got worse. However, before I get to that, I do want to say that this renewed unit was virtually brand new. It came in the original box, and all the accessories had brand new packaging around them. Even the headset itself appeared as new, without any scuffs, scratches, hair, dust or anything of the like.The setup was very easy to do and only took a few minutes, although I did have to get some assistance from online help on Meta as the Touch controllers would not initially pair to the headset. The headset is very easy to put on as it features an easy to adjust fabric strap, an optional silicone liner, a glasses attachment for those with glasses, and a three-way IPD adjustment. Once done with the setup, the Meta Quest storefront offers a lot of apps, but I found that it lacked a significant amount compared to when I had the Oculus Rift years ago for my PC. This could be due to the limitations of the Quest 2 when used standalone, so I didn't initially think much about this.Now, in terms of the quality of the headset, the lenses are way better than anything I was used to previously. The screen door effect was almost entirely gone, and the inner display was able to deliver a brighter image with better color reproduction. The only thing that hindered it was that, despite having much sharper and clearer optics, the actual resolution of the games did not look that great when using it on its own. So, to me, it was like seeing super clear but very bland graphics with a lack of detail. When using it with my PC, this was a different story as the games I was able to run looked way clearer and more detailed than anything from the standalone mode and I was impressed, at first. The audio was also impressive. The audio comes out of built-in speakers in the straps and they do an excellent job at delivering high grade surround sound audio with surprisingly very little noise bleed. Even at max volume, others in the room around me could only barely notice the audio coming from the headset.I also loved how great the cameras on the headset were able to track my movements as it really did feel immersive when using the headset on its own. The touch controllers are fluid and responsive, and most games feel like you are actually there and interacting with your surroundings for real. Additionally, the guardian system does a great job at creating artificial boundaries that you can see in-game that prevent you from ever worrying about running into your surroundings.However, when using the headset in Standalone mode, the built-in battery drains FAST, like extremely fast. On a full charge I was lucky to play games for about 2 hours before it needed to be plugged-in, and that was only on most games. More intense games like Beatsaber, that number would drop to around 1 hour 30 minutes of playtime per charge. Once again, this isn't an issue when using it with a PC as the Link cables can maintain and charge the battery while you are using it.Now, let's get to my main problem; PC Gaming. While I initially loved the concept of using this as a standalone headset with the option of connecting it to my PC, I found that this created an absolute mess compared to the older Rift. The setup was very tedious in the Oculus app to start as it initially kept saying my Quest Link cables were USB 2 and not delivering the required bandwidth. I tried many different cables, even the official Meta Quest Link cable, and it just did not work. I eventually found out that this was an error due to me using a 7900 XT GPU which was not officially listed on the list of supported graphics cards. I then tried setting it up on my backup gaming rig with an older 6600 XT GPU and it worked perfectly there. From this point I used the backup PC to set up the PC side of things, and all seemed well- until SteamVR got involved. Personally, I own way more VR games on Steam than I do on the Oculus store, so I followed the steps to get SteamVR working to play those games. At first, it all ran smoothly until it didn't. While I was able to get SteamVR working on the Quest, it only detected some of the games I had and not all of them- which was a lot that was missing. For the games that were missing from the SteamVR dashboard, I would then have to add a shortcut to my desktop and then use the \"desktop\" mirroring ability in the Quest to view my desktop in the headset and then use the controllers to manually open the game from the Desktop. However, this only worked some of the time and not all of the time as sometimes either the Desktop preview would freeze or lose signal, or the games wouldn't open at all, or the game would open on my PC but not open inside the headset.Overall, this is a very capable headset, but since I can't use it well with my PC which is what I primarily got it for, and due to its subpar battery life in standalone mode, I had no choice to return it. While I am impressed at the brand new-like quality of the headset I received, I honestly cannot recommend this headset for PC use (unless you ONLY use the Oculus store and NOT SteamVR). For everything else, it's okay, but it's just not for me. Hopefully the next gen Quest headset can improve this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694304000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Fun and Exciting, but Not Without Its Flaws","reviewDescription":"So, I recently got my hands on the Meta Quest 2, and I have to say, it's a pretty cool piece of tech. It's a fun and exciting way to experience virtual reality, but it's not without its flaws.On the positive side, the Meta Quest 2 is a blast to use. The graphics are crisp and clear, and the tracking is spot-on. It's also very easy to set up and use, which makes it a great option for both experienced and novice gamers.Another great feature of the Meta Quest 2 is the variety of games and experiences available. There's something for everyone, from action-packed shooters to calming meditation apps.However, there are some drawbacks to the Meta Quest 2. Firstly, the battery life is not very impressive, and it tends to drain quickly. This can be a major issue, especially for those who want to use it for extended periods of time.Additionally, the device can be quite heavy and uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. This can be a major issue for those who want to use it for extended gaming sessions or experiences.Moreover, the price of the Meta Quest 2 is also a major drawback. It's quite expensive, and the additional costs for games and accessories can add up quickly.Overall, while the Meta Quest 2 is a fun and exciting way to experience virtual reality, it's not without its flaws. The battery life, weight, and price can all be major drawbacks for some users. However, if you're willing to overlook these issues, the Meta Quest 2 can provide you with hours of entertainment and excitement.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1681344000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Hardware is great. Software meh. Games are great.","reviewDescription":"It\u2019s astonishing that Facebook is a user experience company and they just flopped so hard on the software design (while nailing the hardware, which, to be fair, they purchased). The quest 2 has multi user setup, but one person has to be the admin, and that person can share certain games with shared users, but other accounts can\u2019t. What. Also, only the admin can stream (to a tv, to the internet, to the app).So if I\u2019m the admin and my gf adds an account, I can share beat saber with her, but she can\u2019t share it with me. I can play on my account and stream to the tv, but if she wants to play on hers (to keep her scores separate), she can\u2019t stream because she\u2019s not an admin. And as an admin, I can\u2019t tell it to stream her view because it\u2019s not my account.If you buy this to play with your child, you can\u2019t watch what they\u2019re doing (to enjoy with them, to monitor their online interactions, or even to troubleshoot). They have to play on your account\u2026 so why even have separate accounts\u2026?Some of the dumbest decisions I\u2019ve ever seen in software. My god.However, the hardware is amazing and even has a no controller mode where it maps your hand movements via front camera. The games are arcade style fun, with lots of dancing, swinging swords, punching the air, and shooting games. The frame rate is high enough that I don\u2019t feel sick even when the scene is moving very fast.

Replace it with another (I picked up the Kiwi Designs one here on Amazon). Most of the pain is now gone, except for the eye strain.I waffled between 3 and 4 stars on this. There's no seemingly breakthrough apps beyond a handful of great games to be had. There's a definite awe-factor when playing Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky in VR.  Using Desktop mode in the Oculus gives you a giant version of your PC desktop - but given the eye-strain, I'd rather just use my physical monitor.Overall - if you're a gamer, there's plenty of things to try with the two aforementioned games being pretty good things to pick up on sale.

On the other hand, I'm finding I don't use it as much as I hoped (and I have previous version of a VR headset) because the apps are very limited. I probably wouldn't buy it again for that reason alone, though of course that's not a criticism of the headset itself. Look it up before getting into it if this is new to you.The product itself is good. I have had no problems with it, once I got it set up, which can be a little tricky. I use it mostly plugged into my gaming computer, which gives a better experience compared to using it on its own. To do that you need a very powerful (and expensive) PC.

{"reviewTitle":"Was Decent, But Went Another Way","reviewDescription":"I already had an HTC Vive which was getting a bit dated, so I thought I'd try an Oculus. I really didn't think it through. I didn't fully realize that Oculus was going to leverage Facebook for accounts. Because of past experiences, I don't trust Facebook enough to give it a credit card and didn't really want Facebook integration with annoyances like Messenger. I also got tangled up in trying to get the Oculus to use Steam. (It and the Vive would fight.) The newer Oculus was wireless and had better graphics, but I still liked my old Vive better, mostly because it doesn't integrate with Facebook and because it was easier to leverage Steam. I think I'll let the VR industry mature a little more before my next purchase.I bought the Oculus directly from their site, not via Amazon. This proved to be handy as there's a 30-day trial period and you can get a full refund. That might be handy for folks who aren't sure if VR is something they want.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1659312000000}

A few weeks later, two small bright dots appeared on the left side of the screen (at about the 11:00 position) in one of the headsets. The internet said they were frozen pixels and suggested a factory reset, which we did. It did not fix the problem, so we contacted customer service. We were shocked to learn that after only a few weeks of use, they would not replace the faulty headset. They gave us only one option: a refund - but ONLY if we returned BOTH headsets. We paid about $250 per headset, and the refurbished ones are now selling for $350 each. So basically, we could send these back, pay an additional $200 and have absolutely no recourse if the replacements also failed to work. We asked to speak with a supervisor and were told we would receive a call in 24 hours.  We never received a call. Because we LOVE the one that works and it would be a financial hardship to invest another $200 on the chance that the replacements might be reliable, we decided to keep the originals.

{"reviewTitle":"Renewed Unit 1 - No Power \/ Unit 2 - Blurred Lenses","reviewDescription":"My son purchased a Meta Quest 2 (MQ-2) a couple of weeks prior to me ordering this one.  He wasn't willing to share for more than 5 to 10 minutes, so I thought I would get one for the rest of the family.  We were all excited when it arrived.  It arrived perfectly packaged, and although it was a renewed item, every component looked new.  Unfortunately, that's where the good vibes ended.I carefully extracted the unit and pressed the power button and absolutely nothing happened.  So I held it in for a few seconds, and still nothing happened.  I made several more attempts, but I didn't even see a glimmer of light from the lens nor the power indicator light on the outer case.  Obviously the battery must have been dead.  So I charged it for several hours and tried again.  It still wouldn't work.  I didn't want to do this, but I had to go to my son to ask for help.  I just knew he would figure out how to power it on and then tell me I was out of touch with modern electronics, but to my surprise, he couldn't get it to power on either.  We left it on the charger overnight and tried again the next morning, but it still would not power on.I called Amazon and asked for a return and replacement.  I couldn't be happier with their return service. Two days later I received another renewed MQ-2.  Unfortunately, I had to return it also.  The lenses were extremely blurry.  The focus adjustments incorporated in the unit did nothing to improve the issue.  After comparing the same games and scenery from my MQ-2 to my son's MQ-2.  I knew the lenses in my unit were defective.I'm not a quitter; so I didn't give up, but I decided to refrain from ordering another renewed MQ-2.  The third and hopefully final MQ-2 was purchased as a brand new unit.  I'll write a review for the new MQ-2 also, but I'll summarize that future review by saying the view through it is much better than the view through my second renewed unit.  If you choose a renewed MQ-2, just remember that someone returned it for a reason, and that reason might be because it was defective.  I know these units are certified by Oculus to work and look like-new, but in my case, I received two duds.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667347200000}

After I let the Oculus charge and it showed a green light, of course I tried to turn it on.Well.. nothing that you would expect to happen, happened when I tried to do so. The only thing that would occur is when I plugged and unplugged the charger from the headset, I would see the Oculus symbol, then a battery icon showing how charged the Oculus was ..then it would disappear and nothing. I even tried to reset it, factory reset it, but nothing ever popped up and the button on the side never glowed white, either.After thinking for a while and talking to some friends who have a perfectly working Oculus themselves, we all came to the conclusion that the issue has to be with the power button. Think about it, it charged perfectly fine and even the controllers seemed to work, just the headset itself would not power on at all.. or doing anything related to needing to press the power button. So unfortunately, I had to return my headset.. which REALLY bummed me out. I truly was looking forward to playing VR with my friends and significant other..

And Quest 2 is better than life itself!!!","reviewDescription":"After reading review after review saying that Facebook was a nightmare to deal with for warranty service, (taking weeks and even months to respond), I noticed that Amazon Renewed has a one-year satisfaction guarantee (which seems to say the item doesn't even need to malfunction for you to return it), I realized Amazon Renewed was the way to go. If you add the 3-year warranty for just over $30, it still costs less than a direct-from-Facebook purchase which only has a one-year warranty, and most importantly, MY AMAZON RENEWED QUEST 2 ARRIVED IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE BRAND NEW CONDITION with only labels marked, \"Refurbished\" to clue me in that it was anything but new. I am an adult who is not into gaming, and I'm finding this device to be BEYOND AMAZING, transporting me to fantastic worlds that look and feel 100% real. In the few days that I've owned it, I've visited with elephants in Kenya (ECOSPHERE), ridden on a roller coaster with Santa (EPIC ROLLER COASTERS), danced with an alien (FIRST STEPS), relaxed in a breathtakingly modern home (ALCOVE), taken a bus tour of Dubai, attended a private performance by the most adorable girl dancing and singing in Japanese (TOUCH THE BEAT), learned the ins and outs of Quest 2 from a good-natured robot (FIRST CONTACT) and more -- and these were just the FREE apps! So all my research on warranties, guarantees and return policies likely won't matter since, it turns out my Quest 2 from Amazon Renewed is a keeper after all!!!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"43 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1654041600000}

I chose to purchase the renewed version because after reading lots of reviews, even some of the new devices have had issues. By purchasing the Quest 2 renewed I got a one year warranty vs just 30 days. When it arrived it was in brand new packaging. The stickers that sealed the box said it was renewed, but if they hadn't been on there I never would have guessed. I am extremely picky when it comes to buying electronics and I fully expected to find a problem or encounter an issue setting it up, but nothing. There isn't a mark on it that would suggest it had ever been used. Every piece in the box was labled, and packaged like new. Setting up the device was quick and easy. I was on the fence about getting one of these, but now I'm sorry I didn't get one sooner. The games are so much fun, one of my favorite being Walkabout Mini Golf. If you love mini golf and you don't own this game you are missing out. Also if you want to travel but can't afford to, the experiences on YouTube VR are awesome. The fitness apps are really great as well and so much fun. I highly recommend this purchase and I'm so glad I didn't buy new. With the money I saved buying renewed I was able to get a few much needed accessories. Thank you Amazon!**UPDATE **Our household has purchased 2 more of these with zero issues.
