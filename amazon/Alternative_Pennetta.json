I noticed that the 1st time I loaded a couple of hundred meg into it, so I set up a little test. My computer has a USB 3.2 port through which I commonly read and\/or write multi-gig files, usually to or from the fast SD cards that I use in my cameras, usually at several hundred+ meg\/sec. It will go up to close to a thousand meg when writing to my SSD backup drives. BTW: The destination and source folder in the test is on a 2 T M.2 NVME card.Point of all that being that any bottlenecks in the system are far above the ratings on the Amazon Basics flash drive.I did a full format on the flash drive and loaded a few folders of images averaging a couple to a few gig. Plugged directly into the port with no cord, every one of the files wrote onto the Amazon card at a speed of slightly less than 10 meg average, peaking at no greater than 24 meg but dropping immediately. I did a screen grab of a sample and attached it above.I'm an engineer in addition to a photographer and moving large files around is common. My office is limited to a 2-3 meg internet upload speed until I finally get fiber in a few months.But when I turned it around and read from the card to a file on my computer, it was at least the rated speed, faster in fact. The 2.5 gig test file loaded from the Amazon flash drive onto a very fast M.2 drive  in a around 3 seconds. That's unbelievably fast, I'd have to duplicate it a couple of more times before I could accept that. In any case, the Amazon thumb drive reads very fast. But 10 meg\/sec into the thumb drive sucks.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723248000000}

{"reviewTitle":"speed oscillates","reviewDescription":"This USB flash is good for volume storage (although some here are upset about claimed vs actual), but I found the speed pauses or oscillates too much when moving a large folder. I was using a USB 3.2 type A port (blue inner bar of the opening).  The USB 3.0 Flash Drive or card reader will work at the speed of the port, for example if you use a USB 3.0 Flash Drive in your USB 2.0 laptop, it will work at USB 2.0 speed.The top thing to consider is that MS Windows gets file info before moving and this takes about the same amount of time for each one; thus the drive is engaged in a bunch of small non-sequential reads, which are relatively slow. This image shows the progress in moving a larger file from an internal NVMe drive. It starts out fast and one tends to think \"it won't take long,\" than it throttles down on copying the file.  Imagine carrying 300 books from one room to another INDIVIDUALLY vs carrying those 300 books in boxes with 30 books each. The boxes will be much faster.CrystalDiskMark (CDM) is a free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tool that some have posted here. Most reviews show a < 400mb\/s, so how do you interpret? In terms of ranking, this is in the bottom 20% of speed across competing flash drives, but the faster ones (700-1000 mb\/s) are going to be more expensive.If you want a cheap USB flash drive, you are going to wait longer to get larger amounts of data over the connection.

Dentro de la caja tenemos una bandeja de pl\u00e1stico donde est\u00e9 alojado el pendrive de 256\u202fGB.Es un pendrive con carcasa de pl\u00e1stico de color negro, en la propia carcasa se indica la marca, la capacidad y su n\u00famero de serie, pero no se indica que sea una memoria 3.1, este dato solo figura en la caja.Este modelo viene de f\u00e1brica en \u201cFAT32\u201d, por lo que, si queremos guardar archivos m\u00e1s de 4 GB, es conveniente formatearlo en \u201cNTFS\u201d o \u201cexFAT\u201d (Windows). La capacidad real con la que viene es de 231 GB y no 256 GB (Esto es debido 1 kilobyte son 1024 bytes y no 1000) y debemos aplicar la siguiente f\u00f3rmula: 0,9313 x GB, es decir qu\u00e9 multiplicando nos quedar\u00eda as\u00ed: 0,9313 x 256 GB = 238,41\u202fGB, pero este pendrive viene con menos GB \u201c231 GB\u201d.En el anuncio se indica que tiene una lectura de 130 MB\/s, cosa que cumple perfectamente, pero no est\u00e1 indicado la velocidad de escritura que es lo m\u00e1s relevante, que siendo un Pendrive 3.1 deber\u00eda superar los 600\u202fMB\/s que es el est\u00e1ndar m\u00e1ximo de un USB 3.0. Pero en todas las pruebas que he realizado me ofrece una velocidad de 80 MB\/s, en el mejor de los casos, siendo lo normal 60 MB\/s. Con los TEST, me pasa exactamente lo mismo.El hardware que tengo emplea puertos USB 3.2 (MSI X570 CREATION + Ryzen 9 3900X + 32\u202fGB RAM), por lo que no es problema de mi hardware, adem\u00e1s tengo otros pendrives que siendo 3.0 superan la velocidad de escritura de este modelo de pendrive en su versi\u00f3n 3.1 (Empleado S.O Windows 11).Caracter\u00edsticas:Marca: Amazon BasicsOrigen: TAIW\u00c1NASIN: B0B61DGG18Color: NegroMaterial: Pl\u00e1sticoTipo: USB Tipo AVersi\u00f3n: 3.1Nombre dispositivo: General USB FlashCapacidad: 256\u202fGB (Real 231 GB)Formato: FAT32 (De f\u00e1brica)Velocidad escritura m\u00e1xima obtenida: - 80 MB\/sVelocidad lectura m\u00e1xima obtenida: + 200 MB\/sDimensiones: 56,97 mm de largo x 20,13 mm de ancho x 12,44 mm de grosorPeso: 8,3 gramos (Pendrive)* Es un pendrive USB tipo A de 256 GB (Mucha capacidad), ahora la velocidad de escritura es bastante lenta para ser un pendrive 3.1, ya sean archivos grandes o peque\u00f1os.** En el anuncio solo se indica la velocidad de lectura, pero no la de escritura.*** No le doy las 5 estrellas porque es un pendrive bastante lento para ser USB 3.1, ahora por capacidad esta bastante bien de precio (-20\u20ac).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"168 people found this helpful","country":"Spain","date":1666742400000}

This whole rounding up to the nearest power of 2 thing in advertising storage devices is false advertising and it really isn't necessary. Just say what it is... it's a good value without fibbing.Speed: The *Interface* speed is great, sure, but devices like this use a small write cache to hide the fact that the actual flash media is way slower than the interface. If you write a little bit of data, you can rapidly move it to the write cache and the device can claim it finished while slowly finishing the actual write in firmware. If you write a lot of data you will fill the write cache and the transfer will slow down to approximately the speed of the actual flash media. On this device I seem to get about 20.5 MB\/s once this happens. This is the speed you should expect if transferring a large amount of data (although lots of tiny files will always be slower so you may see somewhat slower speeds IRL). This isn't too bad for a budget drive, but it's nowhere close to a high-performance thumbdrive or a USB SSD. Just set your expectations accordingly.In summary, this is a descent drive and is pretty fast for a budget drive.

Ich wollte ca. 160 GB vom Laufwerk D (HDD) auf den Stick kopieren und wunderte mich gleich zu Beginn \u00fcber die \"rasante\" Kopiergeschwindigkeit vom 10 MB\/s bis 30 MB\/s. Die Betonung liegt eher 10 MB\/s. Ok, ich lass es mal laufen da der Stick als Langzeitspeicher verwendet wird. Bei t\u00e4glichem Gebrauch h\u00e4tte ich ihn gleicher eingepackt und zur\u00fcck geschickt. Also liess ich den Kopiervorgang laufen und schaute mal nach rund 2 Stunden was kopiert wurde. \u00dcberraschung! Der Kopiervorgang wurde gestoppt und da stand doch tats\u00e4chlich die Meldung, dass ein Order mit 4,3 GB zu gross ist f\u00fcr den Stick. Was soll das? Ich hab den Stick neu formatiert und die Ordner einzeln kopiert. Das funktioniert tats\u00e4chlich aber eben sehr langsam. Um die GB-Auslastung des Sticks zu pr\u00fcfen rief ich die Folder Sizes des Sticks und des Ordner auf der SSD auf. Es gibt einen Unterschied.

{"reviewTitle":"Entt\u00e4uschender Ausfall nach kurzem Einsatz","reviewDescription":"Das Amazon Basics 128 GB USB 3.1 Flash-Laufwerk startete mit vielversprechenden Spezifikationen und einer hohen Erwartungshaltung meinerseits. Mit einer angegebenen Lesegeschwindigkeit von bis zu 130 Mbit\/s und der gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigen Kapazit\u00e4t von 128 GB schien es ideal f\u00fcr den t\u00e4glichen Gebrauch, sei es f\u00fcr die \u00dcbertragung gro\u00dfer Datenmengen oder als erweiterter Speicher f\u00fcr Multimedia-Dateien. Die USB 3.1 Technologie versprach zudem eine schnelle und effiziente Leistung.Anf\u00e4ngliche Erfahrungen:Performance: In den ersten Tagen funktionierte das Laufwerk tadellos. Dateien wurden schnell geladen und gespeichert, und die hohe \u00dcbertragungsgeschwindigkeit wurde deutlich sp\u00fcrbar. Diese Performance machte es zu einem scheinbar hervorragenden Wert f\u00fcr den Preis.Doch dann kamen die Probleme:Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit: Leider hielt die Freude nicht lange an. Nach nur wenigen Tagen Nutzung erlitt das Flash-Laufwerk einen vollst\u00e4ndigen Ausfall. Es wurde pl\u00f6tzlich von keinem meiner Ger\u00e4te mehr erkannt, und jegliche Versuche, auf die gespeicherten Daten zuzugreifen oder den Stick zu formatieren, schlugen fehl.Datenverlust: Dieser Ausfall f\u00fchrte zum Verlust aller darauf gespeicherten Daten. F\u00fcr mich als Nutzer, der wichtige Arbeitsdokumente und pers\u00f6nliche Daten auf dem Flash-Laufwerk gespeichert hatte, war dies nicht nur \u00e4rgerlich, sondern auch problematisch.Verarbeitungsqualit\u00e4t: Obwohl das Laufwerk \u00e4u\u00dferlich robust wirkte, legen die internen Komponenten nahe, dass die Verarbeitungsqualit\u00e4t m\u00f6glicherweise nicht den Standards entspricht, die f\u00fcr eine langfristige und zuverl\u00e4ssige Datenspeicherung erforderlich sind.Fazit:Das Amazon Basics 128 GB USB 3.1 Flash-Laufwerk hat anf\u00e4nglich durch seine Leistung \u00fcberzeugt, doch der schnelle und unerwartete Ausfall hat dieses Bild stark getr\u00fcbt. Dies wirft Fragen bez\u00fcglich der Qualit\u00e4tskontrolle und Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit der Amazon Basics Speicherprodukte auf. F\u00fcr potenzielle K\u00e4ufer w\u00fcrde ich empfehlen, m\u00f6glicherweise etwas mehr zu investieren in Produkte, die eine h\u00f6here Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit und Kundensupport bieten.Dieser Vorfall hat deutlich gemacht, dass bei der Auswahl von Datenspeicherl\u00f6sungen nicht nur die Spezifikationen, sondern auch die Langzeit-Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit und die Erfahrungen anderer Nutzer zu ber\u00fccksichtigen sind.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"Germany","date":1713139200000}

Can't care less about read speed as what i'm always waiting for is writing completion. As it's usual in this market, read speed is better. Seq write speed is much less than 256GB version (100MBs) but acceptable and as planned. However Windows copy  shows lot of choppiness (see graph) and real speed is just 20MBs on several USB controllers. And that's not good. I care very much about 4K write speed too - that's what massively slows down Linux installations. So it's better than usual <1MBs. A  nice bump. But with the choppiness, it cannot be used for ISOs, nor recording (like several customers point out). Just like 99% of others on the market.Noticed the drive went off and on many times. Brief resets audible on Windows and visible in usbdeview.exe.The device looks like Extreme Pro but it's far from that. Controllers seems cheap.  No LED light.

Not only is it Huge, also fast transfer times on a USB 3.0 connection compared to every one I have, to include a pair of Lexar ones of the same size (& more costly at around $30) purchased at Costco 4-5 years back. Of course, these components typically gets better over time, can recall a pair of 4GB SanDisk ones costing near the same (each).A lot of computer users, myself included, could backup our Windows or \"C\" partition with this size of a USB drive. As long as the backup program allows. Or can store lots of digital pics & movies, although I prefer to store these on traditional hard drives, the spinning ones. They'll last longer on magnetic versus Flash media. This is Not because of a defect in Flash (cell) type media, rather if sitting unused for a long time (from 2-5+ years), any copies made won't look as good as when taken. Don't store near hot places, like close to a computer.Will be buying more of these in the near future! One more use of this is to have a portable, Secure operating system in your pocket, like Windows to Go or a Linux based one, such as Linux Mint or Ubuntu, among others. There are guides on how to do this, but most important, unplug the main drive on your computer while creating this. Otherwise, can mess the bootloader of your Windows computer up. Just unplug the SATA cable (the narrow one) to your existing drive or remove the drive if NVMe or mSATA. At it's 128GB size, perfect for secrecy!Bottom line, if I could give this drive 10 Stars, I would, and by the time it's said & done, will have 5-6 of these for my purposes (storage & secret OS's). Also has the Amazon Basics warranty. So be sure to test when purchased.EDIT: This drive has been so fast & dependable that I also purchased the 256GB model for $5-6 more!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689379200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Worst USB Stick I Have Ever Used - Erases Files","reviewDescription":"Two MAJOR issues with this USB stick make it completely unusable and unreliable:1. It ERASES your data! This happened to me twice in one week after 20 years of it never happening with any other USB storage. Today was the second time it happened. I was transferring 112 iphone video files from one computer to another and when I plugged it into the second computer there were only 24 files left.2. It routinely disconnects itself from your device even when you have absolutely not touched it.An absolute piece of garbage. Amazon should be ashamed of this product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679961600000}
