{"reviewTitle":"Eh - It's Just Okay","reviewDescription":"I've had this now for about a week. I bought it to check in on my new puppy while I'm at work. I'm rating it a 3 because I'll admit, the picture quality is far better than I imagined. I was floored when I saw how good the night vision is! Excellent picture all around .... When it works, that is.I haven't had a second to purchase an SD card, so perhaps the experience will improve once I get that far. As for now, I turn it on before I leave in the morning and turn it off when I get home (the constant notifications drive me crazy with the puppy running around in front of it and I'm not quite sure i want to see a \ud83d\udc7b when I'm in bed lol). But I've found, it glitches A LOT. I have a 20 minute commute and by the time I get to work, it's already cut off. I'm often having to turn it back on. It's rare that I can get the live feed. I'm constantly having to get out of the app and back in again to hopefully force it to work - sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. My internet connection is always incredibly good so I don't think it's that, as is my mobile data (IDK if one has anything to do with the other \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).It's actually a good camera and easy to use.

The 2K version of this device surprisingly has a narrower field of view, meaning there is less picture captured around the perimeter of the image than the standard version.The picture difference between the 2K and standard version is insignificant. The 2K version offers significantly more digital zoom within the app, and objects at distance are slightly clearer.The devices are good and the app is not bad. The devices struggle a bit with connectivity even at a moderate distance from an access point, leading to some stalls within the app.Advanced users: These devices require access to WAN. I have blocked them from internet and attempted accessing them on my local network. I can rotate the camera, but no image is returned. It seems all image communication within the app is external. The only traffic between this device and the outside world are two AWS addresses. The addresses DO have a web page stating they belong to Kasa, but nothing stops a bad actor from getting an AWS address and discretely mimicing this behavior to MITM traffic should a vulnerability be discovered.You are NOT forced to use cloud storage with these devices.

{"reviewTitle":"Sort of Worked","reviewDescription":"I bought this on 5-9-22 and by 6-16 it had stopped working as well. The monthly subscription plan was impossible to find. At one point I got an message in the kasa app about how I can be notified by email when my kasa is turned off daily, but despite it being a good idea I waited, and when I couldn't find the option, kasa customer service in taiwan denied any and all involvement with such a message or feature.On 6-16, a month in, the kasa camera developed an over 60 second delay between the cell phone video shown and the actual direction the camera was pointed. In the same day, my blink mini read 'backup failed for 'MTWTrF'.Almost every time, when arriving home, turning off the kasa camera that had detected my motion and that was pointed at me correctly, took minutes. The app is slow, and the off button takes more than a few presses for camera to turn off. In actually checking the feed, to see if there was any recorded motion while away, the camera often took another minute to load that specific window.The app sort of makes sense, and for $29, and no monthly cost for the camera to operate, its ok. But getting the video off it is harder, while the monthly subscription is hard to find.In signing up for the subscription, $3 is missing from my account monthly, but there isn't a registered transaction that I can find. This implies I have to work with their tech support or replace the initial pan tilt.\/\/\/More than a year later, the kasa pan tilt still works, but I worry of increases in small problems from a better review. What stands out is the app, and related gadgets. The app itself looks really smart, from scheduled on and off patterns. The kasa pan tilt goes well with kasa light strips, and there are a ton of scheduled features possible that integrate the camera with lights.But, despite the app being quite smart, and well integrated with other devices that similarly work, the pan tilt app could use a lot more smart features in the app. There could be a more complex schedule, so that the pan tilt could turn on at approximately 9 am, and switch to a different area of the room every 10 minutes, with changes in camera direction happening at controllable increments.As it is, its possible to schedule turn on the camera, so it reacts to and tracks motion, and put it in a patrol mode, but its not possible to auto schedule a shifting array. Its not possible to tune the camera so it tracks and follow motion between 9 am and 5 pm, but turn off the track and follow feature once I am likely to get in. Nor it it possible to schedule the camera to patrol the room once an hour, to save the motor.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1655424000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Should Have Read More Reviews.....Disappointed is an understatement..","reviewDescription":"I want to preface this review by saying I was excited to find a camera with a budget friendly cost and a good amount of positive reviews, so I was hopeful...Review for: Kasa Indoor Pan\/Tilt Smart Security Camera EC70I purchased this camera on August 17th 2023, it delivered on August 27th. I did not subscribe as I did not want my information stored anywhere, so I purchased memory cards separately. Upon receiving the camera, I was quickly up and running, the instructions were clear and I was able to follow them without any concerns. The camera worked beautifully, seamlessly, and clear, for roughly 2 months. On October 22nd 2023, I started noticing glitches in the streaming and an extremely long time loading. I want to note that my household runs SOLELY on a wifi network and because of this, I am equipped to handle various devices and have a very strong connection. No other device in my household has encountered such problems.Finally after a few hours of glitches and loading issues, I went into \"settings\" on the Kasa App to help diagnose a problem. Turns out my camera was offline. SHOCKER. After the app prompted me through the laundry list of troubleshooting, I completed this list SEVERAL times. I reset, I unplugged, I reset again, I removed device, I re-added device, reset my home router, still to no avail. Literally, hours spent trying to figure out how to make my camera reconnect. I even went as far as to call my internet service provider to see if there was an outage, even though ALL OTHER devices in my home were streaming perfectly, my phone was working, and appliances were connected. I know, crazy, if I would have had an issue with my home wifi, I am certain any other device or ALL would have issues. But no just this camera.I reached out to the customer service team via email and provided a thorough & detailed explanation of the issues I was having , and they responded with asking me to provide a \"small video about the APP slow to load.\" whatever that means. They provided a link for trouble shooting, and if that still didn't work then I would have to send another email telling them in detail what steps I followed. Which I very much explained in my initial email. I went through ALL troubleshooting steps again, close now to 20 times and was able to get connection but it was somehow worse than before. I emailed them telling them step-by-step, and even told them I wasn't sure why I needed to re-explain the steps I am taking when they are the EXACT same. Granted this camera did not cost me my life savings, but it should work longer than 2 months. They responded telling me to download A WHOLE OTHER APP and follow the steps in the email in the app and send back the files collected, as if I am part of their IT team? HECK NO. I will not download another app and send back \"files\" just to not have resolution again. Who knows what data is collected during that process.I am almost embarrassed how frustrated I am with this whole thing. I really just wanted to put my experience out there so someone else doesn't have to deal with the bull I just went through. Do not contact customer service, they are NO help, and only send emails during witching hour.I am eating the cost of this camera and know now to better invest in my future purchase.I DO NOT suggest this camera, READ all reviews, good and bad.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"157 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698796800000}

Both cameras are controlled by the same mobile app.The first camera stopped working after 2-3 days. When I tried to reset it, the app reported it as already configured failing to add as active device. I returned Tapo C211, uninstalled mobile app and got Kasa EC71.Trying to setup EC71 I installed the mobile app again (where I already had account). However, I got the same error from the app - already configured. This time I decided to seek for tech support. I spent 2 hours getting through the same reset\/setup process with technician on chat. At some point he suggested to check and modify DNS configuration on my router. That triggered my suspicion - is it common for average consumer to even know what the router is. Anyway, I checked the router setting - camera was listed in router devices but not recognized by the mobile app.Once the chat ended, I got email from tech support suggesting \"It has the possibility of the compatible issue causing the connection issue, that's why we want to check the router settings.... please install Teamviewer on Windows PC and send me the ID and password...

{"reviewTitle":"Terrible Experience with the Kasa Pan\/Tilt Camera","reviewDescription":": Terrible Experience with the Kasa Pan\/Tilt CameraI recently purchased the Kasa Pan\/Tilt Camera and I must say, it has been an absolute disappointment. From the moment I set it up, I encountered numerous issues that have made me regret my decision to purchase this product.First and foremost, the camera's pan and tilt functionality is extremely unreliable. It often fails to respond to commands, leaving me unable to adjust the camera's view remotely. This defeats the purpose of having a pan\/tilt camera in the first place. I expected smooth and seamless control, but instead, I am left frustrated and unable to monitor different areas of my home effectively.Furthermore, the camera's video quality is subpar at best. Despite boasting high-definition capabilities, the footage captured by the Kasa Pan\/Tilt Camera is grainy and lacks clarity. It is nearly impossible to make out any details, making it useless for identifying faces or objects. I expected a much better image quality for the price I paid.Another major issue I encountered is the camera's connectivity problems. It frequently disconnects from the Wi-Fi network, making it unreliable for continuous monitoring. I have tried troubleshooting the issue multiple times, but the problem persists. This is a major flaw, as I rely on the camera for security purposes and need it to be consistently connected.Additionally, the Kasa Pan\/Tilt Camera lacks essential features that are standard in other security cameras on the market. For instance, there is no two-way audio capability, which means I cannot communicate with anyone on the other end of the camera. This is a significant drawback, as it limits the camera's functionality and usefulness.Overall, my experience with the Kasa Pan\/Tilt Camera has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. The unreliable pan and tilt functionality, poor video quality, frequent connectivity issues, and lack of essential features make this product a complete letdown. I would strongly advise against purchasing this camera if you are looking for a reliable and high-quality security solution.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"17 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705708800000}

And forget about panning or even trying to navigate to one of my saved \"views.\" The app lags to the point where I can't even change the basic settings. Just getting into the menu has the little progress wheel spinning endlessly. If I try to even navigate out, it basically freezes. I've had to force stop this app so many times. I even restarted my phone. I put a microSD in the camera, by the way, but I can't even get to a setting where I can see that it's installed properly and working.And it's not my phone or wifi. My phone is a Samsung galaxy s22+ and has never had a problem running any app I've downloaded - except this one - and my wifi has never had a problem connecting to anything - and I have a decent amount of smart things.All I wanted to do was have a camera that I could use to occasionally look in on my crated dogs to make sure they were OK. This is the simplest task I could ask this camera to do and it fails miserably. At this point, I might as well just buy another freaking doorbell camera. It can't pan, but it actually works, unlike this waste of money and electricity. Oh, yes, it's a waste of electricity because it won't even let me turn it off from the app! It linked to Google Home successfully, but I can't even power it on or off from there. Once again, it just spins endlessly!Oh, and there's no household support, meaning that if you want your SO to have access, you need to turn off 2-factor and give them your sign-in info so that it's both of you signed into one account.

I initially got them for 2 reasons, 1, I wanted more pan and tilt cameras like my old Zmodo ones. They don't make them anymore, so I thought these were the next best option because reason 2, I love my Kasa smart plugs and switches. I thought it'd be great to have everything on one app!Well, got them and set them up right out of the box with few issues. At first it was user error because I didn't plug the USB cord all the way into the wall plug. (Duh!) After that was fixed, set up was a breeze, just like my other Kasa products! Everything worked great! I set up the zones, which was a brilliant feature and it followed movement. I also loved how you could set 4 different views and toggle the camera between them to get quick views. They were a dream!Fast forward a few hours, and I was getting movement alerts and I thought, \"Ooo! I wonder what my cats are up to!\" Clicked on the notification and it took me to the camera part in the app, but there was no video to look at! I clicked on the tab where the clips are supposed to be and nothing. Nothing on the notifications. Okay, thought it was odd, but we'd give it a fair shake. Maybe it was a fluke. Nope! Every time it was set off, I couldn't retrieve any clips. Annoying. What's the point if you can only see it live? I let it go until the next day. I went to the app to see the camera views and they were offline. Okay, weird. Maybe my wifi was acting up. Checked again later. Still nothing but a blinking green light, which supposedly means that it is hooked up to the wifi, but can't access the cloud, and therefore, can't access the app. Annoying. Tonight, I tried about 57 times to get it back online. I did a soft reset. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. I did a factory reset. I deleted it from the app and tried putting it back on. I did all of these multiple times to no avail. I have 2 worthless pieces of plastic now unplugged, sitting on my table ready to be sent back. Do yourself a favor and avoid these junk cameras. It's not worth the headache. Also, if they own your video\/feed, that's a big no-no. I don't want them looking in my home whenever. What if I'm running to the laundry room in my underwear to get a clean pair of pants?! I don't want anyone to see that! Also, I haven't left the house since I've set them up, so I can't confirm or deny weather or not they work outside of the home wifi. I know others had this issue, but I never got to test it.

I would've paid $10 more for a battery version. Without battery, it simply means that it's hard to change its location and it won't work without electricity.Noisy rotation! It's definitely not a stealth camera because there's no way to hide its noise and lights.Sluggish tracking! The latency is quite high to track a kid who's walking fast.Bought 2k QHD but still not looking that good.Overall: Great camera for very light monitoring on house and kids. I'd advise you to make sure that your router has 2.4 ghz wifi before buying this device which works only on 2.4 ghz. If not, you'll need to buy a wifi converter(I bought the Atomi Smart Wifi 2.4 ghz converter). It'll save you time and money on buying a new router or trying cheap tricks that won't work.Update(1\/31\/2024): There's an option to turn off its lights on the app.My camera can't reconnect when the power goes out for more than 5 minutes or when the memory card is full. The worse part is that it can stop saving  data without you knowing it. From November 2023 to January 2024, the camera wasn't saving anything locally until I tried to review some recordings and found out that it wasn't recording for several months when the memory card was still there without issue.

{"reviewTitle":"Motion Detection Hit\/Miss, Google Integration Meh, Picture quality great","reviewDescription":"First the good, the picture quality on this camera is great. Even the night mode is clear as expected for a 2k camera. It really delivers. It's nice being able to control the viewing angle too to look around the room. I also like that the camera can be turned on and off for privacy and be scheduled (If only my life was entirely predictable and could be scheduled a little better).But now for the bad, the motion detection is really hit or miss on this. Especially at night, day time it's actually pretty good. I use this mostly as a cat camera and I was hoping to tell if anyone was breaking into my house. But sadly if you adjust the sensitivity too high it detects the cat as a person during the day and if you adjust it too low the camera fails to pick up the cat at night and will stay stuck in whatever orientation it was last in which may mean it's facing a corner where it last saw the cat sleeping during the day... Not great if you have windows on the other side of the house you were hoping it would notice motion on. To its credit you can have the camera rotate views at set times, but it specifically warns this will reduce its life span significantly and is not recommended.Also, how I was saying privacy mode is great since this is in the house and people may not want to be being recorded when we're home.... ya between all of our other smart apps it's a real pain this doesn't integrate better with google \/ alexa. I understand it's a \"privacy\" concern to be able to turn the camera on and off I guess but it's annoying that rather than just saying \"hey google turn the camera off\" I have to open the app half a dozen times a day to turn it off. Or I just can't make it a part of one of my routines. About all you can do is ask it to bring up the camera for viewing, which is great don't get me wrong... but not super useful since I likely have my phone on me and could just pull the app up rather than leaving my show.All and all a nice camera for the money. Still really useful to have, just wish for more convenience. Would be great at least if they would include pet detection like they have baby detection. If the thing moving isn't large enough to be a person I don't need an alert. You can set motion areas surely you can detect if an object is large enough to be a person, a dog, or a cat.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671926400000}

The app gives a spin wheel then a couple of seconds later a popup notice saying \"Operation failed\", which is expected since your connection is slow. And if you try to access the cam again when your connection is still poor, you may suddenly notice that the cam is now marked as \"Offline\" in the Kasa app! And once it is marked as \"Offline\", you lose all access to the cam completely! This happened to me when I was traveling in Asia. And I waited for a couple of days and the cam was still \"Offline\". I had to ask someone to go to my place to power-cycle the cam to get it back online again! And this happened several times and at the end I gave up on remote access to the cam. During the same trip, I had no problem accessing my other wi-fi connected devices at home (Garage, thermostat, etc.)By the way, I've contacted Kasa's tech support but they refused to consider this is their design problem.

I guess I can't ding the star rating for something it doesn't claim to do, but, they absolutely should.The app setup process requires location access. The app claims this is \"to determine sunrise and sunset times.\" While it is nice that they actually offer an explanation, it's not a particularly believable explanation. At the very least, it doesn't belong in the first-time-camera-setup process. Prompt me for that later. Otherwise, it's just creepy.The app also doesn't do anything to automatically discover the camera. Further, it makes you switch wifi networks to continue the setup process. The IMOU Life camera setup process does that work for you. TP-Link should be able to do as much.Lastly, without internet access the camera is useless. Even though you're on the same wifi network with the camera, you can't use it if your internet goes down, which is just a poor engineering decision.To have any hope of achieving 5-stars, a camera absolutely needs RTSP support (preferably also ONVIF) so that I can use the camera with the Streamie app so that I can get it on my TV.

(We tried covering them up but it messes with function) Which makes it so we can\u2019t see him in the dark. And our 6 month old just lays there and stares at the lights on hers so we often keep them off as well. I\u2019m not sure why this is a feature, no other camera had red lights in order to make night vision mode work. And it doesn\u2019t help that the camera is white circle with a black \u201cface\u201d and 2 red glowing eyes in the center. If you intend to use these as a baby monitor, I would reconsider.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672963200000}

The camera was super easy to set up and worked great for a few days until we unplugged it while out of town. Once we plugged it back into the wall, the camera still worked, but lost all the custom spots we set up previously and it would lose connection to my phone once I left home. I tried the reset button for 5 secs and that didn't work. After that I removed the camera devise from the Kasa app and tried to reconnect but it wont even reconnect. All the camera does is blink green and refuses to reconnect to my Kasa app. The app is telling me to unplug the camera to restart it so I guess when I unplugged it initially I restarted it. I loved the camera when it worked, but now its just getting frustrating.

I found out in the activity option that it had been recording us the whole time and RECORDING saved on KASAcloud, which I do not even subscribe to. I tried to download it but it said it was no longer available.

Its easy to set up the app, just follow the instructions it tells you. It pans well and sets up zones. You click the zone you want and it automatically goes to the set point. The activity alerts pop up all the time which is annoying but also nice at the same time so i know when he starts to move around.  Also when you are on the app away from home, the microphone (from camera) picks up sound perfectly. I can hear when he barks or even what tv show is on for him. The \u201cnight vision\u201d is really clear so you can see decently good when its pitch black. Now the Dislikes:  first i have to say is the microphone (from the app) or speaker,  to me it doesnt pick up your voice till late over the camera speaker and end up only hearing parts out of the camera speaker. Its also muffled sounding even when talking slow to try to get it to pick up what youre saying.  It would be nice to be able to talk to him when he gets restless.  Next the panning function from the app. When you move the camera its lags. Meaning when you move the camera, you have to let go of the \u201cjoystick\u201d early in order for it to stop where you want it. Also when you, lets say, pan left, right at the start it will move a different direction and than pan left. Its weird. The camera itself also goes blurry when panning but once you stop its clear as can be.

Kasa blames internet connection and that is and is not the case. With the price point and how it works. Even the fastest internet will struggle. Further more the input lag makes it almost impossible to use the camera rotation well. SD playback is slow as well. The reality is if you are only using the SD card; their are a lot of internet based steps to get to your phone.-The camera detects people when they are not there. Tried to find many solutions but it's just not there.Even with all that said I'm tempted to give it a 5 star BUT their is one super con that is a deal breaker.Super con:-there is no gaurd mode.Sounds stupid but it really needs it. There is an overall lack of some major features even with the paid subscription. This one is the biggest. There is no way to utilize the cameras detection abilities.There are only two options: always detect, or set a schedule.Sounds fine but it's aweful.If you plan on leaving the house and want to get notified about detection. To bad you can't because you set a schedule for when you are at work. You think... Well I'll just turn it always on when I leave. When you do that it clears the schedule that you made. Still doesn't sound too bad? Well you have to do that for every camera you own and it takes time. You need to wait for the icon to load for the one camera... Tap on that to view the picture then you can access the camera, change your settings then go back and do it for the next camera. So on and so fourth. Then later you need to input the schedule for each individual camera all over again.I love kasa products and this camera is great.

I wanted to get a view of the hallway and my dining room so I had to mount it on the wall near the ceiling.In order to get it to view down the hall I had to put washers behind the lower screw so the mount was tilted toward the ceiling more. I tried to make sure I got the mount centered right but the template only tells you how far apart the screws are not where the camera rests. I was off by about a half inch which makes the camera tilted to the right when at rest making it not centered on the room I want to detect motion from. It will sometime stay center after I adjust it on the app but not always so I end up with a rotated view of half the room and it doesn't pickup motion from the other half of the room.The motion sensor doesn't always detect my pets so its unreliable for tracking.The zones I set to detect motion in dont work.  Only 2 of the zones show the right area the other 2 show the ceiling even though I've tried resetting them several times.When I pan the camera from my phone it tells me I've reached the limit even though I know it can show the entire room.

{"reviewTitle":"Important things to know about this product","reviewDescription":"First off, I am a cybersecurity expert and admittedly hypersensitive to my privacy. That being said, I am no longer using this product due to the TPLink\/Kasa cloud service requirement. This product can not be used strictly on a local network and you cannot directly control the camera from a client device (phone\/tablet\/PC\/etc.). It MUST go through TPLink\/Kasa\u2019s cloud services to function. This doesn\u2019t sit well with me, but I understand a lot of people will have no problem with this.Privacy concerns aside, this camera had network connection issues where the camera would drop off the network very frequently to the point that it became unusable. I had the camera <10 feet from my 2.4Ghz wireless access point. No other devices had the same connections issues, so it was not an issue with my network. The ability to store footage locally via SD card was a nice fallback to these issues, however SD storage comes pretty standard on similar cameras from competitors as well.This is a great, cheap camera for a lot of people. It just wasn\u2019t for me.

Since the camera came with SD card storage, I thought I can check the videos from the SD card via the App and can skip purchasing any Cloud subscription plan! But that is not the case...to watch the video stored in the SD card you need to put the SD card on your laptop SD card slot (assuming it has a SD card slot or you have to use a SD card adaptor) to view the videos. Imagine you going through the whole night's recording which are in 5 to 15 mins clips to find out the movements \/ activities???! You will be spending hours doing it..totally useless, unless you want to use it just for live view or to get motion alerts and then check the live view or buy their cloud subscription plan.The worse thing is that videos are recorded to SD card only if you enable 24x7 recording. So only if motion alerts are enabled no videos are recorded. In the app if you check the activity, it says no activities recorded in the cloud! So they want you to buy the subscription plans to view motion alert related videos.

THERE IS NO WAY TO JUST SAVE EVENT VIDEOS TO THE SD CARD! I do get a folder for each hour an event occurred that contains 1 jpg image, 640 x 360, for each event in that hour.

Note: All of these cameras are on same TP-LINK (Kasa) Mesh Network with average speeds of 450MBPS. The KC410S cameras have VERY Serious lagging delays when trying to view LIVE and sometimes takes minutes for cameras to show Live View if at all.

Trying to access files on cloud service only shows very little of actual activities and many clips are unavailable with square X indicating Errors. The recordings on MicroSD are intermittent with breaks of nothing recorded even though settings are for Recording 24\/7 . I am under the impression it is issues with the Software & Chip rather than the build quality of the video cameras because the picture quality is excellent and the pan & tilt features work flawlessly when you are able to access the cameras Live.

The description says: \u201ccontinuously records and stores footage OR video clips on a local MicroSD card\u2026\u201d Tech support confirms my experience that there is no way to store just motion video clips on the SD card. Instead, you must set the camera to record continuously (24\/7) to be able to later review those portions of the footage where motion was detected. Since recording continuously can fill up your SD card quickly, check the Kasa knowledge base to get estimates of the size SD card you will need for your purposes.  (You are able to schedule continuous recording for just portions of the day.) Note also that the SD card video is not encrypted. If a thief steals your camera or SD card they can view your recordings on a computer. An alternative is to pay monthly for Kasa\u2019s cloud storage. SECOND WARNING: If you want to use multiple activity zones, you must set the camera in \u201cPatrol Mode.\u201d This means the camera motor is constantly engaged as the camera moves to each zone for a user-selected time period. Kasa\u2019s knowledge base warns that Patrol Mode may prematurely damage the motor (although for 2-years the warranty should cover such damage.) These are disappointments to me along with sometimes-slow response. But with those exceptions I like Kasa\u2019s pan\/tilt camera. Having both Arlo and Eufy cameras, Kasa offers some settings that I like.

I do have a separate security system for the outdoors, and I wanted something simple and portable to use indoors. I chose the Kasa camera because I already have the Kasa smart plugs. For about $20 dollars this is a camera with a lot of nice features. It is extremely easy to install and use. First, download the Kasa Smart App and create an account. Second, plug the camera into a power source, open the app add the camera and follow the directions. Once added, use the 3rd party tab to add to your Alexa account and google home account. If you already have added those accounts, then the camera will automatically be added and you can access it through the Alexa and google home app. The camera once added did require a firmware update and this took about 2 minutes. Some helpful tips I learned during my encounter with set up. The EC70 camera will accept a microSD card from 8 to 256GB used for local storage. Even though it tells you during set up to add, you will NOT be able to do so unless the camera is tilted up as high as it can go. So, you may have to finish set\u00a0up, then start the camera and tilt it up before you can install it. For the Alexa app, the app will NOT turn the EC70 camera on or off. I am able to connect the camera to my Echo Show and FireTV only. The camera WILL send notifications to any Amazon device, and you are able to pick which devices to receive notifications. For google home, it is essentially the same, you need to have a Nest or Chromecast device in order to view the EC70 camera output. You probably will need to use the google help page for instructions on how to set it up. You can set the EC70 camera for different views of the area you wish to see, and can also place it on patrol mode to automatically move to each view. There are a wide range of positions available to meet your particular specifications and needs. The camera is mobile, unless you attach it to a wall or ceiling with the included bracket. The picture quality is great, and you do have options for the video quality settings depending on your wifi. I read other reviews and some of the negativity of the EC70 camera most likely is due to your wifi, not the actual equipment. I have used this camera to watch the front door when I am in the back, and also to watch the dogs. It is nice to receive the notification that they are at the door, so I can let them out to do their business. I am very happy with my purchase. I hope you find this review helpful.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"60 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714694400000}

I need to know when an aging parent is moving or trying to get out of bed. The promise of easy motion detection \"instant notifications\" seemed perfect, but this camera simply does not deliver.  Sometimes the notifications come at once, sometimes they come up to 5 minutes late, and sometimes there's no notification at all.  I have had multiple lengthy email conversations with the support team but they have no answers.POOR CONNECTIVITY WITH THE APP - I am using this TP Link camera with a brand new tp-link mesh Wi-Fi system. However, there are times when the phone app, which is connected to the same wi-fi system as the camera, simply will not connect to the camera. I have uploaded a screenshot of what I seen this happens.  The app is the only way to see what is happening. There is no desktop app or PC connectivity. Again, I have had multiple email conversations with different departments at the tp-link customer support and no one has been able to solve this either.POOR TWO-WAY AUDIO - the audio that comes from the camera to the app is good. However, the speaker in the camera is so tiny and weak that no one in the room being monitored can hear communications or even notice when someone is speaking to them through the camera.POSITIVES - The pan and tilt function works very well. Picture quality is good and night vision is effective. Setting up through the app is very easy, although continued functionality is incredibly spotty.SUMMARY - this would probably be a great camera for someone at work who wants to see what their cat is doing during the day. Don't use it in any case where reliable video or audio is necessary! If you want it just for entertainment or casual viewing, it will be perfect.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620950400000}

I initially really liked them- easy to set up, app is easy to use and the cameras tilt and you can talk through the cameras. However there is a fatal flaw if you use more than one camera- the app asks after 10 minutes if you want to keep streaming. It is impossible to use these monitors as baby monitors when you were sleeping at night because it timed out after 10 minutes and you have to continue clicking it every 10 minutes to stream. I contacted the manufacturers in hopes of a resolution, but their solution was for me to literally click every 10 minutes while I\u2019m sleeping at night to continue streaming. Obviously, this is not feasible. I am not sure why this camera is advertised as a baby monitor. Please beware as this could be very dangerous for people who don\u2019t realize that they aren\u2019t actually tuned in to their kids when they\u2019re sleeping at night. I asked for a refund since this is not stated anywhere and they told me they don\u2019t offer refunds. So I told them I\u2019d be sure to share the struggle I had with them and their product here.

{"reviewTitle":"Worked great for a few months but one will not read SD cards anymore","reviewDescription":"I bought two of these to watch our cats since they were having some issues and needed a 24\/7 recording option to watch their activity\u2026. and for a while they worked great. However, the 24\/7 functionality on one of the cameras has completely stopped working, doesn\u2019t matter if I factory reset the camera or try different SD cards, it refuses to read the SD card. It\u2019s only been 6 months so pretty poor longevity there. I tried to get a replacement through Amazon who told me to go to the manufacturer, but their warranty process is very onerous for a $34 camera, so I\u2019ll just buy a camera from a different brand in the future. I would also say while the app looks like the 24\/7 recording function needs work\u2026 it does take a long time to load recordings and also it only lets you review in 5 min increments, so if you want to view 1:03 PM you have to watch from 1:00 PM for 3 minutes and be glued to it so you don\u2019t miss what you\u2019re looking for, which can be tedious.

They have even disabled motion detection recording when you have the SD memory installed. You can't even copy the installed chip, you have to remove it and put it in another device. It won't stream to a PC either, IOS and Android only. Total pain!I purchased this device to monitor my driveway and front door during the night and early morning. It is pretty useless for that application. If you want to look in to see if Jr. is OK, then go ahead (although the night vision was weak from 10 ft.).This would easily be a five star camera if it weren't for the handicaps they designed into it to sell their subscription service.

For 10 minutes I looked over every millimeter of the camera and couldn't find the Reset button. So as a last ditch idea I decided to manually rotate the camera ball upwards, because I already knew that's where you insert the SD Card, but rotating it while it was on seemed like a very bad idea for the motor. But wouldn't you know it, the Reset button was right next to the SD Card slot. I held it down for 5 seconds, and it cycled its power off and then back on, and then it started working properly by successfully connecting to my home WiFi. Like other people I was ready to give up and just return it. The Kasa app doesn't say anything about where to find the Reset button on your particular model of camera.

{"reviewTitle":"For the price, it's good.","reviewDescription":"So, I do security cameras for other folks as part of my job, but I needed an inexpensive, basic camera for inside my own home. This camera does well. Noise and motion detection is good (sometimes too good - it catches reflections real easy!). Yes, you can hear the motor when it turns, so, a little less quality build encasing the motor, but for the price - hey, that's reasonable (so 4 stars). The tracker gets bored quickly and resets to home. There are multiple features on this camera, like the patrol mode and zone monitoring that seem like they might be GREAT features. Frankly, I'm just too lazy to go through all the learning curves to deal with that (and the added features are not overly \"user friendly\" - and if that's the case for me, that means it's not pleasant for the average user, so a bonus, but a waste unless you want to take the time to learn it all). My living room is not large enough to need the full 360deg, and its noise detection can tell if someone's coming from off-screen. It does recognize people (which substituted the patrol mode for me). Great for night vision. Not obnoxious in size. Not intrusive. It's app is pretty basic - just like every other app out there but I DO like NO subscription fees just to \"use\" it (there may be some to store to the cloud?). It may have ads, but I haven't noticed. I did buy my own SD card, got the class 10, 256 GB high fidelity card, and ran this at 2k. Quality was GREAT. I tried 1080. Quality was still amazing. I went down to the 720... and quality was STILL great (but not for face recognition in low light). I'm not looking more than 25 - 30 feet away and the details are MORE than sufficient, giving me even longer record times before it overwrites. It doesn't always alert me on the app when it sees motion, that is touch and go? Maybe a network issue. I did have a 1-time loss of wifi with router at the very beginning, but that remedied itself. (and sometimes, it is slow to connect - but that is all network dependent, not necessarily the camera). Long story short - if someone's breaking into your home, you want to know immediately. You want faces. And, you want to be able to report it. This does that and well enough for the price (in fact, it just beeped at me thru my phone while sitting at work and typing this). Again, it's in the $30 - $40 range... so it's not going to be \"high class\". But, to get to that range, you're \"usually\" jumping into the $200-1200+ per camera category, so... for my tight budget, no. It has some mounting options, nothing fancy (like all others in this price range). It's corded, but you can always find solutions for that (and it's not a hidden cam, so cord doesn't really matter, and no battery powered cam will give you good, constant operations without fast draining). Funny note - it picked up motion on our TV screen while binging Supernatural! As an IT person who does camera set-up security, if you're on a budget, I recommend this. I was going to get a Hiseeu cam because of their quality build, but honestly, the Kasa has audio detection, better audio quality, near the same range of vertical motion, does not have to be mounted up-side down (can sit on its base), is smaller \/ less obvious, does well at night, does lack the \"emergency lights\" option (unless I'm mistaken, someone please correct me), and has a \"patrol\" mode (which, if you've ever used 360 degree cameras, you suddenly realize that it can't see someone coming from a blind spot and becomes obnoxiously useless without a patrol mode and\/or audio detection) - and altogether, even tho the Hiseeu motor is quiet and the build is stronger (and it can pair with an NVR whereas I have no idea if the Kasa can), that STILL makes Kasa the better option for me (on a budget).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"96 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701993600000}

I was looking to replace a Wyze camera around the same price point that has been having some video quality playback issues lately. I would rather keep the Wyze camera that has occasional playback issues because I can use the third-party app IFTTT to automatically turn on\/off notifications when I leave a specified area, or return to a specified area. This makes it so I never have to open the app unless I am notified of motion\/sound. Alternatively, this Kasa camera, while I am at home, is notifying me every five minutes of sound or motion. Needless to say, extremely annoying. I have many smart strips and smart plugs made by Kasa that work great, but this camera was a HUGE letdown.

So, I have to use\/waste a smart plug to plug the camera in in order to automatically switch it on and off (say at different times or using geofencing - when I leave or return home).

I set this little camera on the floor, pointed at the food dish & the door, & got great pictures of my visitors. I had my phone set up inside so when I got a beep (notification of motion or sound) I could see what was happening. If left to run all night, I could review the footage the next day. I liked the minute-by-minute recording, showing when something triggered it & what time. I added a SD card that records things, otherwise I think all you get is the live view, nothing saved. My main complaint is the online manual. It is too brief, does not explain the details of using the camera, & calling their tech support line wasn't much better for getting answers. Maybe I'm just too much of a novice user (this is my 1st camera use). I also set it up inside to see what my 2 indoor cats did all night. Very interesting. One was quite mesmerized by the camera's whirring motor sounds as it moved, so I got several close-ups of his nose & face, sniffing the new gadget. I am still trying to figure out how to erase the old footage (I was told, new stuff just over-writes it), but since I wanted to save some of the earlier footage, I have ordered a card reader that plugs into the computer, so I can transfer the footage there for easier reviewing, & potential saving.

Within the first 24 hours mine was accessed. How do I know? Because I turned it off once I was home from work, this turns off the recording light and it will no longer track any movement (it moves when It detects something) and even faced it away from me (gotta be safe). I fell asleep by accident and when I woke up I noticed the camera was facing me.

Several weeks the later the same thing happened only about an hour later it fixed itself again. Tech support thought it was due to needing to forget my WiFi and restart it back up on my phone. Now here I am tonight a few weeks after that incident with connection issues that tech support is telling me it's due to my WiFi router being dual frequency. And after it finally connected itself again it would not let me pan around the camera on the app. To this new issue tech support has escalated it to the \"RMA team\" to \"check the warranty.\" I am more than fed up with this camera suddenly not working with my WiFi that has not changed since installation and wasting hours of my time repeating the same troubleshooting guidelines with multiple different techs.

{"reviewTitle":"No desktop app, poor video formatting, chat support doesn't know the product","reviewDescription":"PROS: Great image quality.CONS: There is no software to monitor the cams from your desktop. MAJOR loss there  The android app takes forever to load, find the cam, load the image and finally display the image.  The recordings on the SD card are apparently hard-coded to be saved in one-minute slices. When I am reviewing the previous nights recordings, I don't want to have to open 60 files to review one hour of footage. Seriously?  The SD card slot is hidden under the camera ball. To access it you have to rotate the camera around then raise it up. Seriously awkward placement.I'll be returning it and avoiding this company in the future. I was really hoping they would work out since I wanted to get up to 4 cams, but I am NOT going to try and monitor four cameras on a cell phone screen. Seriously, who at T-Link\/Kasa thought THAT was a good idea. It honestly never occurred to me that a company would promote itself as selling security cameras and NOT have a desktop app. I would have expected better from Fisher-Price, even.Even without the desktop app I was willing to try and use it until I saw that the recordings are 1 minute long and apparently that can't be corrected. I was told that the recording could be up to five minutes, but this same support person told me that I can't record 24\/7 which I had already been doing for days. Don't rely on the support...On a related topic I bought this cam to get away from the camera app MIPC which -- while pretty bad -- does at least exist (so it's better that T-Links version -- that doesn't exist). The MIPC is unstable, partially labelled in Chinese (more of an amusement than a problem), has the user go through many extra steps to view their footage (which it conveniently stores in 1-hour files).Summary: Unless you enjoy scanning through dozens (maybe hundreds) of files to review your security footage, and want to monitor up to four cameras on a tiny screen, while getting support that seems to not know the product any better than the purchaser, avoid this product and probably the entire T-Link\/Kasa product line.

{"reviewTitle":"Features cost money, or don't exist. Useless as security.","reviewDescription":"So, I've used this camera for a while now, and I gotta say, its quite awful. Its slow to track motion, it reacts to motion like after the motion has passed. It only gives a picture of something if you pay $3\/m per camera and even then its not all that great.Otherwise, you have to spend 5 minutes loading the camera in your app because the app is absolutely horrible. Even if you're on the same wifi network as the camera it still takes forever, as if it first has to go through the internet which is unreasonably stupid and I have high speed, at this speed it should be instantaneous access.Worse yet, the app only lets you snap a photo, you aren't allowed to record what it sees. You can't pull recorded history either. You can view it, if you have an SD card in the camera, but you can't pull a video clip from it. For that, you'll have to shut down the camera, pull the card, move it to a computer, find the file names you want and combine them all in some video editor. The camera records things in 60 second chunks and stores them in a folder named for the hour, in a folder named for the day. Which is fine and all, but the Kasa app, does not let you easily  get the video clip yourself. They make you have to pay for such things because you only get a record button if you are a Kasa Care member.As a result of this, and the Kasa app being so terrible, I will never be  getting anything Kasa related again. I already use their smart lights and this app, is just so bad, even they are sluggish with it. This camera proves to me that Kasa don't care about the customers. The camera its self is great, but feature locked and feature lacking which makes it, useless. I wish I could return this but, eh.Side note, the camera has a tendency to burn out your MicroSD cards permanently if you have power flow issues, such as living in a stormy area where the power can go out or flicker multiple times within a short period of time. This camera has already burnt out one SD card of mine permanently.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644019200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Live Stream cuts out every 10 minutes or so...","reviewDescription":"As a camera, it's not bad if you don't plan to live stream with it. For a 2K picture, I expected better. It's a little grainy, but for a baby monitor, it was something I could live with. Its remote control feature is ok. It's just a little loud when the camera is moving and there is a slight delay.WHY I RETURNED IT: I wanted a simple camera with audio, night vision, and a decent picture. I wasn'tplanning to record anything. I really just wanted to be able to live stream so I could watch my baby when I was in another room. How simple, right? Well, the live stream cuts out every 10 minutes or so to ask if you are still watching. When I select that I am still watching, it takes 30+ seconds sometimes for the stream to resume and focus so I can see my baby again. Sometimes, I have to restart the app to reconnect. I contacted TP-link to see how I could disable this feature. They told me, \"well the camera has motion sensors and cry detection, etc. so you don't need to live stream. It will let you know if there is movement, then you can open the app to view what's going on\" (after 30+ seconds). When I asked about the delay they told me it was probably my network. Now I'm a very experienced IT person and my home network is more solid than most small business networks, easily. It's fast and there is not a single dead spot on my property. So, that's s not the issue. In the end, they chalked it up to, \"that's just how the camera was designed\". So, I'm sending it back until they design a better one. I can get a basic webcam that will do a better job for my needs.Another thing I am annoyed with is, the camera can't be shared with another user. My wife set it up under her Kasa account, so I have to log out of my Kasa app and log in with her credentials on my phone to use the darn thing...This camera has potential, but the basic functionality is completely terrible.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644796800000}

The picture quality is great but that should be expected in this day and age when in general, most devices are rendering video in at least 1080.The irritation sets in with the need to force the user to get a subscription to make the camera at all useful.  You cannot use a microSD card to store any video clips that are detected via motion.  Nearly every camera has this - and at the same price point - these days.  It makes no sense that you can only use a microSD card for 24\/7 recording.  It seems they did this to justify the subscription.From the looks of it, other than being able to use the camera like every other normal camera is used (Blink, Wyze, Ring, Nest to name a few) - that is, to record any motions detected by the camera instead of blindly recording everything- their subscription service doesn\u2019t even offer any basic perks.  IE They do not offer AI recognition such as Pets, People, Friendly Faces\/People You Know, Audio Sounds such as baby crying, meowing, barking, window smashing.  Nada.  They don\u2019t offer you to set a schedule of when to record (there is a schedule set to \u201cpatrol\u201d but again, useless because all that does is move the camera back and forth).I am sending this back and getting something else.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent value for a very versatile and feature packed remote camera.","reviewDescription":"These cameras are excellent! The price paid is minimal compared to the total amount of functionality.They do track objects that trigger them, maybe not as smoothly as higher priced options (I don\u2019t know, have not tried others).For the mobility of relocating the  camera by simply picking it up and finding a new location, it\u2019s massively more practical than the full wired systems available.  Until you know where you want those more expensive cameras to be permanently installed, these cameras are a great alternative!  Also, great for keeping a watch on who\u2019s passing by your place at window-level.Wired cameras have to be mounted high enough to be safe from getting ripped down by trespassers, these see through windows during the day very well.  Interior night vision is top notch, seeing outside through windows at night is more difficult.With the sensitivity turned up, every time a tree branch blows it triggers the cameras.  This leads to near constant triggering of alerts during the late Spring, Summer and early Fall.And, lots of recordings every day.  So, you need to use the App to designate areas to watch for motion, or it\u2019ll drive you nuts and frustrate you. To the point that you may start to ignore the notices.The App provides great control, and allows remote on\/off, sensitivity setting changes, you can set to record noise triggers or remove that, set trigger zones, move the camera via the App, and other adjustments.I have noticed that the App actually does offer more functions, and work a little more smoothly, through my phone than my very new tablet. No idea why, it should be the same App for both platforms, no?But, of course watching the playback on the larger screen is so much better, so I do use both.The service plan allows storage of recordings from up to 10 cameras for $10 per month.  Much more cost effective than others I looked into.The cons:Can\u2019t see thru glass with the built-in lights, at night. Reflection off the glass blinds the camera.That should have been obvious to me from the start, since these are designed for indoor use only.  but I had naively hoped for better night vision performance.So, if looking out a window, get a motion-activated light to trigger so you can see what\u2019s going on out there. Just don\u2019t set it up where it will shine in your bedroom and wake you up.App functionality on phone is higher than on tablet, no idea why.  You will want to have the App on at least a phone, if not both.Sometimes, some cameras will trigger, others won\u2019t, for the same event.Deer moving around the house sometimes are ignored by one camera, recorded by another.  Also happened that another outdoor camera from another manufacturer recorded a vehicle trespassing, these cameras didn\u2019t. Had to adjust the sensor sensitivity, but I think the baseline software settings should be set to trigger sooner on vehicles.Branches moving on the breeze cause constant notices, even with Person Detection Mode activated.A more elaborate software system might offer better monitoring, but for the pro systems, this requires fully wired systems with dedicated main recording components\/control systems .  Much more expensive, and I can\u2019t afford to open the walls throughout the property.Overall, these are great! I have bought several models, both the fixed ones and the bigger moving ones.  All look great when set to the highest recording resolution, seem to last a long time, and are a breeze to set up or switch from spot to spot.I very much recommend this camera!

{"reviewTitle":"Camera is ok, Kasa software is a disaster, buyer beware","reviewDescription":"This review is more about the Kasa application than the Pan\/Tilt Camera itself which is a good piece of hardware. Nice clear video, good range of motion. I have over 35 Kasa devices (bulbs\/plugs\/cameras) linked into my router networks. Power went out, everything down except router on UPS backup along with cable modem. But router did a complete reset anyway. When power came back, all my Kasa devices in the application were gone. Nothing remained. Normally when this happens, all Kasa devices come back on full power. I would then shut them off using the Kasa app. But can't as it no longer recognizes any of my devices. But Alexa still sees them all, and works fine. The Kasa app does not backup its data properly. If it gets nuked, you must relink every device from scratch. As said above I've got nearly 3 dozen. Don't understand why Alexa has all the devices but Kasa nuked them all. Router shows they are all on the network, pingable and communicating. So buyer beware. Kasa app is not stable on the phone. Another demerit goes to its portability to other Apple devices like iPad. When iPhone app was working fine, I loaded Kasa app to my iPad Pro. Came up and did not recognize any of the working devices on the phone. WTH! Why would the app not recognize what's already on the phone? Other apps do this fine. So it will take about a full day of relinking every device. No more TPlink\/Kasa stuff for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683504000000}

Amazon did give me my $10 back, but they shouldn't have had to because this was Kasa's fault for false advertising, and it should have been more than $10 because of how much of my time and energy they (Kasa) wasted pretending this was an issue with me just not knowing how to set it up correctly.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718064000000}

It\u2019ll keep running into issues, like 24 hour recording decided to stop working. The LED status light came on once (I did not turn it on, nor did I want it on). The only time that you can successfully format the sd card is after a reset (otherwise, it just spins and winds up showing  less memory than it had before it tried to format). The camera randomly panned back and forth a few times again the other day (I do not have zones set up for it to patrol). Since the last time I reset it, it goes back and forth between detecting phantom motion and not detecting actual motion.

It\u2019s not clear enough to get license plates, not clear enough to get an ID on people trying to break into cars.The software is awful.

Despite that, the company advertises this camera as one that allows local storage but they misleadingly hide the convenience of downloading a video to your phone, by forcing you to pay for a storage plan.Even worse, when you go through the trouble of removing the memory card you're using to store footage locally, when you plug the memory card into your computer, there's zero sound with any of the video files (which are all \"conveniently\" stored in a million folders that are created for every minute of every hour of every day).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703203200000}

Finally, I had a brand new of these cameras still in the box, which I had not have the time to install yet and I tried setting that one up and the same issue.

Please try again.

The range of views is great and ease of changing views is easy. I've been happy with the app too. I bought a 256GB SD card which allows us to go back and look at the camera recordings from the past. Most important thing to emphasize - with the SD card, you can go back and watch recordings without any subscription! You also get notifications without any subscription (with or without an SD card).Only reason I gave this 4 stars- you cannot leave it streaming as a baby monitor. After 10 minutes, the screen times out and asks if you want to keep streaming. With that popup, you won't hear anything. Huge design flaw if you're looking to use it as a baby monitor. We have a sound\/video monitor that we used when he was an infant, so we just use that for the monitor purpose when we're sleeping. Overall very happy with the camera.

For example, the activity screen will show no activity on days when there are recordings under the 24\/7 recording under the home screen.

Conclusion: everyone dislikes everyone else favorite security camera\/system.  So went low-risk and got this camera.  It's interior only; requires a hardwired electric plug.  No monthly fees.  And...it worked with the Starlink router without issue.  I was concerned I was going to have an issue with the communication ports, since Starlink router is locked down and much of the configuration is inaccessible, but apparently the default TCP port, inbound and outbound, were open.  Setup was easy with the iPhone app - which was all I needed to get it setup.  One note: during the setup I didn't realize I had to connect to the cameras \"wi-fi\" network by switching away from the Starlink one (note: initial setup was all done via local access on the wi-fi).  Once I did this, the Starlink and camera did a wi-fi handshake and I was all set.  I can rotate it 360 and tilt it up and down; has a microphone and can capture sound; takes a 64GB mini-micro card for local storage; can set sensitivities, zones, delays, etc.  Very kewl.  Sends alerts to my phone for motion or sound.  But, without premium service, it seems to be just an alert (although I can screen capture if needed if I'm looking at the live feed).

{"reviewTitle":"Good for the price but not ideal","reviewDescription":"We have four of these cameras that we use indoors for security and to watch our pets when we\u2019re not at home. For the very affordable price I paid, i\u2019m happy enough with these cameras, but there are some key features that I would gladly pay more for. First of all they don\u2019t connect fully to Alexa. I can only turn them on and off from the Kasa app, and I would rather be able to control them by voice using Alexa. I have gotten around this by plugging them into smart plugs that do respond to Alexa, and then naming the plugs accordingly. This is also how I solve the problem of the cameras, lacking Geo fencing capabilities. I wanted the cameras to turn on automatically when I leave the house, and turn off when I get home, so I programmed Alexa to operate the plugs.As far as tracking and panning go, the cameras work well as long as something passes in front of them that they can then follow. The problem comes in when they end up pointed in a corner, and all the action is happening on the opposite side of the room, where they can\u2019t see it. Even though I have sound detection turned on, they never seem to pick up the hint to look in a different direction.My biggest frustration is when I want to view history in the recordings. I have SD cards in every camera so they can record 24\/7. The problem is that the camera history cannot be scrubbed to see a specific moment in time. It jumps by five minute intervals. Meaning if something occurred at 3:29, I have to go back to 3:25 and wait four minutes for the video to play through before I can get to the event. If I want to watch it again, I have to go back to 3:25 and wait four more minutes. This is incredibly frustrating. With my more expensive cameras from another brand, I can scrub the video easily to get to the exact minute and second that I want to see. The frustration is enough that I might be replacing these cameras soon with a different brand that gives me that basic functionality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"111 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709769600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Here's a crucial tip if you're trying to use a Mac with this cam and a micro SD card...","reviewDescription":"I almost sent this Kasa Spot cam back until I learned this tip; thought I would share the tip here in hopes that it helps save others the hassle I went through. I purchased this cam specifically because I wanted to use it to record onto a 256 GB microSD card rather than paying for an iCloud monthly subscription. Set up of the camera with the Kasa app was fairly intuitive and painless. The camera functions as stated and I am happy with the picture quality. When I first inserted the micro SD card in the camera it wanted to format card to ExFAT format (no big deal I assumed). I didn't think anything of it until I tried to plug the micro SD card into my MacBook Pro to look at the recordings. At that point, my Apple laptop said that it did not recognize the micro SD card and that I needed to reformat it. Doing so obviously would delete the recording thus rendering the intended purpose of this camera and micro SD card useless. After much trial and error I decided to try formating the card on DIsk Utility on my Mac as MS-DOS FAT32. I then put the micro SD card back in the camera and much to my surprise the camera accepted the card without trying to reformat it. Then I recorded some more video. To my delight when I plugged the SD card back into the MacBook Pro I was able to retrieve the video from the SD card (the laptop did not try to reformat the card). So if you are trying to do what I am here the solution is to FIRST format the micro SD card using Dick Utility on your Mac to [MS-DOS FAT32] and then use the card with your Kasa Spot cam to make recordings. I nearly sent the whole thing back to Amazon because I didn't think it was going to work but this was finally the solution I needed. I hope this helps save you all the headaches I experienced. Overall this is a good little camera for the price and now that I have figured out how to retrieve the video from the micro SD card on my MacBook Pro I look forward to using it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"30 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700611200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Easy to use, works well","reviewDescription":"I don't have a lot of experience with this type of camera, but I've been very happy with it so far. The setup is very simple. We already had Kasa products so adding it to the app was even easier. I like that you can use the SD card and not subscribe to a service if you don't want to. I like the other options available with Kasa so we could add a doorbell or outdoor cameras, etc if we want. The video quality seems good to me.The only drawback I have found to the cameras is the location of the electrical adapter jack. If you want to put the camera flush against a wall, you have to turn it so that the camera is pointed to one side. This initial view then becomes sort of the \"default\" position for the camera. In our case, this means looking at something next to it on a shelf by default. I think either the jack should be moved to take this into account or you should be able to have the ability to reset the \"default\" viewpoint in the app.The \"patrol\" feature, which asks the camera to regular look at certain viewpoints you choose, helps eliminate this problem, but you would need to use patrol all day in order to get a view outside of this default. In our case, we mostly want a night view so we set it to patrol at night, but this might not be ideal for others. Since the warning is that patrol can wear down the motor, this is not the best long term solution. If Kasa could adjust this, it would be super helpful.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695859200000}
{"reviewTitle":"KC410S is quirky","reviewDescription":"This review is for the 2K KC410S.Pros:Great low light night visionNice features with patrol mode and motion trackingGreat 2K clarityGreat value for this level of cameraCons:24\/7 recording unless you subscribe to service. Fills SD card fast in 2K recording.Weird Viewpoint viewing in patrol mode. You can set 4 viewpoints with 1,2,5 and 10 minute viewing. Problem is that it doesn\u2019t consistently maintain those viewpoints. Especially if you have motion tracking on. It forgets the set viewpoints and sometimes goes to views set previously. Erratic.\u201cLive view\u201d doesn\u2019t really work for more than 10 minutes. My guess is that constant recording overwhelms this feature. It will prompt you to continue live view and if you don\u2019t respond it kicks you out of the app. A workaround is to not do live view from the Devices tab but via the Camera tab. This workaround is not ideal as you don\u2019t get a true \u201clive\u201d view. There are significant delays in what you see. Often it doesn\u2019t show any live activity. However it does capture the recording which you can view. I contacted KASA about this and while the tried to resolve it they didn\u2019t. At least they responded.Limited capacity. The highest SD card is 128gb. Since it records 24\/7 it fills up fast, especially at 2K. So you may only have a few days worth of recordings before it overwrites itself. Apparently subscription gives you activity recordings so you only see motion\/activity which allows for better storage\/playback options.I have this camera setup with an old iPad to provide 24\/7 outdoor monitoring. It is not designed for that. It sorta works. Too much activity seems to overwhelm this camera. But hey, for ~$40, it works. Especially the night vision. My security light provides enough lighting that this camera actually sees in color at night! That is a big deal as most cameras go into black and white mode and have grainy pictures. I suspect that if you only wanted to occasionally watch something live or checked in when notified, this camera is ideal. Can\u2019t address the subscription service since I don\u2019t use it.

I have tried another popular brand (starts with B) that can be found at big box stores but I like this one way better. It allows you to save entire days worth of footage even when there is no motion detected. It can also listen for sound. I love that it can pan and tilt, unlike battery-operated ones.Only downside is that, as with other camera brands, the motion detection is too good. I'm constantly fielding false alarms on the cameras due to glares from passing cars reflecting on the ceiling through the window, etc. No matter where I point the camera, it seems to happen. I know the app has privacy zones that will ignore motion but it's almost the entire top half of the view and I'm worried I'd miss something if I disable those zones.  I have it pointed more towards the ceiling instead of the floor because my cat always sets it off even though I have it set to ignore animals. With the sensitivity at 1\/10 this is still an issue. This is the same for audio alarms as well.

All in all, the camera is good for the price. 2k quality definitely not needed, so save those few extra dollars and get the cheaper option. You can see very clearly without the 2k. The night vision on this is amazing as well. This has better video quality than baby monitors, trail cameras, and any security cameras I\u2019ve seen. Oh! One more thing.

{"reviewTitle":"Much better than 1080p version + Excellent Night vision","reviewDescription":"Needed a night camera for my daughter and I wanted to try this 2k Kasa since the 1080p Kasa in my kitchen has worked well for 2 years. Very impressed with the night vision on this and the picture quality is much better than 1080p Kasa. Not sure how it compares with other cameras, but I believe this is awesome product for the price. (Note: you will need to buy a SD memory card to record)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723680000000}
{"reviewTitle":"This is a awesome product","reviewDescription":"Are use it to keep an eye on my home while I\u2019m gone. Able to move camera to different directions and zoom in and zoom out works well in dark rooms or bright lights. I plan on buying some more.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1724803200000}
