{"reviewTitle":"Nice update with one bad engineering choice","reviewDescription":"My previous iPad was air-2 which I had for 8 years and besides severely shortned battery life and slow browser on heavy pages it was still going strong. So with that retrospective I bought rather cheap basic model. Speed, picture, camera and microphone (I do a lot of video chat) is excellent, battery life is acceptable, noticeably better speakers (comparing to old air 2). 4 points because of one bad decision apple engineers made - power button is fingerprint id. Which works about half the time from first press, half the time from second press and so on. Just plain bad design (smaller area of scanner, button collects dirt). Another thing I thing they wrong is not providing wireless charging, but that\u2019s somewhat expected of nowadays apple\u2026","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708992000000}

{"reviewTitle":"My third iPad and a considerable step up","reviewDescription":"If this iPad were about $100 cheaper I would eulogize it. I would say the move to usb-c is very welcome. I would say the speed is great and the storage (256GB) more than adequate for most uses. But as it is, I am annoyed at paying $150 for what amounts to a tiny upgrade in memory. Especially considering I can already get a 2TB NVMe drive for less money. But Apple is Apple.What is ridiculous is the lack of provision for the Gen 1 Apple Pencil. One of the big features of this iPad is support for a pencil. You would think they'd provide a charging port for the pencil (which uses Apples proprietary plug\/socket arrangement). But no. Nothing, nada.I had no problems taping the 3 months of Apple TV Plus, so kudos for that one! Yes, I will probably end up as a subscriber for content differentiators such as Slow Horses and Foundation. So a good marketing move from Apple!I am disappointed the screen still has a very significant bezel. I expect the next generation will reduce or eliminate this gaping blackness around the screen. So in other words make it more like an iPhone. But it's still way better than the last generation iPad Mini!In terms of speed and RAM? Well, definitely a step up, but I would hoped to see the M1 chip by now. I would also like to see far more investment in 3D scanning (photogrammetry) but I guess you'll need to step up to Pro and then fork out money for a usable application.Overall the iPad 10th gen feels a bit dated. Lacking in distinguishing features.  Wifi 6 and pencil support is so-so in terms of excitement. Even the max storage is looking extremely stingy at only 256GB. But overall I consider it a good purchase for those of us who are locked in to Apples seductive interoperability and consistent user experience. I certainly would not choose to go back to an Android tablet!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"54 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692144000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great upgrade overall","reviewDescription":"Just upgraded to this iPad from my old 9.7-inch one and was thrilled that it would still be compatible with my 1st-gen Apple Pencil. Well, turns out you need Apple's special USB-C to lightning adapter that's specifically made for Apple Pencils in order to actually get the Pencil to pair; this detail is technically mentioned if you dig into the iPad product details a little, but it's not explicitly mentioned with the rest of the bold-text \"compatible with Apple Pencil!!\" declarations, so it's easy to miss. The off-brand USB-C\/lightning adapters I bought still work for charging the iPad but not for pairing. So just be aware that if you want to be able to use your 1st-gen Pencil, you'll have to fork over another $10 for Apple's specific adapter. It works.Otherwise, the iPad itself is great. I love the larger screen, and the picture quality is fantastic. The process of transferring everything off my old iPad was easy. The battery life maybe isn't quite as good as I was hoping\/expecting, especially if I'm streaming a lot of videos or working with large art files.

{"reviewTitle":"elegance and sophistication, it is truly beautiful.","reviewDescription":"The 10th generation Apple iPad is a masterpiece of modern technology, a perfect fusion of power, style and versatility. Since I started using it, it has revolutionized the way I work and connect.The first thing that blew me away was its stunning 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display. The images are so sharp and the colors so vibrant that every viewing is an experience in itself. Whether watching movies, editing photos or simply browsing the web, the quality of the screen makes every activity more enjoyable.At the heart of the iPad is the A14 Bionic chip, which delivers exceptional speed and performance. The efficiency of this chip is evident in everything I do, from effortless multitasking to the smooth operation of demanding apps and games. It's an incredibly powerful work tool that handles all my computing needs with ease.The Wi-Fi 6 connectivity is another outstanding feature, providing a fast and reliable internet connection. This is essential for my workflow and entertainment, ensuring I am always connected with the best possible speed.The 12MP cameras, both front and rear, are surprisingly good for a device in its class. Video conferencing is clearer and the photos I take are of great quality, making it a versatile tool for communication and content creation.The Security and convenience are guaranteed with Touch ID. It's fast, reliable and adds a hassle-free layer of protection. And, of course, the battery life is phenomenal. I can go all day using it without worrying about recharging it, which is a huge relief in my busy daily life.Lastly, the blue color design is simply beautiful. It's sleek, modern and stands out among other devices, adding a touch of personal style to my iPad experience.In summary, the 10th generation Apple iPad is an exceptional device that combines power, beauty and versatility. It's more than a tablet; it's a daily companion that enriches every aspect of my digital life.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"86 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705795200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing!","reviewDescription":"I bought the 10.9 inch Apple iPad because the 10.2 inch $249 iPad used the lightning connector. I already have a lot of USB-C stuff so my main reason for picking this device was to limit the number of connectors I had to keep track of.I chose yellow because it was the cheapest option (about $399 at the time I purchased it) but the metallic finish makes it appear more like gold to me. I am neither a color nor a precious metals expert, but if you told me the color of this iPad was supposed to be gold I would believe it (and I love it).Very pleased with the overnight shipping option. I ordered it fairly late last night and it arrived before noon the next morning.Ordered a $17 case that will be arriving tomorrow. This is my first brand-new tablet that I have ever owned (not including stuff like Kindles and other cheapy tablets I've tried that I all promptly returned because either their performance was not a good fit, it did not meet my needs or was riddled with involuntary ads). Previously I went with a used Samsung tablet back in 2015 that lasted for maybe 2 years before it became a brick and stopped turning on. I spent an hour on the phone with Samsung asking where to ship it to get it fixed. Samsung was not willing to repair it at all even though I was willing to pay for the repairs. I will never purchase another Samsung anything after that experience- they don't stand behind their own products.I've only owned this thing for a few minutes but I'm quite satisfied with it.

{"reviewTitle":"Ipad 10 generation issue and Seller solution.","reviewDescription":"Pros:1. Visual pleasing to the eyes.2. Comes in different colors. Pink was my pick.3. Processor runs smoothly.4. Siri runs smoothly and fast.5. Folders allow apps to be organized.6. Apple pen 1 works excellent with the 10 generation.7. FaceTime crisp and clear.8. WiFi and Bluetooth connects quickly,9. Apple gives 3 months free trial on their tv and etc.Major Cons:1. Hardware issue with on and off button on the iPad gen 10. I did research after my IPad would not turn off. Research said it was a known hardware issue in Gen 10. However, Siri will turn off for you if you tell her.2. This company will not exchange the IPad, only accept returns minus the tax paid.My intake from interaction with this seller:The seller only offered a return, no exchange allowed.  Seller only gives back the computer cost and not the tax paid for iPad. Seller raised cost for pink iPad by 20 dollars on Amazon website. To send back and wait for refund  takes up to seven business days. Cost to send back and rebuy would cost would increase due to iPad color price increase, the loss of tax already paid, and the added new tax fee for new iPad. I added up the addition cost. It would be close to 100.00 for the same color and specs. So, the only choice I\u2019m left with is to be stuck with the IPad unless I want to pay out around another 100.00 more after waiting for refund, then buy a new one, and wait for its delivery. That would put wait time about 1.5 weeks for a new computer to be delivered. That is a long wait when it is needed like yesterday.My only other solution:Contact Apple limited warranty to see if they will back up their Apple product and their solution.Lesson learned:Purchase iPad directly from Apple website. Cost is the same. Apple website offers an optional free engraving on their Ipad 10 generation.  The wait to receive Ipad is about a week.I hope my review will help others when deciding what is best for them and their decision on Ipad purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"73 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698537600000}

{"reviewTitle":"It worked GREAT, until it didn't.","reviewDescription":"I purchased this iPad on August 10, 2023. I am studying Radiography and am required to have an iPad with the HanDBase application for clinical tracking. If I don't have an iPad with the HanDBase app when I show up for clinical rotations I will be sent home and receive an absence. This is not good - anyone in school for the medical field will say that these programs are strict. So, I did the responsible thing and purchased a NEW, 10th GEN iPad. And it has been great for almost six months. Today I noticed it didn't charge when I plugged it in. I tried other outlets and other charge cords\/blocks to no avail. I did all the troubleshooting - restart, hard restart, reset the entire device. It IS covered under a basic one-year warranty so I've made an appointment to get it fixed on Monday - but I have no idea how long the repair will take and need it by Thursday at 8 am. I'm so disappointed and frustrated. I've kept it in a case, and never let it get anywhere near moisture; I've always taken good care of it and this is unacceptable - a product like this should last longer than six months. What are my options now? Buy ANOTHER iPad? Ridiculous. Get an unexcused absence because of a faulty charging port?

My last ipad had a defective battery (overheated and went to black screen, even after factory reset) in less than 2 years.

{"reviewTitle":"Cheap quality iPad with two major flaws: very poor audio quality and no anti reflective feature","reviewDescription":"I wanted a new iPad in the medium size and chose this one (10th gen 64GB) for almost 500 dollars including tax from Apple. After using it for three days, this one felt more like a $100 ipad. It is unbelievable that Apple is selling such cheap quality iPads after all the years it has been iterating them. It is surprising that so many of the reviews here failed to mention two major flaws in this iPad . First, the audio quality is the poorest I have seen in a mobile device. It is muffled and tinny and unclear. So, I went to the local Apple Store and a worker there let me test the different models. This model had the same poor quality as my copy at home, however, the iPad Air 5th gen seemed better in quality as it did not sound muffled and tinny. Why was this model of iPad fitted with such cheap speakers??? This is unbelievable and unexpected for a 500 dollar iPad.. This is by far the biggest flaw in this iPad model. The other major flaw is the screen on this model is reflective to the point of being annoying while Air has the anti reflective feature that helps a bit. Both Issues are deal breakers for me, just by themselves let alone together, esp the audio. Needless to say I am returning this iPad 10 model as I am within the two week window.Please evaluate the audio and all the features of this model iPad at a store before you buy it. If you use Bluetooth audio devices the poor speakers will not impact you, but most people frequently use the iPad audio directly.The video quality and weight are alright and I do not mind the lack of Face ID, but the above mentioned deal breakers shut down this model for me. No thank you. I may go with iPad Air 5th gen after testing it more. I will not use this iPad even if Apple gave it to me for free.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698624000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not much of an improvement","reviewDescription":"First, I did not buy my 10th gen iPad through Amazon, but directly through Apple. I did, however, buy a pleather folio case (Ztotop) for this iPad from Amazon and it is excellent.I've had a 7th gen iPad for a number of years and wanted to upgrade to the larger screen and more powerful processor. I use my iPad largely for web browsing and viewing Excel docs created on my PC, saved to OneDrive and viewed on the iPad with a free Microsoft Excel viewing app. Here are my Con's and Pro's.Con'sThe larger screen doesn't seem much larger. It's is brighter and a bit more crisp, but the larger screen doesn't show more or make it any easier to read.The intuitive home button is gone. I know they removed it to save money and create space for the larger screen, but it had real value.Replacing the home button is a series of bizarre swipes and motions that make little sense and are diffcult to master. I suspect this part of the U\/I was designed by a very junior engineer who never used an earlier generation of iPad.The On\/Off button is a total mess. If the iPad is on, pressing the button turns off the screen but does not turn off the device. To turn if off you have to hold down the button with one finger and hold down the volume button for a precise fraction of a second, or else it captures a screen shot. Who thought this was a good solution?And I save the worst for last: Microsoft's free Excel viewer does not run on this iPad. Not at all. Microsoft decided that devices with larger screens can't run the free app, so to view Excel spreadsheets (and other Office docs, I assume) you MUST subscribe to Office 365.

My prob has been internet connectivity, which has been episodic.  Thanks to Apple Care support, which is predicatably very good, I was able to backup my data and apps, restore factory settings, and reload my apps and data.  So far, all's well.  But beware that this new iPad has quality issues that may be more widespread than just my experience.Update after two months:  Reloading software, data and apps did not resolve this connectivity issue.  By trial and error I discovered that my ISP\u2019s 5g network protocol doesn\u2019t work well with this iPad.  Interestingly, I don\u2019t have this prob with my older iPhone and Mac, which work well with 5g.  When I adjusted the network setting back to the slower 4g setting, which Apple Care didn\u2019t suggest, the connectivity issue disappeared.

Screen response is fast, app load quick and the battery stays charged all day without issues even when watching\/streaming video. I went with the blue and it looks really nice.Step up was so easy using my iPhone and it came with the outlet plug and cable to charge it. What I really love is it comes with USB-C instead of the lightning cable. I hated the lightning cable as they always seemed to stop working and on some of our iPads for the kids they don't plug in properly and you have to do some crazy warping of the cable to get it to connect and charge. After about 9 months of using this iPad 10th gen I haven't had any charging or cable issues. So happy about that.The first thing I recommend no matter if you're an adult or it is a gift for a child is getting a screen protector and case put on from day one. It will save you so much anguish if anything happens like a cat knocking it off the coffee table for instance haha.The performance and display are breathtaking when coming from an older generation and the camera is so much better.

Safari does not even display a full Internet address which I need for my writing.  Tabs in Android are a thousand percent better than what Apple offers.

You get the home bar at the bottom just like you would on a MacBook and can access it in any app. I am however very disappointed with the battery life it charges fast but dies just as fast if your looking for something that will last all day with continuous use I would look for something different or plan on bringing a charger with. I thought it would be a lot like an iPhone with its features but it\u2019s not, there is no facial recognition only finger print on the power button. When using the keypad you cannot swipe the words like you can on your iPhone so it takes a little longer to type things. Altogether it will still do everything that you need it to do.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"40 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689379200000}

{"reviewTitle":"iPad 10 256g Is Expensive Even On Sale","reviewDescription":"I upgraded from an iPad 7 w\/32g because I ran out of storage space. Apple is very stingy when it comes to iPad storage. This time I bought the iPad 10 with 256g of storage. It was expensive even on sale. Other than that these are great devices. The iPad 10 has a fast A14 Bionic processor, a bigger screen than previous iPads, more storage, plus Apple got rid of the Home Button which allows for a larger display area. The iPad 10 on sale cost the same as an iPad Air w\/64g of storage. But I needed larger storage of the iPad 10.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700352000000}
{"reviewTitle":"The new iPad","reviewDescription":"The new iPad with 128gb WiFi and no cellular service plan. Blue case. It\u2019s great. But I\u2019m comparing it to a 1st gen Air that the battery finally would not stay charged for more than a few days. There is one thing I do not like, turning the iPad off.The only sure way is going to settings and using  shutdown.Other software changes are confusing at first yet not a big problem. Like it populated the flip screens from right to left, yet starts up on the far left screen??  So all my most used icons are on the very last screen to the right\u2026It\u2019s the same size as my AIR. Camera is in central location rather than on the side. Keyboard interface is such that I can use my previous keyboard and holder\/case if I don\u2019t want to use outward looking camera. Touch ID is nice. And of course backup, iCloud, device interconnection is great with Apple.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695686400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Why did they change it?","reviewDescription":"I have used Apple products for years. That is why I bought this iPad when my old Apple iPad would no longer hold a charge. However, Apple has changed the charging mechanism on this iPad so you have to use a whole new charger. You also have to use a different set of ear phones. I do not know why they changed it because it was so much easier when all of the Apple products used the same type of charger.  Now, instead of charging this iPad on any of my available apple chargers, I have to go to the one that is specifically for this iPad. Apple, if it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"34 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699142400000}
{"reviewTitle":"WAY overpriced for 64GB of storage and using Apple 1st generation pencil","reviewDescription":"iPads are always great.  They are reliable and just work.  Unfortunately Apple always tries to force you into an upgrade by giving you very little memory (64GB) on the basic iPad.  With memory being so inexpensive, it would cost Apple only a few dollars to give you a reasonable 128GB of memory.  There is no doubt that Apple makes the best tablet around.  Right now, it is a confusing hodge podge of iPads.  Always look for at least one hundred dollars off the price of the iPad before purchasing, otherwise you are paying too much.  Right now, the iPad Air 256GB 5th gen is probably the best value if you can find it for 200 dollars off the list price as I was able to do.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700524800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Bad if you use Pencil","reviewDescription":"This iPad is such a bad experience if you want to use the Apple Pencil.This iPad only works with Apple Pencil Gen 1 and requires a special USB-C to Lightning adapter in order to make it work. If you turn off the iPad or Bluetooth for ANY reason, you can't use the Apple Pencil again until you hook it up to the iPad with the adapter and USB-C cord. Every. Single. Time.Literally the $20 knock off pencils work better because they don't require Bluetooth pairing to work. The only thing they can't do is pressure sensitivity.I don't understand WHAT Apple was thinking when it came to deciding that a USB-C based iPad should only work with a Lightning based Pencil. It's such a poor design and poor planning on their part for such an expensive device (which is, ironically, their \"budget\" device). And very unfortunate if you're out for the day and didn't think you'd need to carry both your USB-C cable *and* Pencil adapter just to make the two talk to each other again.If you plan to use the Apple Pencil and not a dupe, maybe look for a different iPad model. An older iPad that still uses Lightning technology will work great with the original Pencil. Far better than this.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1680134400000}
