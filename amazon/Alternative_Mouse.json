{"reviewTitle":"Great looking mouse","reviewDescription":"I have been long time logitech customer for office use mouse. I had logitech mouse marathon for couple years and it was the best mouse i used during those years. Later on i bought Logitech M510 and it was good too. When my logitech 510 started the problem with loose connection especially drag and drop, i decided to get another mouse. After searching over amazon i came across this inphic and tecknet mouse. I bought some of their models. I\u2019ve added their picture for better size comparison. So far i liked inphic mouse among all of them. It looks great and is silent and functional. I\u2019ve used it for 3 weeks after full charge and battery is still at 85% (daily use of 3-4 hours). Here are some of its issues. It has auto sleep feature which is good for battery saving but every time you\u2019ll have to click any button to wake up mouse. It lighter than I expected and doesn\u2019t hold in hand properly. Except left and right click others button are not silent clicks. They make as usual click sound. Not sure why they didn\u2019t apply silent click feature to all buttons. Although it has some minor issues iv still like it mostly because clicks quickly, battery longevity , and of course great transformer looks!!!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1710892800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good price for a gaming mouse, but not sure I would call this a gaming mouse.","reviewDescription":"I bought this mouse because I was tired of paying $60 to get a decent Logitech gaming mouse just for it to break and degrade in a year or two.It is not as accurate or precise as most mice that I own, including a tiny $10 mouse. When moving the mouse very little, at low speeds, the mouse cursor moves in inaccurate distances. I have found it often difficult to accurately move the cursor where I want it without watching the cursor and adjusting my speed\/direction mid-movement.In general it feels a bit floaty.This mouse has click dampening (the clicks are quiet, but not entirely silent). For me, I don't care, I like hearing clicks. But can confirm the clicks are quiet, at least for now (I have used the mouse for 17 days at this point). I haven't had to recharge the mouse yet, and it is currently displaying 2\/3 battery bars.It is ergonomic, just a bit less so than a decent Logitech mouse. And when picking the mouse up, you're likely to accidentally press one of the side buttons, they're very easily pressed.I wouldn't recommend this mouse for gaming specifically, but for anything else it will most likely suit anyone's needs for the price. I mean, it's only $20 :]","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1711929600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good causal mouse, but somewhat finicky connectivity","reviewDescription":"I'm looking for four things in a mouse these days.  I'm looking for something that connects without needing a plug-in, I'm looking for something that's rechargeable without needing insertable batteries, and I'm looking for something that feels good, and I'm looking for something that works like a mouse should work.This mouse is stellar in three out of four respects.  I like how it feels, especially as someone with slightly larger hands, this is a mouse that's a pretty ideal size and it's comfortable to use.  The buttons and motions are responsive, as they should be.  And the battery life is great, this can go weeks without needing a recharge even if you leave it on.The thing that keeps this from being 5 stars are some issues with connectivity.  During regular use, there will be brief periods where the mouse stops responding.  This typically lasts only a couple seconds, after which it returns to functioning as normal.  However, there have been two instances where the Bluetooth connection has stopped functioning for longer periods.  It still works when you use it in the mode that connects with the dongle, but it won't pair with either Bluetooth mode for a while.  I'm not sure what the issue is, but it would be a pretty significant problem if I didn't have the ability to use the other mode - and given that the dongle is USB-A, newer laptops with USB-C without an adaptor may run into this.These problems are not so bad for me that they ruin the product completely.  For causal everyday use, the slightly finicky behavior isn't really a big deal.  But for people who absolutely need something that doesn't cut out on them, they may want to look elsewhere.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708992000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Color's a bit off","reviewDescription":"Mouse works fine (great, actually). Also feels far better in the hand than expected.However, the coloration advertised as yellow, and shown as a shade of yellow that's slightly orange, isn't accurate. It's far closer to orange in coloration.Personally, I like the color, but I had ordered a few other items that were meant to color match with what was advertised, and due to the coloration being different, they don't match AT ALL. Kind of frustrating, since it means I wasted about $15, but not the end of the world. I just think they should advertise more accurately.Otherwise, absolutely recommend it. But if you're planning on getting a consistent color scheme for your setup, wait until the mouse arrives before buying anything else, that way you can color match properly.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712361600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great value and very comfortable","reviewDescription":"First, I'll say this feels so much better in my hand than the previous mice I used. One was very flat and great for travel while the other provided a decent feel but for someone with much smaller hands. This one reminds me of a ball mouse I had long ago with the way my hand fits the mouse itself. Clicks are very quiet, the scroll wheel moves smoothly but with minor notching so you know it's moving (but it's not distracting), and the battery life is amazing.There's only one thing I don't like about it. The G2 button is right next the meaty part of my thumb so it's very easy to accidentally press it. This takes you \"back\" a screen in the browser so I sometimes lose progress on things I'm working on. That said, it is a programmable button so I could just disable it. I haven't gotten to the point where I'm frustrated enough to do that.I have no other issues with the mouse. I recommend it for anyone looking for something affordable, great quality and feel, and especially those who have larger hands.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706832000000}

{"reviewTitle":"A fine mouse (just not for me) with shady return policies","reviewDescription":"This is a fine mouse on paper. The buttons and scroll wheel work well, I haven't had any issues with tracking, and the rechargeable battery is nice (especially for the price). But after a week of using it, there have been enough small annoyances that I decided to return it.First, if you're interested in the quiet clicking that this mouse advertises, just know that it is only the two main buttons that are quiet. The middle click and side buttons are exceptionally loud (louder than any mouse I have ever used before). There's no side scrolling on the scroll wheel and it also has no fast scrolling option, both of which I didn't realize how much I would miss from my previous mouse. The shape is also too flat to be truly ergonomic in my opinion, although the buttons are all placed nicely.The biggest annoyance for me though has been the battery. While the concept of a rechargeable battery sounds nice, the mouse goes too far in efforts to save its battery. It turns itself off after only a few minutes and can only be woken up by pressing a button. You can't just jiggle it like I have done for past mice, and since there is no indication whether it is on or not, I frequently go to move the mouse after reading or typing for a few minutes and don't know whether I have to click the mouse to wake it up. TThese annoyances mounted up enough for me to decide to just return the mouse, but then I found out that the seller listed this product as containing \"flammable liquids or gases\" so it was not eligible for return. This is a total lie since other rechargeable wireless mice do not have this designation, and I had to go through Amazon support to get the mouse refunded. I also asked them to change the designation of the mouse so others don't have this problem in the future.Overall, I could see someone else enjoying this mouse and not being as annoyed with its quirks as I am, so I was originally planning on leaving a relatively positive review, but after the shady return process, I can't recommend it anymore.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1633046400000}

To top it off, yesterday I tried to move around my mouse after turning pc on. It wouldn't move. Plugged it in but still wouldn't. I unplugged the USB receiver and plugged it back in and it finnaly started working. Honestly I thought it would be a good mouse because of all the 5 star reviews but either they weren't gamers and only used this for the internet and work or they lied about the review. Or I guess it could have been an A ok mouse for them but for me, this mouse barely recievs commands not to mention the indicator that should \"show what battery life\" it has left doesn't work at all.

The left\/right buttons would be great if you're trying to be quiet; otherwise they have no travel distance or significant click so you can hardly tell you're pressing them. The on\/off switch sticks out too far too. The scroll wheel is normal but if you don't keep it very clean it will get slippery fast. For under $20 it's a perfectly good mouse but there are $10-15 wireless mice that are dramatically better; you only have to deal with having to use AA or AAA batteries.I keep this mouse around as a backup since it can connect via Bluetooth or USB and it does work but I would never want to use this on a daily basis because it just doesn't feel good to use.

One nit that might affect you depending on the size of your hands is the back button on the side. It was perfect for me, but for bigger hands it might get hit accidentally. - DPI\/movement - check - up to 1600 DPI will make just about any creator\/gamer happy - Connectivity - check (sorta) - with 2.5 MHz and two Bluetooth options, it's pretty solid and connects every time I've tried, on 2.5 and Bluetooth 5 (haven't tried Bluetooth 4 yet) - Battery life - check-a-roo-check - it's got a rechargeable USB-C port, with battery indicator on top, which is pretty much unheard of in this price category. - build quality is solid and much better than I expected. The mouse-clicks are near silent, which freaked out my gamer son who expected to hear an audible \"click\". Ultimately he concluded he liked the mouse, just wasn't used to any mouse being so quiet.I've been using this non-stop for the last couple of days and I like it a lot. I bought it as a temporary mouse to replace a Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed that died on me (and remarkably started working AFTER I bought  and received this one).You can see from the comparison pics how similar the size is. For me, this mouse fits better in my hand than the Basilisk. t's not a direct replacement for a mouse like the Basilisk, but for the money it's pretty close. It lacks in one thing most hardcore gamers really need - a decent polling rate. While most gaming mice nowadays poll near 1000, like the Basilisk, this one never got higher than 140.But seriously, unless you're a competitive gamer, you won't notice this.

I also wondered if i need to buy the fancy features when there are some out there that are brand names and less than $10. It is always good to read reviews first before buying so you will know the pros and cons, to be mentally prepared. 1\/ i learnt that even though the blue color looks great too, it was an old series, this yellow one is the newer version - so good to know, right? 2\/i learnt that the cord to charge it is the USB-C type, which is the type i own bc of my Google Pixel phone. Upon its arrival - it took me 1 hr to fully charge it. The best part like one reviewer said - you will see the lit arrows move forward during the charging process, it actually looked cool when it did that. 3\/i read that it goes to sleep on its own when not in use and once asleep, it doesnt wake the screen at all, which is very good bc i dont like the screen monitors to wake up when i dont need it to. To wake up the mouse just tap the top. Someone said to click the side buttons, yes it wakes up too to that. But point is just click either the top part or the side G1\/g2 and the mouse wakes up.  4\/ it is that soft touch type, so it's quiet. 5\/ On the bottom is the mode - i used a pointy thing like the tip of pen to press that small mode button. the pairing of Bluetooth 5.0 was received automatically by my desk computer, so i didnt even bother to choose the other 2 options as this one worked already for me, no need to complicate stuff, also i didnt need to choose any DPI. As is worked for me already too on the DPI. 6\/ I am adding here that the manual came with all Chinese, and minimal English, so anything you need to know to operate it is rely on the Reviews.

I was in need of a secondary mouse for around the house and for a backup to my (at the time) main mouse in case of battery running out. Since it was going to be a secondary mouse I wasn't super picky about looks or ergonomics, etc. But I did have 4 criteria -1) Must be Bluetooth (no dongles! unless its an extra feature)2) Must be rechargeable (My old main mouse is rechargeable, it's liberating not dealing with AA or AAA, remembering which type is needed and\/or how many - I will never go back lol)3) Standard\/full sized (small mice are fine for small hands which mine are not)4) Finally, low cost.I did a search and this one caught my eye. I had never heard of the brand but it checked off all 4 of those criteria nicely so I went ahead and purchased. If it turned out to be not-so-great for whatever reason then NBD since its intended as a secondary\/back-up.When I received it I was surprised because it \"felt\" like a more premium (aka more expensive) mouse. Had a good weight (not too much or little). It was solid and well built feeling (no loose or misaligned bits). Ergonomics were nice feeling in my hand too. It is indeed a silent clicker as advertised but it still maintains a satisfying click \"feel\" when pressing the L\/R buttons (not mushy). The scroll wheel is wide and smooth-rolling (not just a thin rubber disk with a bumpy roll that is common at this price point).My only negative comments are extremely minor and would not have affected my decision to purchase and don't add up to any whole star deductions (maybe 1\/2 star deduction if all added up). The L\/R main buttons each come to a point in the front of the mouse. This seems to be cosmetic and doesn't serve a purpose but it does sometimes snag (clothing, blankets, etc.) when used off of the desk. The USB dongle (optional if you need it) is simply stuck into a slot on the underside and not covered or secured very well. Of course I immediately lost mine. Only the L\/R buttons are silent, the side buttons definitely are not. For some odd reason the charging cable connection is micro-USB (Cost reasons maybe? It came with a cord so it's not really an issue anyway).Even with those minor criticisms this mouse quickly became my favorite to use due to the points I mentioned above. My main (and far more expensive, yet less premium or well-built feeling in comparison) mouse was demoted to secondary status and I've been using this one ever since (since last August, about 7 months now).Also of note: I think I've only had to recharge it once so far.It's price has increased by $1 (factoring in current 15% coupon offered) which would not change my opinion.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1707350400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Favorite mouse so far.","reviewDescription":"I love this mouse. It's not that picky about the surfaces it tracks on, it tracks great, the DPI variation is perfect, and it's battery life is several days long. I use it for everything. It's also pretty sturdy, not breaking or falling apart when I accidentally drop it. My favorite part of it is the battery indicator lights.My problems with it are that only the left and right click buttons are silent, while the others make noise, which is not what I wanted. Additionally, the back\/forward buttons are placed inconveniently, causing me to occasionally accidentally press them when I was first using it, which was annoying, but I eventually adapted to not pressing them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1709251200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Micro-USB in 2024? Seriously? Drop this product.","reviewDescription":"To start, let me preface this review by saying that I went with the basic model of this mouse (without the battery lights).I wanted just a basic wireless mouse, nothing too fancy. I figured for 17 bucks, I couldn't really go wrong. After looking at the pics and description, I didn't see any type of USB specification. Being an off brand Chinese mouse, I wanted to at least make sure it had USB-C so I didn't have to worry about having a separate cable for 1 thing. I glanced through the reviews, and many of them noted USB -C, so I figured it would fit the bill.When I received it, I was disappointed to see that it was in fact micro USB. Unfortunately I failed to realize the reviews are combined between the 4 different mice listed.The mouse does feel like it's pretty good quality and I probably would've liked it, but I refuse to use anything micro USB in 2024. I would've shelled out a few more dollars for one of the other mice have I had known before purchasing.They really need to clearly state which USB standard they are using when it comes to charging the base model mouse. Nowhere does it say it uses micro usb on the listing. The other 3 mice clearly state that they are USB-C. Why couldn't they just add a little tidbit that this mouse uses Micro?It's a deal breaker and an immediate 1 star from me for deceptive marketing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709078400000}

When the mouse is on a white or light colored surface, it does not work properly. It will not register that you are clicking or moving the mouse. As seen in the pic, if I move it where the sensor is on white, it quits working. I had to order a whole new mousepad to deal with this.The other issue is that it randomly goes to sleep after a couple of minutes of inactivity without warning. I guess it\u2019s a battery saving feature, but still annoying.I will say the battery does last a long time per charge.

I forced myself to give it a solid try because it is a different form-factor than I'd been using.  I couldn't get over how clunky it feels, and how the construction feels like a plastic child's toy.

Again sounds like a child's toy!!Since I only ordered this because those side navigation buttons are second nature for me when browsing the web and wanting to go back a page.  I do a lot of researching, so I search and click a link and constantly go back until I find precisely what I'm seeking.I went to return this mouse and it's misclassified on Amazon as being flammable or gaseous components, so it is INELIGIBLE FOR RETURN.  I contacted an agent who's lead manually issued a refund, but while unspoken, those do get tracked and you only get so many.  The kicker, when getting the refund is when I was reminded of the cost of this mouse.  I was thinking I may have been out only $10 or $11 if the refund was denied.  NO!  My refund was for $19 !!!  This mouse is garbage!  Go for a Tecknet mouse.  I loved that mouse but saw this and thought I'd try something new.  The Tecknet mouse that I just ordered to replace this junk, it shows was last ordered by me in 2017!  I got 4 years use out of it!

{"reviewTitle":"Great mouse for a great price","reviewDescription":"I had bought a few mouses recently, but found myself disappointed in all of them. I have a background in human factors psychology & work on a product team, so I tend to be annoyed with mediocre design. Recently I bought a Logitech M705, which I really enjoy. However, I also had need for a bluetooth mouse & wanted something at least comparable (i.e. nice weight, ergonomics\/usability, grip\/material, battery life, smooth skates etc.) to the m705, all while remaining less expensive (expensive mouses just seem silly to me - the only caveat being vocational use & hardcore gaming (risk for carpel tunnel)). I'm pleased to say that after a week of use, this is my favorite mouse of the 8 I have laying around.Admirable Qualities:The L & R buttons are quite silent & after experiencing this I've begun to question how I ever endured so much loud clicking. The material feels rubberized (I got the black version) & high quality. The bluetooth (5) connects in about a second & is easily found (I read some comment about how the BT button sticks out too far? - absolute nonsense). I love how the ergonomics keep my pinky from dragging around on mouse-pads (most mouse-pads being somewhat gross) & the size is no more\/less than it needs to be to let my fingers sprawl out in a comfortable manner (I have mid-size hands - if you've got Hagrid hands this may not be for you).Could use work:The scroll wheel is a little bit slow on MacOS in comparison to other mouses I've owned (even with scroll settings maxed).The buttons, outside of the left & right, are more noisy than most mouse buttons which is a bad contrast.The skates have already picked up a bunch of dirt\/dust & I use a hard mouse-pad.The weight is very light, although many mouse's \"weight\" comes from batteries, which I personally don't like (makes it feel cheaper).It charges using micro USB which seems a bit dated - wish they would have used AA\/AAA batteries to power this mouse (modern mouses getting a year+ off a single battery just warms my heart).I can't speak on the battery life, however it hasn't needed any additional charging for this past week.It's disappointing that the RGB is only active during charge (although I understand & accept why). I wish the gray would have been the same material as this black (would have matched my M1), however looking at that shiny\/cheap looking plastic space gray makes me realize I made the right choice.Overall:I was a bit apprehensive before buying this & even in the first few minutes I had doubts.

The mouse allows 2.4ghz, 5.0 ghz and 4.0 ghz. This is great because i am able to use this mouse for my macbook, windows laptop, and a pc without having to fool around. The simple button at the bottom once paired broadcasts on that frequency and when you connect once you're all set. The silent click is great. The side rest is plastic which would be a little better if it was a rubber material like the mouse click buttons are.Only cons, No batteries. The battery life is really good(not sure how many hours) After 2 days of use i noticed a very small humming noise when moving the mouse(sounds frequency related) But unless your house\/area is dead quiet(no AC running, No tv or anything in the background) you won't hear it.

I'm not using the DPI settings (as far as I know - no software for Linux that I know of) or for gaming, just getting stuff done. It will put itself to sleep after a while and wakes quickly with a single click.A few minor issues that aren't stopping me from buying another one for my work system:* weight: the mouse is light. I'd prefer a little more weight to the device.* documentation. The factory instructions are minimal. There's no QR code to take you to more detailed information. This is a basic ODM product that works well, with no investment in creating a great customer out of box experience. That said, the packaging is minimal and easily recyclable.* USB option: I'd love to be able to use this as a USB attached mouse as well, not just USB charged.I imagine the extra weight plus the USB option would probably cost the factory another $1 or less... Which would mean around a $3-$5 more for the customer. If I can find this mouse with more weight and USB usability option for $25 or less that'd be pretty much perfect for my use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696291200000}

Connecting it to my PC was simple enough... Turn it on, select BT5 as my preferred connection, and then search\/add the new device from my PC.  Within a minute, it was connected and working without any issue.Feel. The mouse feels lighter that other mice I've used in the past. This is partial because the mouse is rechargeable and does not require any additional AA batteries to operate. But the plastic body also feels like it's less solid than other devices. This could give someone the impression the mouse \"feels cheap\", but it feels sturdy enough for me.  That said, I do find it a bit too light for my personal preference.Features. Mouse has separate forward and back buttons located on the left side. These are appropriately placed so as to avoid accidental pressing, while still easily accessed.  The left and right mouse buttons are also \"silent\", which is a welcomed feature. The wheel button scrolls smoothly.  You can also change the DPI settings with a DPI button on top. It will cause the wheel LED light to blink to 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the selected setting.Battery.  Haven't used it long enough to get a feel for how often it needs to be recharged, but I do appreciate it being rechargeable and not needing to to have a supply of batteries available.Overall... my impressions of the mouse are very favorable, and for the price it's feels like a pretty decent value.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688256000000}

I DO like that I can continue to use the mouse will it's charging, like a wired mouse, and then unplug when it's fully charged.Update: Battery life seems good after 1 week.  Still shows 2 out of 3 bars for remaining power.  One thing I don't like (or haven't figured out) is it seems you are unable to re-assign the two side buttons.  They don't show up as available in Windows Control Panel\/Mouse.  Still, I'm really liking this mouse so far.I previously had 2 Logitech M720 Triathlon mice.  The first one gave out after a couple years, but I liked it, so I got another one.  That one has also failed after a couple years.  Figured for about $15, this mouse might be OK and if not, no great loss.So far I like it a lot.  I really like the left and right mouse button feel.  They have a nice solid QUIET click.  We'll see how long this one lasts compared with the Logitech.  The fact that it's rechargeable will either be a blessing or a curse depending on how long it holds a charge.

I use this for work 8+ hours per day and I must say I'm impressed.I started off with the USB dongle since that's what my old mouse used, and then I decided to try the Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. I've never used that before on a mouse, but I'm really impressed. It's just as responsive as the USB, automatically connects when I start up and it saves me a USB slot on my laptop.The mouse is mostly silent, but you can hear a pleasant membrane pop\/click sound when you do use a button. Having a perfectly silent mouse wasn't a requirement for me, so this was fine and I do like the sound it makes.Using on a windows 10 laptop for reference.No cons so far, the battery life has been phenomenal. Not sure how well windows Bluetooth settings report battery life, but if you can, it's only lost 10% in a week.

{"reviewTitle":"One of the best I've used, especially if you need a quiet-click mouse","reviewDescription":"NOTE: This review is specific to the PM6 Pro Inphic mouse with the 3-arrow battery indicator. (Item #B09K41MDJG) I have bought other mice from this vendor that looked similar but behaved VERY differently. I would say consistency in this manufacturer is hit-and-miss.Over the years I am sure I have used over 100 different computer mice. I've used everything from the basic e-waste Dell mouse to the $100 Logitech MX and this is one of my favorite mice I have ever used. I primarily bought this because I was looking for a silent mouse. I use my computer in my bedroom and loud clicking really annoys my partner. It was surprising to me how few mice there are on the market that even mention silent operation. If you're looking for a silent mouse this is the best one I have found. In addition, it's rechargeable, uses just about every wireless standard, it can be used with multiple devices and if the battery runs out on you unexpectedly just plug in a USBC cable and you can continue to use it while it charges. The weight is just right, the button responsiveness is as good as any mouse I've ever used, and it's very comfortable in the hand. The only caveat I would mention is this is strictly a right-handed mouse. If you're left-handed I don't think this is going to be comfortable for you. Also, I\u2019m not much of a gamer so I can\u2019t really review its usefulness for that purpose.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669939200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Save your timing researching and just buy this mouse!","reviewDescription":"I've bought hundreds of items from Amazon and have only only written a handful of reviews.  I spend hours of research on items I will be using a lot and won't settle for \"good enough\" because one, I hate returning items to amazon (even though they have an awesome return policy) and two, I get pissed when I make a wrong choice on an item after spending hours researching.I have owned many mice in my life ranging from high end ultra expensive, to bargain bin throw away mice and everything in between.  This mouse ranks up there as one of the best values for the money, here are my reasons why:-No RGB unless charging (only minor glow on mouse wheel).  I hate RGB on a mouse, If you NEED RGB than this mouse isn't for you.-I have medium sized male hands and this mouse fits me perfectly, I believe if  you have very large hands, it might feel small but your mileage may vary depending on how you hold your mouse.-For a mouse under $20, it doesn't feel cheap, granted it's not ultra premium feeling but DOES feel good in my hand.  I think this mouse is perfect for daily productivity use and non professional gaming.-I like the silent clicks, I have a very loud \"gaming\" mouse and it's really annoying.  Movement, scroll wheel is really smooth and everything synced, worked properly out of the box (I used included USB dongle).Only Con:  Uses micro USB for charging instead of USB C but I can live with that.In conclusion: There are dozens or more mice on Amazon around this price range but I don't believe for the money, you probably won't find a better mouse that is wireless, nice looking and feels well made.  In the era of overpriced mice with functionality you don't need\/ will never use , I found the perfect mouse for my needs.This review is an initial first impression, I will update if anything changes after prolonged use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"88 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1615161600000}

Never any issues with connecting when I turn the power on.  I have it paired with my work laptop as well.

{"reviewTitle":"Quiet and strong","reviewDescription":"Review:When I first got it, it kept jumping around the screen. I was using it on a plain desk; I searched and found that high Dpi mice can be messed up by rough surfaces.After I got a mousepad, it started working great! Good variation with sensitivity settings, smooth movement, and the left and right button clicks are unnoticeable. However, the roller wheel click is a bit above normal loudness, and the page forward\/back could wake someone.It requires a micro-usb cord to charge; one is included in the box. It\u2019s a very short cord, so it\u2019s difficult to move the mouse while charging. This, combined with not knowing when it will need battery, can impact your ease of gaming significantly.I solved this by getting a long cord to use it with. That pretty much solved the charging issue.One thing that persists, however, is the sleep mode. It takes a a few seconds to wake up from it, despite frustrated waving and clicking.This doesn\u2019t impact gaming, but when typing a report, watching videos, or any activity that infrequently uses the mouse, it becomes annoying. I\u2019d be willing to spend an extra five dollars to not experience it.Overall: A great budget gaming mouse.Info:Inphic PM6BS Bluetooth Mouse  \u2022 You have to press and hold the \u2018mode switches\u2019 button to activate pairing.

I have had this product for almost a month using it about 2-5 hours a day and am just now charging it. (Though I probably could go for another week)The only thing that I'm not a fan of is that the mouse is on the small side and it doesn't glide super smooth, but that's just nick picking at this point. I have spent more on inferior mice so if this one ever breaks or need a spare I will be buying this one again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1691452800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Works as described. Don't let bad reviews discourage you.","reviewDescription":"Great product. I have it connected to 3 devices and easily switch back and forth with the click of a button. I don't know why people say it takes a long time to get out of sleep mode. In my experience using it this last week, it takes a fraction of a second to wake up; really unnoticeable to me. Silent clicking was a bonus for me, really like that feature but wasn't why I bought it. Like all the other reviewers say, it's only silent on the left and right mouse clicks, not the middle or forward\/back button. Middle scroll wheel button is a little tougher than other mouses (mice?) to press. For example, I use a program where I need to click and hold it while dragging the mouse and it was a little annoying, but i got used to it pretty fast. For all the functionality in this one mouse, the price is truly unbeatable. I personally can't stand the mouses (mice..?) that are tiny and I like to think I have an average hand size. It's got a resting place for each finger with my hand. For the reviews that say it's hard to pick up, I say why are you picking it up in the first place, and secondly, just like the scroll wheel button, just squeeze a little harder and get used to it.. it's not a small mouse. Rechargeability is a huge plus, I've only charged it once so far and it was fast. I also use it everyday.Pictures to show size comparison. Video was mainly for sound of buttons, and yes I was clicking them, they're just that quiet. I loved the black one in the picture, this was bought to replace it (its scroll wheel was broken). This cost less and has two bluetooth options whereas the black one only has usb plug (and its clicks were really loud..). By far best mouse I own. I should mention, I use this on 2 PCs (Toshiba with Windows 8.1 and HP with Windows 10) as well as my Galaxy Note 8 and all buttons work as expected. Haven't tried it on my macbook, but I'm pretty sure the description states the forward and backward button might not work on apple products? Don't quote me on that though.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1595980800000}

The reviews were decent so I thought, \u201cwhy not!\u201d  Here\u2019s why: I don\u2019t like the sluggishness and latency when using the bluetooth connection, I had to click buttons twice before it recognized the input, I\u2019d drag the mouse and literally wait 2 or 3 seconds for the cursor to follow. It goes to sleep really quickly and seems to be a hard sleeper.

{"reviewTitle":"A great mouse, so far--10\/1\/22 update, dropped a star","reviewDescription":"10\/1\/22 Update: The click button has stopped working.  It was fun while it lasted. I would say I gave this mouse moderate usage, so I am a bit disappointed it has quit on me already.  I am dropping it down to 4 stars unless the company responds to my email I sent a few days ago and offers a solution.  4 stars because the battery does have solid life and it is easy and quick to recharge and when the clicker button was working it was very quiet.  Dropped a star for the lack of durability.After using this mouse all day for a couple days now, I really like this mouse. For the price, this is the best mouse I have ever had and I have used quite a few mice from all brands. The quiet click is the bomb! Love it. The click button has a super solid feel and the mouse is very responsive.  Scroll wheel works great. My only slight complaint is the buttons on the side (the back button) and they feel soft\/spongy and I wouldn't mind them being a bit tighter. The click is a louder than the top button, but is the same loudness as any other \"normal\" mouse I have used.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again assuming it holds up over time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1632700800000}
{"reviewTitle":"questionable quality, but possibly best in class","reviewDescription":"I believe this is the only rechargeable bluetooth 5.0 mouse with a traditional shape I could find on Amazon. I wouldn't mind trying a newer design, but not one of the common flat designs (i tried one that was sort of flat, and fail to see the advantage), and certainly not with a slippery scroll wheel. One very important note for me is that this wheel material feels like rubber, so it's very grippy and moves effortlessly without any pressure required. The wheel is illuminated blue when charging (which it hasn't really required yet)The mouse is lightweight plastic and doesn't feel premium, true, but I'm fine with that.I haven't had any problems with accidentally clicking the infamous side buttons.Bluetooth 5.0 connected very rapidly...when I first tried. All has been fine with tracking (I'm not a designer or gamer), although on at least one occasion after returning from sleep, there was stuttering when moving cursor across screen. I'll be watching closely to see if this reoccurs.The other concern for me right now is this strange phenomena: I had to remove the mouse and all bluetooth devices from my computer.  When I tried to add it again later, I again used the mouse button that switches between BT 3.0, BT 5.0, and usb until I was on the BT 5.0 setting. However, this time, the computer saw the BT3.0 setting as a BT 5.0 mouse, and vise-versa. It seems to connect and work ok, but...??Another feature I wanted that is uncommon is linux support, and although I haven't tried yet, there is at least a \"mention\" in the supplied images. If it does in fact work in linux (and continues to function), highly recommended for twenty bucks.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1590883200000}

The primary two buttons are very quiet and smooth to click, and the mouse wheel and side buttons are more firm with a pop. I have not tested this mouse with games. One important thing to note is that the sleep mode stays on until a button on the mouse is pressed. It will not wake up by simply moving it, you have to press a button. I spent roughly 30 seconds waiting for it to wake up before I realized I needed to click. However, it only takes roughly a second to wake up from sleep mode. I have not had battery life issues yet. Overall, a very nice mouse that fits well in the hands.UPDATE: While the majority of what I stated above stands true when this mouse works properly, lately I've been experiencing what can only be described as unresponsiveness from my mouse. It moves very jerkily and sometimes requires multiple clicks to register an action. This happens roughly every few days, and I'm not sure what causes it nor how it is fixed, but it definitely ruins any sort of productivity this mouse provides and often leads to just using my touchpad (which then begs the question, why did I get the mouse?).

Unfortunately for me I found it to be very uncomfortable to use.  The problem for me was the left click button is on the same plane as the right click, not higher and at a different angle than a lot of other ergonomic mice on the market.  While I didn't think this would be a deal breaker for me, given the afore mentioned reviews, features, and price, after using it for a day I found myself unwittingly toeing the front of the mouse to the left (I'm right handed), which after some thought I realized was because of the poor ergonomics of the button design.  I'm sure that the reason behind this was the ability to allow both right and left-handed users equal opportunity to use this mouse, but appealing to both meant that I found it very uncomfortable to use in a very short period of time.

{"reviewTitle":"Caveat Emptor","reviewDescription":"Although the mouse is attractive, it slides poorly and has less than optimal tracking and response time while in bluetooth mode.  Additionally, it is uncomfortable to use for someone who has medium-large hands. This featherlight mouse is a good example of a mouse you would expect to get for under $20.Besides the attractive look, the only positive thing I have to report is the low noise (not silent) left and right mouse click buttons. However, the benefit of the low noise of those buttons are offset by the noisy loud click of the two thumb buttons.My remarks come from someone who is a tech enthusiast who has a large collection of mice ranging in level from budget to the best money will buy. I bought this mouse because I was looking for a bluetooth mouse that was full-size, comfortable, good bluetooth connectivity, and a smooth glide. This mouse is none of those.Lastly, I question the validity of the three Amazon video positive reviews for this product because my experience was opposite. What was their incentive to post their video? Did the manufacturer contact them asking them to post a video in exchange for an Amazon credit or free products? Unfortunately, this is a common tactic used by manufacturers. There are many manufacturers who take advantage of this Amazon policy loophole.I do not recommend this mouse even if you are looking for a budget or backup mouse.Caveat emptor.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1611878400000}

I like the shape of it and the Bluetooth function, which means I don't have to take up one of the two USB ports on my laptop.  I also like the way it goes \"to sleep\" and having to click the left button vs just moving it; this allows you to move it without waking up the PC, which helps to save PC battery as well. Yes, it can be hard to get used to because the only other type of wireless mice I've used, wake the computer upon moving the mouse. I like it so much I may give it a try with my desktop PC for drawing with ACAD.I have found it to be responsive and very nice to use. I'd rate it right up there with my MX Master. The battery life seems to be very good as well. I have only charged it once in the 6 months I have owned it. I only use it a few times during the week and on Fridays when I go into my office to train a newbie.If you need a case for this mouse, I found that it fits nicely in the CANTOO Hard Travel Mouse Case for Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed \/Basilisk Ultimate\/ Logitech G602 G604 Wireless Gaming Mouse Portable Carrying case, which I attach to my laptop case.All in all a five start product for very little money! 6 Stars!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694995200000}

The laser seems to randomly go between hyper sensitive and not sensitive at all, as does the scroll wheel.  And, most annoyingly, it doesn't have a good \"sleep\" function like other mice.

So the mouse will still make sound when clicked on curtain buttons. When the whole point of the feature is so the mouse would be quiet so it doesn't disturb others, but the point is that it could still disturb some people from the side, and CPI\/DPI buttons having the normal loud clicking sound. So it's a decent mouse, not the best gaming mouse by any means, but you can use it for gaming even though the quiet feature isn't fully there.

But that's never been the dealbreaker for me.The biggest issue is after three months of very light use (not even using it every day), it is already bugging out a lot of the time. It won't move when I'm moving it or will change the location of the mouse on-screen all over the place, lagging, etc. I've charged it up again to make sure battery wasn't the issue, and it seems to persist.

To put the problem into prospective, this mouse lagged enough that I struggled to center the mouse on the x button to close a window I had open. Annoyed, but not willing to give up, I tried Bluetooth 3.0 next. At first it worked great, but within 5 minutes the next problem became apparent. When I used this mouse in Bluetooth 3.0 it would track and scroll smoothly and reacted as I expected, but periodically the cursor would randomly jump a quarter of the screen to the left or right. Finally, mainly out of curiosity, I tried using the 2.4G dongle. To its credit, 2.4G worked great for this mouse.

It is Bluetooth in that is has a USB dongle that it uses to help connect to your computer.  Seeing how computers these days have a very limited number of actual USB ports, a true Bluetooth connection to the computer would be most ideal.  This mouse is simply ok but works very well for what it costs.  I do believe that you will get plenty use out of it if you can tolerate a few things.First off, I am very happy with how quiet it is.  This is actually my favorite feature.Secondly it is a good size and feels ergonomically correct for my hands.It is simply designed having a right and left finger button along with a very nice scroll wheel between.  A very typical mouse design.  Typical is good.  It also comes with a DPI setting button and two additional buttons that seem to function mostly as forward, back, & exit buttons.  I didn't dig deep enough yet to see if they can be programmed for other uses.  These buttons are very easily pressed which became very irritating for me.  So irritating that I super glued them in place so I couldn't accidently press one or the other when picking it up and moving it around.With these buttons so easily pressed, it brings up another negative for me.  When picking the mouse up there was no avoiding pressing one or the other buttons.  Gluing the buttons in place completely made that annoyance go away making the picking up of the mouse easier because it allowed for leverage to pick up the slack of a slick surface of the mouse structure.  The plastic molding of the mouse is very slippery.  This is different from the top surface of the mouse which has a subtle rubber coating.  It is my opinion that the entire mouse should be coated in this subtle rubber as it would help with a good overall grip.  A good grip is something this mouse does not provide.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709078400000}

{"reviewTitle":"A generic mouse that meets generic expectations","reviewDescription":"This mouse is mediocre but that was about what I expected for a $17 mouse.First, Maximum DPI setting on this mouse does not behave like I would expect a mouse at 1600 DPI to behave. It's on screen movement speed felt about equal to a logitech g series or a razer deathadder at a 600-800 DPI setting. I wouldn't be surprised if either the DPI is overstated or it's achieved by in mouse interpolation of a smaller DPI sensor (or both). In any case if you need a 1600 DPI mouse that acts like others on the market, buy a better mouse. While I knock the weird DPI of this mouse, it still feels higher than a $5-10 wired model.Glide of this mouse is rough, akin to other mice in the under $20 range (if you have ever used a public computer at a hotel\/school\/etc, that is the glide feel to this mouse)Ergonomics of the mice is pretty good. Much better than other mice at this price point. Most people would be happy with it (though it is a bit on the light side).For gaming, my entire use case for this mouse was for casual couch gaming (city\/world building games). For those this is OK. If your going to use this mouse for competitive shooters or for competitive RTS games, spend the extra $20 and get a gaming mouse (you can get a great mouse for $40). The lack of tactile\/sound feedback (left\/right mouse button click is silent with little feedback) from this mouse (and the DPI issues from above) will make these games not a great experience (unless your use to using a $5 wired mice, the this may seem like a high end mouse).Long story short, it's an OK mouse for occasional use if you go into this thinking your getting a wireless version of a $10 mouse with decent ergonomics. If you think your going to get a $100 gaming mouse experience, your in for a bad time.Final note: don't use BT3.0 with this mouse if you can help it.

Just be careful what you map to those side buttons (see below).What I cannot abide however are 2 things which drops this down the rating scale.1. The shape of the mouse and placement of the side buttons are such that I find it nearly impossible to lift the mouse and reposition it without clicking on the side buttons.2. Most egregious however is the sleep mode. If you stop using the mouse for 5 minutes, it goes to sleep to conserve power. That would be fine if it recovered from sleep more quickly.  The delay is at least 2 seconds from the time you CLICK a button to wake it up.  It does NOT even wake up when it is moved.  I wish there were a way to turn off this \"feature\" and pay the penalty on the charge rate.Overall, I would not purchase this, or any similar mouse that \"features\" an automatic \"sleep mode\" which you cannot disable. I do not think the problem is with this manufacturer, nor this mouse in particular - it seems to be pretty standard behavior (having read more about the sleeping mice since it arrived) for rechargeable mice.
