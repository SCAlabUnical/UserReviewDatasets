{"reviewTitle":"TEXAS SIZE POWER BANK!!! Best one I've owned so far.","reviewDescription":"I ordered this one for two reason,1. 30000mAh is plenty for a few big smart phones and tablets. 2. Caught it during a flash sale for a VERY GOOD DEAL!! so duh...had to buy it. 3. We are planning a few camping trips so doesn't hurt to have a nice potent portable Juice pack. It's pretty bulky and has quite the mass to it so if you are planning on carrying it in the pocket make sure you have some deep ones and you wear a good belt!. But should be fine in any back pack pocket. Real estate is about the same as any Plus size smart phone out there and as thick as about 2.5 phones stacked on top of each other.I tested it with my s10+ at about 10% battery left and took about 1hr20min to fully charged and battery indicator light was still with all 5 lights on. As soon as I plug in my other phone it went to 4 lights but fully charged that one also and still had four lights. So...it's fair to say that it could handle at least up to 5 charges on one phone. I've yet to try multiples at the same time. The light is farely bright for what it is, I'd say abou 200-300 lumens...??(he'll do I know, right) enoughy to find loose change under the couch! lol. I also liked the fact that it has a lightning port as a power input to charge the device additional to the usual micro USB. One draw back and is the only thing wrong with mine and the reason for the over all 4 stars....the lightning port on mine is sitting either in too deep or has some play, I have to wiggle the cable in order for it to start charging and if the cable moves it stops. It will not hook up just by simple pluging it in, the Micro USB on the other hand...worked like a charm all the time (shown in pictures). If not it would be a SOLID 5 STARS; but hey..nothing is perfect. Other than that, this thing is awesome. I definitely recommend this JIGA power bank, and even more so if you can buy it for under $30 like I did!!!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1615852800000}

With the full price of only $26.95, and ability to use coupons to get an even better deal, this portable USB C charger is the best deal and value among all power banks.

It is huge.Too heavy for pocket or even purse carry but essential as a carryon companion. I\u2019m a 2-battery guy. A 10k small and light fast charger for daily carry and this monster for long trips when the pocket rocket isn\u2019t enough and weight is not an issue.TSA has never had an issue with this supply. It\u2019s physically smaller than many with less juice. Got it for under $30.Main drawback: bank itself takes a very long time to saturate all that power density. If I have a trip coming up, I set a calendar note to self to plug it in to charge 2 days before leaving. It doesn\u2019t take 2 days but better safe than sorry.Not a whole lot of features, but will charge using any phone cable. So I can leave it charging in a hotel room on my phone charger while I\u2019m out with my phone and pocket power bank.

I haven't owned it for long at all, yet I feel I can say that it will last for quite some time.The flashlight is far brighter than I thought it would be. It isn't the brightest but it is brighter than the cheap flashlights you can grab out of a store. I haven't seen how long the battery pack lasts while the battery is on but I imagine it would last a decent while.The storage of the battery is pretty nice. I can charge my phone multiple times before it dies but I feel it may not be as large of a battery as it claims, but only off a little. The many options for charging ports, (micro-usb, lighting cable, type-c), is great and very convenient for my friends and family as I use a Samsung and they use Apple.One of the only cons is the weight of it.

{"reviewTitle":"Fast charging and many options!","reviewDescription":"I am a real estate agent who spends a lot of time out and about, often in homes that don't have wifi or electricity in some cases. This means I have to use my phone's wifi hotspot which drains my battery pretty quickly. Having a power bank with such a huge capacity is very helpful! I used it non-stop for two days straight and still had 60-80% left so I\u2019ll be able to use it for weeks at a time without worrying about having to recharge it, which only takes a few hours anyway. There are ports to plug in my android tablet, my iPhone, my laptop if I need to, and pretty much any device I have with me. There is a simple set of 5 lights to tell you the battery level in 20% increments, which is precise enough in my opinion. The flashlight feature is excellent too! It is actually a very bright light that I can use, instead of my phone, when inspecting properties during showings with my clients. This does barely fit in my pocket but it is not necessarily \"pocket friendly,\" as it is pretty heavy, a bit longer and wider than my iPhone 11, and about three times as thick. For how much energy it holds though, with all the options for charging, I imagine it couldn't be much smaller.  I would recommend this one to anyone who regularly needs the extra juice and uses electronics a lot.

{"reviewTitle":"Not much use to me, and will be returned.","reviewDescription":"Well, I tried...  I tried to find out what the actual maximum output current was, but failed.  I asked the question here on the Amazon product page but no one answered.  I also read a professional review that said one could charge the battery pack faster by charging it via its multiple inputs.I just tested it though and found rather disappointing current levels.  It is described as having 3x 2.1A USB outputs.  But what does 3x 2.1A equal?  In this case it equals about 2.1A.  2.1A is the maximum TOTAL output across all three USB sockets.  So if you are charging three devices, they will all charge rather slowly, especially as the voltage drops well below 5v as the current rises.  If you wanted to charge three low power devices, like a  couple of older phones and a bluetooth speaker, you might be alright.But worse than that, the maximum input current is very low.  I didn't try via the USB-C port as I did not have a USB-C cable, but via either the Apple Lightning input or the Micro USB input (you can't use both together as the sockets are too close to each other) the absolute maximum current the battery bank will accept is 1.8A.  That is with the supplied short (30cm?) Micro USB cable.  With longer cables I tried the current was below 1.0A.  The charger I used was a very good quality USB charger well capable of producing about 3.5A without the voltage dropping below about 5.1v, so it is definitely the battery bank itself which is limiting the current flow.The other thing is that it doesn't look like pass-through charging is possible.  At least, it didn't work for me.  An iphone charged fine from the battery bank when it was not plugged into the wall charger, but as soon as the wall charger was connected to the battery bank the iphone said something about \"accessory not supported,\" and the charging symbol disappeared from the iphone's screen.So, a bit disappointing, but this power bank is clearly not going to do what I need it to do, so I shall be returning it.  I've given it one star (on top of the one compulsory star) because it does seem to work.  It's just very slow, and I'm not sure why anyone would buy such a large battery bank if they only needed to charge low power devices.  A large bank should also be reasonably powerful, and this one just isn't.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"37 people found this helpful","country":"United Kingdom","date":1610150400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Cheep plasticy battery with high capacity.","reviewDescription":"Main reason I bought it, is the enormous capacity.  In general it feels placticy and cheaply build. It is not water proof or shock resistant. I'm afraid that if I accidentally drop it, it will fall a part. If you are care for your stuff, sturdiness should not be a problem.  Too bad the outputs are only USB-A type, but the high variety of inputs is great. Definitely make this battery super universal.  Yes, it's heavy, but that's understandable for 30 000 mAh and if you like camping in the woods this one should be enough to feed you phone for days.  I don't have it from a long time, so cannot say about the self-discharging.  For me the biggest disappointment is from Amazon. My battery seems to be used or at least sold and probably return. The box was definitely opened before. It is even damaged on both sides. Anyway, I decides to keep it since no severe marks of usage are present.Update after 6 months: I bought this battery in July with an intend to use it during my summer holiday, and I did so. For two weeks I charger my phone couple of times out of it and recharge the battery itself two times. After that I barely used it. It was mainly sitting in my desk with out 75% charge in it. Until December I used it probably two or three times. For your information I have an iPhone with a 2200mAh battery.  Currently in the last 10 days I had to use it and from a full power bank I barely recharged my phone six times, starting from 20% to 100%, and the power bank was empty. If I do the math seems that the power bank has more or less half of the capacity it's rated for.

Also, they used to rate these things in Amp\/hours too but figured out most people think 30,000 mAh is so much more so they all started doing it. This same unit is actually 30,000,000 microamp \/ hours.Overall it seems to be a good unit. It's large and heavy but you have to expect that for the capacity.

{"reviewTitle":"Avid battery enthusiast, very disappointing battery bank.","reviewDescription":"Pretty disappointed with these batteries. I purchased 2 for a upcoming international flight. I was going to use them to charge my oculus quest 2 and phone for a flight that was 24-30 hours, while testing at home the battery won't even stay on while charging my phone, the battery just turns off after charging for less than 2 or 3 minutes.  At first I thought it was a isolated problem with one of the batteries so I tried the second.  NOPE!! Both batteries will not stay on. I really wanted to love this product, I love portable battery banks and the fact that they enable electronics to be used while on the move. These however,  miss's the mark... by a lot.  I can not in good faith recommend this product for any type of use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"52 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620950400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Do not purchase.  The unit will stop working and customer service is horrible.","reviewDescription":"I used this device one time while traveling.  Everything worked fine.  I go to use it again and it won't charge my cell phone.  It also shuts off before charging a tablet and a small speaker.  Customer service is horrible.  They told me that tablets are usually 20v and it won't charge that.  This is false.  Most tablets are 5v.  Mine is a 3.85v and it still can't charge it.  This device can't fast charge let alone slow charge small devices.  Do yourself a favor and find something else.  A faulty unit is one thing but when a seller attempts to give you false information because their product doesn't work and they don't want to be accountable...  That's a HUGE problem.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1632700800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Meta Quest 3 VR headset needs it the most!!!","reviewDescription":"This charger is perfect for charging your quest 3 VR headset, you can use the charging cable that comes with the quest 3, then plug it in, and put your charger in your pocket, and then you can use your quest 3 for up to 12 hours, depending on the power consumption of the VR software, and during the charging and use period, the quest 3's battery will always stay around 90% up and down. It can be said that it is very good, but note that this is a 30000mAh battery, so it is on the heavy side, twice the weight of the average mobile phone.  If you have a Quest3 and are looking for a high-capacity and cost-effective power bank, I highly recommend it, and you can even use the Quest3's own charging head to charge this power bank.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701129600000}
