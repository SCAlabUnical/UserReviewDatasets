{"reviewTitle":"Read carefully what it does and doesn\u2019t do before purchasing","reviewDescription":"I bought this thinking I was getting a good price on a printer. It\u2019s a good price, but that\u2019s because everything has to be done manually. Want to make more than one copy? Press the little print button the number of times equal to how many copies you want, up to 10 copies. So, press the button 10 times for those ten prints. Want to copy something double sided? Check it out: it says double sided is possible manually. That means you have to copy one page then take that copied page out and put it in the paper slot and copy the 2nd page. Heaven forbid you want more than one two sided page! You\u2019re going to be awhile! Want to fit something to page size? Well, too bad. You can\u2019t. Squish it in the best you can, if it\u2019s longer than a normal size page, because you can\u2019t re-size. And, what about that print quality? More like a charcoal gray color rather than a black. I\u2019ve regretted buying this since the first time I tried to use it to make a few copies, which was a few days after I purchased it. Unfortunately, I threw the box out the same night I purchased it and set it up. So, I\u2019ve been trying to make do. But, for me, it\u2019s just not working.My husband finally convinced me to see if I could send it back and get something better. He convinced me tonight. After all, it is Amazon, and Amazon often allows 30 day returns. Another unfortunate: I am now 8 days past my return date.Anyone want a printer, cheap?Update:I\u2019ve had this printer 3 miserable months now. Last night, it malfunctioned. It said it was low on ink so, even though the symbol telling me to replace ink hadn\u2019t come on, I tried replacing the ink to see if that would fix it. Nope. Didn\u2019t even show there was now ink available. I tried going on HP to get customer service online. Hah! Even though HP has been sending me ink for 3 months, my printer isn\u2019t registered. Inputting the printer and trying to do chat resulted in messages that said the function was not available and I should try later. I tried 5 times over a period of 2 hours and got the same message. I tried about everything I could think to get printer working - reinstalling ink cartridge, hitting the \u201cX\u201d to cancel the job I had started, turning the printer on and off, even unplugging and plugging it back in. Nothing.I went out and got a new printer. Then, I went on the HP app and tried the help for the printer ink subscription, which I do show as having, even though they don\u2019t show my registered printer. I asked the chat bot to cancel my HP subscription. I told the chat I was canceling because the printer wasn\u2019t working. When I got an agent, she didn\u2019t know what I wanted. I told her I wanted to cancel subscription. When she asked why, I said the printer wasn\u2019t working and I didn\u2019t want the printer any more. I told her to look at the original chat. Twice, the agent tried to convince me that I needed ink for a printer I told her wasn\u2019t working and I didn\u2019t want. Twice, she tried to tell me what a good deal the ink was. When she did cancel, she told me the cancellation would take effect when this month\u2019s billing was up. I\u2019m still in the 6 free months! (BTW, that conversation took about 10 minutes, so don\u2019t expect anything to be prompt.)I had an HP printer before I got this one. It was a good printer. It lasted 5 or 10 years.

{"reviewTitle":"Printer is good.  HP+ is questionable.","reviewDescription":"The printer is very good.  Not much needs to be said.  HP+ and Instant Ink that the printer comes with is not a bad thing since it gives you a fairly long time to print stuff without paying for toners, although, it also follows that people who don't have that much to print will find themselves not really needing that service much.  (I've found that, for instance, I may have a few occasions during a year that I might need to print quite a bit of photos, then go months without needing to print anything--this is exactly the worst combination of needs for what HP Instant Ink does.)  While Instant Ink is quite useful, I've found HP+ to be not particularly useful an app and it's not a good thing that you can only use HP's own cartridges once you have activated it (although some reviews of generic cartridges claim otherwise--I'm not entirely sure how this works.)  On the other hand, HP cartridges (for now) are not dreadfully more expensive and if you are not printing too much, it may not be too bad (although their cartridge reliability has declined quite a bit--I've just had a color cartridge die unexpectedly just when I needed to print a bunch of stuff.  This is exactly what HP Instant Ink is supposed to provide protection for and it just failed at it.  Apparently, I can and did request new ink, but the timing is most awkward--Instant Ink runs out in 3 weeks.  It may take up to 2 weeks to arrive, and it'll be a week and a half after I need to print.  Hmm....)  :\/Edit 2:  I've downgraded the rating to two stars after running into more problems with HP support for Instant Ink.  I think the set up is not too bad if HP cartridges are 100% reliable so that the ONLY problems that could arise are either simple or just running out of ink.  They are not:  you always run into problems when cartridges that still hold lots of ink goes bad for whatever reason.  If you do, then the whole thing becomes more trouble than it's worth.  Normally, you'd just get a store bought ink to substitute in a hurry.  Instant Ink causes problems if you do that, though.  I don't begrudge HP cartridges for not being 100% reliable since stuff happens all the time.  I do begrudge whoever that came up with the way HP Instant Ink is set up for the presumption that HP cartridges are 100% reliable and basically screwing over any customer who runs into cartridges going bad without running out of ink and making the HP+ app tied with the Instant Ink.  (Besides the basic ickiness associated with the whole \"subscription\" model that entraps customers, too).I'd still endorse the printer for the fundamentals.  It works alright, although you'd suffer some functionality loss if you can't use HP+ app (i.e. it may not be as easy using the scanner, etc without the app--probably, there are workarounds,  but finding them would take some effort...)  But Instant Ink is deplorable (it's not too bad as long as everything works, but you will inevitably run into issues, and then it's far more trouble than it's worth.)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694822400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Actual trash. Good for headaches, not much else.","reviewDescription":"HP has been in the printer game for a long time. Long enough to have perfected printers. One would think.This printer has been a headache since day one for a few reasons.Most significantly, it doesn\u2019t work when you need it to. About 80% of the time I go to print something, I get an error. What should have been me walking to the printer that worked last time I used it and picking up my print job turns into a 20+ minute troubleshooting operation. With absolutely no changes to my network, home setup, printer settings, etc., this guy will completely disconnect from and lose the network.When an error occurs, neither the app (mandatory download if you want to print remotely from phone or computer) nor the printer will tell you the reason for the error, so you end up walking through some series of steps and printing troubleshooting pages that make little to no sense to figure out why the printer refuses to print. Again. The whole thing is ridiculous and so far from user friendly. The photo attached is from today\u2019s attempt to print, finally getting a troubleshooting page to print, which told me that the printer was connected to the network and in the next statement said the printer was not connected to the network. Then I tried to connect and got this error - while standing next to the printer. This happens almost every time.Technology has come so far and can do so much. Printing has been around for a while and evolved very little. I just feel like we should have figured it out by now\u2026Additionally, you get a free trial of HP\u2019s instant ink upon purchase. This is great if you\u2019re using your printer regularly. Without thinking about it you get new ink in the mail. However, I moved during this free trial and gained some spare cartridges. After the trial and with inconsistent printing, I cancelled Instant Ink, intending to use the extra cartridges before I bought new ones outright. No can do. As soon as you no longer have Instant Ink any cartridges you got in the program are voided. They will not work.In the paid Instant Ink program, you sign up based on the number of pages you will print per month. It\u2019s very affordable and great if you know how many pages you will print per month\u2026less great if you don\u2019t. Very much less great if you usually print 8\/month but need to print one 20-page document. The pages don\u2019t roll over.I also haven\u2019t figured out exactly how these cartridges work or how full they are and if I\u2019m actually saving money in the long run, since it\u2019s based on pages printed and not ink remaining. Overall it just seems like a very wasteful and unclear program. Even during the trial the cartridges seem to get prematurely low more than once. But for a printer that actually prints about 20% of the time I need it to, it seems like the best option until\/unless I purchase a new printer than will absolutely not be HP.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693094400000}

Granted I do a A LOT of printing since I homeschool and this printer just designed for the amount of printing I do. The amount of ink in the cartridges doesn't last long, it's loud, and likes to only print half of a worksheet every other time. Now, it'd be ideal for someone who prints occasionally.

I have a fault where I cannot connect it back to either of my networks to print. I like most people, do not just have a USB-B cable sitting around the house, if it was in the box I never got one to use, otherwise I would just use it in direct connection mode. Whoever designed the hp smart app really does not know how to make things simple and easy for anyone, you need to have the printer connected to the same wifi connection to remove it from your account, but to do that you need to connect to the wifi, I can't. I am stuck in a loop that someone really could have taken 3 seconds to think about and figure out that maybe, the solution should not be reset your wifi to default for a flippin printer, I have way too many things hooked up to the wifi that would need to be reconfigured over something that is just a poor excuse of programming.This is the first and last HP product my family or friends will ever know of, I have told them to not buy HP because this thing is a flamming pile of garbage. The app alone is enough to make anyone angry with how it is so poorly set up, let alone not being able to add the printer back to the same or even a new network. The guides online tell you to contact HP support, but then looking around you see countless threads of dead HP support tickets with no help in them. I should have read a review or two about this before spending money on it. Not upset with the price, and honestly should expect this type of issue with the price, but wow that's not confidence inspiring that a $90 printer is a flamming pile of junk.

It did it's job for me for 2 months, then decided it needed a union to work. Can't afford that here.Stay away from this printer if you don't know your way around a computer and networking.

It printed fine on all devices but after just a few minutes it went offline and nothing I could do for 4 days would get it back on line except unplugging the printer and plugging it back in.

HP claims there is no problem with this printer, so I ordered another one just like it to make sure. I will add to this review the results of the new printer whether it's good or bad.Then again maybe I'll keep it because it didn't cost that much, and it works for 15 or 20 minutes.

I initially bought the Canon Pixma MG3620. Downloaded their app to get things setup and what a nightmare. I have an eero wifi and the PIXMA printer would not show up on initial scan. I would select scan again after clicking a series of buttons on the printers and then it would popup only to show my wireless network listed 4 times with me being left to determine which one I connected to. I assumed it didn't matter but it did given after selecting 1 and inputting the password, it wouldn't connect. I would click the series of buttons on the printer again to begin the process again only to have all the wifi networks show up (mine + other networks it found) but in a totally different order. This meant I couldn't even weed out each of my 4 networks to find which one was right. Also, the one time I did manage to get it to connect, I had to set my eero wifi in legacy mode for it to connect. As soon as I removed it from legacy mode, the printer began failing again only for me to begin attempting to get it connected again. I looked on many forums but eventually couldn't find a solution as many other people had issues as well.Why do I mention the printer above? Because I then bought THIS hp printer and simply downloaded the app, plugged in the printer, turned it on, and followed the step-by-step instructions (with animations) and it immediately found my network and connected. No duplicate entries, no hassle, it just worked. I was printing within minutes. I then tested printing on my mac, my downstairs PC, and my phone with AirPrint and it all just worked. I spent almost 2 hours on the canon printer troubleshooting and it was just a huge headache.

The printed documents and photos came out nicely with vibrant colors.  Not bad for a bargain printer.  It was very easy to set up my account and HP Smart app. Printer sharing with friends and family was very simple too.  The printer came with free 3 months of ink, which is actually their Instant Ink subscription free trial period.  The box did come with regular starter HP black and tri-color ink cartridges.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that during the 3 months free trial of the Instant Ink, although I chose a plan that gives me up to 50 pages per month, I am able to print up to 700 pages per month for free during the 3-month trial period.  Depending on my usage during the trial period, it will help me decide if the ink subscription plans are right for me or not.  If not, then I will just need to replace the HP Instant Ink compatible cartridges with regular HP ink cartridges before the trial period ends and continue using my printer as normal without the subscription.  The Instant Ink cartridges will stop working when the subscription plan expires after cancellation.  So far, I have enjoyed the printer.  The ability to print from anywhere is a great feature!

Once downloaded you really do not need the app anymore. I can print from any apple device that we have and my macbook without downloading anything. As long as you are on the wifi network you can print.I just needed this to scan\/copy, and print basic stuff. I'm not expecting this to be a high quality photo printer, but the copies seemed pretty good in my testing. I printed some coupons off the internet from my phone and my husband's phone, and a document I needed from my macbook and all were passable.One thing I liked about this one is that I can leave the tray closed and since I have it on a desk it will spit the print right out the bottom. My old one I had to leave that door open. This has a door you can open if you need to but it's nice for us since we are just occasionally printing stuff like coupons to not have to leave that door open. I keep it on a small writing desk in our dining room, and there is plenty of room for other things on the desk.It does not come with any cords to hook up straight to a computer but it does have a port. My old printer had such a cord and even though I never needed it I kept it just in case someday I need to attach a laptop or something.One other thing I like about this one is that it just has a normal cord to plug it in. My old one had one of those big blocks in the middle of the cord. Apparently they figured out a way to put all that junk inside the printer.Anyway for fifty bucks I was up and printing in a few minutes and I'm not signed up for any kind of ink service. I know I will pay through the nose for ink but since we do not print that much I can live with it. They do warn you that there is a chip in the ink cartridges that forces you to buy ink from them but I our last one was like this and it would take some of the generic cartridges I tried. I'm sure the ink that comes with it is a small amount so I'll be buying more ink to have on hand.I'll come back and update if I notice anything pertinent that comes up.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"272 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704153600000}

I took the tape off and connected the printer to the computer with my own USB-B cable.  The scanner and  printer both worked fine.Before long, the scanner would sometimes no longer be found.  I would restart the printer and\/or the computer and most of the time it would reconnect, but then, it eventually would not be found at all.I contacted HP support and was on the phone with them for about an hour and a half while they updated the drivers and installed new scanning software (HP Scan, vs. the pre-packaged HP Smart software that installs with the drivers.  Oddly enough, the HP support rep recommended NOT using the HP Smart software, and to use the HP Scan software when needing to scan.)The scanning software worked fine until today, then even *it* would not find the scanner.This is not the first time I've had an issue with an HP product, but it certainly will be the last.

I do not see this lasting very long for that reason.  Second, the shady manipulation that goes on to GET you to HAVE to sign up for an INK refill subscription is bad.  I tried to bypass this yet another subscription that I do not need, but the setup made it next to impossible to not sign up, as it would not install until I did that, then things started to move along until they did not have WiFi connection is janky and with the cheap materials I have no doubt this has something to do with it.  No help was available, you have to download an app to install it and then jump through a million fiery hoops to get it to print, and it still is not printing on demand the way I need it to and the way my previous HP did.  Huge disappointment.  I waited too long to install it and now cannot return it, please look at other options this is cheap for a reason.

{"reviewTitle":"would not buy again","reviewDescription":"purchased for business purposes as a reasonably priced printer that had a 'reputable' name with the expectation of light to medium use but expected it to last more than 10 months.  Had to call support due to errors setting up. Even when it was set up I regularly had flashing lights, periodically lost wifi signal, hp support site never seemed to have ink levels-always had 'couldn't be detected' (though printer was always powered on) or some such nonesense so ink didn't get sent. (total waste of time signing up for that auto refil nonsense) The one time it was sent (because i called which was Not a pleasant experience and took entirely too long) it never arrived so I had to go out and purchase refils anyway.  I have had it turned off for the last 3 months.  Too often, there is a red flashing light which diganostic page does nothing to tell you what the issue is, usually a reboot magically resolves the issue.  Printer will show error if one of the cartridges is empty\/low\/missing (even if you are trying to print b\/w w\/o the color printer so you are going to either have one or the other cartridge sitting around or, you will throw away cartridges that are not empty.  Cartridges are akward to place and remove and even when properly 'seated' printer may or may not still give errors.  When it was working, the print quality and clarity were of expected quality.  If you print and there is an issue,  you have to find the print queue window to see what the issue is and then try various finesse moves to resolve so you can print.  If I had used anymore than I did, I probably would have thrown it out earlier from frustration.  I have a set of refills that I don't have the receipt for so when I have the time and patience will probably try one more time to get this thing to work a little longer as for the little i used it, it should have lasted at least 2-3 years.  HP is not the quality it once was (had a laptop that lasted about 1\/2 years).

I've had it a year and a halfPros: it prints most times. Nice having a wireless printer. Somewhat lightweight.Cons:- doesn't print consistently. Sometimes ink doesn't show despite levels being fine. Just had a job end halfway on the last page and can't figure out why- hp smart subscription has turned this into a subscription printer which I didn't want. It only works when you're subscribed. It gives an error so you have no choice but to enroll in the program- the tech feels shoddy. I've been having an unexplained error with the mobile app for the last few days and can't use it from my phone. It was also incredibly difficult to learn how to set it up again in a new apartment with new wifi. Literally pressed buttons for weeks, got very frustrated, had to hope the right combo of buttons printed the instructions and then try reading it through inconsistent ink- support is not good. When I had the wifi challenges, I couldn't get help from anyone. When I set it up the first time, I was googling and guessing for the steps to do it. It wasn't the craziest challenge but more challenging than it should have been- papers often get clumped so two tend to be fed in at a timeI wouldn't recommend this to someone but it'll do for the short term because it can somewhat print.

I needed a color printer for work, and they all seem to have the same issues, so I took a chance on this one. I saw that some reviews said you might not be able to set it up over your workplace network, and that was true in my case. So I set it up at home using the app on my phone, and that part was easy. However, it will not connect to my Chromebook no matter what I do. I've read so many different directions and troubleshooting guides and it will not connect, at home or at work. You can print using a USB cord, but not until after you set it up over a network. So I figured that was my fate with this printer, not a big deal to hook it up when I need to print something. But then it wouldn't print what I needed properly, the top edge was cut off of one thing and another was missing half the image. I assume it's an alignment issue, but for some reason I also can't fix that without being connected to a network, which, again, I can't make happen at work. So I guess I have to take it BACK home for a 3rd time to try to do it there.

Here's why:This printer has some mischievous behavior. I changed the ink and it prints out a little report to make sure, I guess, that everything is aligned in the device. Wow, great. So now the $30 cartridges I bought are probably down 5% because HP couldn't manufacture a better device. Cool.But this isn't the only time you'll need to do this. When you first buy the printer, it HAS to print out all the set up information because the device doesn't have a functional screen. Now you're down 3-4 pages of paper and 10% of your ink and you haven't even used it yet.Anyway, we've all seen the teardown videos on YouTube where these cartridges have almost no liquid in them. My advice: Stay away from this sketchy company. I can't believe it's 2023 and a company can't make a decent printer. It's like they think it's okay as long as it can print pages adequately.

If you enter the chat thing, they'll ask for your phone number, call you, then pretend to help you set up and install your printer, and then, when it doesn't work, they'll say it's because you have a virus in your computer that has gotten there through your WiFi.  It will be a long process--in my case, about 45 minutes, and then they will offer to \"save you\" and fix everything for a one-time fee of $199.  That is when the alarm bells sounded and I realized this was not an employee of HP helping me, but a scam, and  I ended the process.

{"reviewTitle":"Works fine\u2026 if you hardwire","reviewDescription":"This review is for the older model (2755e). Let me start out by saying I have had this printer for a few years now. It was simple to setup once I figured out the hp app. I\u2019ve never really had a paper jam or anything too inconvenient happen. It\u2019s small and fits great in my work space and it has been durable so far. I don\u2019t do any heavy duty printing but overall have been satisfied when I\u2019ve needed to print the random document here and there. I\u2019ve had no problems with the instant ink subscription and have liked that I don\u2019t have to go buy cartridges. That being said I have recently needed to print more pages than usual. Nothing crazy, maybe ten sheets at a time, and I have never been more frustrated in my life with a printer. I just spent the last hour trying to print a six page document and I have gotten two pages to print correctly. This printer disconnects from the wifi after each page and I have to restart it to be able to continue printing. When it does print it takes a long time even though they advertise 5 pages within a minute. This is not something new. It\u2019s never been extremely fast, but there\u2019s no way I can get more than one page in a minute if I\u2019m lucky. Two of the pages I\u2019m trying to print can not print the last half inch of the document and just cuts off. I have tried numerous fixes for this including recreating the pdf to print and nothing is working. This is not the first time I have had to print this document and was able to get it to print fully in the past. I\u2019m at my wits end with this printer and am going to be replacing it. I don\u2019t recommend it if you need to print more than one thing at a time.Update: I bought a USB-B to USB-C cord to connect to my iPad\/Mac for printing. Since doing this I\u2019ve had zero problems. The idea of the printer is to be able to wirelessly print, but after getting the cord I no longer feel I need to replace the printer at this time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723593600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nice Printer, Especially for the price","reviewDescription":"I purchased this printer as a replacement for my HP 8028, which was out of ink. I had been trying to use off brand ink fillers but HP must have done an update because it no longer works. Replacing the ink for that printer would have cost me $85 versus $60.00 for this printer which included ink. It looks like the printer itself isn't how HP makes money but rather by forcing you to buy their ink. So, it's cheaper to buy a new printer than it was to fill the ink with new cartridges branded HP. Anyway, it's a pretty nice printer. It is smaller than my 8028 and a nice neutral color. I have done several pages of printing and the print quality is very good. In terms of connecting it via bluetooth, I had various levels of success. With some of my computers connecting was quite simple and fast. With others it took several attempts. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why it was easy on some computers and hard on others. The only thing I would change about this printer is its capacity for holding paper. It doesn't hold very much at one time.  For me this is not a big problem because I don't do much printing anymore, it seems like so much can be done electronically nowadays. But, if you are doing large batches of printing this might not be the right printer for you. You might want something with a larger capacity of holding paper so that you don't have to constantly fill it. Overall, I think this is a great printer for my needs and we'll see how much ink costs when it comes to that time. HP also tries to get you to subscribe on a monthly basis to ink replacement and they promise better pricing for your cartridges but they don't give you any pricing so I am going to wait until I actually need ink and then check pricing for the cartridges. Maybe by then I won't need to buy a new printer I can just buy new cartridges. We will see.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721088000000}
{"reviewTitle":"BELIEVE THE REVIEWS","reviewDescription":"UPDATE: when I was FINALLY able to actually speak to human (after navigating the firewall of automated computer and telephonic systems), support was extremely helpful (shoutout Elmer). Support on their app is basically FaceTime so they can actually see what the issues are and help you solve them\/set the product up\u2014which again was insanely difficult. With that said, it\u2019s been awhile since I used an inkjet printer-they are much slower than laser, the ink will smear until it\u2019s dried, and the picture quality isn\u2019t nearly as sharp-which is fine for me as I\u2019m using it mainly for craft projects but don\u2019t expect to be able to print big batch jobs efficiently. Also, the scanner doesn\u2019t have an automatic feed, so you can only do a page at a time. But I\u2019m now pretty happy with the purchase and you manage you expectations and CALL support to help you set it up, you probably will be too for the price. I was also able (eventually) to set it up on a usb as opposed to WiFi (they push their monthly services pretty hard which need WiFi) but it obviously doesn\u2019t come with a usb printer cord.FIRST OF ALL, I DID NOT SEE ANYWHERE IN THIS POST THAT THE PRODUCT IS WIFI ONLY-you cannot wire it to connect (it doesn\u2019t even come with that wire). So that was the first GIANT disappointment bc I bought it for work where WiFi printers are not allowed bc we work with sensitive information.But beyond that, EVERYTHING in the reviews (that I ignored) is true\u2026setup is ATROCIOUS. I can usually figure stuff out but this was a NIGHTMARE that has so far been unsuccessful. Also, \u201csupport\u201d is a joke.

{"reviewTitle":"Deskjet 2755e","reviewDescription":"First of all this was a replacement for an All-in-one that I've had for about 13 years. I don't print all that often and the printer filled that need. I would have trouble printing wireless then I would sort it out, then after a while it would fail to print. But wasn't so much of a problem that I would just use the USB cable and I could print. But last week it just failed to print. (I suspect that either it just gave out or they sent an update the disabled the printing. Since it's been awhile since I've updated the firmware I suspect the printer finally died.After spending a few hours looking at all the HP printers and reading the reviews I still went ahead and purchased this printer for a couple of reasons. 1. I have an HP computer and it seemlessly connects without to much hassle and 2. the price of the printer. This is because I need a printer but don't use all that much.Hooking up and getting the printer set up was fairly easy. I downloaded the app to the computer and started there then went and downloaded the app to the phone. So started on the computer and then kinda worked both the phone and computer at the same time. But it set up fairly easy and quickly. That said for me was easy as I can mess up an easy task on the computer. Not the best at tech.During the set up was asked If I wanted to sign up for instant ink which I refused, because the plans charge you for printing, yes they charge you per page on paper that you've already paid for. So for 10 pages a month it's $0.99 \/$1.25CAD, and it goes up from there with 50 pages $3.99\/$5.49CAD, 100 pages (they recommend) $5.99\/$7.49CAD, 300 pages $11.99\/$13.99CAD and finally 700 pages $24.99?$28.99CAD. These are all pages per month. WITHOUT ENROLLING IN THE INSTANT INK OR HP+ PROGRAM YOU GET THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY. With the HP+ then it's 2 years. and some other features. One is that you get 24\/7 built in printer security, but I suspect that they monitor your printer, because they need to know how low your ink is so they can send you replacement ink and how many pages your printing. But as I said you can opt out of this while your setting up the printer. That said I declined all the offers, and the setup went smoothlyPrinting speed compared to my old printer is faster, but then again in the tech world 13 years makes a big difference in speed and quality. Noise wise again it's quite compared to the old printer. Quality was good and this fit's my needs as I'm not using for business or printing a lot.The ink that comes with the printer according to some of the reviews is just enough for printing test pages and I believe they do this on purpose, I did buy the black in cartridge with the printer, should have bought the color as well. (My bad) but then I can either buy at Amazon or Walmart. I had 1 page and 1 copy to make and the ink full filled both tasks.This is what HP says about the ink cartridges: \"As a reminder, your printer is intended to work only with cartridges that have a new or reused HP chip or circuitry, and it uses dynamic security measures to block cartridges using a non-HP chip or circuitry. Periodic firmware updates will maintain the effectiveness of these measures and block cartridges that previously worked. A reused HP chip or circuitry enables the use of reused, remanufactured, and refilled cartridges. For more information, go to www.hp.com\/learn\/ds \". Part of the security is that they can update the printer and cartridges that used to work will not work in the future. Will wait and see what happens and update the stars.Finally if and when they decide to disable my cartridges and I get more that a year out of the printer the price I paid will not have hurt, and they will look to another company's printers that do not have the restrictions.Tech support I rated 3 stars, but will update if I need to contact and the outcome. The rest will be on how the performance turns out when I need to print more pages and with replacement cartridges.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"175 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693785600000}

HP will shut off your ability to use the printer if you don't pay for their subscription service. I already had a bad feeling about this printer on the first day. I work in IT from home and had an easy enough time setting the printer up. I installed the ink that came with the printer, printed a couple of test pages, and left it alone. The next day while working, I needed to print a document for work. I go to select print, and nothing happens. Then I get a notification that the printer is out of ink. Well, fine. I assumed the first ink that came with it only had enough for a couple of prints, so I replaced the ink. Page prints. OK. A couple of weeks later, I need to print something else. I go to print, and nothing happens. I check my settings, and the printer is offline. I see all the indicator lights are on, so I assume the printer has gone to sleep, so I press the power button once. Nothing. I start pressing other buttons, trying to wake it. Nothing. Finally, I hold down the power button, and still, nothing happens. The printer does not power cycle. Finally, I unplug the printer, wait about 30 seconds, and plug it back in. Then it finally powers up and allows a print. Fast forward a couple more weeks, and I need to make a print. (As you can tell by now, I do not have the need to print a lot.) So, I try to print, and nothing. I am about to get back into settings and get a notification pop-up that tells me that payment for my subscription plan has failed and that I will not be allowed to print until I change the payment method. OK, I understand why the subscription payment failed, and it was because I was issued a new card after the old one showed up with a fraudulent charge and I had the card replaced and simply forgot to update the information on the HP subscription. So... card was updated, and I was allowed to print. The thing that really started making me angry at that point was that I had used this ink cartridge maybe three times total on three one-page prints. The ink was full. So, here I was, trying to print on a printer I paid for in full, along with HP's stupid printer cartridges, and yet, they had control of the printer and decided when I could and could not use it. Fast forward again. I go to make a print, and the printed document comes out all faded. I print another copy, and it still looks faded and blank in spots. I remove the ink cartridge, shake it, and replace it. Still, another faded print. Finally, I replace the ink cartridge (which should still be full at this point), and then, you guessed it, I got my print. On to the next print. I go to make a print, and it shows the paper is empty. I see there are a few sheets left in the carriage. I stick in about a 1\/4\" stack of paper. The printer shows empty. I tap the paper stack down to make sure it is meeting the rollers. Still empty. I take out half of the paper stack and still nothing. I remove about half of that, and THEN it finally registers the paper. Apparently, the printer only works when it is loaded with about 15 sheets of paper at a time. Literally every single time I have tried to use this horrible thing, I have to spend 15-20 minutes troubleshooting. The latest thing it does now is to go offline every day. It won't reconnect with a power cycle or reboot. You have to go back in and set up the WiFi settings each time. I only need to make a print every now and then, and each time has been like building a printer from scratch. It would be faster to drive to Walgreens, make the prints, and drive back home.

Not to mention that obviously the use of an Ethernet cable only allows connecting to a computer and not a smart phone- HP recommends on their website to use the chat option for support as it is faster. Customer support via chat is terrible in response time and support provided- in the end, 40 min wasted on the chat - problem not resolved - stuck with a printer I cannot return as it is past the return deadline - ordered an Ethernet cable and praying it will at least let my son print from his laptopDetails:I purchased this printer earlier this summer for my son to take to his college dorm room. He moved in yesterday and proceeded to set it up to print from his iPhone and his laptop using wifi. He is on campus in the dorms so the wifi is the one provided by the university to the students. The printer would not let us set it up saying this wifi network was not supported by the printer\/hp app, to try another network or contact HP support. The printer does have an Ethernet port (cable NOT provided) but the setup app only offered the option to set up by wifi, no option to set up using an Ethernet cable. The printer manual  also specifically discourages the use of an Ethernet cable and warns it will not allow access to all the printer features. They even mention that they cover the Ethernet port on the printer with a sticker to deter people from using it. And obviously you cannot connect an Ethernet cable to a smart phone. The printer does NOT come with an Ethernet cable so we could not test it. I contacted HP support via their website chat using the link provided in the error message. I had to wait 20 min before being connected to an agent. But the frustrating part was the delay in response from the agent between each single question\/answer. The agent asked 2 basic questions in 2 posts - first post was to provide info to identify myself and the printer - second post was to confirm my problem statement. I answered each question immediately and had to wait at least 5 min after each answer to get his feedback. I know it was at least that long as each post on the chat is marked with the time it was sent. After 15 min of wait (in addition to the initial 20 min to be connected to an agent), he answered that the university wifi was a public network and therefore would not work. He advised to try using the hotspot from my son\u2019s iPhone. I answered that my son\u2019s phone carrier\/plan does not allow for hotspot so that couldn\u2019t work. I once again waited and waited for an answer and gave up. I cannot return the printer as it is past the return deadline. I ordered an Ethernet cable and hope that will work with the laptop even though the setup does not offer that option and the manual specifically says that connecting via Ethernet is not as good as it does not allow access to all the features. As for printing from the iPhone I guess that is not possible. Could not be more disappointed by the terrible customer support and lack of information in the manual!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724198400000}

Packages are presented with various price ranges to the customer - boiling down to a per ink cartridge and anticipated number allotment of the number of pages being published by the owner, every month.For the first 1-2 months, hadn\u2019t experienced anything alarming. However, had unexpected technical challenges which shortly developed upon updating the Wi-Fi password.\u2013 Out of security purposes, it is recommended in general to update passwords and login information ~ about every 90ish days. -When attempting to re-connecting to the Wi-Fi, customers immediately might experience unanswered questions; \u201cbot-chats\u201d that provide additional links to articles within the website that do not directly answer the question originally situation; and when finally getting in touch with \u201cHP Support\u201d (via phone call) are then confronted with irrelevant questions - unrelated to the product malfunctions - and then are continued to be ridiculed with various recommendations of \u201csecurity systems\u201d packages.

This \u201cprinter\u201d (if you can even call it that - which is a stretch in my opinion) is quite literally the worst product I\u2019ve ever had the unfortunate experience of using.Let\u2019s start off with what works.1. The scanning.Ok moving on, let\u2019s look at what doesn\u2019t work.1. This is completely unusable unless you sign up for an HP account. Not sure why I need an account with HP (who will no doubt lose and or sell all my information). Whatever Product Manager at HP decided that this was a smart business decision, I hope suffers from some terrible inconveniences for eternity so that they can understand a tiny piece of the frustration they have unleashed on the world.2. This thing hardly prints. Sure, day 1 you take it out of the box, install new ink cartiridges, sign up for a useless and silly HP account and print some papers. Amazing! Day 2 this thing stops working. First my color ink no longer works\u2026 ok despite all diagnostics saying my brand new 1 day old ink cartridge is full, I replace it, and amazing it prints again. $20 a page what a great device.One week later I want to print another single page, and wow what do you know my FULL AND HARDLY USED black ink cartridge no longer works. Replaced and wow amazing the printer can finally print another single page.I\u2019ve owned this printer for 2+ years and managed to print maybe 10 pages on this device. 10 pages that required 3-4 ink cartridge replacements.2. The app the HP makes you use to setup\/maintenance this printer is hot flaming garbage. WHY DOES A PRINTER NEED AN APP, SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS. CAN WE NOT JUST BUILD A PRINTER THAT PRINTS?!?3. None of the maintenance tools on this printer work even a little. The app consistently breaks while attempting to clean the printhead or do any type of diagnostic. Although, I\u2019m not at all surprised that HP would build an app to intentionally not work so they can sell you more ink cartridges.Let\u2019s call this for what it is, a barely functioning piece of garbage that is built to 1. Collect your information ( forcing you to sign up for an account and use an app just to interact with it) 2. Sell you more inkI\u2019m not sure if HP hired the Juicero team to build this \u201cprinter\u201d for them, but there is one thing this printer has done for me - I will never purchase another HP product for the rest of my life. Even if I am given a mountain of free printers, paper and ink from HP I will immediately toss it into the dumpster where it belongs.I\u2019d not recommend anyone to ever purchase this product nor anything else from HP until they build an actual printer that works and stop forcing customers to sign up for a ridiculous account that, let\u2019s be honest, not a single person in this universe wants.0\/10 would not buy again nor would use again.

{"reviewTitle":"Poor quality at first, soon became unusable","reviewDescription":"Up until today, I had printed maybe 4 pages on this thing. I don't print a lot. I bought it in December. It lives in its own little dust-free cupboard, and I pull it out when I need to print. Today I have spent about an hour trying to troubleshoot and update it. First it printed a shabby-looking page from my email. I was really unimpressed with the print quality when I first booted it up, but I figured I don't need much. I should have known better than to buy HP again. Etc. But today, it is just churning out smeary mess after smeary mess. I'm using brand new Instant Ink cartridges in a printer that has printed fewer than a dozen pages and is less than a year old.So I tried to just print it again, maybe up the quality. It quit talking to my phone. Then when I tried to print with my phone or computer, it just said the printer was \"busy\". I used the HORRENDOUS admin software to install an update. It logged me out while I was waiting, then the printer turned off and wouldn't turn back on. Is it safe to unplug it? I don't know! It was updating the firmware. SO SLOPPY! I unplugged it and plugged it back in, and found that all of my print clients still said it was busy, so it's clearly something that the printer is communicating. For no reason, 15 minutes later, one of my pages spits out. Still looks like blurry garbage.EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of my experience as an HP customer here has been AWFUL. The printer is of poor quality and produces poor results. The fact that they make you chuck your ink in the trash when you subscribe to instant ink is ridiculous. The software is ATROCIOUS. The printer is non-functional without a screen of some kind. The little LED indicators that are there are not sufficient. You have to open an app or some piece of software that launches a browser or frame with the management software served by the printer loaded in it. Doesn't work if the printer isn't working, or if you have network trouble, or if you're a normal human being and have no idea how to figure any of this out. They could have made a printer that worked well without a screen, but this is not it.I previously worked in IT, I have managed fleets of HP printers. I'm pretty familiar with how their JetDirect-derived environments work. I am flabbergasted that all of this is in this state in 2023. I can't believe how bad the UX is at every step. The only piece of this experience that looks like it gets any attention at all is the HP Smart app (that's a terrible name! Don't invite the comparison to \"smart\" when most people are opening this app because your product is being \"dumb\"! I digress), and obviously that's because this is the portal to recurring revenue.The PRODUCT IN FRONT OF ME needs to also be functional and good or I won't want to use your subscription service.I will NEVER, EVER make the mistake of purchasing a product of ANY KIND from HP again. I am done. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me like a million more times, and what is even wrong with me? But I've had enough. Bad, bad product from an apathetic company with terrible support who doesn't understand the first thing about UX or customer success.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"178 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699142400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Keep Looking","reviewDescription":"Are you wanting a no hassle, easy to use printer? Then keep looking! I have had this thing for two months or so and regret this purchase every time I try to use it.* Doesn't turn on\/come out of sleep mode? CHECK - which means I basically have to unplug the power cord and wait for it to start back up every time I want to use it* Can't edit printing capabilities? YOU BETCHA! - now granted, this is probably my fault. I saw (what I thought was) a decent printer that wasn't going to break the bank and was like 'sure! Let's go for it'. You know why it doesn't break the bank? I can't edit diddlysquat in the printer settings. It took me 11 tries (yes, 11. I kept the page each time to try to figure out why it wasn't working) and AN ENTIRE ink cartridge to figure out how to print the photo collage the way I wanted it. In the end, I had to create a custom paper size (which is why I had to keep testing it to see how it printed) all because I couldn't just manually adjust my margin sizes or or print at 90% of the original size. If you need to print anything besides basic stuff PLEASE pay a little more for a different printer that gives you these adjustable features. They'll save you hours of finagling and a massive headache* STILL don't have my printed photo collage? Unfortunately yes - Now that I finally have my custom paper setting and have replaced the ink, I am working on fighting the printer to feed the glossy photo paper. I honestly don't know if this is the printer's fault or user error, but after everything I've gone through with this today, I just don't have the patience or energy to try to figure it out. I have been working on this project for 4 hours now and still don't have the single page finished product I am trying to print out.*Small footprint? I guess - yes, this printer has a smaller footprint than most, but it's kind of negated by the fact that the paper feed at the back still needs to lean out at an angle. Sure, it's not a huge deal, but I got this smaller printer to sit on top of a storage dresser thing because my desk is teeny tiny and because of this, I'm constantly having to pull it away from the wall and hold it while it prints so that the paper can feed through...that's when I get the paper far enough down the shoot because I seriously can't figure that part out. It seems to change every time I need to print something. Again, my fault or faulty machinery? Who knows, but do you really want to have to fight the printer over something so simple every single time?Overall this isn't a printer that I would buy again and I would strongly encourage anyone looking at this to just spend a little more and go with something else that won't be so problematic. Are all of these things the printer's fault or is some of it due to user error? I don't know. But I do know that I have set up and used multiple (6+) printers in my house in my life and have NEVER had this many issues with one.I would return this and buy a better one (from a different company because HP has been going downhill for a few years now and this was the final straw) but unfortunately for me, I moved right after I got this and it was too late to return after I gave it a fair chance to not be a pain in my tush.

{"reviewTitle":"Edit to my original Review","reviewDescription":"UPDATE:I had to edit my review. I got this a year or two ago I rarely use it but when I need it I want it to work. I wouldn't recommend this printer to anyone. I power it off once I'm done using it and every time I turn it back on the printer is offline and won't work. I'm a technical person and had a work around. I would have to uninstall it and then reinstall it using my computer but now that doesn't even work. It has issues finding the network and staying on it, it doesn't remember the network or any details like it should. Now when I try to reinstall it, it sends a password to my computer, I put it in and it says it's wrong. I don't bother with the HP app that never worked properly.It also started having issues pulling paper down into it to print on, I would have to hand feed the paper into it and I barely ever use it!So, now that I can't reinstall it I have to spend money on a new printer that works.If you're not technically savvy I wouldn't recommend this printer EVER and even if you are I still don't recommend it, hopefully I have saved someone from this headache! BUYER BEWAREI bought this because the price was good and I just needed a basic printer to use every once in a rare while with my windows 10 computer. When it's working it works fine but it was a little tricky to set up and buggy so if I could do it all over I doubt I would purchase this printer again. One day we lost power a few times and after that the printer showed as being offline and nothing would fix it. I'll describe how I set it up and also how I fixed it and made it show back online again.Original Review:To set it up you have to plug it in and power it on, then find the ink cartridge area and place them inside. Once that is done you need to google hp smart app and download that. I will tell you I had a hard time downloading the app for some reason but after much clicking got it to download. Once you get the app open it and click the + to add a new printer, from this point the wizard should take over and find your hp deskjet 2700. Just follow the instructions and that should get the printer up and going.After the power outage the printer showed as offline and wouldn't print anything for me anymore. The only fix that worked for me was to uninstall hp smart and the printer from my computer. Restart the computer and download hp smart all over again then follow the instructions to set up the printer like I did when I first got it. It is working again now but I have a funny feeling I may have to do this again at some point, hope this helps someone.UPDATE: I have changed my stars to just 1. I bought this last December, it is now 6\/21\/2022 and I have had to reinstall this printer 4 times so far. I don't know why it will suddenly show up as \"offline\" and not work, could be due to a power outage happening then when power comes back on it glitches but I don't know for sure. All I do know is that my old printer never did this, I would not recommend this printer for this reason. If you don't mind it suddenly not working and having to reinstall it all over again I would say go for it, if you don't want the hassle keep looking,  it's a headache especially when you really need to use it and you can't.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"86 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644364800000}

That means if your WiFi is down you can't print or make a copy or even scan an item.Printer worked for 2 weeks, then stopped. It just sounded like it was printing but only blank paper would come out. We sign up for the HP+ and order ink, thinking maybe the cartridges that came with it were low of defective, but when they arrive we still can't connect or print.Ran all trouble shooters, would not reconnect to the printer. Tried the original WiFi connection buttons, Says connected then in less then 3 seconds it cant find the printer. Even removed it completely and factory reset it.HOURS were spent by our own tech support doing everything possible to fix the issue with every port, driver, hardware, updates, tried from multiple devices, kept saying printers unavailable or status unknown.Then just says offline, then back to unknown status.HP SMART Troubleshoot says everything is fine but cant print test page because it doesn't know where the printer went. Other diagnostics say it doesn't exist. HP Virtual assistant Suggests everything I already tried. Waited 57 to chat with a person, no one came.Called today was on hold for over 1 hr 45 min(not including time speaking to a person) which I was transferred to 5 different people, Each saying i needed to speak to a different department, The oe woman had us on hold so music was playing but you could also hear everything she was saying because she was not on mute. Then wait and wait, Was hung up on. Got called back 9 min later to say that I needed to be transferred again to somewhere else, which is what each person is telling me, on hold for over 20 min again, to be told i need to talk to a dif dept AGAIN, tranfered again, on hold for 9 min then same person picks up and say ok I am going to transfer you to this department WHICH WAS THE SAME THING HE SAID 9  MIN AGO, on hold again forever someone picks up and says hello then hangs up.Even the HP doctor program cant fix or find it. Manually connect it to USB directly, Wont let me access settings to reconnect to internet. Factory reset, Hardwired Ethernet to printer to laptop and still is saying it cant find the printer.

{"reviewTitle":"Don't waste your money - App required, ads, and basic jobs take forever","reviewDescription":"For an eighty-dollar printer, it does the basic things, but barely.Setup: The instruction manual is useless - it just tells you how to unpackage it and to visit the website for most everything else, which means you'll have no idea what the icons on the printer mean without an internet search. The printer setup was super annoying. First, you are required to download the mobile app to connect to the printer - there is no way around this. I tried to connect via computer WiFi and Bluetooth, but both wouldn't find the printer. The only way to get the printer on your network is to get the app that endlessly prompts you to sign up for HP+ subscription program. After declining and declining, you can finally complete the setup. The program sounds like a scam - you are required to keep the printer on and connected to the internet at all times, you must opt into sending printer user data, you must agree to only ever using HP ink, and you need a credit card on file so that you can be charged monthly after the 6 months trial - a deal-breaker for me.Printing: After the printer is connected and fully set up, you will find that there is no paper tray. You have to manually load a small stack of sheets (10-15 at most) to the back of the printer. You'll also need to manually open the paper tray and pull out the extension otherwise it won't print, and without the extension, paper will fall to the floor. A minor annoyance if you don't print often like me. However, this thing is somewhat loud and slow - but still is on par with other budget printers, so not a deal breaker. But, the print quality is only for documents - do not expect to be able to print pictures or posters with any sort of quality AT ALL.Ink: After printing only 4 documents, I'm starting to see a dip in ink levels, which is crazy and makes me think this printer is just a way to get more ink subscriptions. It is convenient to only need two cartridges (My Canon Pixma took 6), but it comes at a cost.Scanning: To use the scan function, you have to create an account in the HP Smart desktop\/mobile app - there's no getting around this. Luckily, you can create an account just with an email.  I scan a lot of documents, so it was vital to be able to use the scanner and IT IS THE WORST. Both the quality of the scan and the amount of time it takes is just ridiculous. The alignment is also off. It took over 5 minutes to scan one color photo at 1200 dpi, and about 1 minute at 600 dpi, but the quality dropped dramatically at 300 dpi - which would've been good to know before purchasing since this is what I do most. Documents scan around 20-25 seconds for 300 dpi, which is abhorrent, too. I could use my phone's camera, but I need to quickly and easily scan docs to PDF to my computer - so it's kind of a deal-breaker for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"78 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701734400000}
{"reviewTitle":"DO NOT BUY","reviewDescription":"I cannot emphasize this enough but do NOT buy this printer. I bought it because it was a decent price, and had a copy and scan feature and now I know why it was so cheap.So I setup up the printer and it took all of 10 minutes. For the first month I was happy with it. Everything worked fine, I was able to print and scan things with relative ease. Well.. after about a month everything stopped working. I'm unable to scan or print anything using the hp smart app. I get in contact with tech support and I had 3 different calls. The first one told me I had to setup a 2.4ghz access point, even though it was working fine before on my 5ghz access point. So I setup a 2.4ghz access point and I'm still not able to get the printer to connect to my router. The next two tech support agents inform me that I need to switch out my printer cartridges because they are setup cartridges. Sure enough they do say they are setup cartridges on the cartridge themselves however there should be plenty of ink left in them because I've hardly use the printer to justify ingthem out. The ink levels say they are just fine on the interface too. But no, because they are setup cartridges and I haven't enrolled in instant ink they programmed the printer to brick itself. So I can't scan any items or print anything until I get new cartridges, supposedly.. I've yet to replace the cartridges. The website says that you can continue to use the setup cartridges until the ink runs out. That is I guess not true. So now until I enroll in instant ink or go out and buy new cartridges I won't be able to use the printer AND I can't enroll in instant ink because they programmed the printer to essentially brick itself until I switch the cartridges. This is so much more complicated than it needs to be. After this printer I will never give HP my money again. Please, for your own mental health and happiness don't put yourself through this. It's not worth it.

Quality is good.Big complaint: the \u201cInstant Ink\u201d package. Right now I believe it\u2019s a 3 month subscription; when I got my printer it was a 6 month subscription. Sounds great: they send you ink and paper based on how often you use your printer\/how many pages get reported to them electronically for a discount. Sounds good right? However, I just discovered that you can\u2019t use any of those cartridges unless you have an active Instant Ink account. I canceled mine a couple of months ago as I wasn\u2019t using my printer and didn\u2019t want the monthly expense, as it had been over a year since I got my printer and no way I would remember all the details. Then today I had to print urgent tax documents and my printer wouldn\u2019t work. After lots of customer service time, I was told that I could only use my stockpile of Instant Ink cartridges in my home office if I renewed my subscription; otherwise, I would have to purchase individual black and color HP cartridges from other retailers. I think it\u2019s very deceptive and designed to the have the \u201cfree trial subscription\u201d with enough lead time for people to forget that even if they are not printing, they will still charge you a monthly fee to use the cartridges that you\u2019ve already purchased from them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709856000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Does the job.... if it's feeling like it.","reviewDescription":"I try my hardest not to leave negative reviews but wow, we've hit the straw that breaks the camels back point with this thing. I love the printer in theory, and when it's working it does a perfectly serviceable job for a budget-friendly machine. I also enjoy the concept of the HP instant ink that works with it, again very cool in theory. However...Right out of the gate I've had issues with it disconnecting from the internet. I've had several tech savvy friends (and not to toot my own horn but I know my way around plenty of tech) try and help me troubleshoot why it might be doing this but we've all come up empty. I decided to ignore it, it was a budget option after all, and all I had to do to make it reconnect was get up and unplug it, wait a few seconds, plug it back in, and wait a few more seconds before returning to my computer. Annoying, but fine, so long as it did what it was supposed to do. Though I am incredibly confused why there APPEARS to be a \"power button\" but it does nothing. As a matter of fact I can't get any of the buttons on it to do anything, except when the paper has run out and I hit the orange button to let it know I have indeed fed it more paper. Are they... are they just there to make it look better? Buttons that don't seem to serve any purpose? Really not sure on that one.But what really does it for me is that as of writing this I've had the printer just shy of seven months. During such times I've printed hmm maybe 200 pages if we're including test pages. I bought this because I returned to college and it was necessary to have something to print off the long lab reports I had to work through. But I think we would qualify as very very light use. If I wasn't printing a lab report no one else was using it, or my mom might have printed a coupon now and again. Seven months.... and it no longer powers on. I've tried plugging it into various sockets to get it to light up for about a second and then nothing. Could it be the power cord? Probably. But that doesn't change the fact seven months of light use should NOT kill a power cord, let alone a printer. Absolute paperweight quality. Guess I'll just drive to staples and pay to print there.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657497600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Needs to be installed on W10 or earlier","reviewDescription":"A HP website says that this printer in W11 compatible.I tried to get it working when I installed the software on a W11 device using HP Smart.  It could not connect to the internet.I then used the HP Smart app to install the 2755 on a W10 device.  I noticed this time it showed that it was downloading a driver.  It did not do that on W11.  Anyway, it now appears to be working as it should except I can't figure out how to get the \"Information Light\" to go off.  I tap it, it prints some pages but stays on on.  I tap it again and it reprints the same pages and continues to stay on.The print quality on this is not as good as the 2655.  I only replaced the 2655 because it stopped connecting to the internet.  Now, I think that is because I did a clean install of W11 on the device the printer was installed on and the clean install removed the W10 driver that was on the device from before I upgraded it to W11.  It remained there during the upgrade to W11 but was wiped off when I did the clean install of W11..Amazon has agreed to let me return the 2755 so I may try and install the 2655 on my W10 device and see if it works.  If I can get the 2655 working I may return the 2755 because the print quality on the 2655 is better though I rarely print anything.  I used the 2655 mostly for scanning documents.  The build quality on the 2655 also appears to be better.Installing the ink and loading the paper was no problem.  If you have a W10 or earlier device you can install the software driverr for the 2755 on then it is a usable AIO if you don't print much.I am using the HP Instant Ink program which I like.  During the installation process HP Smart tried to push me into the HP+ program.  I declined.I can't recommend the 2755.  It is cheap and outdated.P.S.  After installing the 2755 on the W10 device I was able to get HP Smart to recognize the 2755 on my W11 devices and smartphone with a green saying all was GTG.

{"reviewTitle":"Does what it advertises, no more, no less.","reviewDescription":"My first review was screened, so now I am deducting a star for deceptive practices. As a work from home professional, I need a printer and scanner to do basic work, and I do not generally need to print more than 20 pages per month. Similar to many other commenters, I ran into technical difficulties setting up the printer on my M1 Mac and iPhone 13 Pro Max. I ultimately had to hard wire the printer into my desktop using a third-party USB cable, which was not included in the box. What IS included in the box are the ads for an ink subscription service, and instructions for setup which only direct you to download the HP Smart App.The HP Smart App has multiple flaws, and the troubleshooting feature is circular and insane. The main problem is that, even after troubleshooting the wifi connection issue, you cannot manually download the drivers needed to recognize the printer. This is pretty basic and you should not need the app to do this. My computer is updated to macOS Monterey and could not detect the drivers. Again, I eventually had to hard wire the printer in. To this day, the HP Smart App on my phone still cannot find the printer on my network, thereby defeating the point of having a wireless printer.The most annoying thing, however, is that, even after getting through setup, the scanner does not use the feed tray, forcing you to scan each individual page of a document manually. There is no scan button on the printer, so you have to run back and forth between the printer and your computer to switch out and then scan each page. Again, this defeats the purpose of a wireless printer. The device gets two stars because it is affordable, compact and does print and scan (I have not tried the fax feature yet).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1655337600000}

This is extremely inconvenient when I need to quickly print something. I would not buy this printer again.***This printer does the basics: prints, scans, copies, and even sends mobile faxes (included for the first 2 years after purchase). The copy\/scan quality is pretty good. The unit is also fairly compact and lightweight. My only complaints so far are: 1) You have to scan manually by placing documents on the glass or by using their app with a mobile device. This is pretty annoying if you've got multiple page documents that you want to scan. 2) The setup isn't as user friendly as I'd like. The printer took a while to connect to my wifi, and then took a while to be recognized on the HP app even after it was connected. The steps themselves are easy, but the printer doesn't necessarily work automatically.Overall I give it 4 stars because it's cheap, gets the basics done, and comes with some perks (like the 6 months of free ink and deep discounted products after that period ends), but I'll definitely opt for a printer with better functionality for my needs in the future.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"45 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676764800000}

Price 2.

{"reviewTitle":"Delivers On The Basics","reviewDescription":"I do graphic design and have several home printers for various purposes. The HP DeskJet 2755e is a decent value for a bare bones, all-in-one unit. It doesn't take up much desk space has somewhat attractive styling. There's no paper tray so it feeds from the back. It was rather a pain to set up via Windows 10, though I could have installed the HP app on mobile and done it that way. Still, it took longer than I liked to get everything running smoothly. Once all that was out of the way, however, it has been solid.I would say the 2755e is ideal for someone budget-minded who is looking for the utility of an all-in-one, wants to option to print in color, but doesn't need super high quality, and may only use it occasionally. It does everything I need it to but does not shine in any one area. Print times aren't super speedy and print and scan quality are just okay. The LED readout is a joke. Since this will be only getting occasional use, I didn't go with an HP Instant Ink plan, but that may be a good option if you plan to print in larger quantities.This printer was purchased based on price. I could obviously get something better if I paid more, but it is on par with what I expected, perhaps even a little better. I can't yet speak to durability or the long-term cost of ownership.~ Kort","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"43 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644105600000}

I don't print a lot so I may just cancel entirely an just buy ink myself. The down side of the subscription is that the printer needs to be online at all times to keep track of the ink\/paper levels and what sucks is that you cannot use the ink once the subscription is cancelled\/finished (which kinda makes sense since subscribing is really cheap and they don't want people taking advantage of it) But like I said I don't really print a lot (and I mostly just print in black) which is where my problem lies... for a month the printer's ink on paper has been smearing lately and not printing clearly so i've been getting poor quality prints and its annoying that my prints are now just getting poor when my previous old printer never had this problem...

{"reviewTitle":"May Not Keep It.. Ongoing Hassle - Updated","reviewDescription":"Edit on Apr 16 2023.... Well, I kept it anyway as it prints nicely and the instaInk has been a good deal.  I have had it set up at home and not moved it.  I have printed 200 page documents without difficulty once I learned the way to reinsert the paper for printing on the second side. I suggest printing a two-sided project only about 10 pages at a time.  If you screw it up... less is wasted.On occation it seems to go to sleep and not wake up. Shows up as \"offline\".  What has worked for me, after trying many other rabbit hole solutions, is to unplug it for 5 minutes, then just plug it in again.  No other changes. But that, too, seems to not work for everyone.  And I don't know yet if it will always work for me. I have concluded that one or more of the following are the problem with it going to \"offline\" status:  a brief power interruption, an update on the computer you are using it with, a blip in the router... or just a crappy design by some software engineers.  Search the on-line reviews here using \"offline\" as the search word...  I have also concluded that there is no place in HP,  or on-line, where effective help for this issue can be found.Initial review-----This would likely be great IF you only use it at home on a good wifi network and with just one computer. I bought this for travel while traveling in our motorhome.  Certainly not portable but the best I could find for a reasonable cost. It set up with only minor difficulty at home and once on the home wifi network it worked just fine from multiple laptops. .  It prints beautifully. You have to load its HP Smart app to use the features.  I think I would not use the auto-ink supply option as it complicates things a lot.  On the road.. I rate it a one star for the difficulty I encountered getting it \"re-setup\" to change to the RV Park's network, and getting it set up to \"print direct\" was just as bad.  One can't be both on a remote wifi network and print direct... one or the other it seems. Not too handy for printing things you are researching online.  Instructions are not clear and the Smart App is no help either.  I finally resorted to using an old USB printer cord which I got to work, once I learned the wifi had to be shut off on the input panel.  One would think you could just shift the USB cord and have it work on another laptop (wife's).  No.... that took even longer. And.... if you cannot connect it to a wifi network, the HP Smart app will not let it print as it wants to track your ink supply if you have signed up for the free ink trial period. The cartridges that come with the printer will get you started but may not last as long as some you purchase.  I have had computers since before they had hard drives.  The early desk jets were great. This one is beyond my willingness to fool with.  Of course, it could all be due to operator error, but this operator no longer has the patience to tolerate things that are not somewhat intuitive or at least well explained in documentation one doesn't have to search out online,  including obscure PIN settings and info provided only when the printer itself prints it out.  Still looking for a simple one for travel. This is not it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"90 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663977600000}
{"reviewTitle":"HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color Inkjet-Printer - A Mixed Bag of Pros and Cons for Home Office Setups","reviewDescription":"My journey with the HP DeskJet 2755e Wireless Color Inkjet-Printer has been an enlightening experience, to say the least. As someone who works from home, a reliable printer is an essential part of my day-to-day activities. While I found several noteworthy features in this model, I can\u2019t overlook some significant drawbacks that have affected my overall satisfaction. This review aims to provide a balanced account of my experiences, helping you make a well-informed decision.\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Easy Installation and User-Friendly Interface: An Idyllic StartFirst impressions are everything, and the HP DeskJet 2755e scored well in this regard. The setup was incredibly straightforward, involving a few quick steps guided by an intuitive mobile application. Within minutes, I was ready to print my first page. The printer interface is equally user-friendly, a godsend for those who might not be too tech-savvy.\ud83d\udcf1 Mobile Printing: Modern Convenience but Room for ImprovementThe mobile printing feature caught my eye, given how much I rely on cloud services and smartphone apps. While it\u2019s great to have the option to print from your mobile device, I\u2019ve found the function a bit finicky. I\u2019ve often had to restart the app to get it to recognize the printer, which has been a mild annoyance.\ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f Print Quality: Color Reproduction and Clarity Are On PointWhen it comes to print quality, I have to tip my hat to HP. The color reproduction is vibrant, and text comes out crisp and clear. This feature has been incredibly helpful when printing out color-coded documents or high-resolution photos. However, like any inkjet printer, it does struggle with handling bulk black-and-white text documents at times.\ud83d\udd12 HP+ Subscription: A Double-Edged SwordOne of the things I find controversial about the HP DeskJet 2755e is the HP+ subscription for Instant Ink. On the one hand, it\u2019s convenient not to have to worry about running out of ink. On the other hand, I have reservations about being tied to a subscription model to fully utilize a product I\u2019ve already purchased.\u23f3 Speed and Efficiency: Where It Lags BehindWhile many of the printer\u2019s features are above par, its speed is notably lacking, especially when compared to some other models in the same price range. A high-quality color print can take up to a minute, which is not ideal when you have multiple pages to print. This is particularly cumbersome when I\u2019m in a rush to print important documents.\ud83d\udca1 Wireless Connectivity: A Hit and Miss ScenarioWhile wireless printing is convenient, I found myself wrestling with connectivity issues more often than I would like. The printer has a tendency to lose its Wi-Fi connection, requiring a restart to resolve the problem. Given the competitive market for wireless printers, this is an area where HP could certainly improve.\ud83d\udc6a Family-Friendly Features: All Ages Can Use ItOne of the things that can\u2019t be ignored is its family-friendly appeal. With easy-to-use features, even my kids have had an easy time navigating basic functionalities like scanning and copying. This is a plus for families looking to use it for various purposes.\ud83d\udcb0 Cost-Effectiveness: Could Be BetterIn terms of cost-effectiveness, the printer is a bit of a mixed bag. The initial cost of the machine is reasonable, but the ink cartridges are on the pricier side, especially if you opt-out of the HP+ subscription. It\u2019s crucial to consider the long-term costs involved in maintaining the printer.\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Durability and Build Quality: Middle of the RoadThe build quality is robust but not exceptional. It\u2019s made mostly out of plastic, which is standard for most printers in this range but doesn\u2019t exude a premium feel. However, it has been able to withstand the daily wear and tear typical for a home office setup.\ud83e\udd14 Overall Impressions and Final ThoughtsIn summary, the HP DeskJet 2755e is a printer that does many things well but has distinct areas that need improvement. It offers excellent print quality, family-friendly features, and a convenient setup process. However, its shortcomings in speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability cannot be ignored. Therefore, I\u2019m giving it a 3-star rating.If you are looking for a basic home office printer that can handle a variety of tasks but are willing to overlook some quirks and are open to a subscription-based ink service, then the HP DeskJet 2755e could be an option worth considering. Thank you for taking the time to read this detailed review; I hope it assists you in making a more informed purchase decision.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"854 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687392000000}

Each time that I have to use it now, I find myself saying a quick prayer in the hopes that it will work today.  (This is where I normally would say LOL, but it is not funny.  It is frustrating.)  Several times I considered returning it to Amazon, but because of its low cost and the hassle that I would have to go through, it was not worth returning it.

{"reviewTitle":"Don\u201dt expect to use it out of the box","reviewDescription":"I have an HP Envy 4520, which has been a great printer. In fact, all of my printers have been HP and I have been very happy with them. Recently I put both the color xl and black xl cartridges in my Envy. I have been having trouble with printing and the HP messages say one cartridge has a problem, but not which one. I was ready to purchase 2 new cartridges and found out that the cost to replace them had gone up quite a bit in price. It was less expensive to purchase a new printer with 3 months of free ink than to purchase the replacement cartridges. I purchased the DeskJet 2755e  And received it on Friday, January 5, 2024.The picture above showing what is in the box shows the printer, the power cord, and 2 ink cartridges. There are no cartridges in the box. Since I needed to have a document ready on Monday and another on Tuesday I went out and purchased 2 cartridges only to find out when I got home that in order to start printing you need a setup cartridge which I assume will come with the first free ink. You can not purchase this cartridge on  the market and once you get it and use it you are to keep it in case you need it again.I cannot tell you how the printer prints. That will need to wait until HP sends to setup cartridge. Hope it comes soon.Additional comments:The set up cartridges were in the box after all. They must have popped out of the box when I finally got the printer to come out.Having to pay a ridiculous amount for new cartridges or get a new printer for about half the price brought sadness.  (And there was the loss of 2 nearly full XL ink cartridges from the old printer.)My old printer is more user friendly and on first glance may provides better printing. I like to duplex whenever possible but if it is available on the new one it doesn\u2019t show the option on the control panel. (More paper please.) I had purchased new ink cartridges for the new printer, not realizing that you need to use the setup cartridges before the new printer will print. I received differing information from HP on if I could use the new cartridges and was finally informed that I could not. This printer is set up to try 3 months of free ink through the HP Subscription Ink Program. You can choose later if you don\u2019t want that service.I have had HP printers for over 30 years. They have been very reliable, they can last forever with home use\u2014including 2 kids using them for school and entertainment involving printing, a parent in grad school sharing the printer, a parent constantly printing patterns and recipes, personal business, and grandchildren using them. My most recent old one is about 5 or 6 years old and probably has years of performance in it. Unfortunately, when companies make it difficult to use older equipment, we end up with planned obsolecense. This may be the way of tech companies now, but it is not ecological for our world and it doesn\u2019t allow for passing equipment to those who have none so that they also have information access. I hope we can do better in the future.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704585600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Plug & Play? Well, not exactly","reviewDescription":"My printer, about 5 years old, died, so I needed a new one. A trip to my favorite computer store turned up the fact that they sold only commercial-type printers and the 4-digit price included installation.Well, that seemed like overkill for someone who only prints maybe 15 pages a year, but they are important pages, mainly tax documents. So I fell back on Amazon. I ordered this printer. It was reasonably priced and had one feature I wanted that my old printer didn't have: WIFI communication. It appeared at my door promptly.Two hours of struggle and I was unable to get my computer to recognize it. So, I called HP's customer support. It took some effort to get connected to a human but the agent helped me set it up. The process was far too complicated, taking a third hour for a process I'd been doing in minutes on previous printers, but I then had the ability to print from my smartphone as well as my computer, and no longer needed a data cable. This printer can also scan, but I haven't even tried to access this feature after having such a hard time getting it to just print.There's also an extra step to get to the HP print menu rather than just taking the default from software on my computer, so on the whole I would rather have a dedicated printer working only with my desktop computer if that would allow automatic printing where you just select what pages you want.I thought I was all set, but the next time I needed to print 2 pages, it didn't work. I could see the print queue on the Windows menu but it said \"printer offline\" and there was no obvious way to bring it online. Another call to customer service and a half hour with their expert and I could print again. A month later I needed to print again and...you guessed it, printer offline. I gave up. I went to Amazon's website and attempted to return the recalcitrant device but the time allowed for returns had expired. This printer is not recommended unless you have a PhD in computer science. I want my money back.Loading the ink cartridges is also not as easy as it should be. The print head was hidden all the way on one side and I had to push a button on the printer to center it so the ink could be loaded. There's an automatic ink resupply option but it has already sent me another ink reservoir after I've printed exactly 4 pages.

I opted out of the ink subscription so there were no issues there that many people stated they couldn\u2019t opt out of. I also did NOT  need to provide any card information to create an account so again, not sure what that was about.I found that the color prints come out clearer than when you choose black and white. Black and white prints are not very bold,  and the print is somewhat choppy.When it comes to making copies via the scanner it\u2019s easy to use but you need to make sure you are aligning your document right, because it cut off some sections and the print was very light.Overall, I think if you are using this printer as a here and there type of deal, I would continue with the purchase, however, if this is for a work station or printing off papers for school work often, I\u2019d invest a few extra dollars and\/or do your research for a different printer.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718928000000}

I don't like it as much as my old one so I'm a little bitter. But the old did randomly die so maybe it's not that great. The paper tray is smaller so I have to reload more often. The screen\/button area isn't super user friendly or intuitive.You have to set-up through the app or a computer. They recommend the app, I hate having to download an app for set-up but it does work much better. Set-up was fine, pretty straightforward. If you have any issues\/problems with the printer you solve them through the app or a computer it seems. The printer itself isn't much help. My printer randomly was having issues connecting to the wi-fi. I had to re-download the app after trying on a computer to fix it. I tried for like an hour and was about to return it (2 days left to return) when I tried one last thing - restarting my router. It worked. It's frustrating but I guess now I know. None of my other devices had issues so it's weird.The print quality is fine, I've only done paper though. Double sided printing is annoying. You print the first side then turn the paper and put it back in so it can print the second side. Instructions pop up on my screen whenever I choose this option. However, if you already have more paper in the tray it'll automatically print on a second sheet. So you have to take all the paper out before printing double sided.I keep getting errors when I print, it'll flash E 2 or something. Everything prints fine so I don't understand why it's giving me an error message.I signed up for Instant Ink since it was free. Everyone recommends keeping it. It is super convenient to not have to think about ordering it. It just gets sent to your house automatically. You'll have to remember to cancel if you don't want to pay for it since you have to put payment info to get started. Starts at $1 a month, next tier is $4\/month.Overall, it's fine. It's relatively affordable and gets the job done. My old printer worked so much better and had better features for a similar price. Of course the new model is a lot more expensive so I opted for this one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1664496000000}

It was rated very well so we thought it was a great printer and ordered three- for myself, my father-in-law, and my sister-in-law. For starters it was very hard to get it connected to the computer and wifi. I bought my own cable hoping to just connect to the printer to my laptop USB and print, but it wouldn't work. I called the company and they said it has to first be connected to Wi-Fi to work. After spending many hours connecting it to Wi-Fi it finally worked, but only for a few hours. I tried printing something the next day but again it stated that it wasn't connected to the Wi-Fi. I called up the company again and spent another few hours  until one of their technicians was finally able to get it to stay connected to the Wi-Fi. The second problem with the printer is that the ink runs out really quickly. It printed about 40 pages and then all the ink was used up. I guess I'll be keeping it until the free ink subscription is over but after that I'll definitely be buying a new printer that doesn't require a new ink cartridge so often. My father-in-laws printer also hasn't been working well. It worked fine for the first 2 months but after that, the printer kept having problems with connecting to the internet. The printer does not connect to the computer or phone anymore so it's impossible to print anything. my father-in-law spent many hours with the company trying to fix the problem but they were unable to resolve the issue and my father-in-law decided to fix his old printer rather than try to get this one to work. My sister-in-law has also been having connectivity issues with this printer.Bottom line: Even though this printer is rated well, if you're looking for a printer that doesn't require a lot of time to set up and will stay connected to the Wi-Fi, definitely DO NOT buy this printer","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670976000000}

These printers constantly have an issue with shutting off power so that you cannot print to them. That is so annoying because my primary use is air printing. It defeats the purpose of remote printing if I have to go restart the printer every time and then wait for my printing to complete while standing next to it.

No feeder tray, so to make copies of more than 1 page you would have to manually put it on the flatbed for each page. Also, it ran out of paper quickly (the paper tray didn't hold much paper). My biggest issue was that it ran out of ink after less than a week. As I used HP Instant ink (which we had used previously for the last printer we had, and loved the program), we didn't have additional ink to replace with as it hadn't arrived yet.

Replaced with an HP3755 because it used the same ink as the remaining 2600 (ValueToner 67XL). However, the 3755 is total junk: slow printing, fails about 20% of the time. So, returned that and got this 2755e. Planned to use only with a USB connection, the remaining Deskjet 2600 is on the network. The 2755e so far is wonderful; as quick and reliable as our older 2600s. Only reason I did not order it first was it takes a different ink cartridge, and reportedly ONLY functions correctly with genuine HP (overpriced) cartridges. Our two Deskjet 2600s worked flawlessly with ValueToner 65XL cartridges. I may try them in the 2755e (ValueToner 67XL) , but probably not worth the aggravation.......UPDATE Apr 2023:I hate that my HP Deskjet 2755e directions say it will not function correctly with after-market ink cartridges. The 2600 I used to have for several years recently broke. It worked fine for about 5 years with after-market ValueToner cartridges. I have not tried after-market cartridges with the new 2755e, but I may try eventually and will update my review if I do and it's successful.UPDATE about 3 months later: After about 3 months of working okay, my printer fails printing about every 5th document saying the there is a problem with the HP color ink. I then take it out of the printer and reinstall and re-align. Works then for another 5 documents or so. The level indicates about 75% full, same as the black ink cartridge. The HP black ink has not caused any problems.I just ordered the ValueToner cartridge that worked perfectly in my previous HP 2600 printer that lasted about 5 years with ValueToner cartridges.

Shut down the printer I would ostensibly be using in the privacy of my home because I'm not buying my ink from you anymore? At the rate that I print (very little), the cheaper option would have been to pay the .99cents a month rather than buy the ink from Office Depot (assuming that I went through the purchased ink in under 2.5 years which I might not do) but the mere fact that HP has taken such an intimidating and bullying stance via their precious ink cartridges made me decide that I'd much rather give my money to an office supply store. All of that, again, is assuming I can get the printer to work every time. Not the situation at the moment. Very frustrating.

This printer has turned what should have been simple tasks into a nightmare of errors and frustration.First and foremost, the print quality is horrendous. No matter how many times I've tried adjusting the settings, the output always appears faded and blurry. It's as if the printer is running out of ink even though I just replaced the cartridges. I've wasted countless pages trying to get a decent printout, but it's simply impossible with this device.Beyond the abysmal print quality, the printer's connectivity is an absolute disaster. More often than not, it refuses to connect to my computer, causing me to waste valuable time troubleshooting the issue. Even when it does connect, it's unreliable at best. Print jobs get stuck in the queue, and I've had to resort to canceling and restarting the print process multiple times just to get a single page out. It's infuriating!But wait, there's more. The wireless mobile printing option is just slightly better than the wired connection, which is a low bar to begin with. While it occasionally works, I still encounter numerous connectivity issues, making it more of a headache than a convenience. It's truly baffling how a supposedly modern printer could struggle so much with a basic function like mobile printing.All in all, the HP DeskJet 2700 has been an expensive and aggravating mistake. I deeply regret my purchase and would strongly advise anyone considering this printer to look elsewhere. It's an absolute waste of money, time, and nerves.

Just about anyone in IT will cringe when you say the word \"printer\", they are the bane of most IT departments and as such, I have hated many printers over the years but none as much as this one.WHEN it prints, the quality is good enough. The problem is getting it to print.  The thing can't pull paper through unless there is only one or two pieces in the feeder.  It is a constant battle of trying to get the paper to load through so something can print and hoping it pulls through fast enough that you get your whole page printed.We have yet to be able to get the thing to scan.  Rather than give you a simple \"Scan\" button, you must open the HPSmart software and scan through there, which is fine if it worked.  Once you login to the software and hit \"scan\" it asks you to log in and thus begins an endless loop of trying to scan.

First off this printer has never printed in color. Second, you have to set up a subscription with HP to get ink sent to you based on how much you print they will automatically send you ink (you are charged) plus whatever subscription you choose, if you go over the allotted page limit they start charging you per page. Such BS. I wish I would have discovered this sooner so I could return. But since we don\u2019t print a ton, I am just realizing what a scam it all is. So not only do you buy the printer, then you buy your ream of paper, pay for ink and then they shut down printing capabilities if you have gone over your page limit or need to replace the ink. I have more ink, since we did not use all that was sent to us and I can\u2019t even use it without setting up an hp instant ink account where they will charge and send me more ink (that I don\u2019t need) and keep track of all the pages I am printing so they can charge me per page if I go over the allotted amount.

Yes, it's been that much of a frustration over the last couple of years that I came back to write this review. I bought this printer solely for printing return labels whenever I make purchases and need to return something. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I've used this print less than 20 times in nearly 2-years. It's terrible. The toner levels were showing that they were full but it was printing like it wasn't. One evening I spent literally 3-hours troubleshooting this. I went through all the prompts step by step -- and even reached out to HP for support (they were useless) and it's still not acting right. I went to Target and bought brand new toner and when I replaced them (even though the toner was showing as full with the previous cartridges) it began printing normal. Whatever... I chalked it up as being a fluke... even though that first toner I had in there was ALSO new. Well, it printed normal for maybe 5 more times and now here I am again facing the same exact issue. I'm so frustrated with HP and the quality of this printer. DO NOT BUY IT. I saw a couple reviews on here that had similar experiences as I did so I'd say it's not a fluke. It's junk.

Unfortunately, HP doesn't allow you to use the scanner unless you download their software (which then eliminates you being able to buy any other printer ink except HP). This irritated me, but I needed the scanner so I went ahead and started to download their software. A hard ethernet connection won't work. They demand you unplug your ethernet cable and connect to wifi to download their software. Frustrating, but I did this as well. While attempting the download yet again, they disconnected my wifi connection and made me sign in again. I tell you, at this point I felt like a hacker was trying to get my wifi password. Long story short, I wasn't able to download their software despite several attempts. Fortunately, I was able to connect the printer by just going through my regular computer system, but will never be able to use the scanner because there is no scanner button or option on the printer itself. You have to open the HP software to use the scanner. I ended up buying a \"plug-in & use\" Epson scanner. If Epson printers are as easy as this scanner, that's what I'm buying next.

Instead of simply inserting a CD or downloading software, HP FORCES your to install their app on your smartphone, even if you'll never print from your phone!  Getting the printer installed and connected to WiFi wasn't hard - but in order to continue installation, you have to completed a couple more steps.Why, if the printer is connected, do we have to complete additional steps before printing? What other steps could there possibly be?Well, first of all to continue installation you MUST create an account that you're never going to use or sign in to again.HP thinks that being a loyal customer and buying their printer isn't enough - they want more from you. A lot more. After creating a useless account, you MUST sign up for HP's ink subscription program.  You literally cannot click \"Continue Installation\" until you've done this. Then, you MUST check a box that says you \"agree to not purchase ink from any company but HP\".  Then, in order to continue installation you MUST input your personal cell #, email address, and physical home address. As everyone knows, any functional printer needs to know your cell and where you live in order to get that ink running. At this point, I was surprised they didn't ask for my social security # and bank accounts.After providing HP everything about your life, you then MUST check a box that says you ALLOW HP TO SHARE ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS.  If you don't check this box, you can't continue installation.And when you think it couldn't get any worse, if you have multiple devices in your home wanting to print, too bad!  Only registered HP accounts are allowed to print from your printer.  This means if a family member wants to print something, they also have to go through these installation steps inputting THEIR personal information, cell phone, address, and allowing HP to share all their personal data.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"38 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675555200000}

And they even ship replacement cartridges when you don't need them, but as soon as you try and use this new cartridge it wont print because you don't have an active subscription. How wasteful.Beyond that, the user interface with the app is horrendous. I don't think the app or the printer works well with any OS. I was able to get the printer set up the first time pretty quickly but after that it all went to crap.It constantly loses connection and has to be reset. And what's super great, when you reset the printer it MUST print a test page. This test page consumes a ton of ink. Very nice plan... Sell a crappy printer that can't connect and requires constant reboots, make each reboot include a test page that consumes massive amounts of ink, continually charge customer for using ink.I then tried to use non HP ink cartridges, which from a technical standpoint is completely fine. But HP emails you constantly that the cartridges arent HP Instant Ink approved.From the moment I installed the \"non-approved\" cartridges Ive had even MORE issues. The device just won't connect at all. Sometimes the printer will just start blinking every light and every digit in the seven segment display and has to be unplugged.

I know some stuff, been around the block. This was PAINFUL.I bought this because my awesome Canon printer that lasted 15 years finally gave up the ghost. I was looking for something to print a document here and again and a few photos of family. No big whoop. This was cheap-ish and looked cute. Big mistake.Setting this up was as fun and easy as applying for a home loan. It took HOURS for my computer to be able to see the printer on my wifi network. It would see it, then it would go away.

It refused to recognize it otherwise.So to the printing - it prints documents fine. Nothing great, nothing awful. Photos on the other hand - no. Well, if you like having an ugly 1\/2\" border on one side while the rest are 1\/8\" then this is perfect for you. I, like most other humans on the earth think this looks odd.

I purchased this printer and had an offer for their Instant Ink prescription program.  I decided to give it a try but after a few months decided it wasn't working for me.  I was using print cartridges from the program.  After I unsubscribed within a week my printer would not work.  There were flashing icons on the printer led but I could find nothing in the manual or online that matched the error icons.  I am very busy and knew that calling their customer service would likely take a long time so more than a month later, without the use of the printer that whole time I called.  Sure enough it took three tries and an hour and a half of my time.  What I discovered is that my printer would not work because I was using the Instant Ink cartridges!  And there is no way to make them work after I had unsubscribed, even though technically I paid for them.  The customer service rep tried to tell me that I didn't pay for the cartridge because it was a subscription program.  That's when I realized it is a scam program.  The only way to get the printer to work again was to buy cartridges that are non-instant ink cartridges.I am so disappointed that HP has turned to scamming customers and will never buy another HP product.

{"reviewTitle":"Connection Issues, But It Prints","reviewDescription":"So I don't know if it's just a bad receiver or what, but set up was kind of lengthy because it was just taking forever to send and receive signals from my laptop. Once it was done, it began to print the test pages. The text looks decent, but the shapes\/images look a bit grainy in my opinion. After doing the copying, I thought they looked even more so. Also, it looks like it's already using up quite a bit of ink which is pretty ridiculous.Decided to do scans of the pages it printed to share here, and boy was that a pain. It wouldn't connect to the scanner for some reason and I kept getting an error. I looked on the Smart App for my phone and, funnily enough, was able to start the scan through there. After that, I was able to scan from my laptop.Overall, it works after you work through everything. I've only bought this to print notes for school so I won't be super dependent on it. If you only need it for text, this might be good and can save you so money. If you need to print a lot or need to print diagrams or anything, it would be better for you to invest in a better product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696204800000}

{"reviewTitle":"You get what you pay for","reviewDescription":"EDIT - June 2023****I had a free trial for HP Instant Ink, which I guess expired awhile ago. I was auto-enrolled into the $0.99\/month tier without me knowing. Today when I needed to print, my billing information was out of date. As such, HP bricked my printer. I literally could not print or force print anything until I went to my account and updated my stupid plan.Absolutely ridiculous that being behind a few bucks for their stupid plan renders the printer useless. 0\/10, would not recommend any printer from HP.Long and short of it - the printer works. However, there are a few downsides.The set up was really frustrating. We downloaded the app and it kept failing. We have amazing internet\/WiFi and were close to the router. We also tried installing it locally connected to our computer, which also didn't work.After a half dozen attempts, the app finally worked and the printer was set up. HP of course tries to get you to sign up for their printer services which may or may not be great, depending on your needs.The other issue we were having with this printer was it completely resetting any time we unplugged it to move it.We had to move our office around a little bit and you have to obviously unplug it to do so. After plugging it back in, it was no longer discoverable in the app or on our computers. And because there is no smart screen or interface on the printer itself, we had to re-do the entire set up process.We also recently changed internet providers, and consequently internet hardware (modem\/router). Again, because all the set up is done on the app we pretty much had to re-set up the printer from square one.My recommendation - if you need a cheap printer to print once a month or less and moving it around isn't an issue, great.Otherwise, spend a few more bucks and get something more reliable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657756800000}

It's not even really wireless, you still have to have it plugged into the wall for power, why not just add another cable to hook it up to my PC and avoid the hassle of all the bugs that go with it being wireless?First I got an error that said my wifi password was wrong, when it wasn't, rebooting seemed to fix that. That wasn't the advice online though, the advice online was to go into all kinds of obscure settings to troubleshoot the issue, glad I skipped that and tried just rebooting first. The setup was then extremely slow, took about an hour waiting for the buggy software to set everything up. Then they tried to sign me up automatically for recurring ink shipments. Kinda dumb I have to sign up for an account at all, it's just a piece of hardware, you used to be able to plug these things in and they would just work, and there would just be drivers associated with it that you would only have to deal with in the event of problems, instead of requiring you to sign up for an account so they can continue to advertise to you.Now that the printer is all setup, 75% of the time it fails to actually print, for unknown reasons (possibly wireless related issues) and I have to restart the thing repeatedly. This thing is a massive downgrade from a normal printer from 30 years ago that just worked when you PLUGGED IT IN.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705708800000}

Print quality for black and white document printing meets the current standard, color printing of photos and images could be better but seems about the same as others in this price range.Here's the problem. This comes with 6 months of Instant Ink. After 6 months, you're automatically charged monthly whether you use your printer or not. But if you decide to to stop the subscription, the printer stops working. Somehow or the other, HP has coded those little devils so they stop working when you stop paying.

I enrolled for HP InstantInk thinking it would save me time going to the store for more ink and make it easier to recycle. After having the service for 6 months without printing, I didn't see the benefit of continuing to pay for the service based on my limited use, so I cancelled it. 6 weeks later I tried to print something and the printer lit up like a Christmas tree. Whoops! After an hour of resets, reinstalls of the printer and trying to find what caused the issue, I connected to the printer's web-based hub. Get this! Despite the fact that my cartridges are full and I hadn't printed in months, HP disabled my print cartridges unless I reenrolled in HP InstantInk. Having an urgent need to print and basically having this equipment held hostage, I acquiesced and selected the lowest cost program. This is where I learned the true reality of HP InstantInk. HP InstantInk keeps track of your print usage, for each page you print, you are deducted a use. Misaligned? Dirty print head? Ran out of ink in the print? All of these are counted against you during your printing cycle. I paid $2 to print at home, using my own printer, paper, and electricity, only to have unusable sheets. Since I selected the lowest cost plan, each set of additional 10 pages was $1. Or $0.10 per page. This is the cost of going to Staples or FedEx office and having them print for you. That's right, you are paying the same rate as a print shop to print from home.

This is why I chose HP; they support Linux better than just about any other brand.Setup was a very fussy affair. The setup on the Android was trivial. Setup on the Chromebook took more effort than it should have. The setup on the Linux box was a ROYAL P.I.T.A. This install was fussy spelled with capital pain in the ass. I worked one evening for about 2 hours trying to get it to work. In the printer settings I could see that the printer was available. It was also available in the print's list of printers. However, when I started a print job it would just park in the print queue. I tried multiple reboots and tried the drivers that are on the HP web site. This didn't go well. I then installed the drivers using apt-get. This went better and far faster. This appeared to install successfully, but the print jobs in the queue would not print. Out of frustration I shut it down and went to bed. The next morning I started the computer and all the queued jobs printed without any action on my part. I've no idea why it worked this morning.Alignment was also a pain. It took me 3-4 attempts to get the alignment to complete. it would print the test page but would not scan it.

{"reviewTitle":"Must buy subscription or printer won't work!","reviewDescription":"So first thing first, I bought this printer because I'm homeschooling my oldest kids this year, I have had it for about six months now. It is a decent printer at first because you get the 3 months of free ink with your purchase. But after your three months runs out you have to pay to pretty much use the printer or it doesn't work. If you cancel you plan like I did you can print literally 10 pages per month for free. So no you can't just buy this printer and buy ink somewhere else, it's set up to where you can only buy their ink. So basically your paying a subscription even after you purchase the printer, even if you only want to print a few pages a month they make you subscribe or the printer doesn't work, it forces you to make a payment just to print something. So your buying the printer, paper and ink and paying a subscription just to use the printer and it is highway robbery if you ask me. So my takeaway is to buy a printer you can just buy and use anytime you want without worrying about if you remembered to have enough money to pay for you subscription. If you don't pay, you can't print. My sister has a brother printer and she buys her paper and ink and that's it, she doesn't have to worry about paying an additional subscription fee every month just to print and it should be that way. I don't and would not recommend this printer to anyone who is reading this review. I literally got ticked off I went to print my kids homework last week and had forgotten to pay my subscription fee $13.99 per month so I couldn't print, so I went online to cancel my plan because my printer just kept blinking at me that it had a message and it literally won't stop blinking until you update your payment method and even if you cancel your payment method it doesn't actually cancel for two weeks so you can't get your free 10 pages until then. It's absolutely ridiculous and a complete scam. My takeaway: buy a non subscription printer so you can print when you want whether your enrolled or not. Like if I want to buy my paper and ink somewhere else I should be able to do that but I can't with this printer unless subscribed.

{"reviewTitle":"HP Support is a Special Circle of Hell","reviewDescription":"Super disappointed in this printer which worked fine for about four months then mysteriously started flashing all the lights, which prompted a call to HP support. That's when the fun began.The first rep managed to get the printer working again, but there were still minor issues with connecting to Instant Ink. The tech and I were disconnected after two hours, prompting yet another contact with someone who undid all of the work of the first and we were disconnected again before resolution.The third contact worked with me for about three more hours, (new day, because you need an entire evening if you're calling HP) determining the scanner on my printer was defective and the whole thing should be replaced. (The scanner wasn't even the problem, initially!)The pre-paid shipping label for return went to my spam folder (my fault for not checking) but two weeks passed and I contacted HP again only to be shuffled along to three more different people.Meanwhile, since I had been on hold for 45 minutes with intermittent repetitive questions (name, case number, email, phone number, etc) again and again, I noticed that the address on the pre-paid label was wrong, so I knew I was going to need to fix THAT, provided I could get passed back to the right representative. This call's hold time was already long but I didn't want to ruin yet another perfectly good evening, so I just stayed on the phone.Fortunately, Frank from HP Instant Ink helped me pause my ink subscription and even got me in touch with someone at the warranty center who could help. Adding up all the time, it looks like 7-8 hours of tech support went into this machine, and that's not even counting the time it will take to get this to the closest FedEx dropoff pont which is 20 miles from here.Takeaway? I'm on my second HP computer and my third HP printer, so I like the company overall. But the next time I buy a product from them I'll test every feature before the return window expires through Amazon which would have been a far simpler process.Also, I initially liked the ink subscription, especially when I printed more often in the past. Now I am not so sure, especially when it is one more thing that can go wrong, and one more area of HP that you must contact if there's a problem. And that's the main problem with HP's support--they have so many support factions that it is nearly impossible to talk to the person who can help you on the first try.So sit back, pour yourself a cold one, and try not to be cruel to the underpaid worker on the other end of the phone. Something is wrong with the way this company communicates with its consumers, even loyal and patient ones like me, and there is something also wrong with the way problems are communicated between factions of HP Support, given how much hold time a consumer must endure just to reach the actual help that is needed.Good luck, and hope you get a good one!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"96 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673827200000}

The charge for printing over the amount you designated (making you pay to use a printer you already bought is insane)2. Printer saying it is connected but yet is entirely unable to print no matter how many restarts, ethernet chords, etc. (meaning the HP app you need to download to manage your subscription service as well as print from this printer is faulty and only serves for you to setup a payment plan - who cares if the program works if HP is able to get your money, right?)This printer is a dystopian nightmare and literally the worst case of a company abusing its customers through negligence.1. Printer does not work as advertised despite excessive troubleshooting (i have to troubleshoot each time I print)2. It makes you pay extra to use the printer at all (after buying it)3. It does not care if you are connected to the internet. It does not care if you have an ethernet connection. It does not care if you are God.

In fact on the \"interface\" line of the specs it says  \"USB 2.0\".I even contacted my internet provider (spectrum) to make sure that my router was 2.4 compatible, and I had to change the appropriate setting, and the tech support person said that they showed the printer hooked up to my 2.4 ghz wifi network.It still wouldn't print. Not even the test page. I ran the diagnostic function of the \"HP Smart\" app, which is lacking to say the least, and it came up as having no problems. The panel showed that it had a solid connection with wifi. Still wouldn't print. It would print a little, as shown in the photos. The full page diagnostic prints came from the machine's firmware or something, they were not sent by the computer, as far as I can tell, and it happens as part of setting up the software and drivers. It was not something I sent to the printer.Also, after not even 3 pages of color printing, the color ink indicator went down by an alarmingly significant amount. I believe they do this to get you to subscribe to their ink subscription scam.

We received the Instant Ink package with the printer and I thought it was kind of nice of HP to start us off on our printer journey with \"free\" ink. Boy, was I wrong about it being free. When I checked into it the day after we received our printer, I found that HP would send us ink cartridges depending on our use of the printer (number of pages printed) for a nominal fee of $1.06 (which they would charge us monthly regardless of them sending us cartridges). I called HP and spoke to a product representative and after a brief conversation, I requested that the Instant Ink deliveries be discontinued. After setting up my printer, I just couldn't get it to work no matter what I did. I Downloaded HP Smart to my cell phone and followed its instructions to no avail. I went to the HP site, Youtube, and various sites and nothing helped. Not even calls to Hewlett Packard were helpful. As a last resort I called my computer guy. He came over spent 1+1\/2 hours and tried everything. Nothing seemed to work. He asked me if I had an HP account. I told him I had never signed up for an account. He looked around my desk and saw a small box stamped \"hp instant ink\". He said, \"There's you problem!\" He told me once I cancelled the Instant Ink deliveries, there's a small chip in the ink cartridge and they cancelled the cartridge's use through that chip. My computer guy told me that if I install cartridges purchased from any store, the printer should work. I bought two (2) cartridges yesterday, installed them and the printer works just fine. The problem is I lost the use of this printer for 16 months because of Hewlett Packard's sneaky tactics. My computer guy charged me $150.00 (more than double the cost of the printer) which never would have happened had Hewlett Packard been conscientious in dealing with their customers. Oh, and by the way, even though I had cancelled Instant Ink package the day after receiving our printer, Hewlett Packard is still charging me. I feel that if Hewlett Packard was an honest, forthcoming company, this incident would never have happened. As far as my purchasing any future products from Hewlett Packard, that depends on them.

That worked fine and the printer then worked as expected.So, to recap, use an USB cable, only the basic driver package, and disconnect from the internet while you install it.I would guess that an MBA exec at HP decided to save money by firing US based software engineers and outsourcing app development to cheap labor regions to save money.

Just bought and setup this printer- firstly, it made me sign up for HP+ to finish setup. If you don't already know, this printer will only let you use HP ink due to \"security features\". Secondly, it comes with 1 black and 1 tri-color HP ink. I installed the HP ink out of the box and it refuses to recognize the black ink cartridge after 1 day. On my old printer, it would have just used the tri-color, but not this one. Printer is now useless until I can drive to town and get more black ink (which I shouldn't even have to do after 1 day and a single print of 2 pages).

{"reviewTitle":"The most painful setup ever","reviewDescription":"I write software for a living and lead a team of 12 developers. I know how Windows works, I know how printers work. This was the most painfully horrible setup experience of my life. I got this setup at home after about 2 hours with my daughter's new laptop for college. After finally getting it setup to do WiFi direct printing, I shipped it up to her. It stopped working as soon as she got it. I spent 2 more hours over Messenger trying to help and troubleshoot to no avail. I never could get it to be recognized as a Bluetooth enabled printer, which would have been much easier. Instead you have to jump through hoops on HP's proprietary \"Smart\" software...which was terrible. Even after unplugging USB, it still registered as connected via USB. I even unplugged the printer and uninstalled the printer from Windows, but the \"Smart\" software still saw it as connected over USB and working...not sure how a printer works without being plugged in. This was so painful and it still doesn't work. All I need now is for it to print a piece of paper that says \"PC Load Letter\" and I'll feel fully justified in taking a baseball bat to it! HP could have spent an extra 0.50 cents and put a screen on the device that actually provides information, like IP address or MAC address instead of you hitting some esoteric button sequence to print network information...which only works SOMETIMES because other times it prints WPS pin numbers (useless!!!). Just a horrible experience. I'd pay $60 to get 4 hours of my life back and never have to see this device and software again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693094400000}

All of their printers come with sleep mode - after a predetermined period of time, which you can change, the printer goes into sleep mode to \"save power\" - look, HP, I can manage my own electricity, of which I pay for, I don't need your help.  You cannot disable sleep mode.  You can only change how long it remains functional and operational until it decides to shut down and go offline, even though it's in \"sleep mode.\"Now, HP claims that sending a print job to the printer automatically wakes it up.  This is not true.  I can send hundreds of print jobs to the stupid thing and it never wakes up, and that goes for both Windows and macOS.  And iOS.  I doubt it's a faulty model, and it's not like I can do anything about it because HP refuses to offer any assistance whatsoever.I probably won't buy another HP printer ever again because you can't turn off sleep mode and the whole false advertising thing.

I've had HPs in the past and they've always been steadfast and reliable. This one, however, was exceedingly disappointing.It couldn't print colored and black text on the same line - it was always misaligned, even after I did the alignment process on the printer three separate times. When you're printing important documents with certain words highlighted in other colors it is simply unacceptable to see one word slightly above the rest in a different color because the printer couldn't handle keeping the words on the same line. When words were both colored and used black ink, they just looked fuzzy because of this offset.Each time it printed, despite using new printer paper ordered from Amazon, it took 3-5 sheets with each page it printed, sometimes messing it up so it printed on parts of all of those pages, which wasted paper and required me to reprint it.When contacting HP customer support about it, I was offered a free replacement but the agent took 50 minutes to collect my shipping and billing information (because they needed to temporarily charge me $1, which they would refund when they received the old printer back). Beyond this the site he sent to collect payment information didn't work three times in a row. In the end I had to go to an appointment because I hadn't expected the call to take more than maybe 25 minutes so didn't complete the process.When I contacted Amazon again to get in touch with HP support they offered me a refund minus an 18% restocking fee. I took it because I'm tired of dealing with this printer and all the hassle that has come with it.HP printers are now dead to me, which I never thought I would say.

Every single page it tried to feed.  The two pages would jam just as it was entering the print mechanism.  It would feed one inch into the print mechanism, jam, and print the entire page in one spot on the paper.  It would feed-and-print halfway down the page, and then jam.  Trying to print a 5-page document, I had to start the printout maybe 6 times, each time starting it again at the point where it jammed.The next time I tried to use it, 2 days later, I tried hand-feeding one sheet at a time.

I swapped to my computer after turning on its wireless card (I normally have a wired connection) and it still took a bit of fiddling to get it on the network.

The machine will not print unless I open the app and select the file, meaning that trying to print in any native way (i.e. using the print command in Word,  Acrobat etc) would result in a failed print job.

I booted my computer and went to print a test page and my computer could not find the machine on the network. The printer was literally set up the night before and apparently cannot maintain a connection after about 12 hours.I think the worst part is that it has no USB connection - so you cannot plug into it and troubleshoot from there.

TADA! Connected! Now??? Nope. You have to download an app to your phone, even if you never intend to print from your phone (because it isn't permanently attached to your hand and you can function without it). Then you have to ask for a code. Then you have to pair the printer to your phone. THEN you have to send a link to yourself via email to download to your laptop, so you can pair your printer to your laptop.I have no idea why it is that every single time a \"new and improved\" version of a piece of tech comes out, it has \"improved\" so much that it takes an additional five steps to get the thing to work.PS: HP, if you're listening, your tech used to work MUCH better before you \"improved\" it and added useless steps. I'd buy your products in the future if you hadn't altered your user-friendly setup processes to include mandatory phone tethering and apps. This is the last piece of HP junk I will ever buy--not because it doesn't work. It DOES work. But because I refuse to be forced to jump through hoops to use the machine I've already paid for. Sell me a printer that I can just pair to my wifi or plug-n-play, and I'll buy it. App pairing for simple device use is cheap and invasive to privacy.

Fairly easy to install, but a bit surprised by complexity of installation.  It is not like the old wireless printers that you plug in, turn on and the computer detects a new device, installs it, and you are good to go.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent Printer, Especially for the Price -- NO FREE INK WIRED","reviewDescription":"This really is a great little printer.  It is exactly what I wanted, and after reading all the positive reviews, my mind was made up, especially in light of getting 6 months of free ink.  The printer set up in less than 5 minutes right out of the box.  I have it WIRED, not wireless.  My PC is also HP, so I was printing right away.  Great print quality!  Here's the rub -- I was really enticed by the 6 months of free ink.  I spent probably an hour online trying to set that up, but it wouldn't work, so I had to contact an HP tech to help set it up.  Spent an hour with the first tech who couldn't figure it out, and was then transferred to a second tech.  after another hour and a half, the problem was still not solved.  It turns out you have to have both your printer and your PC on wifi in order to get the free ink.  I don't want to have my PC on wifi because wireless communications are more easily hacked.  So I can't get the free ink because I prefer to have my PC WIRED and SAFER.  SUX.  Five minutes to set up, 3 and 1\/2 hours to find out I can't get the free ink if my PC is wired.  Why can't they just tell you that?  It would certainly save a lot of frustration.  And you can't get the automatic refills, either, because without the PC and printer communicating on wifi, the signal doesn't go out to request new ink.  Seriously SUX!  Other than that, the printer is great.UPDATE:  A year later and I am LOVING this printer, despite the problems I had during setup.  It works like a charm and is VERY RELIABLE.

{"reviewTitle":"YOU NEED THE HP SMART APP TO INSTALL THIS PRINTER, ALTHOUGH IT IS MENTIONED NOWHERE ON INSTRUCTIONS","reviewDescription":"Let me save you HOURS of frustration and misery. To properly install this printer, you will need the HP Smart app from the App Store (or Android\/PC equivalent). This app is in addition to the setup installer they instruct you to install.If you automatically go to the setup installer like the instruction tell you to, there's a big chance the installer will tell you that there is \"no printer found\" and to check all of your power cords, USBs, etc. I spent half an hour accepting the fact that this was going to be much more complicated than that.I came back a few hours later and was ready to figure this printer out. This would not defeat me. It was too affordable. Anyway, I was clearly stuck at the phase of the printer being found on \"my network.\" To make a painful story short, I finally concluded that there was apparently an HP App that was downloadable to your COMPUTER. Nowhere is that explained. Nowhere. This very, very simple piece of information would have saved me an afternoon of madness.Other than that, if I had been told the manual even mentioned this (or the app itself once on any piece of paper included with the printer), the setup would have taken about 15 minutes. No sweat.The app itself tries to interface directly with your browser, and will continually switch between using the app window and the browser window, so make sure you have an up-to-date browser. That would have saved me about an hour, but honestly was my fault. Although I will say, I don't see much point or convenience to the app needing to have you access HP.com on your browser continually. Unnecessarily complicated.You'll also need to create an HP account. Odd to assume everyone already has an HP account and the app installed beforehand without instruction. They easily could have just stated this, which would have simplified the entire process.After all of this, the printer works flawlessly. Superfast, super quiet, and the setup ink is more than enough to cover you for a while. It was well worth the low price, and I don't regret my purchase, although I'm still mildly infuriated that they couldn't just come out and say that I'd need to download another one of their products (the app). It wasn't sneaky; it just made it more annoying.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1647820800000}

I was looking for a cheap printer because I don\u2019t really print much and didn\u2019t want to spend too much. Despite some of the negative reviews I took a shot with this one.I spent about 40m setting this thing up. I\u2019ve set up quite a few printers in my life, for me, friends and family and this has been the most tedious and time consuming one. All the setup has to be done from the HP app. The app failed multiple times while setting up. I had to restart every time. After finally getting it connected to my network, it printed a test page and all the letters were doubled. I had to do a print head alignment, which you sort of have to dig around in the app to find. Then it had to do an update so that took a while. I swear I almost packaged this thing back up to return, but just practiced a bit of patience.After all of that, I was able to get some quality pages to print.It\u2019s a bit slower then my past more expensive printers and it is a little loud but I won\u2019t be using it too much for that to bother me.The saying stays true, you get what you pay for. It is a budget printer after all and it gets the job done. I see some reviews where others seem to get this thing setup in a few minutes. I guess it\u2019s a hit or miss with the one you get.If you print once in a while then I think the price is fair, just be prepared incase you get one that doesn\u2019t want to play nice during setup.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"73 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708214400000}

It gave me a fear to print because I would not know how much I would get charge every month. On top of that after you cancel your subscription, HP PUT A PROGRAM TO BLOCK YOUR PRINTER FROM USING THEIR INSTANT INK, so I am sitting here with a bunch of leftover ink. There is a 3rd party you buy ink to use for the printer however I heard it might be difficult and risky because ether have a program to block that as well.

Basically it is monitored to how often you print and the quality of printing from the device at the company and not the actual print that has printed at your house or company. Connection is determined by the company\u2019s computer not the actual connection you have at your house or business. The printer itself is not user friendly and do not bother calling the company because on their end the connection is at full capability. Also, be ready to be at the printer when printing because it does not have an effective holder for what it being printed, so it well be in a cascaded mess that you will have to place what you printed in the correct order of the project printed. Do not add too much paper or it will jam and not work, not enough and you will wait to continue to add paper so what you are printing will be able to print all papers. It is useless unless you are printing a black and white cartoon that your child can color. Again, you can only do that if your printer decides to connect to the device you are printing from.

When I bought it, it came with some kind of subscription to \"Instant Ink\", which I didn't fully understand, but OK I guess it could be convenient to have ink shipped when I'm running low.The problem - the printer almost NEVER responds because, for some reason, after being connected to my network for a day or so, it loses it's IP address but remains connected to the WiFi. This causes it to show up on my computer and in the HP Smart app as being \"connected\" - but will not respond to print requests because of the stupid Instant Ink tracking, which needs an IP address apparently in order to keep track of how many pages I'm printing.This has been nothing short of infuriating. I don't need to print documents very often but when I do need to, it is urgent. So unfortunately, it took me many months where I hardly printed anything before I realized this is a constant problem. Lately, every time I've had to print something I basically have to spend an hour with HP's online support before we can get it working. Then the next day, it just doesn't work again. Nobody has been able to send me clear directions on how to fix it, and the HP documentation online is confusing and outdated, often giving directions from outdated versions of the app that no longer have the same settings, features, etc.I wish I could just return it, but unfortunately I had it for several months before I realized it was an issue, and it was only after continually encountering the same problem that I realized basically, if I need to print something, I can count on losing 30-60 minutes of my day troubleshooting things so this piece of junk will actually work.I'm about to just go full Office Space on this thing - DO NOT BUY ONE.

I'd had it for probably 15 years before it finally got a fatal error. Then I looked into a new printer and found this one.The setup wasn't bad, but man do I wish I could return this thing. The paper tray does not guide the paper in well, and it isn't clear if the paper is sitting properly in the slot for the rollers to grab. Half the time, it only feeds the paper halfway through and gets stuck. Sometimes it eats the paper and crinkles it.The quality of the print is not good. The very first thing I printed should have been the red flag I needed to return it, but I wanted to give it a chance. The text was blurry and actually looked like it had a doubled text effect like a drop shadow. Except there was no drop shadow. It was just a low-quality print. Much worse than my archaic printer.But my biggest gripe is that without fail, I have to print at least one copy of something to throw away before it will print mostly correctly. Just look at that photo I submitted. That's a 3-page contract for my business where every 4th line or so on the first and second pages got cut off, and the third page is unreadable. This is the copy I printed first (so it isn't a matter of running out of ink), and then I print another, which prints mostly fine, with the occasional first letter of a word smudged. The amount of ink and paper I waste just getting this thing to do its one job is disgraceful. And considering you're set up automatically on their ink program that tracks how much ink and paper you use, it's really not a good look.I would recommend buying a different printer.

It never corrected. I had to use the wireless printing option and, because of this, when my black ink ran out, the ink service that I paid for month after month never sensed how low it was. I literally could not print with black ink and had to use color. Until the color ink started to run out. And because it never connected properly, I couldn't get replacements, even though I was still paying.I tried their troubleshooting app. I tried reinstalling drivers. I tried everything.The only con is that it was so light, I had no trouble bringing it to the garage room.DO NOT BUY HP PRINTERS, THEY ARE MONEY-SUCKING PIECES OF GARBAGE","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1719532800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Never buy a HP printer again. Additional information.","reviewDescription":"Read the end which is my most recent revision. While I gave one star in reality it deserves a minus ten stars and so does Amazon!!!While the delivery was one day sooner than expected, it took several hours to set up even with a grandson who is extremely computer literate. I have never had a problem in setting up any computer devices before. The instructions are pitiful and the web site is a joke. I'll try Epson or another vendor next time that I need a printer. Now HP says they will be cancelling my account for automatic ink. Its just as well - this thing is a expensive door stop. Their help is a joke as is the printer. On line I found that the problem of entering the sleep stage is a problem that they are aware of but the pitiful instructions to correct this have tell me to press a button that simply do not exist on my printer. their service is a joke. They just lost a long time customer. Shame om Amazon for recommending this product. It makes me question the validity of any Amazon recommendation. Two months of trying to fix this I get a virtual assistant who get me on an endless loop. Needless to say there is no understanding on the HP site. The printer did work for one day then fell asleep again. My daughter has the same model of printer purchased the same time as mine and has no problems YET. This is reason not to buy anything from Amazon. Shoddy products. I am considering to buy locally in the future -  not from Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!update. I tried to order Instant Ink and was continually told that I did not supply complete information but I did and that the order was cancelled but after 6 months they started to bill me. I contacted HP and after a few hours they closed my complaint case file. I suffered a stroke years ago and lost function in my right hand. I type with one finger on my left hand. It is a slow process but apparently too slow for HP and they closed my case because it took me too long to state my case. AMAZON SHOULD INVESTIGATE. I AN GOING TO CANSEL MY CREDIT CARD THAT THEY ARE BILLING. THEY WILL PROBABLY SUE ME FOR NON-PAYMENT.

{"reviewTitle":"an exercise in frustration","reviewDescription":"What they don't tell you when you're considering this purchase, and even after, is that the cartridges provided aren't standard ink cartridges. They are, as the technician on the phone informed me, included only for the purpose of printing test pages and, as such, only include enough ink for about a dozen pages. Further, for whatever reason, they never really show up as being empty, even after all the ink has been used.I rarely use a printer, so I was able to get a few prints off of the included cartridges, thinking they were just standard ones. After several months, I go back to use the printer, and I'm a little perplexed as to why I have very low ink levels  ...allegedly still usable, but low. Worse, I try to print something and only two colors show up, very faintly. I assume there must be dried ink on the printheads, so I proceed with the cleaning function and am gifted with a blank test page. I try the next level cleaning and get the same result. The app then suggests I call customer service or initiate a chat with a technician. I chose the latter and after about 20 minutes of troubleshooting, I'm informed about the hobbled cartridges sent with the printer from the factory. After installing new cartridges, the printer now functions normally. I was relieved because I was giving serious consideration to throwing the thing into a wood chipper. (not really) Again, nothing in the installation instructions mention the need to buy additional cartridges. Considering the cost of buying ink, suddenly the price of the printer doesn't seem like that great of a deal. Sure, they offer \"six-months of free ink\", but that requires giving over credit card information and signing up for a subscription. Shady.Some other frustrations are about how I have to open an account with HP in order to print something in my own home. That just seems like some creepy corporate big brother BS. I'm also not very impressed by the app. It's overly complicated and often non-responsive, forcing me to reboot either the app, the printer or both.All in all, I wish I had been given better information so I could have made a more informed decision about whether or not to purchase this unit. Frankly, I very likely would have bought something else.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"179 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1682208000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Would not purchase again","reviewDescription":"I had an HP Envy 4512 that finally stopped working.  I came across this printer and wrongfully assumed it would be as good or better than my last one.  Boy was I wrong!  First of all, I duplex quite often.  This printer can duplex but only manually.  In other words print one side, flip the pages and reinsert and pray that you inserted the pages the correct way.  My old printer automatically duplexes.My old printer had a paper tray.  One wouldn't think this is a new concept.  After all, the printers I had more than a decade ago had that feature.  The paper feed at the back of the printer is a pain.  I make simple copies of report forms for church.  I generally print 10 at a time.  At least that's the number I manually input on the printer panel. I never know how many I will actually get because the printer randomly pulls extra paper through the feed.  Yesterday it was pulling all of the paper through for each page.  Of course yesterday, I wouldn't have needed as many pages if the software allowed for edits like my old HP.I have only used the printer a few times since purchase.  There is no way it prints as fast as it claims to.  Instead of 5.5 pages per minute(or whatever the claim is), it's more like 5.5 pages per hour.Certainly printer technology should be improving.

It's not a bad choice because I'm a student and I don't use my printer often. But I just bought it from Walmart because the paper is expensive and delivery is late. The printer has 300dpi 600 and 1200 options, but if you choose 1200, the printer will get errors and is very slow. I just recommend 300dpi, which is not clear, but fast. If you print it to the paper, the picture always cuts. That's quite annoying. To prevent that, you can make it into a pdf or jpg file and use the word to specify the paper margin.

The ink cartridges that come with the printer won't last long as there isn't much ink in them.  After printing the initial alignment page (it auto renders in color for it), the ink level monitoring software automatically opened \/ popping up on my screen and graphically showing the level of the color ink cartridge was \"down one notch\" from full.  Really, from just printing the alignment page?  Bad HP, Bad Indeed.As a set, the regular HP replacement ink cartridges will set a person back almost $50 so, as it's been for years now, these inexpensive combo printers are a money grab for the ink required to use them.  Fortunately, I don't print much at all these days so the included tiny cartridges will probably last me many months.  I do not recommend the HP Ink Program; it's a shortcut used by HP to get quicker access to consumers' money and from what I've read online about it, it's ink monitoring software is skewed to influence the frequency of the automatic ink orders; so not cool HP!  Plus, in addition to the expensive HP Ink being shipped more frequently than actually necessary, the program is structured as a subscription based service.  Again, not cool!2A.  I bought the combo printer because I wanted to connect it thru USB rather than wirelessly.  The last two HP printers bought over the years were wireless ones and though I'm computer savvy and have been online and printing for 30 years, the 2 wireless printers had network connectivity issues regularly even though they were both close to the PC and the combo modem\/router.  The various indicator lights on the printers flashed often indicating communication \/ network problems so, since the printers were fairly cheap anyway, as I tired of network, router\/modem\/printer resets and reboots, I gave them to Goodwill.2B.  Once the HP123 setup was initialized, I realized this install program has bias toward a wireless connection set up rather than a wired USB.  On the first setup screen, the only option is to choose the wireless network the printer detected and another option that says something like \"choose a different network\".  The screen is missing a clickable direct link to a USB setup.  However, by clicking the \"choose another network\" option, on the screen that follows, the user can then choose a wired USB connection. C'mon HP, you can do better!All in all, as a hard wired USB printer, scanner, copier, it's decent.  I have no knowledge of its wireless connectivity and use when connected that way.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"183 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671148800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Perfectly Sufficient for My Printing Needs","reviewDescription":"I needed a simple printer for the occasional printing needs and I wanted something as compact as possible.This one gets the job done and has been perfectly sufficient.Set-up was fine.  No issues following the instructions and I don't recall it taking longer than anticipated.I do appreciate the wireless capabilities of this printer.  I routinely print from my phone which is a convenience I didn't anticipate using or needing.  As reliant as I am on my phone, I now find it's more convenient to just print from my cell.  I keep the printer connected to my wifi so I can seamlessly print from either my computer or my phone.I haven't used the scan or copy capabilities yet so I can't speak to those.  It's quiet when printing though.  The noisiest part if when I forget to pull out the paper tray prior to printing and my print falls to the floor.I don't print frequently - a couple of times per month and usually in B&W.  Despite this the ink doesn't seem to last very long.  I've replaced it ~6 times since March 2022.  The print quality is fine with no smudges or smears.  B&W prints appear sharp and color prints seem vibrant enough.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704412800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Outside Of The \"Free\" 6 Months of Ink, It Is GREAT!","reviewDescription":"I took a chance on this printer given it was being sold at a great price, and I finally realized I need a printer.  I actually bought this printer TWICE: once as a wedding gift and for myself.  I don't understand what all the criticism is about: the set up and functionality has not been a problem for myself or the couple I got it for.  If all you need is a printer to print basic documents periodically and scan documents, then this one should fit you perfectly.  The set up is extremely easy, if you follow the directions, and the printer is really easy to use.  I was worried initially given the amount of low reviews, but I'm unsure if that is the printer's fault necessarily (maybe it is, just given my experience this is my conclusion).  The only reason I don't give this a five star is the ink situation...  With the title \"6 Months of Free Ink\", you'd think it would come with the printer, right?  Wrong - You have to sign up for the subscription service they offer, and the printer only comes with enough black\/colored ink for the test print.  Therefore, I recommend buying ink when you buy the printer.  Usually there is a \"bundled together\" section that shows the ink you need for the printer.  Overall though I'm really satisfied!  If you need a simple printer that works, at a good price, then this is a good choice!To update: After a couple months of use\/having this printer, I have not had some of the issues others have commented on (ex. wireless connection issues).  I still recommend 100%!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"403 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687996800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Product arrived very damaged--poor shipping method","reviewDescription":"I ordered this not realizing that the company would take no precautions in packing this printer to be shipped. As soon as I opened the box, there were glass shards everywhere inside. The shards got everywhere when I removed the printer from the box, and upon inspecting the printer, I saw that the pane of glass for the scanner was completely broken (photos included). So, that part of the printer was useless straight out of the box.I believe this happened because the company just slapped the shipping label on the original printer box and sent it out with no further impact protection (photo included). I guess that's just the chance you take when you order something like this online, but I just expected the company to take more care in ensuring the integrity of its product. I was unable to return it within the return window because I'm a college student, and I desperately needed anything that would let me print at home.I rated it two stars because I guess it is capable of completing small print jobs. Setup and wifi connection was easy. I was only able to test it once, and it ran out of ink before it could finish printing all the documents. However, I was trying to print a slideshow, so the ink might've lasted longer if I was just printing plain text. I was also using the original ink that came in the box with the printer, which might've been faulty.I have no way to assess the quality of the scanner, but the HP app seems good. Overall, my experience with this printer has not been good.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670544000000}

I didn't realize I signed up for the instant ink program until I received the ink in the mail. Trying to cancel was a nightmare, I finally got through to a person and cancelled . I tried to print something and my printer would not print, I found out because instant ink was in the printer when I cancelled that also cancelled the ink that was in the printer to print. Another nightmare to get to a representative, they informed me since my instant ink was cancelled so was the ink that was in the printer. If I wanted to print I had to resubscribe to instant ink or go buy new ink somewhere else. I had a full black and full color cartridges in the printer that were useless. I did not resubscribe and bought new ink. Just be aware of this scam they pull on you that they do not tell you about when you subscribe to the instant ink program!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1703894400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Would Return If I Could","reviewDescription":"I have had this printer since June and unfortunately am unable to return it. I have had two Canon printers before this HP and they were great. However,  I wanted to try the HP for the Instant Ink program. I regret my decision. While I have received great help through customer service twice so far, this printer is not easy to fix. I am pretty tech proficient but it doesn't matter with this printer. I have had issues with the printer not connecting to my devices. I learned that the printer has to connect to my phone or computer at 2.4ghz. My devices typically default to 5.0ghz so I have to change this before printing or it will not print and causes more problems. I had issues with my printer not responding last week and when I called to speak with customer service, the representative was very helpful. However, there were multiple steps that we had to go through to get it to work again. I was motivated to write this review today but I have yet another problem with the printer. When I try to print today, it tells me that the printer is in use and will not print any actual documents. I have restarted my computer and the printer. There's no paper jammed in the printer. It's just not working so I feel like I will have to call customer service once again. At least they are helpful and are great at troubleshooting. I just don't like there are so many issues. It does print well, if you can look past the less than user-friendly tech issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661040000000}
