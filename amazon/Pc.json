{"reviewTitle":"Great value, love the simplistic design","reviewDescription":"Very simple and functional yet it has all of the essentials without any of the gimmicky frills. Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal.You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well. What more could you ask for at this price point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"270 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694304000000}

{"reviewTitle":"10\/10","reviewDescription":"I recently purchased the HP Newest 14\" Ultralight Laptop and let me tell you, it has been an absolute game-changer for both my student life and my business needs. As someone who is always on the go, I needed a reliable laptop that could keep up with my busy schedule, and this laptop has exceeded all of my expectations.Let's start with the design - this laptop is sleek, lightweight, and portable, making it perfect for carrying around campus or taking to meetings. The 14\" screen is the perfect size for both work and play, and the Intel Quad-Core N4120 processor ensures that everything runs smoothly and quickly. The 8GB of RAM and 192GB of storage (64GB eMMC + 128GB Micro SD) provide more than enough space for all of my files, photos, and videos.One of my favorite features of this laptop is the 1 Year Office 365 subscription that comes included. Having access to all of the Microsoft Office programs has made it so much easier for me to stay organized and productive. The webcam is great for virtual meetings, and the HDMI, WiFi, and USB-A ports make it easy to connect to external devices and accessories.But what truly sets this laptop apart is its incredible value for the price. I was a bit hesitant at first because of how affordable it is, but I can confidently say that this laptop is worth every penny. The performance and quality are on par with laptops that cost twice as much, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.In conclusion, if you're a student or a business professional in need of a reliable, efficient, and affordable laptop, with amazing battery life, look no further than the HP Newest 14\" Ultralight Laptop. It's a 5-star product that will truly make your life easier and more enjoyable.

All drivers are up-to-date, and still the thing is garbage. Google Meets is a choppy nightmare, running any kind of extra apps or dual monitor in addition makes the thing unusable.Build quality: very poor. It arrived with the keyboard-side plastic surface slightly bulging from the housing. Trackpad stinks, very loud & \"clicky\". Screen is really poor quality. HP bloatware is obnoxious - blows my mind you would add even more performance drag on an already budget POS.Really disappointed in this thing for having so many high ratings.

The keyboard is set unnecessarily high. There doesn\u2019t need to be that much space at the bottom of the keyboard. It\u2019s not ergonomically functional. I am a writer and I frequently lose paragraphs at a time because as I\u2019m typing my palm slides over the touch pad and highlights text. I often find myself wondering what happened to a whole block of text. Obviously clicking the undo button in the middle of a writing project could mean clicking undo 75 times before you find the mistake.2. The screen is way too small for a writer because it is long. That means that your document will only display about 4 inches at a time unless you minimize the text down to about 70%. As a writer, these options are very frustrating.3. I believe this laptop was advertised as a touchscreen, it is not.4. Auto sync- don\u2019t do it unless you really want everything transferred over to your brand new laptop. I have old files that should\u2019ve been deleted from my old computer now on my new computer and I never wanted any of that.

If you're lured to these by an Amazon flash offer, and begin to compare other options\/offers, be sure to throughly compare the descriptions. Or you'll purchase something you didn't want. If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5\/30\/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by \"Deal\" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery.  I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w\/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1\/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying  different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation. It also moved data from broken laptop creating what will be hours of scrubbing to sell at 1\/2 price on Ebay.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"41 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717027200000}

Also, during set up there are a ton of annoying ads to purchase further apps etc.  I just deleted those as they came up, but still annoying.  (I know what I need, I know what basic security comes with the laptop so stop trying to sell me extraneous crap I don't need!!!)  The reason I got this HP is two-fold. First is sale price.  On a budget you can't beat under $300.  I don't stream movies or do gaming.  I just need a basic laptop for bill paying, shopping and emails.  The second is I had to get away from the crappy chrome books I've previously bought.  Found out you cannot add memory to them and the memory runs out quickly even when you delete a bunch of stuff and keep apps to a minimum.  So having a 'regular' laptop is going to be good in the long run if I need to add memory.  If anything wonky happens in the next few weeks I'll be sure to come back and update this review.

Not great for editing pictures or watching videos, but would be fine for other things. I do have to restart it quite often if I\u2019m working on it quite a bit. It starts to slow down and freeze.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"43 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709337600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Disappointed... Slow processing speed","reviewDescription":"Forced to get a new laptop because of audio system incompatibility with new Windows in my last laptop. Pleased with this HP laptop's design and the specs (on paper) especially with the SD card reader. However, extremely disappointed in this whole S mode business, which is a Windows thing not unique to HP, so I had to switch out of it to download apps that I usually use (including MICROSOFT Teams! I don't know why that's not \"safe\" for S mode). Processing speed is very slow, even with only one Internet browser open. I can no longer multitask on Zoom meetings because the audio starts to cut out and lag when I switch windows. I also had a lifetime Microsoft 365 subscription, but I was unable to transfer it to this laptop (again, general Windows issue). Moderately disappointed with this laptop given the positive reviews but I will manage...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724025600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Better check PC before downloading all you files","reviewDescription":"I bought the HP 14\" Stream Ultralight Laptop thinking, it was a good addition to my current desktop HP computer running Windows 11. Setting up the new PC was easy, perhaps too easy. New PC asked for router password which I gave.  PC asked for permission to copy all my files from my old desktop.  I am figuring \u201cwhat the heck\u201d it made set up new PC easy. Big mistake!  You have to understand everything was automatic up this point.  I didn\u2019t get real feel for the laptop. When I finally got around to actually using PC it was BAD.  It picked sometimes without hitting left button (the \u201chover\u201d function was turned on --- I tried to turn off NOPE).  Often, I had to press the left button several times to pick.  Later on, when I hit left button it acted as if I pressed right button. (given a choice number of actions \u201copen new window\u201d etc.). I requested a return and Amazon approved my request.  But here\u2019s the rub: Amazon does not want my personal files on the laptop.  But my new laptop is a clone of old desktop through the connection with THE CLOUD \u2013 anything I do to one of PC is reflected on other PC!  I thought I broke the connection by disabling the laptop access to router NOPE.  When I try to delete a file from laptop, the laptop says \u201ccannot delete file because you are offline\u201d.  Apparently, the new laptop is a good PC, I just happened get this lemon.  I will try to show you the problems on video. I could only upload one video -- I press the left button and PC act like I pressed the right button.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713398400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Bare Minimum","reviewDescription":"I needed a laptop that was inexpensive and lightweight, and decided to give this one a try. It will be light to travel with, which is what I wanted. But it's just okay - nothing spectacular about this laptop. Microsoft doesn't make switching out of S mode easy, so if you plan to use other apps (like Chrome), just know you will probably have challenges. That's no fault of the laptop - just something to know before you purchase. Battery life isn't great, so keep your charger handy. It's a bit slow, but does mostly what I need it to do.... for the price, it's an ok laptop that should be fine for very basic use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718582400000}
