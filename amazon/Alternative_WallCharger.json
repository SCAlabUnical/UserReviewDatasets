{"reviewTitle":"love the outlet!","reviewDescription":"I recently picked up this Surge Protector Outlet Extender with a 5-Outlet Splitter, and it has become an essential component of my home office setup. Gone are the days of choosing which gadgets to charge and when; this power hub handles all my devices simultaneously with absolute ease.First off, the surge protector function gives me peace of mind, knowing my electronics are safeguarded against unexpected power spikes. I appreciate the design, which doesn't block other outlets and even leaves enough room for bulky adapters. It's compact enough not to be an eyesore yet robust enough to handle up to five devices - a perfect balance.The build quality is commendable, with a sturdy casing that feels durable. The outlets are well-spaced, reducing the frustration of larger plugs jostling for room. I also found the plug angle to be particularly thoughtful, allowing for better cable management and a cleaner workspace.One minor caveat, though, is that while it's excellent for most home applications, if you're planning to use all five outlets with devices that have high power demands, you might notice it getting a tad warm. It's nothing to be overly concerned about, but it's worth noting for those looking to power multiple high-draw electronics.Overall, this Surge Protector Outlet Extender with 5-Outlet Splitter is a reliable, well-built choice for anyone looking to expand their power options. It performs admirably, offering both convenience and protection for your devices. A solid four-star addition to any home or office.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699315200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Game changer","reviewDescription":"I absolutely love this USB wall charger surge protector from the moment I plugged it in. As a mom, I have multiple devices that need charging throughout the day and this surge protector has been a lifesaver. With 5 outlets and 2 USB ports, I can easily charge my phone, tablet, and laptop all at the same time. It's a game-changer for our busy household and has eliminated the need for multiple bulky chargers cluttering up our outlets.Not only does this surge protector provide ample charging options, but it also gives me peace of mind knowing that my devices are protected from power surges. I no longer have to worry about damaging my expensive electronics due to electrical fluctuations. The compact size of the surge protector makes it perfect for traveling as well, ensuring that I always have enough outlets to keep all of our devices charged and ready to go.

It is a single multi-purpose 5 AC outlet charger, surge protector with 4 USB ports, and 1 USB C that offers great versatility of use. I've only had it a short time, but I am very pleased so far. The 3-sided design adds additional variability from the typical crowded AC outlet. The design also allows me to insert my USB directly, thus saving valuable space rather than having to utilize the bulky AC connector. There is no downside that I have encountered.

{"reviewTitle":"NEAR perfect solution to getting more plugs!","reviewDescription":"This is a fantastic solution to the age-old issue of not having enough power plugs. It beats the traditional solution of having a power strip which has to lay on the ground and gets in the way, and is unsightly.I especially love the USB ports, and didn't realize how useful it would be to have those available to charge my AirPods, my Google Nest Mini, and my mouse. It's more convenient and useful than I even thought it would be to have those USB ports just always there and always working, unlike your computer USB ports, which power off with sleep\/shutdown.My ONLY complaint with it is that the weight and build of it isn't incredibly confidence-inspiring. Unplugging things from it usually unplugs the device itself if you have to pull it at all, and the overall light weight and feel makes me presume that the electronics inside aren't the most robust. However, there's nothing to indicate to me that it isn't a quality piece of tech, as it's worked well for me for a few months now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1711584000000}

The sockets are very stiff which not only can make it a bit of a pain to plug things in from any direction but straight on, but also results in the entire thing coming out of the wall rather than a single plug. Can't recommend for regular home usage, find one with a screw, something that I THOUGHT this one had and swear the picture showed. Threw away the packing already so I'm unfortunately I'm stuck with this instead of a quality one that has a screw costing a few cents if not a whole secondary plug for both stability and so that all the electricity is more distributed. Especially when running a window AC out of it. I guess it can still be used for travel, or in an area of the house where there isn't any traffic or risk of it being lightly tugged, but I'm still extremely disappointed and do not recommend. Buy a quality extender instead, this one might have been on a deal sale, but it wasn't worth the money.

{"reviewTitle":"Not 1800J only 170J  False advertising","reviewDescription":"I purchased several of these because they were rate 1800 Joules and also bragged they used a Gas Discharge Tube which reacts very quickly to surges, which is something I wanted but rarely see in surge protectors.  Gas Discharge Tubes are expensive and they work better than MOVs.  I was surprised that they could sell so cheap and have such a high joule rating so I was skeptical.  I decided to dissect one of the units once they arrived.  Turns out these are not at all what they claim.The two blue discs you see in the photo are the MOVs (Multi Oxide Varistors).  These are used in all surge protectors and are rated in joules which is how much energy they can dissipate before destroying themselves.  The silver tube between them is what I thought would be the gas discharge tube.  Turns out it is not.I spread the MOVs apart and with a magnifying glass found the part number 14D331K which is an MOV with a rating of only 85 Joules as shown in another photo.  The numbers on the silver tube indicate it is made by AUPO and is part number BF113 and is actually a thermal fuse and NOT a gas discharge tube.  There is a huge difference in how those two components operate.In summary, this product is not even close to what they say in the description.  It is 170 joules and not 1800 joules and does not have the fast acting gas discharge tube they claim.  I will be returning them.Addtam products are also sold under other brand names on Amazon.

Plus, it looks nice ans sturdy.Immediately follow my good impression of the front of the product was \"Seriously, this is bad design.\"  The back side has only one plug, which in my opinion should has two because it covers the entire wall outlets that two outlets.Sure enough, the product strips every time four of the outlets (the extended) were plugged in.  This product extends into five outlets, three USB-A, and one USB-C.  However the back side has only one plug.  If it was divided into two plugs on the back, then it would reduce the current load in the front to prevent it from stripping the surge protector all the time.Now I can't even return this product anymore.  It covers two outlets on my wall and it can only extend it into three outlets in front, so the ratio is 2:3.  You would get one more extra outlet with this product.

So plugging 5 devices into a single outlet is... not wise.2nd on this particular device it appears to me, that the 5 mains power is connected to the step down with these tiny little wires with insulation that is way to small.  I'm pretty sure that wire is intended only for low voltage uses (like Arduinos and LEDs, etc).  Worse they are rubbing up against the back of the solder joints on the USB charging block.Sure, while everything is working fine, the risks are low.  But things break, everything breaks eventually.  Maybe a component fails, or the sharp solder joint being pressed into that tire wire might rub through, or nearly anything else.  In my opinion when this fails it is likely to expose mains voltage to the USB ports and result in melting a device, or likely a fire.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"56 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666051200000}

When I try to plug other things in, however (specifically into the USB outlets), I don\u2019t seem to get the same amount of power, if I get any at all. I get better power by plugging USB chargeable items into my laptop, which is already by my bed and what I was hoping to avoid plugging into anymore by buying this product. Because of this I feel like this outlet doesn\u2019t provide enough power and is therefore relatively useless, as I already had my lamp and laptop plugged into the wall socket that this item now takes up both spaces of to allegedly charge up many other items. When the other charging outputs work, they work fine. They just don\u2019t often work. Doesn\u2019t seem worth it to me, I just bought it cheap on prime day sale.

Depending on how tight the original receptacle is, the process of unplugging any cable could pull the wall charger out of the wall receptacle.

If you want to use the laptop at the same time, chances are it will only hold a charge and will not actually charge the battery.I actually prefer this since I use it to charge the laptop overnight, so time does not matter to me. Plus, this is trickle charging the laptop. Long-term this may help the battery retain its maximum rated energy. Fast charging produces a lot of stress on the battery.

This, to me, is worth considering more, especially when the price is right.  Otherwise, I'd get the alternate\/competitor without a second thought.As an adaptor, it's a really good design.  I needed this to be simple and space efficient with different plugs.  This is used in my kitchen where I plan to use at least one of the USB ports for holiday night light(s), and at least one of the regular plugs for a coffee maker that has it's own plug switch.  So it'll need lots of spacing, but won't be overloaded.  The spacing of the outlets is the key because of the positioning of the USB part sufficiently out of the way. I prefer this style over the competitors as it's a very clean and simple look with no seams or creases on the edges, and matches well with a plain white wall. The problem is, it doesn't attach firmly or securely to the outlet without screw-in support.  I've found others that do, I just don't like their outer, faceplate style as much.As a surge protector, I won't know until it's needed.

One reviewer mentioned it does not fit GFCI outlets. There is warning on the back that states not to use it with GFCI outlets. There is a plastic piece that fits into the lower outlet to help secure it in place, but there is no center bolt. That's unimportant if you have a decora outlet which have not use a center hole for mounting the outlet plate.

A nicer unit allows you screw through the middle into the plug plate, stopping it from falling out of the wall. This unit does NOT have that.

This is a great power outlet that expands AC ports as well as adding extra USB charging ports. It added a ton of functionality and convenience.However, I only give it a 3-star for its One potential caveat, so people in my similar situation can be aware of what may be in store. I had mine plugged in next to my night stand, and 3 months in, I started to notice a high pitch noise coming out of the outlet. It gets louder as more load is connected to the USB portable. I'm blessed with relatively good hearing (I was hope that happened to my vision as well, oh well), and in the middle of night, when all the devices are plugged and ambient is ultra quiet, the noise started to affect my sleep as it get very annoying during quasi-sleep state. I started to disconnect the unit at night and looking for a potential replacement.Overall, I recommend this to anyone who will place the unit far away from where he\/she sleeps.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1626393600000}

Lately I've been getting additional electronics for my aquarium and plants, and they seem to come with either USBs as the plugin or a charger adapter for USB. Since none of my old outlets are designed for USB it's even more frustrating.
