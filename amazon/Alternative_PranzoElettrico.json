{"reviewTitle":"I like my food hot\u2026 not kinda warm..","reviewDescription":"As someone always on the lookout for a reliable solution to keep my lunch warm at work, I initially gravitated toward the HOTLOGIC Electric Lunch Box. It has been a dependable choice with its straightforward warming mechanism, ideal for busy office days.

{"reviewTitle":"HAPPY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY! Last purchased May 22, 2018","reviewDescription":"I decided to write this review because I just took out yet another perfectly heated lunch and realized how much I loved this product and never shared a review. It was sheer coincidence that it's the sixth anniversary of buying this product.With out a doubt, HotLogic is one of our most RELIABLE and often used products we've EVER purchased on Amazon, this little miracle does what it does simply and perfectly, all the time, every time! I almost always bring leftovers with me to work, and the first thing I do when I get to my desk is plug in my HotLogic and zip my plastic lunch container inside. By the time lunch time rolls around I have a perfectly heated meal waiting for me! Yum! I have the mini and fell in love with it so much that I bought my wife the larger one with the included glass container.One thing that bears mentioning that often gets overlooked, is the fact that this works so much better than a microwave! Because this heats with gently from the bottom, your food will heat more evenly and still taste the way you intended it to be; delicious, hot, moist, and uniformly heated. I hated waiting in line at work to share the one messy, smelly microwave, and then have to walk back with my hot food to my office.Also, if you get an inexpensive AC adapter for your vehicle's lighter port, you can have HotLogic heating your meal as you drive. It's great for long car trips, camping, or even the drive-in!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716249600000}

{"reviewTitle":"I am totally in love with these mini ovens! BUT, read the review and know what you're getting.","reviewDescription":"First, I want to mention that it was YEARS ago when I bought my first Hot Logic Mini, and over a half decade later, it's still going strong! Since then, I've bought the \"Family\" size, the expandable bag style, and now this 12VDC version (and a couple backup ones for my camping gear kits).So, on to the details...WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:- This is both a cooking \"bag\" oven and\/or a warming plate, depending on how you use it. Yes, it will COOK food (even frozen food), unlike many of the generic \"warming bags\" out there.- Do NOT use meltable cheap plastics (eg: very cheap plastic bento boxes or \"ziplock\" style freezer\/fridge bags). It does get hot enough to melt them. If you use plastic bento boxes, use high quality ones that aren't warping or bubbling in your microwave or dishwasher.- I suggest any of the high quality glass bento boxes available on Amazon for the best and widest range of cooking and heating.MY REVIEW:I bought one of these over half a decade ago, when I started my first foray into ketogenic dieting. This was back when it was really tough to find low carb meals anywhere. So, I'd prep my meals for a week or two, put them in glass bento boxes, and stick a bunch in the fridge and in the freezer. By \"prep\", I mean, most of the time, the stuff would be raw. I'd take them to work, stick them in the Hot Logic Mini, and plug it in 2-3 hours before lunchtime (depends on what I was eating that day - more on that later). By lunch, I'd have a hot, fully cooked meal!So far, I've found it does a really good job at cooking things like boneless chicken (chicken breasts, chicken thighs, chicken strips, etc), heating or even cooking lasagna (really nice when I make keto lasagna - the only thing I pre-cook is the ground beef so I can drain it), fish (apologies to my coworkers) and even veggies (use the 2 or 3 section glass bento boxes and put the veggies in their own section with a little bit of water for fresh, or as is for frozen, with maybe a little butter and some seasonings).I even found it can cook steak! Yes. You can actually cook totally raw (or even frozen raw) steak in it! The caveats for cooking steak are:(a) it cooks fattier steaks better (more tender)(b) it cooks it to something between a juicy tender stew meat consistency or pressure cooked and braised consistency(c) it leaves lotsa steak juices in the bento box (which helps keep the steak tender till you pull it out.So, while you're not getting a grilled steak out of it (and the steak takes a while to look the right color), what comes out is delicious. As a matter of fact, a bunch of cut up ribeye or chuck\/stew meat in it, with some cut up raw carrots and potatoes, and maybe the tiniest bit of beef broth - plus a few hours to slow cook - and you're going to have a nice beef stew.I've also cooked eggs (scrambled with cheese) in them - that works out ok; something between pan fried and microwaved. It's a great time saver for weekly work food prep.It's hard to burn anything in them, which is nice. The Hot Logics just keep slowly heating the stuff, so, it is a little easier than stove cooking in that respect, that an extra hour won't destroy your food.WHAT I'VE COOKED:I've cooked bag rice (yes, the microwavable bags will survive in them, break up any rice clumps, stick them on their side, and cook for a couple hours), steak, fish, chicken, lasagna, scrambled eggs, veggies (spinach, broccoli, carrots), frozen microwavable dinners of ALL sorts, and much more.IMPROVEMENTS?Not many suggestions for this already near perfect product.- I wish they had a combo unit that was AC and DC selectable, but at the price point and small size, I'm ok if they don't.- They should integrate a velcro tie onto the cable- They should make a double height one (would be nice to put my meats on the bottom and my veggies in a glass bento box on top). I do understand why they probably won't though, because sadly I think it would confuse people who tried cooking a steak or chicken on top of something else.All in all, I now own 4 of these (was five, gave one away):- my original one, which I still use to this day- one spare for when I go on camping adventures (it only draws 40w, so, I plug it into my car's 100w inverter)- one family- one DC version (I have a Renogy battery bank that I can use to cook in tent)- one expandable one (has an expandable storage bag built onto it).I gave away the spare and moved the original into my car where it almost permanently stays, and use the expandable for work, so I can put silverware and such in the top. The DC version just came in a week ago, and will be migrating into my camping pack.NOTES:When you buy one, you will get a link to info on recipes - or you can visit their site yourself and find tons of recipes of food you can actually *COOK* in these.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"173 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696723200000}

{"reviewTitle":"I've used one so much I had to buy another one.","reviewDescription":"I use this just about everyday for various meals. From frozen meals to warming up pizza to even quick quesadillas. One thing I've managed to work around is plastic baggies or plastic containers. I use them all the time for different meals and what keeps the plastic from melting is putting a paper towel on the warming plate and then the baggie\/container on the towel. If you're heating up a warm sandwich, pizza, anything with bread; by occasionally flipping it over, it'll keep the bread\/pizza from getting too hard to eat. If you're warming something up but don't want it too soggy, keep one side of the bag unzipped. That will air out the steam and your food won't be too soggy\/wet. For quick quesadillas, just a tortilla and cheese. Clean off the warming plate and place a flour tortilla directly on the plate. Flip it over a couple of times and once the tortilla is hot enough, add cheese and fold the tortilla closed. This makes it less of a mess than if you're doing a two tortilla quesadilla. You can actually add more to the quesadilla as well. I actually cook eggs with this warmer as well as warm up frozen sausage links or patties. Once the eggs and sausage are ready, add that to the quick quesadilla and you've got a breakfast quesadilla. Or even make burritos. I cook my eggs in foil cupcake tins, just spray them with some cooking spray. It's makes for great Sausage and Egg muffins too, like at McDonalds. I even make cheeseburgers but I buy the pre-cooked burger patties and warm them up, add sliced cheese and whatever else you want and put that on a burger bun and you've got a cheeseburger. I like to keep things simple but tasty. I don't always like depending on frozen meals so being able get easy ingredients and make something in this is great. Easy clean up too.

{"reviewTitle":"Such a great purchase.","reviewDescription":"I bought this almost a year ago in the early part of the pandemic so I could avoid touching a bunch of surfaces in the breakroom. I have never been a fan of the communal microwave (I am a manager at a grocery store and some of the people I work with are pretty gross) but covid added a new layer of terror, and this lunchbox was a great way to deal with this.A few months later I changed positions to an admin\/HR\/bookkeeper role where it\u2019s very hard to leave my little office and clock out for lunch. Someone always needs me for something or other and I have conference calls, interviews and new hires to deal with all day long. So, I decided to put this to work in a different way. My only outlets are under the desk so I plugged in one of those Christmas tree floor switches that you tap with your foot and I leave my Hot Logic plugged into that.Every day when I get there at 5 or 6am I bring in a small breakfast from home (sometimes a homemade foil-wrapped burrito, sometimes a frozen breakfast sandwich with its original plastic wrapper\u2026) and drop it in my Hot Logic and tap it on with the foot switch. My food will be perfectly cooked whenever I can find a moment to eat an hour or three later. Then sometimes I will buy a sandwich or some cold chicken nuggets from the deli or a frozen meal from grocery and drop it in there to nosh on for lunch. It\u2019s so handy to have my meal ready to go so I can eat anytime I have a spare moment between appointments.Also, this little lunch box works great to cook just about anything. It has never melted any plastic wrappers or boxes but somehow manages to crisp up the crust sometimes. The food is never rubbery or dried out like it gets in a microwave.My only major qualm is that the durability kind of worries me; for one thing, the little cord keeper on the side has already started coming unsewn. I hope that keeping it in my office and not actually carrying food in it will save it from wear and tear so that won\u2019t be a problem. Like others have mentioned I do wish there was some sort of LED on this too because I\u2019ve forgotten my food in there once or twice but I have ADHD and visual reminders are really helpful for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1624060800000}

{"reviewTitle":"If you take leftovers to work, you need this.","reviewDescription":"Let me start off by saying that I use this with a container that fits perfectly inside.  The description for this container on amazon is: Pyrex Storage 6-Cup Rectangular Dish with Dark Blue Plastic Cover.  It took me a while to figure out exactly what container to use so I want to save people some time.  This container costs $6.55 on amazon at the time of my purchase.  Don't waste your money on the one with the ventilated lid, that's only useful for microwaving and costs more than double.  This oven will not pressurize the inside of your container.  Microwaves are horrible about that because they heat the water very aggressively so that some of it is boiling even when your food is cold in the middle.I plug this thing in when I get to work at 8:30am and when I eat lunch sometime after 11:00am the food is perfect.  I was concerned at first that this might overcook my food leaving it in there so long but it does not.  Today I had leftover steak, It was the ultimate test because it was one of the best I have ever cooked and the microwave I was using before always ruined steak.  It was outstanding.  You can leave your food in this thing for a long time and it will be fine.  If you are a few hours late to lunch no big deal, it will still be better than microwaving.  The secret is that it cooks your food in a sealed container with very good temperature control, trapping the moisture and odor inside.  Since it cooks gently and from the bottom you do not need to worry about your plastic lid.  The lid just doesn't get that hot.I have access to a microwave at work and I never have to wait for it, that being said, I will never use it again.  Frozen meals are excellent in this unit as well, the difference between this and a microwave is even more obvious with frozen food.In case anyone is curious about it, I did some research and found that the power consumption for the HotLogic Mini is 45 watts.  That's 0.375 amps at 120 volts.  Taking into account the efficiency loss of using an inverter, you could run 4 of these off of a standard 20 amp 12 Volt socket in a car.  I have never tested this but the math works out.Update:It's been a while and both of my units are still working perfectly.  I have been using the one I keep at work every day and I will never go back to microwaving.  Since my food is so much better now, I bring my lunch much more consistently and the savings are adding up.  When my lunch break starts I get to sit down and start eating right away, It blows my mind that my co workers can see how good this thing is and yet they still use the microwave to destroy their food.  I paid $30 each for mine and it's possible the best money I've ever spent.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1403827200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Okay sort of","reviewDescription":"Its a good idea. It works for me because it keeps food warm for hours. And the food taste much better than getting nuked in the microwave. My complaints are as follows - Food gets soggy. Since all of the food is effectively in the same oven (sealed dish) it all gets cooked at the same temperature. The heating plate somehow senses when the food inside needs to be cooked and it cooks for a period of time before reducing temperature to hold at warm. There is no way for it to know that some food should be cooked shorter and some longer and it would not matter anyways since there is only one heating element and one dish. The end result is as the manufacturer claims - the food will never be overcooked - but that depends on your definition of overcook (like asking Slick-Willy-Clinton what the definition of \"is\" is. Rarely will food ever dry out (sweet potatoes will if you leave them in there for 10 hours by themselves.) But once the cooking is complete the temperature lowers to keep the food warm indefinitely but all of that moisture in the sealed dish will cause vegetables to become soggy, and meats to become more and more tender. So really meat and fish can remain in for 10 hours and they are fine. Vegetables will be soggy after just a few hours depending on the type of vegetable. I purchased two of these ovens and they are plugged in 10 hours\/day. The meat and fish are plug and play and I can eat from them whenever I want, though they do become more and more tender and will fall apart easier as they day goes on. The vegetables need more attention and are best only left in there 2-3 hours and then replenished for the next meal, otherwise they will become wilted and soggy. Cooking vegetables like brussel sprouts is confusing - they can be in there for 8 hours and be barely tender enough to eat, yet after just two hours they are wilted and \"grey\" looking inside and out. Peas will wilt. Broccoli will wilt very quickly. Red peppers if not eaten in three hours will turn to mush. A little disappointing. My second complaint is the heating process - the manufacturer recommends keeping food in contact with the bottom of the bowl. This limits the usefulness of the oven. The manufacturer recommends a 6-cup pyrex container. If you limit the food to the amount that can touch the bottom of the container than you really cant carry that much food. Apparently the food gets cooked thru the surface to surface contact on the bottom. Any food not actually making contact with the bottom will get cooked but takes significantly longer. I pre-cook all meat so if I layer a second layer of meat, it will get heated properly just takes longer than the bottom later and not as hot. If I layer a second layer of raw vegetables, the cooking takes much much longer for the top layer since only the bottom layer will really \"cook.\" And does that second level actually cook or do they just get soggy? Maybe a little of both. One last comment - because of the heating technology used which admittedly I really don't understand, once the dish is opened and food removed, the food taken from the bottom of the dish is really really hot, but it gets cold really really fast. So if you insist on a hot meal like I do be prepared to eat fast otherwise you'll be making trips to the microwave. As i said earlier, its a good idea.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1445644800000}

The first container was just like a Had a full amount of food in it and when I warm it. I thought it took like 30 to 40 minutes. No, it took 2 hours and 2 minutes to warm up the food in a good hot temperature tested it with a second container I used a small one with a decent amount of foods. Warm it up that took 1 hour and 35 minutes In the last third container was a glass container and after I tested that that took over 3 hours to warm up the food It works don't get me wrong. But the biggest con with this product is that it is way too time consuming, especially that's those that's on a Go like at work or something. So I personally do not recommend this product at all. If you're someone, that's needs to bring a lunch to work.  And there's a no microwave or something.And you gonna use this, don't use it. It takes like hours to warm up your food By the time your food is warm up enough your break is over.

The first one, I plugged in at 8:00 A.M. and checked it at 11:00 A.M.. I opened the zippered bag a saw the contents of the dinner rapidly boiling and the plastic film bulging out. The temperature on my laser thermometer read 215 deg. F on the package film covering. The contents were overcooked, unrecognizable and inedible. I tried a second dinner and timed it for only two hours with pretty much the same results. The problem with this particular unit is that it had no temperature regulation and would not maintain a constant temperature (like a slow cooker). Did I get a defective unit? I was surprised, because most of the one star reviews were because the unit didn't get hot enough or just stopped working.I think that the HotLogic is a great idea having serious flaws that need correcting. $40.00 is too much money for a cheap zippered lunch bag with an unregulated temperature \"hot plate.\" I expected nothing of the HotLogic except a warm meal after a few hours, but it just couldn't deliver.

A frozen solid lasagna requires for me to plug it in as soon as I get to the office, but then it comes out really good.  Rice with some chicken, veggies, and spices requires me to set an alarm on my phone to remind me to plug it in about an hour or two before lunch.

I take this to work with me and to workshops!!! No more using nasty community microwaves or standing in line for the microwave!! I love this item!!Saves me money and keeps me away from the nasty microwave and nasty cafeteria! I was so tired of the long lines and attitudes at the community work microwave!!! I was tired of the nasty cafeteria food and wanted a way to heat my food instead of always taking sandwiches as an alternative! I saw this mini portable oven when it was around $39.00. Which has already paid for itself at first I thought the price was too high.The straw that broke me down was when I was in a workshop and the one micro wave that was there went out after a person had used it and left me having to eat cold food!!! I said never again, as soon as I made it home I ordered this and the on the go cereal bowl and salad unit! Working for someone else is hard as it is!!! So I said never again will I be in a position that I have to eat cold food or use a nasty micro wave that is unhealthy!!! Or pay for nasty food, that may not have even been prepared correctly!So far this unit has paid for its self, I have ate chicken, and rice, spaghetti, soups, sausage green bean potatoes, and many more! I cook in my bigger crock pots so dinner is done when I arrive home, so I take a portion of that meal and place it in the glass Pyrex ware for my lunch for the next day and what a pleasant treat for me knowing I have healthy food warming and in a clean unit!!!Someone told me that it smelled good in my work space I just said thanks because I did not want them running and telling, you know how some people can mess things up for others. (Yes, that is the type of work environment I currently have) So this unit makes my day pleasant knowing I have a great lunch waiting for me!!!I am so happy with this unit that I plan to purchase an adapter for our suv so that if I need to heat food up in the suv I can if I am out in workshops and there are no plugs etc (things do happen).I highly recommend this unit! For me it blesses my day because it gives me more time to also read my bible during my lunch instead of waiting in line to purchase food or heat my food. I make sure I always have something to heat in my portable oven even if it is just a can of soup! I refuse to go back to the micro wave or cafeteria!I don't have to stand in line any or more or watch the attitudes of people waiting for the microwave or using the microwave. I am grateful, for my current environment, just speaking on how much of a blessing this unit has been for me!Peace of mind!!!!

To be fair, I purchased this several years ago, but also to be fair, it seen literally less than 5 uses in that whole time and the seam on the bag has a hole in it. My original intention for this was to send lunch to work with my fiancee, who is in his truck all day. Unfortunately, he didn't think it was nearly as good of an idea as I did, and so it sat in its box, totally unused, for almost 2 years until I remembered I had it, and it was too late to send it back.I used it once on a vacation where I knew I would be getting an insanely large steak dinner (go to Jocko's, if you're ever in the San Luis Obispo area!) and was staying in a place without a microwave. I used it 3 times when my mom had an accident and wanted hot food pre-prepared for her so she didn't have to hobble around the house. And just this last week, I used it once to bring my food to work for lunch.So, yeah. That's not a lot of uses, and definitely not a lot of zipping and unzipping, and really, it was only 4 times because on the 5th time is when I saw the hole. Nothing very heavy has ever been held inside, and it was only held by the handle those few times it was used. For $40, I would've hoped that the bag would be more durable than it has proven to be.

The food container inside was also a good quality reusable food container one would reasonably pack daily lunch in with flaps to seal it.The item I received was absolutely poo. It's the thickness and sturdiness of a free throwaway lunchbox you'd get as a promotional item. I would never pay more than a dollar or 2 for a lunchbox so cheap. I wouldn't even be comfortable washing the inside for fear it'd fall apart.The heating element is the only thing that feels sturdy but after seeing the quality and \"care\" of the rest of this item, I don't trust it to last.Lastly, they have the nerve and disrespect to include a **disposable** takeaway container as a \"free gift\".

Once the container of food reached the desired temperature, the oven cannot be turned down to prevent the food from overcooked.

{"reviewTitle":"Pretty happy with it. Here's what I've discovered...","reviewDescription":"Overall, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. I chose to go with this brand because of the extensive online reviews everywhere and a \"feeling\" this may be a better choice than the cheaper brands and perhaps not cause a fire when it's out of sight. Basically it does what it says so I won't waste time going into everything already covered elsewhere.Here's what I've discovered that new buyers MIGHT find helpful. The obvious question... How do I know how long to heat my frozen entree when I'm just starting out?Answer: Look at the microwave instructions! Assume the average microwave is 1100 watts and then multiply the time by 27. Why 27??? Because 1100\/40 watts is 27.5... Meaning it will take the 40 watt heating element 27 times longer to consume the same amount of energy as the microwave. So if your entree says microwave it for 3 minutes... try about 80 minutes (or less to be safe).Is this fool proof??? Absolutely not, it's called a rule of thumb and you can adjust it from there as you gain experience. No 2 foods will reheat the same but at least the frozen entree people gave us a clue as to how much energy they think we should pump into their creation to bring it back to life.Does it work for refrigerated leftovers, you ask??? Sure, except YOU must come up with a microwave time and power setting YOU would normally use to reheat leftovers. 3 mins at 50% power???50% power = (1100\/2) = 550550\/40 = 13.75x 3 mins you'd normally reheat= 41.25 mins in the miniThere're multiple ways to do the math. Just imagine you're throwing watts into a bowl for a certain period of time and then ask yourself how many minutes it would take if you only throw 40 watts per minute into the bowl instead of 1100.I hope that's not too confusing and that someone is helped by it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"179 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1606521600000}

I so much wanted to love this item, but I don't. I have tried on several occasions to heat frozen meals in the car and was unsuccessful at all attempts. It takes FAR longer than 2 hours for food to even get warm, let alone hot. I have both types of oven--AC and 12V. I've plugged the one directly into the AC charger in the car and the other I've plugged into a 120V inverter (w\/480W capacity), but neither of them worked well. So far, REALLY, REALLY disappointed. I say \"so far\" because I've only tried them while idling the engine (yes, for HOURS at a time). I'm going on another 5+ hour road trip in a week and I'm going to test them while driving to see if that makes a difference (although I can't imagine how or why it would, but we'll see), then update this review to confirm or change my rating.*** UPDATE ***First, since this thing doesn't come w\/precise instruction, you have to figure it out. I found out that it works best if you PREHEAT IT, just like a a regular oven. All that requires is plugging it in for about 20mins and it gets quite warm. Second, it still takes more than an hour for frozen foods, but for things like RediRice or canned goods it works fairly well (about 40 mins including preheat). While those foods feel really hot in the package, it tends to be just really warm, certainly edible. I've also heated plastic bottles of water for instant coffee; again, feels hot, but just really warm. And I make popcorn! After preheating, I put a bag in and it starts to pop after about 5 mins. After another 5 mins, I unzip the oven and continue to cook until the bag is fully expanded. \ud83d\ude0a","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1584316800000}

We had just started minivan stealth camping and needed a low wattage cooking appliance to complement our existing our 550 Watt portable power station and mini fridge. Since we were planning on eating out each day we only needed something to heat up any leftovers. The Hot Logi Mini, with its ability to take a standard 1.5 Quart square Pyrex Dish met this need perfectly. It performed exactly as advertised. Plugged in it used only 50 Watts. The only inconvenience is having to remember to load and plug in the Hot Logic Mini at least 2 hours in advance of your planned meal. So we'd load and plug in the Hot Logic Mini right after breakfast so that it could heat the food while were on the road. By lunchtime the food would always be piping hot. We've upgraded to a larger power station and bought a butane stove in preparation for our next road trip.

I work in construction and i dont always have time or most of the time i cant afford to stop my work and find a place to get lunch. I have deadlines i must meet. So its best ti bring your lunch. Its always better to bring a meal from home thats warm and ready to go. Its small, doesnt take up alot of space and really does heat up food when you want to break for lunch. Have said that though you do have to give it time to warm up your food. I usaually plug it in as soon as i can before 9 am and my lunch is ready by 11 am or whenever its an appropriate time to have lunch. It warks really well with caned soups. I also suggest that you thaw out frizen dinners at home before you decide to use it otherwise youll wait awhile before its done, but it will get done! I do recommend that you also get the glass pyrex container thats for this warmer. It works better in my opinion heating your food evenly and thoroughly because it will heat up the glass.Since i did buy this warmer last year i bought it when this unit was $9.99 and now its at $39.99!!! so that is my reason for giving it 4 stars and not 5. Supply and demand i suppose... It has held up well and easy to clean but the price has gone up unfortunately but It is the smallest unit you can buy and WILL WORK!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1485043200000}
{"reviewTitle":"So far so good","reviewDescription":"Its a hotplate in a laminated tote made out of cloth, it works pretty good but takes awhile to heat up food, if ur foods cold its going to take a hour to dethaw and another hour to cook. It only reaches a certain temperature so u could even touch the service of the hotplate if u wanted and sadly the hotplate is made of plastic not metal, thats how they use plastic and the compatibility for on the go. It has no gauge to control temp just reset low heat. If anything get a hotplate for cheaper with more temperature control with a pyrex bowl and call it a day. This works since i bought it already but i live in my truck and only use 100ah.

This thing is the greatest thing I've ever bought for work. It doesn't burn food if you forget about it for a while.  I use glass container or plastic with no issue. Takes 1 to 2 hours to heat food up.  Any driver or someone who doesn't have access to microwave needs this. I've recommended it to guys at work.  If it broke today I'd buy another one immediately. Tip- watch the price,  it goes up and down from 30 to 40 bucks.  Buy it at 30.*update*After 8 months of near daily use, it has stopped working.  True to what I said in my original review,  I immediately purchased another one. This time though, i bought it from the hotlogic website directly so i could get the one year warrantyUpdate 2: I bought another one and it broke after two months. The others I bought lasted at least a year. Just past the return date. Should have taken my own advice and bought directly from hotlogic website.

Being able to have hot food on the road is awesome. It actually gets hot enough that I have to unplug it and let the food cool down for a bit.  I also found that the Rubbermaid long, low profile take alongs fit perfect inside. It's more durable than the container that comes with the product.That being said, the only issue I have with the product is the pocket for holding the cord. When you first unbox the oven, the cord is shoved in that pocket. But as I used it on a daily basis, folding and stuffing the cord back into the pocket for transport started to tear the lower stitching of the pocket. After about a month I started noticing a tear probably a 1\/2 inch long. Now it is about two inches.It's really unfortunate this happens. I feel like the problem could be fixed with a reinforced stitching on the pocket to withstand the frequent in and out of the cord.But after all that, I would probably buy another one in the future. I would also recommend it to others with the caution that the pocket will probably tear.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1603152000000}

I like that the heating plate is removable so that you can rinse it out if you spill something which does happen occasionally when containers are not sealed properly.  A couple of things I wish they had done when designing would be to make it a bit larger and to have a zippered pocket on the outside for adding condiments, spoon, fork, etc. but depending on the size of your dish, you can probably just put them inside with your dish.

Okay I figured, not as quick as a microwave, but it promises a better quality meal, so............I put the refrigerated spaghetti in the provided prep container, closed the top and placed it in the cooker, and zipped it shut. I plugged it in at 5:22 pm. I eagerly awaited the results. I did get hung up on doing something else so I didn't get to open it at the 40 minute mark. It wasn't until 6:11 pm I got to open it. It really hadn't done anything at all. You could feel warmth on the bottom of the container, but most of it was still cold after 50 minutes.So, does it work? I'm not so sure about that. I stopped my test and got something else to eat. It may have eventually worked. But come on...... it may have taken another 30 minutes at least. And that was refrigerated, not frozen!

{"reviewTitle":"My grown up lunch box!","reviewDescription":"I have owned a Hot Logic Mini for six or seven years.  Initially, I purchased it for camping and potluck dishes where I might need to provide my own heat to keep the dish warm.In the last couple of years, I have come to rely on this as my lunch box when I work.  I absolutely love that I can meal prep lunches ahead of time and have anything from fish to soup in this little gem.  I can plug it in somewhere in a quiet corner out of the way when I arrive at work and then 2-3 hours later when it's my lunch break, I have a hot lunch waiting for me without needing to find a microwave oven or stove.  Absolutely no cooking food aromas can be smelled until I uncover my casserole dish when it's time to eat.Often my coworkers stop by to check and see what's on the lunch menu for the day.  I am frequently told I have the most appetizing lunches around.  One of my favorites is cheese ravioli with sauce.  I start with frozen, uncooked ravioli then add a little sauce to the bottom of my dish (so that the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom of the dish), arrange my ravioli  on top of that, and top with more sauce and a handful of mozzarella cheese.  Delicious!I prefer using glass\/pyrex-type baking dishes in the Hot Logic.  The Pyrex brand six-cup is a perfect fit as is the six-cup Snapware brand.  However I do prefer the Razab 6.5 cup with locking lids the best.  They are less expensive, completely leak-proof and also a perfect fit for the Hot Logic Mini.  (https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/dp\/B081PBY1CR?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)One can heat ready-to-eat frozen meals still sealed inside the cardboard container without risk of anything burning.  A person can use any flat-base dish for eating and cooking, including paper plates or bowls, aluminum foil, aluminum pans, plastic, glass, heavy-duty freezer bags, and even restaurant carry-out containers.  A person can also cook food from raw, as it functions much like a slow cooker.  It has more difficulty with root vegetables (potatoes, carrots, turnips), and it will not sear or crisp edges on meat.  It doesn't do well rice or pasta either, so when I do these, I pre-cook to al dente.

You can make a cup of tea with it, but using average-cold tap water it's going to take between 30 to 45 minutes when heating one cup (I zipped the cover over the cup while heating).

So much water still on top of these eggs, maybe because of the condensation from the sealed container (required). Just had to finish frying it up in the cast iron. The spices had not taken to add flavor either. I also made a balsamic\/onion pork chop (from raw) and apples\/carrots with ginger and cinnamon in there. The apples were mushy, the carrots underdone and the pork chewy. So, heat up your soup or stew in there, but nothing fancy going on here.

When I DON\u2019T want food heated quickly, I just leave the cover unzipped and flipped back.  And, if you have an item that\u2019s too large to fit inside the pouch, you can take the heating tray out of the pouch and simply place the item on the tray.

{"reviewTitle":"Life just got a little nicer...","reviewDescription":"As mentioned in other reviews, this food warmer is really just a hotplate in an insulated bag.At first glance the Hot Logic Mini doesn't seem to be very special. However, upon closer inspection (and use) it is apparent that Hot Logic has put a lot of thought into this product and the intended use and has produced a very well-made and useful product.Plus, after much research I can't find any other product out there that comes close to matching the features and versatility of this portable food warmer. Before I get into my (long winded) review here are some specs on this unit.Specs:o 1 shelf with Smart Shelf Technology (cycles off and on maintaining optimal food temp.)o Nylon case available in four colors: Black, Blue, Green, Orangeo Exterior dimension 10\"W X 8\"L X 3.5\"Ho Can accommodate food containers up to 8.75\"W x 6.75\"L x 2.5\"Ho Plugs into a 110v standard wall outleto Heats food to a max of 212 degreeso Consumes 42 Wattso Weighs 1 lb. 4 oz.o Electric Cord is 48\" longo UL CSA Certifiedo 1 Year WarrantyI travel a lot for work, mostly by car, and after years of fast food (mostly unhealthy, expensive, time consuming, and often served from unsanitary establishments) I started looking for something to take with me on the road other than a cooler with a cold sandwich.After looking at all of the available items out there I fortunately settled on the Hot Logic Mini.After receiving the Hot Logic Mini the first thing I noticed was that it is a quality made product. The attractive double zippered nylon case opens and closes easily and the 48\" electric cord is long enough for my needs. (Note: The cord can be folded and stored in the pocket in the back of the case.)Eager to try it out I simply dumped some chili in one of my many Pyrex glass containers (I prefer glass containers.), snapped on the container lid, zippered the Hot Logic Min shut, and plugged it in. 45 minutes later, I had piping hot chili. Of course your result will vary depending on starting food temperature, portion size, container size, etc.Note: You can use most any appropriately sized flat bottomed container (with tight cover) as the maximum heating\/cooking temperature will not reach over 212 degrees. (The warming plate will cycle off and on maintain a maximum temperature of 212 degrees.)  At this temperature food will be kept well above the recommended 135 to 165 degrees for food safety, but not hot enough to burn your food or container.After use, you simply have to wash the container you used. (Much easier than some of the warming products where the container is built in or requires that you buy disposable liners.)I did read a few non-positives about this product such as it not having an on\/off switch. However, I am ok with that as a switch would add bulk and is just one more thing that could break. However, if you are using this at an office and have to crawl underneath your desk to reach an outlet, you might think about getting an extension cord with a switch or at least one placed so you can easily plug and unplug this warmer.Also, this unit only runs on 110v AC (household current), however this is not a big dealer to me either as it is only pulling 42 Watts and even the cheapest DC to AC inverter should be able to handle that. Plus, many new cars come with an AC outlet built in.Bottom line I am very happy with this purchase. I can heat up (or cook)food as I drive down the road and pull over under a shady tree and have a nice hot lunch (and a nap afterwards). When I get to a hotel I can keep it in the room to heat up leftovers or food I buy from the market. I'll also use it at home to heat up (and possibly cook)food as it uses a lot less electricity than my oven or microwave. Plus, I don't have to plan my meal times perfectly as the Hot Logic Mini will keep my hot food at the right temperature for hours.I hope this review helps!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1404432000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Worth Every Bit","reviewDescription":"This has made ALL THE DIFFERENCE! Be advised, not all recipes or left-overs will work so effortlessly well. I cannot report that I have found any of those. I suspect there are only a few things. But I have merely started to empower myself with such a risk-free hot meal at all times, that I can capture the moment to do so at work. Firstly, I have tried successfully to provide myself with ready hot meals with the Crock-Pot lunch warmer. It works well. However, being restricted to the proprietary container, leaves too much narrowness to the equation for any absolute satisfaction, because of singularly limited dining containers. Now, for the HotLogic warmer, I can have my own meal warmed and held in a container compatible to my choice (Glass-Lock) to deliver to me an instantly gratifying hot lunch in my work environment to satisfy any stickler for individualistic superiority. All the other lunch-minions scurry for some mucked-up public microwave to scald and scorch and boil their miserable leftovers or plastic, industrial, MSG ridden, convenience poison, waiting in line for the scarce minutes to sit down to their reluctant pseudo-nutrition. I merely remove my container from the HotLogic pack and open it on my elegant place mat and sink my personal tableware into some succulent entr\u00e9, lifting it to my waiting pallet to indulge in the anticipated culinary delight (choose your own verbiage). With just the right added ingredients, I can make a plain-Jane substance turn into the reason to go to work. Maybe my imagination has gotten the best of me, but my imagination has been inspired by this HotLogic Personal Oven (lunch warmer) to ready myself for tomorrow. Like some obsessive competition, I look forward to making someone break the ice and ask me about this rig. I merely go about my business as if the mechanics of fixing a superior lunch for myself is far better than marching off to some Greasy-Spoon, Blue-Plate-Special. Well, it is!Okay. Now to review this product. I have become so personally enthusiastic about the success of my initial use of the HotLogic Personal Portable Oven that I can make this comment. The potential is clear to me and the failure is impossible. In just one week, five work days, I have become the greatest advocate in my living room. Not bad for an introvert! So, I tried to sabotage my experience. Can you imagine anything worse than to put cooked Japanese Black Rice in the refrigerated container. Three days later I open a can of salmon, pick the bones and soft skins, throw in some fresh asparagus cuts with a little butter, teriyaki glaze, dehydrated garlic and onion and closed it up, thinking I might have made a mistake. My hypothesis was pointed towards disaster, however, even though I still expected the worst, that the salmon would stink the break-room, that was my only mistake. Surprisingly, I sat down to a tasty dish, even for canned fish, and delighted in not having made a mistake at all. I have turned cheap cake with a dollop of cream cheese, frozen berries and white chocolate chips, into a tasty warm desert to round off my private dinner. There is no way I would wait to pay top-dollar for such excellent results. The thing is that I merely placed the ingredients in the container, sealed it up and packed it for the next day or two in the fridge. Then I plucked it to carry to work and placed it in the HotLogic first thing, forgetting it. Lunch could be at any time several or few hour later. When that time came, I merely unzipped the enclosure, as the containers were held at table-hot temperatures perfectly and suspended in time, and placed my succulent nourishment before my salivating anticipation. I even tried a portion of buttered bread folded in foil and received a tender accompaniment to my feast. This is better than a cold bento box. Why should I call in reservations at the Angus Barn? I just entertain the imagination a little, mainly because that imagination is inspired by the readiness of a perfect hot meal all because of this HotLogic. Don't take my word for it. Just DO IT! I am now a member of the clean lunch plate club.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1396310400000}

{"reviewTitle":"The Closest To A Wife","reviewDescription":"The first issue that I want to cover is something that made me drop my jaw when I read it more than once in the reviews: This Portable Oven IS NOT Intended To Cook Food!Geeez... guys... no! You first prepare a meal and cook it. Then, a portion of that \"already cooked food\" may go in an appropriate container. Later, you place that container inside the 'Hot Logic Mini Portable Oven,' set the timer to be on for 2 [two] hours, plug it in a live outlet, and walk away. When you come back, the oven has done a good job to bring food to the right temperature.This is my schedule:1.- In the evening, I prepare and cook a meal. After it cools off, I place it in a container and in the refrigerator. As a personal preference, I added two [2] tablespoonfuls of healthy Olive Oil and I sprinkle the entire meal with Herbs de Provence from France. Both ingredients are available at Amazon.2.- After I have breakfast the following morning, I place the container inside the 'Hot Logic Mini Portable Oven,' set a timer to turn on two [2] hours before I get back home, and I walk out the door. When I come back home from work, I go straight to another healthy meal which is at the right temperature.Assuming normal ambient temperature, I estimate that 12 to 14 ounces of food reach a sensible temperature to eat in two [2] hours. Longer than two [2] hours may expose nutrients to heat for too long.This 'Hot Logic Mini Portable Oven' has been a hero to me. I stopped relying on unhealthy ~and costly~ breakfasts at fast-food restaurants, I get much more satisfied with food Mother Nature provides which keeps me healthy.I already concluded that this 'Hot Logic Mini Portable Oven' is the closest a single guy can get to a wife.

It will overcook and ruin your food.That all being said, if you can plan your reheating time accordingly, reheated dishes out of this taste worlds better than microwaved leftovers.

On pizza fundraiser day I put my sad little slices of gluten-free pizza that have been out of the oven for 45 minutes straight onto the hot plate for 15-20 minutes until they are crispy just getting melty and appetizing again. No time for packing a lunch? I have shelf-stable Indian packets in my desk and just throw an unopened one in for an hour or two.

Check food temperature before eating!","reviewDescription":"For frozen pre-packaged meals to be safe, they must be heated throughout to a min of 165F\/74C for a period of several minutes. I've had mixed results with the HOTLOGIC Warming Tote. A rectangular foil or 'microwave safe' plastic container that covers most of the warming element in the Tote works best, but after a min of 2 hours in the Tote, my meals have varied from 150F\/65C to 180F\/82C. Most of the time the temperature has been below the safety threshold. Oddly, refrigerated left-overs have heated to a lower temperature than frozen meals! I have access to a microwave that can bring my food to the correct temp, but what is the point of using this Warming Tote if a microwave is still necessary?I really WANT to like this Tote. A friend raved about it, and when office access to microwaves was limited by the pandemic, it seemed like a fantastic find.

I work in the transportation industry where a hot meal isnt always practical. But this changed everything!!! I probably turned 20 people onto this little gem . However just last week it stopped working. So while i do feel i got my monies worth out of the item.... I just cant give it five stars as I would have like it to last a little longer.Also here are some of the best ways I have come to use this container wise....Dollar tree -- Three individual foil containers for a buck. Good but you have to be carefull of steam as they so not seal 100%.Glass pyrex -- Ok but very heavy. This is a hugh minus... If you are not returning home everyday. Also the lid will pop off slightly if you heat for a while.The Best option by FAR!!!!IKEA ceramic\/plastic container with a lid that has pressure release built in. This was awesome it was a little bigger than the pyrex so you kind of have to pull the corners around the container but it works flawlessly.

It\u2019s a game changer when there are a lot of orders and traffic is bad, or I messed up and took that GrubHub order and it didn\u2019t come close to where I thought it was going, adding heat ensures the customer gets hot food without adding enough heat to change the cooking levels. Five stars so far, it works well so fsr.UPDATED 04\/07\/23I\u2019ve found that when I start my deliveries I plug this in gaily l to the multi cigarette lighter adapter I use, and open the insulated bag of this lunchbox fully, I can insert the entire thing into my 3 year old small DD bag that\u2019s looking ratty on the outside, but the foil insulation inside is still perfect. This allows the foil inside the old DD bag to heat up, and it can\u2019t contain all the the heat, so rather than having a single hot spot that\u2019s 8 x 10 or so, it spreads the heat evenly throughout the catering bag after these two bags go inside of the catering bag to keep it ALL warm. I\u2019m thinking about cutting the bottom of the old DD bag out to allow heat to escape more evenly. I\u2019ll probably also cut slits in the sides to even it all out.

Mine from Amazon came with a cheap plastic container much like a take out box. If I had known this, I would NOT have bought from AmazonUPDATE:  I emailed Hot Logic and expressed my frustration with the plastic dish. Anna Hollar contacted me immediately to work on a solution. To my surprise, she offered to send a replacement glass dish for heating foods, at no cost to me.  This type of customer service is hard to find.  To say I will purchase more of their items in the future is positively true.  They have made me a customer for life.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1638576000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Traveling cook","reviewDescription":"For me this was a great discovery.  These should be advertised more at high school and college.  As a Vegan I have difficulty finding adequate meals when I have to travel.  I used this on a recent business trip and was impressed. Some of what I \"cooked\" was a test to find out if it worked and I was not disappointed.  One morning I quartered some amber potatoes, spiced them, place in a container with a few tablespoons of water and when I came back for dinner four hours later (after work) the potatoes were done exactly as they should have been. i did pasta, vegetables, frozen pizza, frozen desert, and a few other items.  They all cooked exactly as they should have.  This is so small, easy to pack, doesn't burn food, and the meal is ready when one returns from work.  Sorry it took me so long to find the product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1563753600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good to have, not perfect","reviewDescription":"Nice to have to be able to heat something up away from a stove\/microwave. Pretty ideal if you are in a hotel w\/o any amenities. Ive heated a few things, frozen (pre-cooked) chicken, pasta dish, leftover thai food and all suffer the same problem.. soggy and too much water absorption. the pasta and thai both wound up too saturated? with water, very mushy\/overcooked unlike the original prep. Not sure if there is anything that can be done about that. The chicken was soggy too. I am sure there are some things it reheats great, I just havent found them yet.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1633046400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Takes time but saves searching for a microwave!","reviewDescription":"Im a flight attendant so love the idea of having a way to heat up my meals after a long day of flying. Not all of the hotels provide microwaves and it\u2019s not in my budget to buy meals every night I travel. It does take some time to heat up food (allow an hour at least!) so if you\u2019re looking for a quick meal this is not the gadget for you. (This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5) I bring my food already in the glass container I\u2019ll be using (instead of trying to transfer it from foil, etc, to the container.) As soon as I get in my room I plug it in. By the time I get settled in, it\u2019s usualy only about a 15-20 minute wait. So if you have the time to wait it\u2019s totally worth it plus it\u2019s safer than a microwave with the added plus of being green!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1518998400000}
