{"reviewTitle":"Great quality, and customer service!","reviewDescription":"For starters; the price on these phones is great. Between having the reassurance of Amazon buyer protection, and the benefit of knowing the device has been tested for performance, it\u2019s well worth it.I needed a new phone fast after my cat knocked mine  into the sink \u2639\ufe0f Rice fixed it for a while, but it was only temporary before it died altogether.I hate buying phones and avoid it whenever possible. 99% of mine belonged to someone in my family first. And i was good with that. Needless to say, my cat didn\u2019t wait for someone in my family to upgrade. I was on my own this time.Okay.... that\u2019s not entirely true. My grandma had an iPhone 7 sitting around so that held me over in the meantime. Going from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to an iPhone 7 was\u2026.bad. It was too dam small, in every possible way.  32 gigs of memory!! I needed an upgrade. Fast. My 11 year old was bullying me relentlessly. And that\u2019s on me. They had my old XR (formerly my dad\u2019s)I scoured FB marketplace. I\u2019d decided upgrade a little, so I could feel better about the switch.  I didn\u2019t want to feel backed me into a corner by my cat\u2019s recklessness. I would get a slightly newer model in a fun colour.Marketplace had plenty.  Sending message after message from my iPhone 7, I worried. \u201cThis person seems too eager\u201d, \u201cthis one has been posted so long\u201d, \u201cI want a purple, but the only purple one listed has less storage space\u201d and \u201cthe pretty green one has a small crack\u201d, \u201cthis guy lives 2 hours from me\u201d and \u201cBattery life? Errr last time I checked it was like 74%?\u2026.no, I can\u2019t take a screenshot of it, it\u2019s turned off\u201d\u2026. \u201ccash only please\u201d Etc.So much pressure. What happens if the thing doesn\u2019t work? That\u2019s $300+ down the drain. I knew I couldn\u2019t afford new. But I hated the idea of buying something used from a stranger on Facebook. I didn\u2019t want to get scammed, and I also didn\u2019t want to settle.That\u2019s when I remembered good ol\u2019 Amazon. Maybe I\u2019d check there. Just for funsies. Probably out of my budget, but it couldn\u2019t hurt.Sure enough, refurbished devices selling \u201clike new!\u201d Mostly same cost or less than what I\u2019d found so far. Surely there was a catch? I read through everything, tested by Amazon, includes all the specs, unlocked, I can pick the colour, the storage size, the condition, etc. AND I could have it delivered to me tomorrow??! With a warranty?!!I recovered from my brief stint of disappointment after learning the 12\u2019s don\u2019t come in yellow. Then fought hard to decide between mint and lavender. The lavender would take an extra day to arrive. Mint it was!! As promised, it arrived the next day. It was in beautiful shape. 128g\u2019s, mint green, not a single scratch, 86% battery life. All for less than I would have paid to some stranger for a 64g with some \u201csmall scratches\u201dOnce my case and screen protector arrived I excitedly set it up and synced my data.Oh no.The FACE ID DIDNT WORK \ud83d\ude2dAfter becoming used to facial recognition, having that yanked away, and dealing with a 7 for over 2 weeks\u2014  I was desperate for the convenience of Face ID. I had been using my fingerprint. Like a *caveman*.Not to mention I have Blink 182 tickets, and it specifically states facial recognition is required to access the mobile tickets. Idk if that\u2019s true, but I needed Face ID!!I googled, I contacted apple support. Fixing it could be upwards of $300. That\u2019s almost what I paid for the whole phone!!I realllllly didn\u2019t want to be stuck without a phone again. But I also wanted one fully functioning.So I reached out to Amazon support and explained. The rep was incredibly helpful (as most Amazon reps are) and after bts failed, she advised the ship was a 3rd party seller, and she  send a message to them. \u201cIf they don\u2019t fix it by (insert date) contact us back and we\u2019ll make this right\u201d she encouraged.I\u2019m ngl. I was nervous. I didn\u2019t have high hopes, having dealt with 3p sellers on Amazon in the past. At least Amazon had my back, ig. The concert wasn\u2019t till July. Even without facial recognition, it was loads better than the  7. I could make do in the meantime.The seller came in clutch though, and my worry was unwarranted. They responded within minutes. They were receptive, apologetic, and more than willing to help.As I\u2019d anticipated, they offered a refund or exchange, as soon as they received the return. I explained my concern with not having a phone for several days or more; and the merchant offered to overnight a replacement as soon as the return was dropped off.I could deal with one day without a phone! I gratefully accepted. That was Saturday night, we made plans to catch up Monday for the return instructions and for them to overnight it.Monday I reached back out; and they were ready to ship, BUT they *had no more green\u2026.* \ud83e\udee2 SHOCK\u201c\u2026do you have purple\u201dNo. :( just blue, white, and black.THIS WAS A HUGE BUMMER.It\u2019s silly I know, and the definition of *first world problems \u201c.. but I mean\u2026. My change of heart about this whole phone thing HINGED ON THE FUN COLOUR. Without it, I was just a person\u2026out $350\u2026 because my cat was thirsty while I was watching YouTube while washing dishes. I needed a cool colour. Plus,  I\u2019d already gotten the matching case! Clear with mint green borders.It wasn\u2019t even a fun blue\u2026 it was a dark, serious, navy blue. It was pretty and classy, but I wanted something fun. I even asked if he had any older models in yellow \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d no luck,They told me they\u2019d be restocking in a day or so. Still, no greens or purples came in.Ugh. Reality was setting in. I was going to have to settle. It was fine, I thought. At least it would be a fully functioning phone.No. I wasn\u2019t ready to let go. They assured me I could take my time to decide, and I asked if we could wait another week in case one came in. If it didn\u2019t, *then* I would choose from the options available.I messaged them Wednesday afternoon, bracing myself for the answer\u2026. THEY GOT IN PURPLE! YAY.They sent a label, I dropped it off, sent a photo, and had my new phone the next morning.they\u2019d said overnight shipping\u2026 but wow! I\u2019d dropped off the return around 3pm, and had the replacement by noon the next day. I didn\u2019t even have my new case yet \ud83d\ude05Despite the Barney-Esque colour scheme my mint green case created, the lavender is GORGEOUS and I\u2019m actually sort of glad the green didn\u2019t work out.Don\u2019t get me wrong, the green is also  gorgeous.. but in the end I\u2019m glad I ended up with the lavender. I was overjoyed when I was prompted to set Face ID during setup. Worked brilliantly, as did everything else.Great packaging, no cosmetic flaws, amazing battery life, customer service was great, and best of all\u2026 ITS PURPLE!Can\u2019t wait to pair it with the new case. I\u2019m so glad I went this route where I have some peace of mind as a buyer.I\u2019m grateful to the seller for being so helpful and patient with me as insufferable as I must have seemed making such a fuss over colour preferenceIf you\u2019re nervous buying a phone used or refurbished too, hopefully you can take comfort in knowing- this seller is legit. You receive a good quality product, and, speaking from experience, they\u2019ll gladly help resolve any issues you may run into.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"284 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707523200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Excellent condition","reviewDescription":"My reason for purchasing an iPhone was probably different than most people.  I have a Samsung phone that use daily and I am very happy with it.  It is on a carrier that is not one of the \"big names\".  It suits my purposes fine.My mother invited me to accompany her to Europe.  This is a once in a lifetime trip for me, but I soon realized my inexpensive Samsung phone would not work there.  Believe me, I tried.  The best way to have a working phone while in Europe so I could stay in contact with my business was to invest in an iPhone.  I decided on the iPhone 12 and bought a refurbished one.I researched the sellers and their profiles before ordering.  I finally decided on MOBILESUPPLY because they have an incredibly high rating.  They did not disappoint!The first phone I purchased was purple.  It arrived in excellent condition visually.  No scratches, no marks and actually looked like a brand new phone.  It charged up to 82% which was great.  Everything was wonderful.  Then I set it up (which took me a couple of YouTube tutorials being a long time android user).  I couldn't hear on the phone without using my earbuds or having it plugged into my vehicle.I thought maybe it was me, so I tested it with several people calling them and having them call me and finally I gave it to my husband, then son to get their opinion.  Nope, wasn't me.MOBILESUPPLY answered my question immediately and it was no issue to replace the phone.  They sent a prepaid label and the same day they received my phone they shipped a new one out to me.  The replacement phone was blue, but that isn't an issue.  It charges to 93% and again, appears brand new.  It works great, I can hear and now I am ready to go on my trip with my Mom.This entire experience was a lot of research and I am so glad I bought from Amazon, and picked the seller I did.My advise is to think of your needs for purchasing a \"new\" phone and to do your research on sellers.  Amazon offers an amazing choice to pick from.Hope that helps.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721692800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Almost brand new!!","reviewDescription":"I purchased the (Product)Red 64GB version Refurbished - Excellent iPhone 12. When I received and unboxed the phone, I realized it looked brand new except what appears to be a small scratch at the bottom of the screen. Do I wish the scratch was on the back or anywhere else other than the screen? Sure but if that's the only blemish, I'm happy with it.Not sure if this is standard but mine came with a screen protector installed which happens to hide the scratch pretty well making it difficult to notice unless you're looking right at it.After I finished setting up and configuring the phone with T-Mobile, I checked the battery health. I would have been perfectly happy with a max capacity around 90% but to my surprise, it's 100%!!I purchased a red set of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live that are refurbished but happen to look new as well to pair with the phone. They work perfectly together and the red color of both the phone and ear buds are a great match.Overall, I really like this phone!! Maybe I got lucky with the condition but this is one of the better purchases I've made recently. I recommend this phone to anyone looking for a decent iPhone that can't afford a current model. I upgraded from an iPhone 8 so this a big leap from that. The differences between the newer models gets  less and less as you move up to the 15 so getting the 12 is a really good option. The 12 even has the same shape and size as an iPhone 15.Hope everyone who buys one gets a phone in like new condition like I did :)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721347200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Better than expected!","reviewDescription":"Firstly, I was scared to even consider buying a used\/refurb phone, but I ordered it just to see if it was worth it. If not, I could have just returned it.Some of the things I was originally worried about ended up not being an issue. Was it going to have a lower battery health than anticipated? Was it going to have noticeable scratches? Was it going to be an international version?It came with a charger and the iPhone was completely new. The battery health was 100%. The camera lens was perfect, and so was the screen. The grills were all clean, and so was the lightning port. AND it easily connected to my previous phones SIM card.My only complaint was the lack of a SIM card tray ejector tool. I had one that came with my old phone, but I imagine others ordering this may not.BTW I got the Refurbished Premium 64GB Black sold and fulfilled by Amazon.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1724284800000}

Bought this for my mother who loses things a lot so getting something in pristine condition for under 300 dollars is a great way to avoid the expense of a new phone with features that would go unused\/unnoticed. Mine appeared brand new so was probably immediately placed in an Otter Box at time of original purchase. Battery seems ok but only time will tell but Apple only warranties new batteries for year anyway. Also came unlocked with no SIMM card and wiped clean just like my new 12 I got 3 years ago. Only took about 10 minutes to add to my Spectrum Mobile account. Only think I will add has nothing to do with the device but to keep in mind with a third-party seller. Price dropped around 40 bucks as soon as I received it. Did not expect Amazon to or the seller to honor it but spent about 15 minutes on their chat only to call a live rep. Then was told they have no control over 3rd party pricing as it is up to the seller. Again, not a big deal but just annoying that I could not get this answer in a minute or two though chat. Finally, if something does go wrong, I was told I would have to work with the seller instead of Amazon and discuss warranty with them.

I was a bit apprehensive at first because I've always upgraded through my carrier, but I took the plunge after reading seller reviews. I had a few questions sent through email and by calling the seller's toll free number as I have never swapped and updated my data between phones before. I didn't know if AT&T would flag me for updating my phone without their consent. Both queries were handled by Angela, who reassured me the purchase and upgrade process would go smoothly. The unit shipped immediately and was in excellent condition. I used the Transfer or Reset option on my iPhone 7 to transfer to the new iPhone 12. The process went very smoothly and I was online in about 45 minutes. I waited until I had a new case to transfer my SIM card, which also went very smoothly. I'm now back in action with my 12 with 128G of space and an OS that will accommodate my app updates. My only critique is the phone shipped with Lightning to USB3 adapter, which I don't have, but I'll just use my existing adapter. No biggie. Also I have no experience with battery life on the 12, but this unit seems to hold a charge pretty well. If this phone holds up in the future as well as it does today, then we have a winner.

I'm guessing that it lived in a quality case, upon arrival and inspection I placed it in one right away. The phone works perfectly, I'm a little worried about the battery strength and lasting power. I do play my music constantly so that might be a problem. We will see and I will  update but right now I'm extremely happy.Now that I have had the phone for a while I feel ready to give it a more complete review. I'm still very happy that I saved money with the acceptable version. The battery is still a concern as there are times when it does seem to discharge faster than I think that it should, but it has never left me stranded. The front glass seems to have been replaced by a lesser quality glass as I do have issues reading my fingertips sometimes in comparison to previous iPhones. Again this is an inconvenience not a serious problem. Overall I'm really happy with the phone a so glad to have an iPhone again. I really hated the Android's that I have had to use over the last couple of years. I use this this phone with mint moble and I have been very happy with the quality of service and calls from both mint moble and my phone. I have yet to drop a call or not have service where I expect to.

{"reviewTitle":"Highly Recommend","reviewDescription":"I am a 19 year old broke college student, but I have had the Iphone XR since my freshman year of highschool... I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years,  she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I haven't had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you're looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple.Now, the only issue, which I dont fully see as an issue and youll understand why but the battery. The biggest issue with my old phone was how quickly it died. It was impossible to go out for longer than 3 hours without  my phone dying. The first setting I checked on the new phone was the battery capacity, and although I was really really upset when I saw it was also at 80% like my last phone, I dont really know if that number is fully true. I recieved my phone yesterday, and havent charged it since the afternoon of that day, and it is still on 49% which would NEVER happen with my old phone. SO, I put the rating down one star because it does still say that the battery capacity is 80%, but I just havent really seen that as of yet!Hope you guys found my review useful, and I highly HIGHLY recommend buying this product. Just make sure to double-check the ratings of the seller you're buying from. For me, the black color of the iPhone 12 came from a different buyer than the blue color. The black phone color seller has 3.2-star ratings while the blue phone seller has a 4.5-star rating, so I went with a color I wouldn't have usually gone with to higher my chances of receiving a phone in better condition!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708992000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Got one with 100% Battery Health, minor scratching on back","reviewDescription":"Update January 2024: Still running perfectly fine, no lag or anything when using. The battery health has gone down to 89% after a little over a year of having it. Granted, I have a habit of overcharging my phone overnight when I\u2019m asleep so that may be the cause. I still highly recommend this phone in 2024.Update February 2023: I still have the phone and the battery health is still at 100%. The phone is still working fine and I haven\u2019t noticed any slow downs yet. I don\u2019t regret this purchase!I believe I got lucky and got what feels like a brand new iPhone 12. I know the phone is old and I really am under the impression I got a brand new one that was sitting around for a while. Everything works fine and I\u2019m really happy that when checking the battery health, it said 100%! I checked under direct light for scratches and scuffs. There was some minor scratches; very thin which looks like finger nail scratches. But from arm lengths distance, I couldn\u2019t make out where the scratches were and I\u2019m happy with it. My Samsung Galaxy S10e of 2.5 years malfunctioned recently and I needed a new phone but I didn\u2019t want to break the bank.I did a lot of research prior to purchase on which older model was more \u201cbang for your buck.\u201d I found that the iPhone 12 in 2022 was a worthy  purchase considering it has a great camera, pretty display and the potential to see several more years of support from Apple (support being firmware updates which tend to include new features to your phone\u2019s software). Nothing is guaranteed but a lot of people mentioned much older iPhones are still receiving updates. I do have a case on it but I don\u2019t prefer any screen protectors because I want the most out of the display. If I break it, my carrier will fix it for a low cost.From now on, I\u2019m going to buy older models of phones to save money and hope I get a quality phone like this one!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"60 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665964800000}

First of all, phone came damaged with a large impact to the bezel clear as day seen in pictures. That however is the least of my worries. Placed the phone on the charger & charged to 100% before removing from charger so as to not overcharge. Left phone unused overnight with 0 running apps, 0 screen time, roaming off, & no background apps of any sort. Woke up 5 hours later to a 50% battery. Phone was not updating, was not syncing iCloud, nor was anything else running during this 5 hours at all. After waking up I checked the Time on my screen 3 times (that\u2019s it)\u2026..47%\u2026\u2026SERIOUSLY?! Made my 1.5 hr drive into work without touching the phone once not even to check the time (again absolutely 0 programs or apps running in background)\u2026..35%?!?! I can only imagine that if I had been actively receiving calls\/texts & checking social media once in a while that this battery would last maybe 2 hours at best.  It\u2019s clear to me that they must be using fraudulent parts\/batteries as battery health score rates at a 91% in phone settings which makes no sense. With a battery like this you are better off buying a corded house phone\u2026I will be giving the seller one opportunity to correct this before taking further action.

I was told a return through USPS or ups would not be possible. Amazon said I could contact the seller, which I did, then the seller responded that they were not liable and that Amazon would have to provide resolution.

How excited I was to purchase a refurbished iphone promised to be fully functional and the only difference from new being battery life capacity is at 80% instead of 100% - to be expected, and fine.The warranty for this purchase if 3 months or 90 days.Months 1-3, it works fine. 4, 5, battery draining more quickly - doesn't last through the whole day, but I remind myself this is a refurbished phone so it's not perfect.At the start of month 6 - my phone randomly can no longer do Face ID to open the phone. When you try to fix it in Settings, \"Face ID not available at this time\" - is all you get.Then, the right side of the touch screen stops working. Try texting or messaging without m or n or , or ; or p or o. I was out of town so had to delay getting to the apple store to fix it - and week 2, the left side of the touch screen stops working. I had to change my passcode to numbers in the middle of the keypad cuz face ID is gone and the keys on the right and left won't work.When I message and email Amazon and the manufacturer - both are EXTREMELY unhelpful - \"The 90 day warranty has passed so there is nothing we can do\" from the manufacturer and Amazon when this is an Amazon Renewed product.The warranty is at 3 months because the phone starts to melt at 4 months and craps out on you at 6 months.DON'T BUY IT.After returning from the Genius Bar at the Apple store, they told me it would cost $450 (I bought the phone for $453) to fix the touch screen and the face ID - and they were happy to tell me to buy the iphone 13 or 14.If you want to buy refurbished, buy direct from the Apple store - don't buy on Amazon and don't buy Amazon renewed or from this manufacturer.Don't buy this product. UTTERLY disappointing.

So when my direct deposit hit it automatically took the money from it. Which makes it seem like I was charged twice for the same product.  Now I\u2019m having to wait 7-14 more days just to get my money back.  You don\u2019t know my situation, so that amount could have placed me in a bind.  Like I said the product itself is great.

Still waiting on refund for that phone. I have come to understand that you must wait on the suppliers of the phones to refund your purchase however I think Amazon implies they are guaranteeing your purchase and like all other amazon returns they will refund your money this is not what happens..  I also find Amazon is beginning to slip in customer service areas that were once routinely always taken care of, takes a week to get a package now refunds get the run around etc.  Its a Christmas present so I have to get her another one quickly so I try again with the white Iphone 12 . After getting it  I immediately notice marks on the screen and slight dents on the side of the phone. It slightly  has dull screen too not as bad as the red iphone but not as bright as her current iphone 10.  She is satisfied with it shes 12... If it was for me it would go back too...

{"reviewTitle":"Amazon Cares Little About Supporting Students","reviewDescription":"Bought this phone to make the jump to iphone from android. Was impressed at how clean the phone looked and the professional packaging. After setting up the phone I noticed on my first phone call that the speaker had an unusual rattle. The rattle was confirmed and more noticeable while playing music and videos. Not impressed that a phone that supposedly passed a \"20 point inspection\" was allowed to ship with a noticeable rattle from the speaker. Sure the speakers worked but the sound was distorted which was irritating and unexpected.After calling Amazon support to promptly report the issue, the support staff were incredibly understanding and tried to come up with a solution. But, this is my first new phone in 4 years (my previous phone being a refurbished Android bought from Amazon) and I had upgraded after prompting from my carrier to upgrade due to network changes so I can not just reactivate my old phone in the interim. The only recourse the staff could offer was a refund after returning, not even a replacement after I indicated I liked the phone besides the speaker issue. So to end up with the same iphone I have to ship this phone back, wait for a refund, and then reorder the phone from Amazon!Mind you I would also have to either work without a phone (which isn't an option thanks to two step authentication) or go buy a different phone in the interim that I could receive sooner. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon's ability and willingness to support students and the lack of options the support staff were able to offer despite their best efforts.If you are looking for a phone that might \"look\" great but will probably have a noticeable defect then this is the option for you but don't bother trying to receive adequate assistance from Amazon, especially if you are a student because they will leave you high and dry without any satisfactory options.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673740800000}

I thought maybe I left something on and drained it so I put it to charge, and it wasn\u2019t charging. I decided to look at the battery health to see if it dropped and there was a notification saying that the battery in this phone is a non-genuine Apple battery. So basically, they sent me a phone with a fake battery that is now turning off every few minutes and won\u2019t charge. I am now returning it and hope they have the decency to refund it full price. Thank god I still had my old phone because I am leaving the country in a couple of days and can\u2019t afford to get another one before I leave. What is the most upsetting is that I did my research on the seller and it seemed to have very good reviews and the bad ones seemed to not be the seller\u2019s fault.

You're on your own for sending it back, and no exchange possible.  Would have to pay and shipping charges over again, wait at least a week before having it recredited, and then take business elsewhere.Yes it was stupid of me to buy international off of here, but they said their 90 Warranty applies and offered it for international order.In reality it's a ripoff and now going to have to pay for a repair.A flaw this obvious really should have beeb caught for a rebuilt phone.

But, only lasted 1-2 minutes and suddenly came on.Day 4 same black screen occurred after a call, but not resolving. Just sent old phone in as trade-in, obviously unable to call customer svc, went to online chat on my computer, not an easy task but typing all symptoms then waiting for responses, 1st with assistant, then transferred to someone, repeating some of conversation, transferred to someone else;  all close to 2 hrs just explaining my issue.  During the end of this, the phone suddenly came on, after 4+ hrs of black screen.  Have not tried calling anyone but using text and internet options. If happens again, I could lose all phone data - contacts, photos, subscriptions, invoices, - so much we have on there!My options, per emails with customer service, were to contact seller and see what was proposed but no automatic replacement. Main recommendation was to return phone to Amazon and refund expected usually about 30 days, maybe more.I have already sent in my old phone.  Before returning this new phone I need to purchase another so I can hopefully still get data transferred.  So much for a safe inexpensive option of buying renewed.  Will have to spend another several hundred bucks for yet another phone, hoping this damaged one will last long enough to transfer data, And what does that mean as to my trade in?  Still don\u2019t have all answers from customer svc.This has not been a great experience, especially since I don\u2019t have a phone I can trust to make any calls, and don\u2019t know what the issue is so am nervous I may lose all data in the phone at any point.In Limbo and very disappointed","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1712275200000}

They let us know that the battery the phone came with was defective and that there were glass pieces left from previous repairs. This has left a bad experience for us as we basically had to invest what we paid for the phone to get it repairs. Ended spending more and the phone did not last a year.

It worked fine on my Tmobile account for about one month. The \"5G\" was never fast, and while at work in my office I would have almost no internet connection through cellular data, even though I am on the unlimited max plan. Then recently, the phone stopped recognizing my sim card. I reset the phone, cleaned my sim card, then even physically went to a TMOBILE store and had them make and activate a brand new sim card for me. This worked for about one hour before the phone stopped reading the sim again and only allowed me to make SOS calls.Needless to say, during this entire ordeal where I called T-mobile multiple times thinking it was a sim card error that lasted 2 days (before I gave up hope and got another phone), I missed several important texts and calls. I then asked for a replacement from Amazon, since that's who I bought it from, but it turns out they are not the company the refurbishes and sells these phones as they claim on the listing, its actually some third party \"tek\" company.

{"reviewTitle":"\"Premium Renewed\" not quite premium","reviewDescription":"Pricing lower than Swappa or Backmarket, with Amazon's return policy another plus.  Shipping delayed a few days, then delivered to an Amazon \"hub\" rather than my home.  I never had anything delivered elsewhere, but maybe that's a new option and I missed it when ordering.  Packed in a nice 'Amazon renewed' box that held contents securely, but that box was then just tossed into a much larger generic Amazon box for shipping--no padding, no airbags, etc.  Flimsy generic lightning cable included, along with a generic and obviously well used 5w charger (these accessories match what the listing indicated, so no problem).  Phone is in generally good cosmetic condition--back and sides seem very good, so was probably in a case; screen though has two distinct scratches toward the bottom.  Both are about a half inch long and both are visible at arm's length.  The plastic protective sticky sheet over the screen was fine, but the one over the camera lens was too sticky and left residue on the lens that I am unable to get off totally.  Phone booted up fine, and Battery Health & Charging in settings says the battery is at 92%.  However, the Battery Stats shortcut which pulls info from Apple Analytics has more accurate and detailed info.  It shows the phone has gone through 320 complete charging cycles and the actual capacity is currently 88.9%.  This is slightly below the 90% battery life that Renewed Premium is supposed to have.  Overall, with the screen scratches, sticky residue and slightly below advertised battery life, I'd give this iPhone 12 about a 7 out of 10.  If I can resolve the camera lens residue, it'd be an 8 or 8.5.  If I can't find a way to safely get the sticky residue off the camera lens, I'll have to return the phone.  :-)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690329600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent condition with good enough battery health","reviewDescription":"[My review contains 6 photos][My review rating actually is 4.5 stars.]My interest in purchasing an Amazon Renewed iPhone 12 (2020) arose from favorable past experiences with renewed (used) purchases, and a more affordable opportunity to upgrade a first gen iPhone SE (2016).My order was placed on March 31, 2023, and it arrived on May 4, 2023.The unboxing experience was excellent. An unadorned white cardboard box labeled \"Amazon Renewed\" on the top and some device info on the back. Inside, side-by-side, two recessed trays, one for the iPhone (covered by a clear plastic film) and the second for a USB 5V power adapter and 3' Lightning cable. A \"OPEN ME FIRST\" sleeve with several cards inside: HI THERE, WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED, QUICK START GUIDE, SIM REMOVAL TOOL, and INSPECTION TEST CERTIFICATE.Cosmetically the phone looked brand new. No noticeable blemishes (just a tiny scratch near the Lightning connection).So, after powering on and setting up the iPhone 12, I checked a few things. WiFi and Bluetooth were okay. Face ID okay. The battery was at 81% charge, with a Max Capacity (Battery Health) of 89%.  iOS was at version 16.3.1, which I upgraded to 16.4.1, then 16.4.1(a).The back of the box noted \"BH 91%\" and the Inspection Certificate noted that \"Your Device\" \u2013 A2172 BH91 \u2013 was \"Tested in New Jersey\" on 03\/24\/2023\" and \"Battery Health 90%+ confirmed.\" So, in the time (~6 weeks) between inspection and arrival, this iPhone lost 2% of max battery capacity. Is this typical (as in other reviews)? Is this a big deal?Well, in my case 89% BH probably is good enough. The renewed iPhone 12 is not my primary smartphone. And the fully charged battery lasts longer than my old iPhone SE's. And the 12 has the latest iOS and other more recent hardware and software features (like MagSafe, Precision Finding).The Amazon Renewed Guarantee includes replacement or refund within 1 year of replacement. That's a plus.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683676800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Functions Properly-Not Happy with Screen","reviewDescription":"First let me say that given the HUGE savings in buying used over new for an iPhone, to me, is worth a few imperfections. So, overall I am happy with this purchase. But I still wanted to review the imperfections so people know what to expect.I\u2019ve been using this phone for 3 months and it was listed as in \u201cvery good\u201d condition. I have no complaints about functionality. It functions properly. The battery life is a little less than ideal, but isn\u2019t bad enough to be a problem.The thing that I was most disappointed with,I didn\u2019t notice right away because this phone came with a screen protector on it. It had some air bubbles behind it, and as much as I hate not having a perfect looking screen, I decided to save money and use it for a while before I bought a new screen protector.However when I removed the screen protector the first time I saw that the iPhone screen was very scratched all around the edges. But what bothers me most is that new screen protectors don\u2019t adhere properly to this phone. There are always air bubbles under my screen protector. It drives me nuts because it looks messy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709078400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great value, shipped fast!","reviewDescription":"My iPhone SE 2nd gen very suddenly bit the dust after 3 years and I needed a new device FAST! I didn\u2019t want to drop close to $1K on a new phone but still wanted to upgrade from my much older previous phone.  My iPhone 12 arrived within a few business days. My only complaints are that the third party charger that was sent along did not work, but thankfully I already had several iPhone compatible chargers in my home. The battery health is at 80% but I expected about that much as it is a used device. So far a full charge with moderate use (listening to music, checking social media and texts) lasts me a whole workday anyways. Besides, even getting a new battery eventually would still be a lot cheaper than buying new from Apple and I felt really confident in Amazon to give me a refund in the event the phone was not in working order. Thankfully, everything functions fantastic! I ordered a T-mobile locked one and then just swapped over my SIM, and it updated on my plan immediately to reflect the new phone. Overall I would absolutely buy from Amazon renewed again!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703808000000}
{"reviewTitle":"iPhone 12","reviewDescription":"So, the phone itself is a 5\/5\u2b50\ufe0f review. Everything seems to be working great. Storage is great. I had a iPhone XS with 64g of memory. With all the apps I want loaded onto it I\u2019ve filled 25g. My pictures took up a lot of space so I\u2019m happy that I have the room for more. The phone came with a charger which was great for me as I break mine a lot.Now, the reason I gave it a 4\/5\u2b50\ufe0f is due to the shipping aspect. I do understand this is out of the sellers control. I ended up finding it at a neighbors house looking all creepy like. They walked out and began yelling at me till they saw it was mine.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712361600000}
