However, we've been disappointed that we can't stream anything directly from our phones due to copyright restrictions.While we were able to work around it by connecting a laptop via HDMI, the convenience of phone mirroring was a big selling point for us. It's frustrating to be limited to using a separate bulky device for streaming services.If you prioritize phone mirroring for streaming content, this projector might not be the best choice. Otherwise, it's a solid option with a great picture quality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721606400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Save Your Time and Money","reviewDescription":"What a piece of junk.I bought this two months ago as a Christmas gift, and have only given it to the my sister last week. Let me tell ya, it\u2019s one inconvenience after another.Here\u2019s the list in chronological order.1.) Opened it up, thinking it was bluetooth or had the required cables to connect to an iPhone. Turns out it didn\u2019t and this one is my fault. I should have looked at the reviews. It will only come with an hdmi connector (both ends), and you\u2019ll need a lightning-hdmi adapter if you want to use a wired connection with your phone. It\u2019ll work if you\u2019re only using it for a laptop. If you want to use Bluetooth, you need to buy a dongle that allows connection and attach it to the project. While there\u2019s a USB port, you can\u2019t use your typical charger to directly connect your phone into the projector.2.) Bought an hdmi-lightning adapter, and it was easy to connect it at first where it\u2019ll ask you to trust the device on your phone like the prompt that you get when you connect your phone to your computer. I don\u2019t know why it requires that, but moving on. Once you accidentally turn off screen mirroring, good luck connect it to the stupid thing again. You\u2019ll either have to reset your iPhone settings, or have to turn your iPhone off and on in order to reconnect. And you will have to do that a lot because it\u2019ll kick you off whenever it decides to. You\u2019d think you\u2019d see it under the screen mirroring options, but nope. It\u2019s not there at all.3.) Once I got the hang of it, 10 minutes into continuously using it, it made a loud high pitched noise, and the image froze while distorted. No matter how many times I turned both the iPhone and projector on and off, it started doing it one minute into watching a video. I figured it was the adapter I bought. Because you need to power the hdmi adapter with a lightning charger, I thought it wasn\u2019t getting enough power since I used the old iPhone charger that only delivers 5W. Switched it out with a 20W charger and power brick, but nope, still the same result. Then I used my other brick that delivered 65W. This time, the projector lasted a bit longer before doing the same thing as it did before.I give up.Piece of crap.It\u2019s, overall, stupidly useless. You can\u2019t use it. At least the one I got can\u2019t be used. It\u2019s cheap at $90, but you\u2019d expect it function at least. What a piece of junk. I would have returned it if the return window hadn\u2019t closed.Saved you some frustrations. Find a different projector.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"44 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676246400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Grainy picture lacking focus with okay sounding speakers","reviewDescription":"I bought this projector for two use cases. 1 - to use outdoors for family movie nights.  2 - to save my primary Epson projector bulb from being wasted on my son's 578th viewing of ABC kids songs. Let's just say after getting the projector my expectations were not met.Setup was fairly simple, just provide power and an HDMI source. I used an old Fire TV Stick as a source to stream some YouTube and Amazon Originals as a test. The projector was roughly 12 feet from an existing white screen. I had to make the room pitch black to be able to see an image. The picture was very grainy with white shimmering throughout. The projector has a manual knob to adjust focus and I found either the edges of the image or the center could be in focus - never both. This was most noticeable when using subtitles. There were also several instances where it looked like the image was lagging and would skip some frames.The built in speakers started off shrill. But over the hour long viewing session either they broke in, or we got used to them. The speakers do a great job of drowning out the cooling fan. There is some heat coming off the side of the unit, but it isn't too bad.The remote control is fine function wise. I was able to control the unit from anywhere in the room without any problems.Overall, if you have a child that isn't picky about image quality in a pitch black room, this is the projector for you. For outdoor family viewing nights, I will keep looking for a better solution.UPDATE: After using the projector for a few hours it began to let out a strong plastic smell that filled the room and caused my head to hurt. Amazon replaced the projector and the new one does not do the same.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"33 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1642377600000}

It has no angle adjustment so you have to prop it up on a book or something.The connectivity on it is GARBAGE. The only way to use this would be with some sort of laptop. Don't bother trying with a phone, many phones do not include HDMI over USB, and even if it does many of the apps like Netflix, Hulu, Pluto don't work right. I guess it might work if you had a fireTV or Roku to plug into itBUT ALSO:The picture quality is terrible. Its definitely 720p, there's no way this is 1080p, its most likely labeled 1080p because it takes a 1080p signal and converts it to 720p which is the DUMBEST thing ever.It has NO BRIGHTNESS. even in a 5pm afternoon shadow with the blinds down it is completely unusable. In pitch black darkness it is still not acceptable. I don't know if the people using this only watch at midnight in a black painted room or what, but the whole point of this thing is to be able to take it anywhere, set it up and use it to watch things.Its a complete failure.

If the middle was focused, the lower quadrant was out of focus. If the lower quadrant was in focus, the rest of the image was not. There was no fixing this, no matter how I angled the projector, adjusted the keystone, settings, etc.On top of that, the resolution is horrible. I put on an episode of Futurama for the trial run of this projector. It looks great on my laptop screen, but the image projected reminded me of an old video game. Again, no settings were able to improve on this.The color and brightness also left a lot to be desired. I tried different settings, and nothing I tried could improve the abysmal performance of this projector.The color wheel and lamp went out on my first projector, so I thought I would replace it rather than repair it since this option was cheaper. I am returning this projector and will instead repair my old one.Auking makes a usable projector that lists for $159.99.

It's perfectly loud enough for my bedroom, however. I just think if you were using it outside, the volume might not be amazing. However I think you can connect a speaker to it somehow, I just haven't tried. Overall, I've liked it so much that I've convinced my boyfriend and sister to get the same one.

{"reviewTitle":"Great customer service, great audio, but inconsistent and difficult to clean.","reviewDescription":"VERY DETAILED REVIEW.I have had this projector for well over a year now and have used it almost every single day, sometimes 16 hours a day for background noise or for entertainment for my cats. There are some great positives to this projector and company, as well as negatives. After a couple of months of having this projector, I started to notice DUST build-up that was projecting onto my screen. This absolutely drove me crazy, and I tried everything to clean it. I probably went through half a dozen cans of compressed air and shoved the nozzle into EVERY crevice I could find, but still nothing. The dust would not budge. The build-up got so bad after 6-7 months that I even tried to take it completely apart to clean it and it did nothing. I ended up emailing the company showing and explaining the dust build-up, and they were so very understanding and told me not to think twice about it, and they sent me a new one free of charge. I never asked or even alluded to wanting another projector, only a solution or way of cleaning it. Of course, I was very thankful and excited to have the original quality I started out with. The CUSTOMER SERVICE was incredible. They were very friendly, kind, and quick to respond.I USED this projector in every capacity at least a few times. I had it connected to my laptop and even played Xbox through my projector. Most of the time I had an HDMI port plugged in that provided multiple outlets so I could do different things. I used a Roku on my projector to watch TV. The CONTROLS were not the easiest to figure out and required research to connect to a Roku. I had to use the projector remote for the volume and power and then used the Roku remote to change the channels and such. There was no way of merging the two since this projector is not identified on Roku's list of compatible projectors (there were probably hundreds on there total.)I initially bought this for the bedroom so I could save the room a TV would take up without sacrificing the size of the screen. It also gave my cats endless entertainment without having to worry about a scratched-up TV screen. The first month I had it, I LOVED it. I placed it on a mounted shelf above my bed, and the SOUND quality was amazing. It sounded like a good quality TV does, except above your head and therefore creating a more realistic feel when watching intense movies or shows. I have no complaints about the sound quality of the first projector I received. However, after receiving the second projector, I noticed the second I used it that the sound quality was much different. It sounded almost muffled, the audio levels were different, and it almost sounded as if the people talking were talking through a pair of walkie-talkies. This was very annoying and made me completely want to stop using it.The PICTURE quality of the first projector was perfect. Given that I used a good-quality screen and used blackout curtains when using the projector. The color was bright, the lines were defined, and the quality was consistent (apart from the changes from the dust build-up.) The picture quality was different on the second projector I received. The color was very muted no matter how much I messed with the settings, and the picture was much darker and even a bit blurry regardless of how much I tried focusing it. I used the second projector maybe less than a couple of hours before I just had to switch back to the first, dustier one I had.Even though it was dusty (and a bit frustrating), I eventually looked past the projected dust solely because the picture and audio quality were just that good. Over a year and a half later I am still using the first projector, but almost exclusively for background noise or for the cat's entertainment. The dust buildup has taken over more than 30% of the screen. I still am unable to clean it or even get the dust to budge. If my Roku remote didn't have voice control, I would not be able to see what I am clicking. However, I still give this projector four stars because of the great customer service and the original quality of the projector I bought. My ratings reflect the quality of the first projector. When I bought this, I paid about $65, and I can happily say I have gotten more than $65 of use out of it. The company can not help that my house has an excessive amount of cat hair and dust floating around. If there was a way of cleaning around the bulb, this projector would be perfect (if the quality was the same as the first one I received.) I still am not sure why the two projectors differed in such a noticeable way, but since it was a free replacement, I didn't care enough to be upset about it, only disappointed that I still couldn't clean my first projector.Since I bought this projector, the page has been updated quite a few times, and I am not sure if they are sending out the same product given that the title says \"updated.\"","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"335 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672963200000}

I would've used it more if I could get it to work without frustrating the crap out of me, but it is what it is.I bought this a little over 20 months ago but was in the middle of a big move at the time, so it didn't get unboxed and set up until 3 maybe 4 months into owning it really (I stored it the whole time safely-I'm OCD on caring for my things, so I really am sure nothing harmed it while sitting dormant).Since the start it has ALWAYS struggled really hard to connect to my speakers even though it was all wired properly and there has always been a massive delay in remote to projector function (turn it on, have to wait up to 6 mins before the unit even responded and actually turned on so you had to trust it and wait).This has Bluetooth, and it only wanted to connect to my neighbor's player. We played so much back and forth reset, trying to stop my projector from cross connecting to his kid's TV, it was ridiculous! When it did connect well and play it was fine and dandy, the picture was way lower quality than a low-cost TV but at least I could see the dark scenes well, so I was happy with it. But then out of nowhere, about 3 weeks ago, the unit just stopped all functions completely. The only thing it does now is the power light comes on. THATS IT.So, if you're going to spend $50-70 depending on sales, maybe consider another projector cus I cannot suggest this one at all.

Ive never had a good projector so i cant compare it to anything. I wouldnt recommend this if youre using it for anything other than your white bedroom wall.The sound quality is so-so. Its not the best, but not the worst. Its actually surprisingly loud but it depends on what streaming service you are using. There was one where i had to turn the volume up to 100 and still couldny hear anything. Wish it could connect to a bluetooth speaker but it doesnt have bluetooth.The fan is loud and makes my room feel like a sauna, literally. I have to cover it with something because its so hot.The quality is good for a $50 projector. This definitely isnt the right projector if you plan on playing video games, you can see the pixels on the screen. The edges are blurry no matter how hard you try to make it focus but its only annoying if you are watching something with subtitles or playing gamesThe screen has been taken over by dust and its only been a couple months. I did contact customer service and they sent me a replacement no questions asked so i recommend this seller, just not this product. The replacement is this same product so it will probably only last 3 months before the screen is taken over by dust again.tbh, these things never bothered me that much except for the intro whenever you turn it on. It is so bright and you better remember to turn the volume down because it makes the most annoying intro sound. It also takes a longggg time to turn on. When i first got it it would turn on in one second but now it takes 5-10 seconds to turn on.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694476800000}

{"reviewTitle":"A MUST HAVE! Mirror your Iphone, Android, Live TV, Tablet, Laptop, Computer, PS4 , Xbox on any wall","reviewDescription":"READ THIS ASAP!! If you are deciding should you buy.  Works with mirroring your Iphone, Android, Live TV, Tablet, Laptop, Computer, PS4 , Xbox  I don't know where to begin. I initially ordered only 1 for xmas( for a son that has all types of gadgets and this was something he did not own)  but after playing around with it to make sure it worked, I had to get one for all of my 3boys and myself. Yes I bought 4 Projectors. They were on sale for xmas for about $55.00. Grab while it has 30% off. Great deal for this!!  Yess Im truly pleased and excited about it.  I haven't written a review on anything in awhile, years, but this was something I had to tell everyone about. I base a lot of my buying on reviews and YOU MUST BUY THIS. Ladies your man will love watching the game supersized on the wall. And the volume is loud. In the video my son is watching the game from his xbox. ESPN. It is much clearer than you see. He was laying down and I wanted to quickly record it.. He uses it for facebook, scrolling the web, watching movies, everything. ohhh, for xmas, I surprised everyone and had it on the wall, just the wall, no projector screen.  We watched videos from last xmas as we opened gifts. It was the talk of Christmas. Since me and my family have used it on everything ( Iphone, Android, Live TV, Tablet, Laptop, Computer, PS4 , Xbox )  I wanted to share this important  information for anyone looking to purchase.  I hope this helps:  With the Iphone you need to use hdmi adapter [Apple MFi Certified] Lightning to HDMI Adapter, for iPhone 1080P HDMI Digital AV Adapter Sync Screen Connector with Charging ( and yes I bought the $13.99 from amazon, works perfect. The real adapters are about $44.00 and I was not buying 4 of those. It has a remote. Android phones  need a different adapter. Im going to do another review with my other son cause he has called me bragging about this since Christmas . I will update u with a future review if there are any issues that cant be resolved. Nooo Im not getting paid for this. Just excited to see the entire family fall in love with this.March 2, 2021Title:  I am back with three amazing reviews, Not from me but each person I gave these projectors to as gifts.I have bought a total of 8 Auking Projectors.  I asked everyone to write a review and send to me since it was ordered under my amazon account. . Here are the copied reviews.My name is Tonya. I received this item as a Wedding Gift from my sister. I am happy to be doing a review on this. My sister had ordered 4 of these projectors for her family for Christmas. She called me showing me how it worked and I got so excited and wanted one. I got married in Jan and she surprised me and my husband with one and I was jumping and screaming because this projector is awesome. The video clarity is great, You can see it clearly in the day, but it is much better when the room is darker.  My husband watched the live game on ESPN and he really enjoyed it with his brother. I hope they dont take it over now, lol. The picture size is really big, not sure of exact size. A video is attached.  I love the fact that I view everything on my Android phone on the screen, while laying in bed. Below is her review she added in December.My name is Theresa.  I received this item as a Gift from Starr and I doing this review under her account.  I never thought about getting a projector before I received it. When I received this item from Starr, she also sent me the link on Amazon so I would know all of the devices that it could be viewed with.  My son (14yrs. old) actually plugged it up and showed me how it it works. It was really easy, nothing to read. You plug in two cords and attach to whatever device that you are using.  My sons wanted to watch view things from his Iphone on the wall.  I ordered an HDMI Connector cable from Amazon and it was also easy to attach. We have it in the living room because my teens enjoy getting on social media and playing games on the wall. We dont have a projector screen and we will get one soon. It shows up great on the wall. I will end up getting another projector for them because I dont want them using it so much. Everyone loves it is all I can say. Thank you for this great gift Starr, You are the best.My name is Ana and I received this a Housewarming Gift from Starr. Me and my husband lovesss this Aurking Projector.  We had been looking for a projector for a long time but we couldn't decide, which one to get. Thankfully we have received this as a gift. We have already had a movie night with family and everyone was talking about how they wanted one.  The picture quality is good. It does show clearer at night but the quality is not bad during the daytime. I will be purchasing one for my daughter because she has been sneaking it to her room, lol.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"1,012 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1609977600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great little projector, if your expectations are realistic","reviewDescription":"Let's be honest, if you're expecting a $65 off-brand projector to be cinema quality sharp and bright enough to easily watch in a room with the lights on you're not being realistic in the slightest. So what is this little unit? Well, it's a fantastic \"movie night\" projector for a gathering of family and friends at an amazing price, but you'll need to make sure you have a very dark room (or it's very dark outside if you're having an outdoor viewing party) and you'll also need to not be a pixel snob, walking up to the screen and pointing out \"eww, I can see the pixels\". Yeah, you can see the pixels on ANYTHING if you get close enough.Okay, so the description says 1080p right? Yeah, well that means it can PLAY 1080p content from a microSD card or USB drive, it does NOT mean that the internal LCD is 1920x1080 pixels in resolution. Does that mean that it's not worth the price? Absolutely it is. I dare you to try to find a projector with an ACTUAL 1080p LCD for less than $300 (at the very low end).  What it means is that you'll need to chill out and accept that your little $65 projector is not going to be as sharp as the ones at the movie theater. Did you really think it would be??I don't know about you but I always look forward to getting movies on bluray after I've seen them in the theater because even the theater ones (which costs TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars) are nowhere near as sharp as a bluray on a decent LED television, but you know what makes it cool? watching it on a HUGE screen! So if you pick this little thing up you can also grab a $20 projector screen here on Amazon and have your very own home cinema for well under a hundred bucks. This thing is easy to use, reliable, sharp (for the resolution it's capable of), and plenty bright enough in a dark room.PROS:- cheap- long life LED bulb prevents having to purchase super expensive halogen bulbs- tiny and easy to carry- has a tripod 1\/4\" thread on the bottom for easy mounting- has microSD, USB, VGA, HDMI, etc...- USB will power a Chromecast, so you can just plug into USB and HDMI and have a streaming home cinema- remote works well- goes from power on to ready in well under 10 seconds flatCONS:- you won't be watching it in a bright room, the darker the better- 800x480 resolution (just don't be a pixel snob)- manual is in chinglish and very sparse (but use your brain and figure it out, it's easy)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3,846 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1556496000000}

Our projector will turn on at random hours of the night, in the middle of the day when I\u2019m nowhere near the bedroom, etc. It doesn\u2019t occur too often (maybe a few times a week) & it\u2019s definitely not a matter of \u201caccidentally\u201d hitting the \u201con\u201d button.

I bought this and love it so far! The remote doesn't work but all the controls the remote has is on the actual projector. It focuses and works well! Product says up to i think 180 inches and we projected on our garage door (14 foot) and it was crystal clear! It came with a free HDMI cable which was a plus. We connected the HDMI to our laptop and blue-toothed the laptop to the garage stereo system and it was just like we were there. Pulled the sofa in the garage and propped the projector on top of a ladder and it was super cool. Well worth the money!!!! I may have misread, but I thought the page said it was compatible with iphones but it is not. You have to buy an HDMI to lightening converter - and if you do this, save yourself the heartache and just buy an apple brand HDMI converter!

It does MUCH better in the dark.  I need a screen instead of my ghetto white sheet but so far I am very pleased with the projector.A few notes, if you are running off of an iPad, the sound will not work for HBO Go or Netflix via the HDMI cable.  You will need to run the sound through another speaker.  I use a Bose portable speaker with a male to male 3.5mm cable.  I have an iPad air 2 so I still have the 3.5mm jack.Also, the fan is a little loud.Another issue that I didn't identify, likely my own error, is that the projector does not zoom.  In order to increase or decrease the size of the image, you must move the projector.  That isn't a major issue but can be a pain.Finally, invest in a decent tripod stand.  My lame table and uneven stone patio make it nearly impossible to get a level image.  The projector only balances on one leg.You get what you pay for with this projector but what you get is perfectly serviceable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"34 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1556064000000}

The new one has arrived and while the image is clearer and better, this new one doesn\u2019t support Dolby Audio, meaning Disney+ and AppleTV+ have no sound, but Netflix and Hulu audio work normal. Why would the cheaper basic one support more audio sources? I looked online and found out how to change the audio source on my Apple TV from Dolby to just Stereo and that worked! Just more work. Overall the quality and setup is better in the Wi-Fi upgraded projector.PROS: I like how lightweight and easy it seems to be to use.

The projector is easy to setup and the produces an excellent picture.  Depending on the screen used the user will need to adjust the brightness and a few other settings to get the colors and saturation right.  We thought the brightness could be better, but we only tweaked it for a few minutes.  There are some nice software based adjustments that can be made to fine tune the fit of the projector to the screen.  The projection size can be reduced down to 75% of the default size nice for fine tuning so  moving the the screen around to fit the projection is not necessary .  We are using a 150 in  (~380 cm) screen; I recommend 16 feet (~4m) from projector to screen to achieve full screen.  The projector has a built in speaker which was just OK. The volume needed to be turned up to drown out the fan noise.  We, however, were not expecting much, but it was sufficient for our movie night.  I recommend a sound bar for the best sound experience.The biggest drawback was the remote.  It is line-of-site and the sensor is behind the projector.  The remote works fine, and it is a little clunky getting through the setting options.  It did not take long to get settings right.Over all we are satisfied with the projector and would recommend this unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1593993600000}

The Google TV remote has an input button, but it does not work with this projector.

I looked at a handful of different projectors and figured for the price of this unit with the amazon coupon I couldn't go wrong. I have only used it for about an hour so far but I feel I can already formulate an opinion. Get a TV... this projector isn't bad but its no substitution for a TV. With a TV you don't have to make your room extremely dark.Setup was a breeze but there is no way to size the screen. I set the projector on my wall behind my sofa so there would be no obstruction of view. I had to angle the unit downward using some shims on the back legs because the projection was tilted up on the ceiling and there was no way to tilt the projection downward. I was also hoping there would be a way to make the projection smaller to get better image quality but there isn't. The image is way to big for the wall I have it on and as of right now I don't have a projector screen. I am worried if I get a projector screen that the screen will be to small for the image.I can get the focus dialed in pretty well in the center or on the edges of the image but not the entire image all together.Also the fan is SUPER LOUD! the speaker quality isn't great but it is loud enough to over come the extremely loud fans.If you want a portable projector this one isn't bad for the price and I am still going to mess with this one to work for me since TV's are triple the price or more.If you do purchase this unit be aware there is only 1 HDMI port, I wish it had at least 2 but you can always buy a HDMI switch which is what I'll be doing and I will be connecting a better sound system to the unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1602374400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Nice for the price","reviewDescription":"This is a great little projector for the money. But it is missing a lot of features like four-way keystone. You can only adjust the keystone up and down. It is lacking a lot of adjustments for contrast brightness saturation etc. The outside edges of your screen will be blurry. You can get the center focused but you will always have blurry edges no matter what you do. When you are watching movies or YouTube or something like that you do not really notice it that much. But when you have it hooked to a laptop and your desktop is showing or you're trying to do presentations with lettering on the screen you will not be able to read the lettering around the outside of your screen. But for 69 bucks it's a nice little projector. I was projecting on 110-in screen at 10 ft away. The customer service I have to say is awesome. The first one they sent me was missing a remote, believe it was a used unit. They immediately sent me a new one.

This is my bedroom budget theater setup for under $150:-$70 Auking (price will vary, got mine during Black Friday sale)-$25 Amazon Fire stick (turn your projector into a smart TV, you can also mirror your phone and stream anything through your smart phone w\/ the Fire Stick)-$30 Insignia computer speakers for better sound quality (optional, projector has builtin speakers)-suggestions: buy an inexpensive ($20 or less) HDMI switch if you plan on having multiple HDMI sources such as gaming consoles, this way you won't have to keep swapping HDMI cords for the projector's single HDMI port.-$9 surge protector, I advise getting at least a 6-outlet to plug in all of your devices.The pictures I included show how bright the projector is in a dark room vs during the day with light coming through a window shade. My projector is set 10 feet away from the adjacent wall, sitting on a shelf above my bed, at this distance it is projecting a 98 inch screen (the further the projector, the larger the image).Pros: easy setup, inexpensive, so far it has lasted hours of use for the last 3 months (I have a 70\" Sony TV that I hardly use since this came around)Cons: projector's focus adjustment could use more fine tuning, some small area on the outside edge are difficult to adjust to project a clear and even image throughout.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"46 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676678400000}

Part of the image would in focus but the edges and corners wouldn't be in focus. The zoom functionality lacks usability. One would most likely need to use zoom when using longer throw distance. When zoom is used in less than 100%, it would leave visible low light band around the image like frame. The brightness is low and hence have to use in very low lighting conditions.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1704067200000}

Some reviews say that the low image quality is only noticeable if you go directly up to the screen, but this is incorrect: it is very much noticeable from a normal viewing distance. These statements are true even for the native menu. The combined effect is that it becomes difficult to look at the screen after some minutes.Occasionally it also makes a harsh static-like noise when it tries to play sound.The price is very low for a projector, sure.

{"reviewTitle":"Beyond my Expectations","reviewDescription":"!! Read after \u201cOverall\u201d to get the concise review !!This projector is beyond my expectations. I originally watched a video review displaying a childrens\u2019  movie, I believe it was the cartoon version of the grinch. Either way I didn\u2019t waste time purchasing after realizing the picture quality was amazing, the projector was affordable, with a 4.5 star rating.The inspiration review states the quality depends on how much lighting is in the room or outside, which is true. I like to suggest purchasing a projector screen (or becoming a VIP customer after purchasing the projector and receive a free one. All it takes is an email). Because, as you can see in my video, the quality was great but the texture and color of my wall didn\u2019t allow certain parts of the movie to show up well. * If your wall is white this wouldn\u2019t be so much of a problem.* I projected on my white shower curtain and the quality was unmatched!Also, I read some of the low rated reviews while waiting for my projector. After receiving mine I made sure to look out for any similar issues. Which I did, but we\u2019re easily fixed using the simple instructions and my handie dandy thinking cap. Such as: the sound not working for Netflix or Amazon prime. It clearly states in the instruction it will not play since these are copy-righted streaming platforms. This is easily fixed by opting out to plugging in your fire stick or utilizing Bluetooth speakers connected to what ever device your using. Use the fire stick if you are utilizing the built in speakers, use the blue tooth speakers as an alternative (especially if you don\u2019t have a fire stick and don\u2019t plan on purchasing one in the near future).Overall,The pros are:-Affordable quality image projection with minimal adjusting needed (and possibly a projector screen).-Qaulity built in dual speakers-They offer 12 month warranty-They offer a 3 month guarantee to your money back-You get a free gift(s) after following the steps to becoming an AuKing VIP customer by simply emailing their customer service team.Cons:- Batteries are not included for the remote-You\u2019ll need to purchase an HDMI adapter to connect your phone, even though their is an USB port.

I have the correct adaptor for my iPhone Xr which works on anything I plug it into. I tried the HDMI cable sent with the device and a better Monster brand 4k 60FPS cable...nope, my kids were let down. Netflix...fail, Disney Plus...fail...Apple+... fail. My home movies worked 50% of the time and my Plex video tests were 75% win. I have not tried a computer connected to this device, but I got it for the small size and expecting it to work with my iPhone in the backyard...no dice. If something can\u2019t be configured to make this work I\u2019ll disappointedly be requesting a refund for basically an over priced lightbulb.Update Nov 2020 --I've now used the projector a few times and wanted to provide some useful feedback on real world use, not just testing it. The device does lack the latest HDMI standards so don't expect to play any streaming services. I've tried an iPad, iPhone, Laptop and Apple TV 4K. I thought it was working with the Apple TV because trailers would play audio and picture, but when I went to watch a movie...it was 1890 with silent films.HOWEVER, I am still going to test it with an older Apple TV 3rd Gen to see if maybe it will work as it also doesn't have the latest HDMI codecs. For halloween I put out a sheet on the driveway and played \"It's the Greatest Pumpkin Charlie Brown\" for kids walking the neighbor hood and adults to hand out. The picture worked very well at max size (120\" or so diagonally) with sound being only slightly off sync with the sound bar connected to the audio out jack. The video was played via my local Plex server using an iPhone on an HDMI adaptor and a Monster HDMI cable. I did have to wait for the sun to set completely to see the picture and start focusing and such. I forgot to take a picture of the set up.This works well for backyard movie nights, driveway neighbor hangouts but don't expect too much as the viewing options are limited. The best results so far would be a local video system. I've not tried a Blueray player connected yet. Lastly, using an iPad with the sound connected directly (no audio though the projector) provided a much better sync experience on a previous backyard movie night.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1600732800000}

That has always been the biggest issue with these cheapo projectors. They are almost unwatchable of you're sitting within 10 feet of the projector.I set mine up behind a shelf so the fan noise is blocked.

You can get the center of the image crystal clear with the focus dial, it's the corners and edges that have the blurry issues.

Now, I was about to get very upset at the fact that this projector didn\u2019t work.  there was no mention of how to use it with an iPhone in the booklet that came with it other than to use it with a lightning to HDMI adapter. When plugging the adapter into my phone and the HDMI cord into the projector, no matter what I did and no matter what setting I chose, the picture would not show up. I went through the reviews and saw people having similar issues.Before I rage quit, I decided to check out the reviews for the adapter that I purchased, to see maybe if there was some troubleshooting to be done there. Now, if you\u2019re like me, you want a projector and you want to use it with your phone, but you don\u2019t want to pay upwards of $300 for a big one and you definitely don\u2019t want to pay the $42 price tag that comes with the Apple lightning adapter.

One unidentified port with a symbol that I didn\u2019t recognize, and one for the HDMI cord.If your adapter sounds similar to this (I will try to insert pics when i get back home) plug your iPhone charger into the other port and then plug the charger into the wall. This will charge your phone while also powering the adapter. Then, go to the input menu and select HDMI.

It\u2019ll do everything you need to, even miracast.The remote signal with original remote is strong, it messes with my tv in the next room where if I hit the mute button it turns the tv on lol. Might just be me but thought you should know.Fire stick doesn\u2019t have this company listed as compatible for the remote. Wanted it to really work with the remote so then I could have one main remote and not have to deal with the other sensitivity. However, just gotta deal with both. Still works fine.Tip: use the keystone! I see reviews saying it\u2019s blurring up top or bottom, that\u2019s because you need to balance the picture out. The flatter it is the clearer it\u2019ll be.This is also better in the dark as it\u2019s only 7500 lumen it\u2019s not as great during the day but somewhat not bad when there\u2019s some light.Will update if anything changes.UPDATE: noticed that after getting a shelf and installing it, the corners are blurry like some people mentioned. You can try your best to make it less blurry but I noticed when that happens the middle of the screen becomes blurry. You can\u2019t adjust it without something else being blurry.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"56 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1664755200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Almost a year review","reviewDescription":"I bought this initially cause it was cheaper than a tv and I wanted to be able to play movies from my phone in my bedroom. I bought the lighting cable adapter with it and it would work it with Netflix  but not Disney plus which I think is just apple not allowing things. I ended up just having my pc plugged into it and hdmi and the projector sits on my headboard and works great. I did notice the quality was pretty bad, definitely not 1080 like it claims but I didn\u2019t mind. Also the focusing is pretty horrible as well. It will on focus a section of it and the adjustment only moves that focus point around. I can\u2019t speak on the quality of the speakers since I used Bluetooth speaker for it. The brightness was not the greatest either darker movies were nearly impossible to watch. Other then that it worked as a projector does, it projects. After almost a year (sep2022- aug2023) and mostly daily use, the bulb finally went out on it. I\u2019m debating getting a bulb if I can or just going with a different product. But that\u2019s my almost a year review for y\u2019all. Take from it what you will.

{"reviewTitle":"good image","reviewDescription":"edit: I have updated my review to 4 stars as the customer service is excellent. They offered to send me a new updated projector that fixes the problems with my first unit.Original Review: I did not expect a top of the line projector at this price point, but I did expect a readable image and some useful features. My unit never came with a remote, so I can't comment on that at all. I have to keep using the buttons on top of the projector to control it, which you have to do each time you turn it on. There is also a very loud intro sound that plays that is terrible at night. I tried a friend's chromecast and the chromecast cannot bypass the intro screen, or the need to hit \"hdmi\" each time you turn it on. You cannot operate this projector without touching it or without a remote because you have to select 'hdmi' every time.The biggest problem is with the image. The entire screen will not stay in focus unless perfectly square with the wall, even after adjusting the focus and keystone dials. I can get most of the screen in focus but the edges are very bad and hard to read anything that isn't in giant font. I can't stream Netflix or Hulu from my phone because of the copyright limitations, you probably need a chromecast or fire stick to use this device at all. The lens also came with smudges out of the box, and it is very hard to clean everything with the provided Q-tip. Either I have received a defective unit or some quality control has to be done.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1682985600000}

Unfortunately, it comes up short projecting text in moderate to well lit environments.  The projected image is not consistently focused over the viewing area, making it less than optimal for things like Powerpoint presentations. Still, at this price, for casual viewing, it's a bargain if you don't expect or require razor sharp images.

There's a manual knob on the projector for adjusting the picture for clarity.The projector remote doesnt come with batteries.In order to select HDMI on the home screen, you have to use projector remote to do so or press the buttons that are located on the projector itself. Which can be a pain if you already positioned your projector somewhere hard to reach.Dust do collect inside the lens.

{"reviewTitle":"The Auking Project used with HDMI connected to a PC and an XBOX","reviewDescription":"This is a very small projector that I purchased for the price, average review, and review count.I have mostly used this projector in my living room and with a Dell laptop, I was able to connect easily using an HDMI cable. I connected a DVD player via USB and due to the distance from the wall (11 feet from the front of the projector to the wall) I was seeing a stunning 9 foot (along the diagonal) image. I watched Minority Report which was such a darker film that I need to increase the brightness. I also watched the Sound Of Music and was able to see details in the mansion and at the abbey I had missed on a 42 inch TV, which is 3.5 times smaller than the 9 foot projected image I was setup for. My living room only has one vacant wall, so I couldn't test closer to the published limit of 170 inches.DVD's were SD so I connected the projector to my XBOX which outputs  in HD1080p. I played No Man's Sky, which looked incredible. I also watched Old Guard with my wife and Minority Report (again) with my son. Both appreciated the larger picture and quality. My wife said during dark scenes she saw a little graininess, but felt it added to the experience and made the picture look \"old school\".I wasn't able to connect with my phone yet.I have used this in a classroom near windows that had no shades, which wasn't great but did the job even for students 18 feet away from the screen. It was a similar setup that I used with HDMI connected to my Dell laptop HDMI.  Due to COVID restrictions, desk spacing, and outlet placement, I was not able to try to get the picture to be as large as it was in my living room.I will also add that I used the output 1\/8 inch jack connected to a small Roland speaker I own. The sound is impressive.While connected via a laptop using HDMI and playing YouTube videos, however, the sound is very harsh. I needed to turn down the low end to nothing to attenuate the bass, but nothing I did could prevent the low buzz and gurgle I was hearing. This is harsh audio is non-existent using HDMI with the Xbox and using HDMI with a laptop.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1601164800000}

Odd they don't have a website and their email address is AuKingDirect@outlook.com, but they were quick to respond, replace the unit, and overall aim to make sure the customer is happy so I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 because of how well the experience was with them and that the product is good sans the fact that it's not clear that it doesn't work with more modern phones. The device might not work with more current phones but it works well with a chromecast and is overall a good product. Chromecast or devices similar to a chromecast are not too expensive to purchase and can be utilized with other products so it's not a bad cost to buy one along with the discounted price of this projector.------------------------------ORIGINAL Review:Their list of phones doesn't mention the Google Pixel in general so that should have been the clue but they responded to a few people in the Questions section asking if this would work with their google pixel, they just need an HDMI adapter so I took the chance and it didn't work out :( I bought two different kinds of adapters and the HDMI port kept saying that there was no signal so I ended up returning it. That said, I gave it three stars because the product itself is nice and overall had a nice screen and such for the price, just a shame it doesn't work with newer phones given that it's listed as a 2022 upgraded version.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666569600000}

Only issue is that Netflix doesn\u2019t have any sound on it but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s because of Netflix\/Apple TV and not because of the projector but that is something to consider. I have bought an hdmi adaptor in order to see if that will fix it and I will update if that fixes the sound issue. Other than that Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube all work with sound. The projector does make a whirring noise when powered on but it\u2019s easy to drown out with the higher volumed shows. The remote is a little cheap feeling and doesn\u2019t always work.

{"reviewTitle":"Beats expectations","reviewDescription":"Got this for our guest room thinking it would be fun to lie in bed and watch movies, or have something fun for people staying over. We didn't expect much from this at all, and have been shockingly surprised overall. I have it set up about 5 or 6 feet from a blank off white colored wall and it projects to somewhere around 7' by 5'. It projects pretty big, but you can obviously move it closer or further if you need more or less space.Pros:1. This speaker exceeds expectations, it so much fun to watch movies\/tv shows on, and is something fun for ourselves and the occasional guest who stays over.2. It's small and compact, it easily stores away quickly and easily in a small nightstand drawer when not in use.3. Has good options for input\/output. You can plug in an external hard drive or USB flash drive with preloaded movies, you can plug in a HDMI input for gaming systems, Chromecast, firestick whatever to stream, and it has aux outputs in case you want to use different speakers.4. It projects to a large surface and the picture quality is awesome for what it is. You're not getting the best picture quality, but if you're watching more classic movies, or movies that are cool to watch on a bigger screen (think Jurassic park, LoTR, gritty crime movies, Ozarks, super hero movies), this is awesome.5. It only needs to be plugged into one outlet (2 if you're using something like a chrome cast) so it's easy to bring outside and watch stuff on the side of the house or bring to a friends house or vacation for movie nights on the go.Cons:1. The projector itself doesn't have the greatest speakers (though they made up for this in my opinion with the option to hook up external speakers if you want).2. The fan in the unit can be noticeable if the sound is low. Honestly though I sit like 2 feet from, it when I watch movies so if you set it up a little further away or just turn the volume up, you won't notice it 90% of the time.Overall: Definitely worth it, great picture quality for the price and what it is, lots of input\/output ports so there's a lot of uses for it. I'd say that if you're on the fence, but it. I gave it 5 stars due to how well it exceeded expectations.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646524800000}

Then I tried it with a dvd player, which connected to projector, but screen was completely jumbled. Sound worked fine. We were never able to get screen to come in clearly with dvd player. Lastly, I hooked it up to my laptop and it did work. Picture was not good, but it did work. This has been the biggest failure of anything I have ever bought from Amazon. I cannot understand the great reviews??? It is a terrible product. I am afraid to buy another projector from Amazon. I think I will stick with Best Buy for electronics.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1598918400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Repeat Function Difficult to Use [UPDATED]","reviewDescription":"[UPDATE December 2021]: In response to my review, AuKing updated the menu options and kindly sent me a new projector to test. I confirmed the menu updates eliminate all guesswork as to what repeat mode you are on. The options now read \"R1\" or \"R ALL\" so there is no more guessing. I now consider this a great projector to use for AtmosFX projections, and the customer service was fantastic.Original Review:I bought this projector specifically to loop AtmosFX videos for Halloween. I got it working by adding digital videos to a TF\/microSD card. HOWEVER, the menu makes it impossible to know which repeat mode you're on. (see pic)It's maddening to drop 10+ videos in a folder, select them all to play (and you can't control the order, no matter how you name them), then leave thinking you got the repeat mode set correctly...only to come back later and find the drive menu is showing to the whole neighborhood (see other pic).To test, I selected only 2 videos and sat there babysitting it to make sure it was looping correctly - which still failed a few times, because I'm not sure it's registering each time I select \"Repe..\" with the remote. Sometimes I click once, sometimes 2-3 times - I'm never sure what works. I thought I figured it out, selected all my videos again, clicked Play, set the repeat, left for a few minutes...and came back to see the menu up on the screen again.I wanted to like this projector but the repeat function is driving me insane. The UI is weak - there is NO indication what repeat mode is selected. I'm considering editing videos together to make one big file that plays for 3 hours instead of relying on the loop function.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1635120000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Would Recommend","reviewDescription":"I've had this product for about a year and a half and have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it. I like not having a TV and being able to completely and easily store this projector when I'm not using it. I haven't been able to get the USB to work with a DVD player, but it connects to my laptop via HDMI cable and I use a Google Home device with my cell phone.  You do need black out blinds for a good viewing experience as it is difficult to see if the room is brightly lit.Recently, the projector stopped turning on for no apparent reason. I reached out to the company and they are sending me a new one even though the warranty period has passed. Honestly it was so odd that I suspected a scam!

I previously got rid of all our TVs from the old home, and wanted a fresh start.I looked for a decently priced projector for my kids room, and I read through all reviews first. This was rated very highly and I could not try it out sooner.It's exactly what we needed! Has a lot of features. We plugged in our Amazon Fire TV stick and bam. Their bedroom wall is like their own personal movie theatre.Cannot recommend this one enough. We did after exactly a month have a glitch on the screen for probably 5-10 mins. It went away on its own. Might have been caused by my kids leaving this on, and it gets warm.Really happy with this purchase.

{"reviewTitle":"Great with Firestick!","reviewDescription":"I was on vacation a few weeks ago and decided to buy a Firestick Lite to use in the hotel TV. I don't own a TV at home. I mostly just use my laptop or my tablet for streaming shows. I enjoyed using the Firestick so I decided to buy this projector just for that and mount it in my bedroom. I'm pretty pleased with the projector's performance. In my room it's sitting about 12ft away from the wall so the projection is about 120\". That's a little more than 8.5x5 feet. Up close i can see little black pixels\/dots but from across the room I quickly stopped noticing them. It seems like it's roughly 1080p. I'm even happy with the brightness during the daytime when light is shining around the edges of the blackout curtain over the bedroom sliding glass door. Even better, the USB port provides power to the Firestick while it's connected to the HDMI port. And the Firestick also has bluetooth which connects to my nice speakers! So, this cuts back on any extra wires or power cords. It runs quiet and after watching a two hour movie I didn't feel any heat when feeling the top of it. The only issue i had was the limited angle adjustment. It only allows adjusting the top\/bottom (or up\/down?). Useful for when the projecting is going to be sitting on the floor or mounted on the ceiling. But if you want the left and right sides of the projection to be even then it does need to be pointing straight ahead. If this is common with projectors then c'est la vie!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1650067200000}

{"reviewTitle":"BEST PRODUCT ON AMAZON","reviewDescription":"We really wanted a 3rd TV but did not want to break the bank and this exceeded our expectations! So the instructions try to make you think that you HAVE to connect this projector to your phone however you don\u2019t need to do that. We plugged our Firestick into the USB plug on the side, we changed the source setting to HDMI (but do it from the remote youre given DONT change the setting from the projector itself or it won\u2019t work). And then we plugged in some $10 computer speakers from Walmart: Go to Settings from the Firestick remote and click on-Sound and then Surround Sound- and then pick the option that isn\u2019t DOBY. And of course make sure your computer speakers are plugged into the Aux port on the side. Again this is only if you have a Firestick! I\u2019m sure you can use a ROKU stick that plugs in or an Amazon stick you\u2019ll just have to play around with the settings to get it to work for one of those.And then we just put up a little $4 shelf from Walmart and set everything above our bed. The pictures shown that is a 10ft wide wall and the projector is 15ft away. Crystal clear quality you just have to adjust the focus on the top.We really have no negatives to this! Other than trying to figure out how we could make sure to get our Netflix and Hulu and such (which again we were able to do with the Firestick) that\u2019s the only negative I\u2019d say we had. Cause the original instructions immediately tell you the projector cannot stream Netflix Hulu Amazon prime but we hacked it!

I was going to get a TV in the house later on, but after using this for a week, I think I'm going to just use the projector if I can figure out how to use a soundbar.Set up was very easy and intuitive.  I've connected my amazon stick to it, as well as my laptop, and my iphone.

The picture quality is surprisingly good and also bright enough that I don't have to turn off the lights to see.  If I wanted really good picture I would turn off the lights.The bad: the volume.  the included speaker is low quality, however there is an aux chord output and RCA type of output, but I haven't been able to get those to work yet.

{"reviewTitle":"Great Value for the Money","reviewDescription":"So far I have used this projector outside twice. I hooked my Firestick to it and we watched a couple rented movies. At 630 PM the sun  still lights up the west and the projector was plenty bright enough to easily see the movie we were watching. Be aware that if you buy the lowest priced model you only have three options for sound:1. Use the built in speaker that sounds \"tinny\" and doesn't get that loud2. Connect a 3.5mm aux cable and connect it to external speakers3. Connect your phone to the projector via USB to HDMI and BlueTooth your phone to an external set of speakers.  I used the AUX cable and realized that I need a more beefy set of speakers to get louder sound, which isn't a big deal for me. Until I find the right speakers I will continue using my JBL Charge 3 at full volume. This coming weekend my son and I will connect the X Box Series X and do some evening gaming and hang out near the Solo Stove if weather permits.  I can not stress enough how great this projector is. I can not comment on the longevity of the projector as I have owned it for about 4 days, but it has been great when we have used it. Auking has done a great job in making an affordable projector that is easy to set up and extremely bright. This is our family's new outside fun.

We decided to test them both out to see which one we should return and I thought to myself that I got him the better one because this product that claims to be 1080P, but yet it has worse quality photo then the one my stepmom got him that claims to be a 780P... It's either this product over estimated it's quality or the other product underestimated there's. Either way, the one that claims to be 780P can display a partially bigger screen and get a way better pictures resolution\/quality then this one that's supposedly 1080P... Very disappointed if I was really deceived into thinking that I was buying a well quality-built projector when in reality it's not... I've messed with it a lot trying to see if there was a setting I've missed, I found the optimal angle so that both the top and bottom of the picture were clean but it still showed a poor quality picture compared to the clearer 780P bigger size display. I'm fairly upset because there were many reviews on this product and it was just about at 5 stars rating, makes me think how many people thought they got a really good projector when in reality they were tricked and deceived just like I was...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"52 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1592784000000}
