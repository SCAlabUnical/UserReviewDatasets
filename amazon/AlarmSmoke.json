{"reviewTitle":"Do your research on this product before buying.","reviewDescription":"First let me say that some people write bad reviews for their own wrong doings for ordering wrong product like this one  thinking it can do something that it cannot do. A lot of people state this is not a detector. Well of course it\u2019s not. It states write in the details it is not. It is a \u2018Listener\u2019. Meaning it listens for your already installed detectors alarms. Now I have only battery detectors. Two of them. One on my first floor one in the basement.  Now they are battery and do not \u2018talk\u2019 to each other.  So if basement smoke detector goes off. It will not trigger the upstairs to alarm. So then I would need this product at every smoke detector!  So I removed it. I ordered \u2018First Alert smoke\/CO Z wave. So they directly go to ring Alarm system. I got them on google store from Costco. A 3 pack for $80. So if you have a hardwire \u2018interconnected\u2019 system now that you recently purchased your alarms.  Then I would say this product is awesome. You will only need one because with a hardwired \u2018interconnected\u2019 system if one goes off they all go off.  So no matter what detector you put it near Ring will get the alarm notification. So know what your system is now will help in your purchase. Also people state they have to rip the wall off to remove is a lie. When you unscrew the top after you \u2018remove\u2019 the device from your system then you see next to the battery there is a clip that you depress down and slide the listener off it\u2019s bracket. Very easy.Hope this helps some people.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"103 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1578787200000}

{"reviewTitle":"IMPORTANT: READ FIRST","reviewDescription":"I accidentally triggered the fire dept to come to my house within minutes of installing this thing. Here\u2019s what happened:1. I installed the device next to my smoke\/CO detector per the instructions.2.  The instructions say to test the listener in the Ring app3. I go to do so, but end up accidentally going into the **wrong** test menu (turns out there are two different test menus, one just for base station connectivity and one to bypass monitoring, and they both say Test Listener)4. I press the test button on my actual smoke detector thinking my new Ring listener is just in test mode and won\u2019t trigger the fire dept5. I get two separate immediate alerts from Ring monitoring that fire and CO respectively are detected in my house. And I dismiss them both within literally 2 seconds. No big deal I thought since I dismissed them quickly.6. Ring monitoring calls 30 seconds later. I tell them who I am and I just set it up and was just doing the testing (per instructions). They said, \u2018oh well with CO we dispatch first and then call the home.\u2019***SHOCK*** (That\u2019s not how the Ring alarm monitoring usually works!) I asked if they can cancel the dispatch and they cannot.7. I try calling fire dept to cancel but no answer probably because they\u2019re rushing to my house.8. So, fire engine with crew shows up with sirens and lights and horns, and I have to explain how this accident happened. I apologized profusely and fortunately the firefighter was cool about it, but not all departments will be like that, especially because this may cause them to miss another real emergency.TLDR; The instructions tell you to test the device in the ring app. There are two separate test menus for this listener in the Ring app. One disables monitoring and dispatching for 15 mins so you can test your detector, the other just tests the Ring listener\u2019s connection to base station without disabling monitoring.

{"reviewTitle":"Initially had problems, support was fantastic. Problems SOLVED!","reviewDescription":"I bought this kit to replace my LifeShield system. When I ordered I got enough kit to replace sensor for sensor. All of the kit arrived and I started the process of setting it up. The base connected to my network without a hitch but I wasn't unable to get ANY of the other devices to connect to the base. I had keypads, contact sensors, motion sensors, water and fire sensors and NONE of them would connect. So I reached out to support via email. In hind sight I should have just called but I was hoping for a short, quick answer that would solve all of my problems. That didn't happen and I got pretty frustrated. After several hours over several days of finding other reports online and trying what they had tried I was ready to throw in the towel. Then Danielle contacted me. She put me in touch with Nick in tech support and he tried for over an hour with me to get something, anything to connect. He had me disconnect other stuff in my house that could be causing interference with no luck. Finally I gave up out of frustration. I really wanted this kit to work because I already have Ring cameras and wanted an all-in-one solution.I waited a couple of days for Danielle to get back to me. In the mean time I spent time here and there trying to see if I could get something to connect, but with no success. Until today. Today I literally shut off the power to every single thing in my house except for my internet connection gear and I started over. Base station came right up. Plugged in the keypad and it looked like it was going to fail like it always has, until it CONNECTED! Contact sensor? CONNECTED! Motion? Water? Fire? Other keypads? All CONNECTED!My existing alarm is from LifeShield. Turns out I had two repeaters I did not remember installing that were causing interference and preventing the sensors from communicating with the base. Once those were off I had no issues connecting up the rest of the kit.I still have not installed this as my active alarm but I will get that done soon. Bottom line is that my initial review and bad experience with this alarm were all caused by other kit in my house. The support I got from Ring, even when I wasn't kind, was great. For that they get 5 stars and I will come back and update this review once I have some experience with the system.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"33 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1556755200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Nice idea, buy buy a new First Alert Z-wave instead","reviewDescription":"This was a good idea to tie in existing smoke\/co devices but the execution makes it worthless.  The instructions say it needs to be 3-6\" away and I found that it wouldn't work more than an arms length away and even then it needed to be pointed directly at the alarm.  This means you can't really use it with more than one alarm even though the FAQ suggests you could do it.  So why would anyone get this instead of just buying a brand new First Alert Z-wave combo alarm for the same money?  The only good reason is if you live somewhere you can't replace your alarm but even then it makes more sense to buy a new Z-wave and stick it somewhere so you have twice the protection.The setup of this device is surprisingly tricky.  You have to press a small button on the side to get it into test mode but while it lights up initially there's no indication you're in test mode.  I held it apparently for too long and it won't enter test mode.  The app doesn't give any indication of what should happen next but if you press it SHORT then it will go to the next screen to register any alarms.  The app won't let you \"reset\" the alarm so you can test multiple alarms of the same type - you have to repeat the whole test!  Finally even removing the alarm was tricky.  You have to time the clicking of remove in the app with removal & reinserting the batteries in some combination that didn't work the first two times and again there's no indication of what's supposed to be happening or what happens next.This listens for the 3 or 4 tones produced by devices in the last 10 years.  They should tell you it flashes red when it hears any loud sound - so you can see it flash for each beep by your Smoke\/CO detector.  But I wanted to use my old alarm system which has smoke \/ heat detectors which don't have a siren built-in and rely upon the system to alert the user.  That system makes a continuous on\/off siren and was not identified as T3 or T4 so it didn't detect it.  There should be a way to hook alarm outputs directly to this thing so you can tie in an old alarm system or a fire sprinkler sensor.Overall I can't figure out what they were thinking.  It's overpriced vs the First Alert Z-wave combo alarm and won't let you use other sensors or your old alarm system.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1601856000000}

She was very knowledgeable, and she totally understood my feedback about how the instructions and the feedback given by the app and the device were misleading. Original review below:I tried to give this feedback on the Ring site, but that thing seems almost designed to frustrate that sort of thing, so here goes here. The instructions for doing the \"learning mode\" seem clear, if as the writer, you're a bit of a slacker, but a key part of it isn't thought through. Judging by some of the negative reviews, many others are having problems because of this. The key part is this: It's not clear when the device is and isn't in \"test\/learning\" mode! Since the setup screens have this one picture with a big black arrow pointing at a button, they will press it. This puts the device into \"test\/learn\" mode. THEN, when they are subsequently prompted to press the button, they are taking the device out of \"test\/learn\" mode! Such users will then dutifully go through the test, and see the red light reacting to the sounds, but the test will never successfully complete.I finally figured this out. This tells me that the setup instructions for this product were not thoroughly tested by genuine users unfamiliar with the device. On the surface, it looks like ok instructions. However, there needs to be more and earlier explanation, combined with better feedback from the device and app when things aren't going the correct way. The app should be getting a signal about the sound detection without the alarm detection, so it can warn the user the device is in the wrong state. Instead, the reacting lights fool the user into think the device is in the test\/learn state.I hope someone at Ring gets this feedback, looks at some of the negative reviews, and thinks a little more deeply about this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663545600000}

Background: I have a kiddie combo smoke\/CO alarm that I wanted to put the listener next to.  The instructions say to put it within 6 inches and the arrow on the mounting bracket pointing towards the smoke alarm. My listener paired with the ring base station successfully.  Then I installed as instructed, at 6 inches using their template.  During the test the listener blinks red in unison with the smoke alarm chimes (which is a good thing) so it seemed like it heard the alarm ok. But the Ring App didn't recognize a successful test.  So I spent an hour on the phone with the Ring tech (he was very patient :)  ).  We finally figured out that I have to put the listener right next to the smoke alarm (again with the arrow pointing towards the alarm) in order for the listener test to show success in the ring app. Unfortunately, now I need to remove the mounting bracket, fill the holes, drill new holes immediately next to the smoke, and remount.  Grrr  And hopefully my hearing will recover from all the testing of the alarm.  Aside from that, I love not having to replace all my relatively new, wired, functioning smoke alarms with smart alarms...  and just using a listener instead.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1550448000000}

If the fire alarm goes off, the \"listener\" picks it up and trips the alarm, causing the monitoring company to automatically call the fire department and dispatch them. The volunteer fire department is not free. If they are dispatched it is an automatic $800.00, fire or not. It was about 10:00 p.m. inthe evening, we were home. The fire alarm beeped.....a warning that the battery needed replacing. The \"listener\" heard that, tripped the alarm, and instantly the monitoring company dispatched the fire department. In the meanwhile we frantically disarmed the system and called the monitoring company to cancel the alarm. The lady REFUSED to cancel the alarm! We BEGGED her, PLEADED with her, explaining repeatedly that the alarm was just a battery notification. She absolutely refused to cancel the alarm and HUNG UP ON US! What? HUNG UP? The fire department showed up. We apologized and sent them back home to their families. We paid the $800.00 bill when it came a week later. We threw the \"listener\" in the garbage.

Obviously, the X-Sense are brand new and recent vintage. I spent over an hour on the phone with a Ring representative trying to get it to test OK on my cell phone, and they finally gave up and shipped me a new one. The same thing happened with the second one. Finally, the second Ring representative I talked with said that unless the smoke alarm emits a certain type of signal, it is not compatible with the Ring sensor, and probably the X-Sense are not compatible. The representative said there is something on the Ring website about this, but all the Amazon website (where I bought it from) says is that this is compatible with \"an existing smoke and\/or carbon monoxide detector 10 years old or less that complies with all applicable standards\". I purchased the smoke detector brand new from Amazon and it is apparently not compatible with this Ring sensor. This is frustrating as I spend over two hours trying to get this to work, and the first Ring representative I talked with did not know about the incompatibility.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1699833600000}

The problem is that there is no time to then disarm the alarm to prevent the fire department from being dispatched.  In the middle of cooking (and perhaps lightly charring something on the stove, the air fryer or in the oven) my extremely sensitive fire alarms start going off, the Ring system starts alarming and then my phone rings - all at the same time.  I attempt to use the Ring app to disarm the alarm but so far it has never worked.  I have to step outside to speak with the Ring dispatcher while it is absolute chaos in my house.  (Luckily I have been able to find my phone each time but one of these days my phone may be in another room.)  I guess this is the way that it is supposed to work if your home is really on fire but...I set my very sensitive fire alarms off at least once or twice a month.  Anyway, the process is very stressful so we are uninstalling the listener for now unless Ring updates the system to allow for a self-monitoring option.  We would like the ability to have at least 5 minutes to disarm the system before the Ring monitoring center dispatches the fire department.

I held listener on ceiling before mounting at less than 3 inches and it did not detect the smoke alarm sounding which was odd.  The sound from a Nest Protect is loud.

{"reviewTitle":"Good for Whole House Smoke\/CO Systems","reviewDescription":"With Ring, you have two choices when it comes to alerting you and others that smoke or CO is in the house:  a First Alert smoke\/CO detector with Z-wave technology or this listener.  The first actually detects a problem, and this listener waits for other detectors to go off before reporting the problem.  Because I have a hard-wired system where every alarm goes off when one does, the listener was the most cost-effective.  I need only one listener instead of several detectors placed throughout the house.  If we didn't have a whole-house system, then I would have gotten one listener for each floor since it still would have been fewer devices than if I placed new detectors in every bedroom and hallway.As with all Ring security devices, this listener was a breeze to install and activate.  Just follow the instructions on the app, and it's added to your list within minutes.  The most time consuming part is installing it 6\" or less from an existing detector.  That is as difficult as drilling holes and screwing the base in.  If you have a hard-wired, whole-house system, you can select any alarm to place it next to, even in an out-of-the-way location.  Note:  If you are connected to Ring's service, make sure you follow the instructions to put it in test mode so that it doesn't trigger a response.I love my Ring security system, and this listener add functionality that I didn't expect when I first bought into the system.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1564185600000}

However, with a larger number of sensors I had going on in my house, there were also some connection issues \/ low signal issues which seem to drain the batteries faster than expected.

You may need to move the sensor around the alarm for optimized performance. With the sensors facing away from the alarm it was hit or miss if the sensor recognized the alarm signal.  And place the sensor within 3 inches.I know my setup may be a little over kill. My house has interconnected alarms in each room. I am using two Ring listeners one on the main floor and one in the basement.  If an alarm goes off all device signal an alarm. I figure if one listen fails the other one should trigger.

However, this Ring Alarm Smoke and CO Listener is a whole different story. Arguably the worst product ever put together by Amazon in my opinion. It was part of my Ring Alarm package so no point returning. Expect a $40 battery operated paper weight.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1591920000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Only will listen to one device and wouldn't hear any of the newer ones we have","reviewDescription":"I bought 2 of these thinking they were combined units that would listen for both CO and smoke.  That is not the case, apparently it only listens for one sound.  If it is a combined unit it might work.  However, it would not hear the 3 year old combined unit I have.  It also would not hear a ~7 year old smoke detector.  Sorry I bought them now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1568073600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Peace of Mind, Respond to a Fire Faster or While You Are Away, But Not Perfect","reviewDescription":"This Ring Alarm device is far from perfect, but is a great way to add fire\/CO alerting and response to your home monitoring and existing Ring Alarm service.  Where properly installed with working fire detection systems and tested, and with monitoring, it should alert emergency response much faster than a neighbor noticing an externally visible fire while you are away, or you getting out and then calling the fire department after it is safe to do so.  I'd still call anyway, not blindly expect that alerting worked.LISTENER NOT DETECTOR:The key difference here is that it is just a \"listener\", not a detector.  It does not do any detection of smoke, fire, or CO levels itself.  Otherwise I suspect it would have to comply with a lot more testing and regulation, 10-year battery life requirements (which this does not have), and would have to be completely replaced every 10 years or so (see current advice & regulations for smoke & CO detectors).  So this one just buddies up to existing detectors that do comply, and listens for the alarm from that device.  It can tell whether it is next to a Fire\/Smoke or CO detector by the technically unique sound each make.  Supposedly \"temporal 3\" is used by fire alarm, and \"temporal 4\" is used by CO gas alarms, and it can tell the difference, and respond with different emergency protocols (but not that you can control).INSTALLATION:There is a simple back plate to mount on a wall with screws.  It doesn't come with double-sided tape for alternative easier installation (not sure why not), but is easy enough to make a mark with the back plate and drill 2 holes.  It can only be installed in one direction facing your existing detector, has an arrow on the back plate itself, and must be placed 3 to 6 inches from your existing detector and pointed towards the right direction to listen for it.  Just add to your ring service through the Ring app as usual, scan the QR code, and put it into test mode to make sure it recognizes the detector sounding, and then mark it done.  It comes with an easy to replace Panasonic CR123A Industrial Lithium battery, comes fully charged, and the Ring app will tell you when the battery gets low or sensor goes offline.DRAWBACKS:(1) They can only be placed within 3-6 inches of your existing detectors, and facing a certain way.  Thsi might not be ideal on some surfaces that you might not want to disturb.  I wish it would just listen like all the Echo devices that have a setting that can alert you if a smoke or CO alarm goes off in your house.  I'd prefer it to hear high pitched sirens from anywhere in the house and alert me to look into it.(2) Unless your existing detectors are networked together so that when one sounds then all sound, you would have to have one of these listeners for every single smoke or CO detector that you want to be alerted for.(3) With monitoring, you have only one chance to avoid a false alarm for smoke, and none for CO.  I really want them to call my home and my emergency contacts first like they would do for a break-in sensed by the other alarm sensors.  For their response protocol, look up their topic \"Getting a Call from Ring\u2019s Professional Monitoring Center\" that details their procedure.  As of this review, for smoke, they call your 1st contact with a chance to cancel, then emergency response, then your 2nd & 3rd contacts.  For CO they dispatch emergency response first, then your emergency contacts.(4) I really worry about false alarms for the smoke detector near the kitchen when something accidentally burns on the stove but is taken care of, yet the smoke detector goes off.  I have my 1st contact as my home phone so I have a reasonable chance to intercept, but it still worries me being my only chance.  My alternative is to put listeners only in places that aren't likely to have false alarms, which adds risk.(5) To test any of your existing smoke or CO detectors, you must either remove batteries from all your listeners or put them into test mode.  I think it will be easy to forget while testing them once in a while to make sure they still work.  Or someone else who doesn't know my Ring system could test it and not know.  CO test accident will trigger a false alarm.  So I worry a bit.(6) Although combined Smoke & CO detectors exist, if you look into it, their ideal locations are very different (where smoke gathers versus where CO gathers) and so you are more likely to have separate units, doubling your need for these.SUMMARY:Certainly better than having no monitoring, and gives me peace of mind.  I just think it could be more flexible, and have a high tolerance protocol to avoid false alarms.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1567900800000}
{"reviewTitle":"A little twitchy - makes me nervous","reviewDescription":"I have First Alert interconnected smoke and CO detectors. I was told by Ring support that they would give me a call first if the fire alarm signal was detected, but they would immediately dispatch fire department if CO alarm is detected. False smoke alarms happen from time to time, so it is nice to know that I could cancel it. However, during test mode I noticed that it falsely detected a CO alarm when my talking detector shouts \"EVACUATE!\" (4 syllables -> 4 tones -> CO alarm). I had to spin the speaker of the alarm a little further away from the sensor until this stopped happening. This means that if I wasn't careful about placement, it could have immediately dispatched fire department on the first false smoke alarm. Also pressing the test button on any smoke alarm will trigger both fire alarm and CO alarm. If you're not careful about first putting the sensor in test mode, that could also cause a visit from the fire department. I feel a little nervous using this device. That's a shame because this detector was the main reason why I bought into the Ring system in the first place. All I really wanted was to be notified of issues if I am away from home.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1605571200000}
