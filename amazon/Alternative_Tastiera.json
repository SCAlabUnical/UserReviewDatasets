{"reviewTitle":"Great as a First Mech Board - But Be Wary","reviewDescription":"I've owned two of these boards since my initial purchase back in 2016, one of which had blue switches and a solid red LED backlight, that one lasted me nearly 2 years and functioned quite well before I decided to sell it to someone else, as it was still in perfect working order, but I had decided I wanted a red switch board as clickly blues were not favorable when living with other people and being a nocturnal gamer. I tried other boards in this pricing category, one of which was full size, and in being full size, much too large for my setup, the other being darn near perfect, other than the D key breaking on me after only a mere six months. After those two expeditions my friend gifted me my current keyboard, this exact K552. I have no receipt or any proof of purchase, hence my frustration when, within a mere two months of ownership, the E key, the most frequently used key in the English language, begins to malfunction. It chooses to either not register, double press, or function normally, with no real change in method of usage. Cheaper mech boards seem much more prone to this kind of issue than others, but this is by far the most frustrating malfunction I have ever encountered. This is to serve as both a review, and possible open letter to Redragon to see if my issue can be resolved in any way. Now, onto the more common reviewing style of pros, cons, and meh.Pros:PriceRed switches feel great and function amazing for gaming, especially after about a month of break-inTKL layout is amazing for desk spaceFeels solidKey sounds are not \"clicky\" but also not exactly \"thocky\" like more expensive boards, it's a nice in betweenCons:Quality Control (I will restate the gripe of my E key breaking after a mere two months of ownership)Keycaps can get shiny after only a few monthsMeh:Lighting is RAINBOW, not RGB (be aware of this when buying, it is fixed colors)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1612915200000}

{"reviewTitle":"A little heavy, keys have gaps in them but you can get used to it","reviewDescription":"When I first ordered this keyboard I immediately thought \"ok I'm going to have to send this back\" because of the spacing between the keys. I am used to other Logitech keyboards where the spacing between keys arent so exaggerated. That being said, I felt it was only fair to try to give the keyboard a test run for a couple of weeks and see what I thought. I'm happy to say that I have been able to adjust to the spacing. The keys have a type of \"tangy\" sound to them, a bit of a mechanical spring type tang that resonates throughout the keyboard, especially on the space and backspace button. There really is no tactical click feed-back, they feel very reminiscent to just a normal red or brown. Sound-wise, it's nott entirely obnoxious. I wouldn't bring it into an open office cubicle setting though. The keyboard itself is incredibly heavy and hefty for its size. The actual thickness of the keyboard base is very large compared to any membrane keyboard (to be expected) but it almost feels like they've put additional weights in this thing somewhere. If you are looking for a good keyboard to have on the coffee table to move back and forth from your lap, this might not be it for you.The other complaint: the software. My goodness, you would think in 2020, they would have a software that supports windows 10. This does not offer support for windows 10 and says \"Device not detected!\"  Leaves a bad taste in your mouth because you feel like you've bought a rebranded keyboard that was originally released in 2007 ish during windows 7 days. Even after adjusting to the keyboard and giving it a couple of weeks run I am considering sending it back due to lack of quality.Edit: I wanted to come back and update this from 2\/5 to 3\/5 because I ended up getting really used to the way it types and sure enough I can now type on it fluidly without having to look down at the keys, I did get used to the functions. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars if the software actually worked correctly on windows 10. There's also other questionable functions that I still don't know about and that I'd honestly have to google, namely the \"disable win key while gaming\" function and others. I find when I cut the power off from the PSU on my computer, the lighting on the keyboard changes for some reason. And this only happens sometimes. I don't use any of the flashy wavy RGB things, I just want all keys illuminated at all times. There is a setting for this, but I find myself having to revert the keyboard (using a weird FN+INS button combo) constantly after having the computer turned off over night. That alone is pretty annoying.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1592352000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Needs to be modded to be good, but can be VERY GOOD modded.","reviewDescription":"Edit: After using the K552 for a while I decided to update this review. I stand buy what I said below but I want to emphasize how much the board can be improved with a few simple mods. I purchased some budget switches, a sheet of PE foam and some little o-rings and after some a little work (the fun kind of work) my keyboard sounds and feels FANTASTIC. I still wouldn't recommend it as an out of the box keyboard but for this price you'd have a hard time finding a comparable TKL modding platform. While its true that my board came with a defect that made the function key less useful I'm sure they would have replaced the board if I hadn't already made so many modifications.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you just need a regular keyboard and you're not interested in the cool stuff you can do with a mechanical keyboard then you're probably better off with whatever you can find for $10.If you want an off the shelf mechanical keyboard this probably isn't for you, it sounds awful, its hollow, plasticy, loud and there's a lot of ping sound coming from the metal plate. The keycaps are ugly.WHERE THIS KEYBOARD REALLY SHINES is as a platform for modding. You can swap out the switches and keycaps with something that feels good, it's easy to open up and install sound dampening, any of the popular mods that work on plate mounted mechanical keyboards are available here. After all the modding and customization I've done I LOVE this keyboard.The only real problem I have encountered that I couldn't fix is that using the function key use WASD in place of the arrow keys doesn't work well, every time I try it either fails or gets stuck so that I cant type anymore.

{"reviewTitle":"Long term review: kinda worth","reviewDescription":"I'm writing this review almost a year after buying this keyboard.Know you reviewer: This was my first mechanical keyboard. I use it for typing (a lot) and gaming (strategy mostly, not fast paced FPS). I'm a touch typist but I don't think that it affects how I feel about this keyboard.***** LONG TERM FAILURES *****When it arrived the F2 key did not work. Since the switches are not hot swappable, fixing this would require some soldering knowledge apparently, which I don't have, not the tools to do it, nor acquaintances that can. Whatever, I can deal, although it was really annoying. Note that I didn't refund because I imported this to a country far away from the US.After a year of use:* The S key is failing. Sometimes it registers 2 or even 3 presses after pressing it only once. Very annoying. Cleaning the caps helps a bit, but only a tiny bit.* The spacebar is failing. Is does this super annoying thing where I press it, it does not register, but after 2 or 3 presses of other keys it register an additional press. So I end up with many double spaces that I must go back to correct. Very annoying.***** PERFORMANCE *****Well I really really like typing on it. It's really satisfying. A good purchase in that regard. As for gaming, well I don't really play action packed games so I can't really comment on that. I was concerned at first that I would find it cumbersome or would take some time to adjust but I didn't. It was a really easy to pick up.***** BUT IT'S CHEAP *****It was cheap, and it was mechanical. I really liked using it to type during this time, in fact, I'm using it right now! Although I certainly did no expect it to fail so quickly. Maybe I was wrong to expect all keys to work after a year at this price point, but I don't like it.In my opinion, this could be a good entry point to mechanical keyboards if it's your first time. Personally, I have decided to upgrade to the $100 price point, and bought a keyboard with those fancy cherry mx switches. Maybe in another year I'll write a review if it was actually worth it or not.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1615680000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Eh, you get what you pay for.","reviewDescription":"I've only had this keyboard for about a week now and I game on it daily.  I didn't need to replace my old keyboard, it was just an old Logitech G19 I bought used back in 2009. It's a membrane keyboard so I really wanted to relive my childhood and see what the hype is about with mechanical keyboards.This is amazing for typing,  I started a one note daily journal the day I got this keyboard just as an excuse to keep typing with this thing. It feels great and the tactile feel is unmatched by membrane keyboards.I've never had a high end Cherry MX keyboard,  so this is my first experience with mechanical keys since middle school.After playing some world of War craft pretty heavily for a week,  my Q key (strafe left in game) has noticeably become extremely sensitive as to just the weight of my finger lightly resting on it awaiting to press it sometimes causes it to activate.I'm not sure if it's just wearing in at this point,  but it's been only a week so far ...... I think they included like 4 replacements in the box,  maybe stiffer would be nice, otherwise I can just try to buy better switches.Right now I don't recommend it for gaming,  my E key is also going down the same road with sensitivity, it's my right strafe so not surprised.But hey for $30 this is a nice keyboard to type on that looks great.I made my G19 my backup but I may switch back and use this as a backup,  it is comparing a previously $200 keyboard, even with age to a $30 new one.I do enjoy the mechanical feedback after gaming so I may just look for more expensive gaming mechanical keyboards.Take care,  if you're on a budget this will be just fine until you can upgrade","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1621900800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Metal reverberation sours the mechanical feel.","reviewDescription":"This may have just been a bad \"batch\" so to say, as I use a Redragon K582, and have been since October. It has wonderful quality and though the switches need replacing more often than I would like, I am confident in stating that I would buy again, which I did when I wanted more desk space, opting for a change of aesthetic with the white board and ditching the numpad for the space.The main thing to note is that though the switches are indeed reds, and do perform as such, whatever metal the board is bottomed with, or perhaps the more open space beneath, causes a noticeable metallic reverberation so to say whenever a key is released, almost like a cacophony of tiny bells if you type quickly. This is not the best description for it, but I can't think of any other way to say it. It is almost like the sound of very loud springs snapping back into shape. While novel at first, after the first minute or so, it gets extremely distracting and quite annoying for anyone listening in another room or over a discord\/zoom call. It may just be that the springs are more prone to reverberation, mixed with the metal board, that pushes it over from cool clicks, to the sounds of metal banging. If that does not make sense, I have attached a video to showcase what I mean. You can hear hints of the metallic reverb in the other keyboard, but the K552 is much more noticeable, though I should note that the audio does not pick it up very well, it is much more noticeable in person. I used the same amount of force, though it may sound like I was tapping more forcefully on the K552 due to the key differences.As a side note the RGB lighting also stopped working after about 4 days of use, which leads me to believe this may just be a fluke board.Overall, this may be more so a matter of personal opinion, and if you don't mind, or even enjoy the metal reverb sound, then feel free to pick this one up. Red dragon is usually quality, but in this case I would not recommend this board in particular. Pick up a K582 if you are willing to spend a tad bit more.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1619913600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Amazing price, not too loud; mechanical ping noise though","reviewDescription":"I am not a gamer! I just type a lot and love the sound and feel. I was really excited about this keyboard because it's my first keyboard ever, and for only $40 i get the rgb, arrow keys, and click clack noise i was looking for. The keys have a really nice resistance to them, and it's loud enough to be satisfying without my roommates hearing it! This keyboard is fantastic for anyone who isn't even sure they want a keyboard--gives you everything you need for very cheap.However, there is a very annoying mechanical ping noise after I press each key. I've only had this keyboard for 2 days! It isn't just if I press one key loudly -- every single key has a resounding ping to it that I hear while i type. I think you could fix this by lubing the keys, but I have no desire to buy the lubing tools or spend time taking apart every key. If I play music I can't hear the pings, so I'm probably going to be playing a lot of music until I save up enough money for a better keyboard.Also, I am not a switch expert, but from what i've heard these definitely sound closer to cherry reds than blues -- not nearly as clicky or loud as the blue audios I've heard.It's very upsetting there is that constant ping, because otherwise this is a perfect steal and definitely the best starter keyboard out there for only 40$. I have no complaints otherwise. I'm just sad I have to turn on music every time I want to type so i don't go crazy from the ringing noise -- maybe my ears are just particularly sensitive.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1618617600000}

In general, I like the white option as it's vastly different from anything I've ever had and the colors really pop on a white platform.This thing is sturdy! Not talking about the switches, just the keyboard overall. It's quite heavy which inspires confidence.Color modes and brighness. These are fun. I find myself mostly using the \"fixed\" or steady lit mode. Or the one where it ripples out from each keypress. The brightness is quite good and is adjustableThe clicky clackety is satisfying. This is my first mechanical keyboard so I can't compare it to anything else but it's fun to type on. Not sure if the \"fun\" factor will last long term or not but for now I find it enjoyableCons:This is not a color customizable keyboard! Each row is lit with a set color and this cannot be changed! They haven't necessarily marketed it this way but It was something I missed when ordering. So you can change the modes which dictate how the keys light up but not what color. Stuck with Red, Blue, Orangey-Red, Green, Orange, and Purple in descending order.The keys sit up high, not typically an issue (and maybe I just have fat palms) but my right palm consistently makes contact with the ctrl and copy keys when typing, specifically when hitting backspace (which can be quite often). This has made typing somewhat infuriating.Overall:I have decided to return this keyboard and will be going with the Logitech G213 prodigy. That keyboard is not mechanical (membrane I think) but still has a satisfying sound and has the full spectrum of RGB to choose from for the keys. Plus it has a numeric keyboard which I have decided is important to me.

{"reviewTitle":"My 1 year review of using this keyboard.","reviewDescription":"No, that's not a mistake, those are only two stars. Most Amazon reviews are for brand new devices, this review is not. I purchased the red switch version in October of 2022 and it is now October 2023 as I write this.I do appreciate that this keyboard doesn't require software, features are controlled by the keyboard itself. Although the colors of the keys are fixed and cannot be changed. Individual key's lights can be turned on and off. There are 6 brightness settings from lights off to the brightest.I have used this keyboard for both work and play so it has seen some heavy use. I use this keyboard at the second from zero brightness setting, this results in up to five keys which change states between flickering or being dim. Typing now seems as if keys sometimes have higher actuation force or distance required. When this keyboard worked it did so quite well since I was able to play Doom Eternal's expansions which require extremely fast paced and coordinated controls.I was hoping for a longer lifetime but I guess the extremely low price means corners have to be cut somewhere. It's not like my keyboard is terribly broken, I can still play games well, but lots of typing definitely feels broken with missed keystrokes. Maybe Redragon can do a newer revision of this keyboard to resolve these problems. I still recommend this keyboard for gamers, but heavy use workers should look elsewhere.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696550400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Key failure wrecks an otherwise great product","reviewDescription":"I needed a keyboard with F-keys and without the number pad, preferably cheap, so I bought this. It's painfully close to being an amazing keyboard for the price but build quality fails it (more on that later).--- If it weren't defective ---First though, how would I review if this keyboard was not defective?  I own a number of mechanical keyboards, both modern and vintage so I will compare it to those: The switches are a bit higher pressure than I prefer and the tactile effect is close to a buckling spring which again I don't really prefer, but both of those are personal preference. As mechanical switches go they don't feel cheap or inconsistent so if you like the pressure and the tactile effect you will be happy with them. It's clacky, which I like. It closely resembles the typing feel of an old IBM Model M which many people like so it's a win in that department, the clacky souund on this one is less metallic than on the IBM. Compared to more modern mechanical keyboards it fits right in with the heavier switched models. If you told me this keyboard cost twice as much as I paid for it I would believe you. At the price point it really can't be beat and would be five stars if it worked properly.--- The defect ---About a month and a half into using it the U key on mine started by registering multiple presses every time it was pressed, now it requires multiple presses to register at all, sometimes it appears after you've pressed another key, and even then sometimes spits out three or four in succession. It happened more than a month after I got it so the return window had passed and I can't seem to find any way to warranty it. The worst part, my non-gaming operating system is Ubuntu.To demonstrate the problem I will type \"ubuntu\" several times in succession at normal typing speed: ubunt ubuuntuu buntu ubuntu buntu bnut---Conclusion---Since I couldn't find any kind of support or warranty so I guess I am stuck with it. If you're looking for an inroads to mechanical keyboards there are better options for $10-15 more and I would suggest spending the extra. This still mostly works for me as only a gaming board since I don't use the 'u' key that much and I can always switch to another keyboard, but if you're looking to buy a keyboard for typing and everyday use buy one with proper warranty support, because while thirty bucks is a great price for a keyboard it's a terrible price for a paperweight.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1510704000000}

I was looking for a tenkeyless board to go along with my Ducky Shine 2 full size board.  My several years old Ducky board is exceptionally well made, with nice bright single color LEDs with Cherry MX switches.  My Ducky shine board was about 160usd at time of purchase.  You can buy about 4 of these for the price I paid for my Ducky Shine 2.  While this board is not quite as well built (ie. Better quality shell, better key caps, and real cherry mx switches on Ducky)  this board comes very very close and within striking distance and punches well about its weight and price tier.The LEDS are just as nice as my old board with very granular adjustments of led brightness from yep its on to very very bright.  It it solid with pretty much no flex.  The board has rubber strips on the bottom to keep it from sliding and two pivot feet if you want the board raised.  The only reason this board is getting 4 and not five stars is for the mechanical switch.  Don't get me wrong its a true mechanical switch which is very nice to use and type on especially for this price point.  I just personally feel spoiled from my older MX Cherry branded switches.  The average person typing on both would probably feel little difference between them, however I think the switches are a step down from MX Cherry's but again this is the single reason this board can sell at this price point.So to sum up.  This is a great true mechanical switch red LED backlit keyboard that 90% of the public looking for an inexpensive mechanical switch board would probably be absolutely satisfied with.  Its really hitting far about its price point.  Those looking to give mechanical switches a try don't hesitate to give this one a go.Edit:  After just 2 days of use one of the keys on works now on occasion.  The left arrow key when pressed works about once every ten key presses.  The key must be pressed very hard to actuate if it does at all.

Each time I've removed the key and inspected under it and try to clear it out with air, but generally I don't see anything that looks like it should make the key presses not register. I keep my computer area clean and there's no random food crumbs\/grease or beverages being spilled on the keyboard, nor is there dirt or anything else that should be causing the issue. Today I finally gave up on it after the W key because more unresponsive than how it normally is when I have an issue with a key, and my attempts to fix the issue didn't do anything.I'm not a fan of the 'gamer aesthetic', so I appreciate that you can mostly turn off the lights and it's very easy to do. You can't entirely turn them off, but you can at least make it so keys will only illuminate for a couple seconds or so after you press them, and on this setting they didn't bother me even when I was playing Condemned: Criminal Origins with the lights off.Overall typing on it feels nice. I was still getting used to have sensitive the spacebar was, and had a high number of accidental presses - especially early on. I don't know if mechanical keyboards are normally like that (this is my first one), and it's not necessarily a bad thing, just something I had to adjust to.Overall I mostly really liked the keyboard, but my issue with the WASD keys frequently becoming unresponsive is why I dropped it to 2 stars.

My son wanted an all green steady light, but that is not possible, he is stuck with a rainbow color scheme.

It gets incredibly annoying and makes it near useless for gaming, I've had to bind my jump to scroll wheel for most games. If the support window wasn't closed I would have tried to get this thing replaced. This review also took much longer to write than it should have because of the space bar issues.

The short wide boxy letters used on this keyboard seem to blend into each other, might be cute for gamers etc. but I use the keyboard for work and editing etc.The way that the keyboard has the 2nd function next to the the number keys 1-0 is odd and harder to read vs above and below like a normal keyboard makes them harder to find.

This in a way defeats the purpose of the lighted keyboard in the 1st place.  As I edit using the run, pause, stop, sound up and down etc.  I would like to see those keys back lighted too.

{"reviewTitle":"You get what you pay for","reviewDescription":"I will preface this by admitting I only used this for a day but after reading the 1-3 star reviews my experience is similar to others. This is an ok keyboard with some cheap design flaws.Pros:Cheap, mechanical, very cool RGB backlit system with tons of presets, sturdy\/heavyCons:You'll notice the cheapness immediately as others have pointed out with the switches. For whatever reason the switches are extremely sensitive even to the lightest pressure. On top of that there is a fundamental issue with them registering more than 1 press and with chattering (i.e. you press a but s registers due to vibration of a triggering s next to it). So many times I'd be playing a FPS game and my character would randomly start strafing to the side despite me not pressing A or D.These are not cherry red switches. They are a cheap knockoff which is why this keyboard sells for $30-40.Overall I'm bummed because finding an affordable mechanical keyboard, that's not too tactile, for gaming is very hard. I was impressed by this keyboard's sturdy weight and RGB design but the switches ruin it for me. I plan to return it and go back to my crappy default dell until I can find something better.P.s. if you're stuck with this keyboard I recommend changing your windows settings so the key press delay is long. This helps with the registering more than one button press issue because windows counts a full second or two before it allows a key to register a second time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1614556800000}

I'd say it's a solid choice for the price - feels fairly sturdy and well made, and I haven't had any problems with durability or consistency. Personally, I find the LED colors a bit ugly (they're not in the usual order of the color spectrum) but maybe that's just me.My last keyboard had blue switches which were very loud and clacky. I wanted something quieter, so I picked this keyboard with red switches. And it certainly is quiet - especially with rubber O rings, it has probably less sound than a normal membrane keyboard. The problem for me is the actuation force.The amount of force required to activate the keys is unbelievably light. This is nice for typing, but not so much for playing games. Most people, I think, tend to rest their fingers on the WASD keys when idle. You can't really do that with this keyboard - even the lightest touch will set them off. I got used to it after a while, so it's not an insurmountable problem, but even after 6-7 months I still find myself occasionally swerving in a random direction because I settled my finger just a little to heavily on a key. And I still sometimes accidentally use ability because my finger brushed a key just a little too hard. It's not often, but still noticeable.

The reason I rated it 2 stars is because I wanted a really clicky mechanical keyboard. It is very clicky but every time you press a key you can hear the springs inside the keyboard vibrate. This becomes annoying after some time. Also the keys have a tendency to toggle. Basically what that is (for all the people that aren't keyboard obsessed) is the keyboard will thing that you are holding down a key even though you aren't holding it at all. for an example go to a word document on your computer and press and hold any key down. It will make a bunch of letters right? Now picture it doing that but your not even holding the  key. Thats what happens with this keyboard at random times. Besides those thing this a really god keyboard. Nice lights, nice structure, it has stands in case you want to work or game with the keyboard at an incline. I will mention this is my first ever redragon product, and it was not a very good first impression. I will not be returning this keyboard as it is new, but I will not be buying anymore redragon products. My new keyboard is coming in tomorrow and it is a razor.

However, The right shift key did not work unless I pounded on the key, but it wouldn't work again after lifting finger. I decided to pull the switch clean it and swamp it with the page file key (who uses that anyway?). I think it was just a bad contact because both keys worked flawlessly after that. However, I really missed the num pad. I use the keyboard for both work and gaming, and I use the num pad often enough for CAD work. I decided to return it mostly on the basis that I already had to repair a key. The brightness is fine. I think it is bright enough where everything pops and is not distracting when looking at the screen. I don't need to light up a room with it like some reviews seem to complain about. There is a very audible ping, but that diminishes a bit if you do not use the foldable legs to prop up the keyboard and use a pad below the keyboard. In research, though it seems like ping is pretty normal. I use headphones most of the time while on my computer, so it doesn't really affect me much. I ordered the K551 instead.

{"reviewTitle":"I really enjoy typing on this keyboard so I ordered another for work.","reviewDescription":"I'm a software engineer and can type anywhere from 85 - 110 WPM and those who code know the challenge of hitting special characters frequently; I should never miss a ; end line now :). I use to use an apple wireless keyboard with the chiclet style keys extensively the past several years and didn't realize that was slowing down my typing. I actually purchased this keyboard for gaming at home but then bought another for work since I noticed a huge improvement in my typing speed. The reason I didn't purchase a mechanical keyboard is due to the windows vs command key. The only mechanical keyboard I've found that has the command key is a das keyboard that is > $100 which is way over budget; can get 3 of these awesome keyboards for the price of one das. I've gotten use to using the windows key as the command with my pinky rather than the left thumb on command. I use both windows and mac so the switch has been great and it took a couple days to get use to replacing the thumb for command and using pinky for it but it has also made my windows typing much better since I use my pinky for windows anyway. For those who can't give up their mac specific keyboard should look into buying one of these since you will make it work due to how awesome the keys feel. It's identical to the more expensive cherry ones. I won't feel bad if this keyboard breaks a year later since it's only $30 and the ones that have the common cherry switches cost > $50. The apple wireless keyboard is double the price of this...# Pros- Identical to cherry switch that other more expensive keyboards use such as Das.- Increased my typing speed by at least 15 WPM.- Tactile feedback you do not get with chiclet style keyboards.- Solid and quality made. It's heavy so it won't move around the desk. Has nice grippy rubber pads too.- Don't have to switch between the apple wireless keyboard and the windows keyboard since I use the same one off the KVM now.- I don't have to recharge and replace the batteries in the wireless apple keyboard since this is corded. Got so sick of replacing batteries just to have wireless when it's going to sit on the desk anyway so it was pointless. The apple keyboard would lose connection with the bluetooth too so again, it was pointless.- Compact size is better than a full size keyboard. Removing the number pad provides a better ergonomic experience which prevent strains due to widening the arms with the mouse. Research this if you don't believe me. Some ergonomic keyboards put the number pad on the left side of the keyboard.- Best bang for the buck. Amazing value so I purchased 2 of them. Perhaps all the big brands such as Das will lower their price since this one seems to own the Amazon market right now. It's 2018, people who are sane know that a mechanical keyboard shouldn't cost > $100. C'mon, the IBM Model M in the 1980's original price was around $250 but that's some dated technology! It's like paying the same price for an OLED TV for a tube tv. Who they trying to fool and that is why Redragon is here. They know the other manufacturers are price gouging.# Cons- None so far.# Neutral- My coworkers find it distracting since it's loud but they can put headphones on. A mechanical keyboard is... loud.- Noticed some sound interference with my Logitech speaker setup at home. It sounds kind of cool because the breathing effect will also output in the speaker. Breathing will make it sound like a badass intro to a sci-fi action scene (think star wars lightsaber) and the solid light will make an ongoing high pitch noise. This is probably an issue with the KVM I use to switch between mac and pc. I don't have this issue with the pc but when I switch it over to the mac the interference occurs.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1537747200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Wonderful keyboard and value.  This is my new favorite mechanical, and I have lots.","reviewDescription":"I love this keyboard so much.  I have no idea how they are able to sell it for so little but I'm glad they do.  Good work, Redragon!This keyboard uses many of the exact same components and design as the, which is a few dollars cheaper at the time of this writing but does not light up.  Actually almost all the components are the same.  Basically the Redragon has a raised edge along the outside of the keyboard.  This is a downside for me as it does not allow crumbs and even liquids to run off the front, like the Tomoko does, but I think it was necessary because of the LED's...they would probably shine brightly off the edges of the keyboard if it were not for the lip.  Anyway, I'm quite certain these keyboards are made in the same factory, or from the same parts.* The key caps in both are double shot with transparent letters.  They are cheap key caps but they work fine.  Because the letters are transparent plastic they will never wear off.  On the other hand, they are not very bold when the lights are turned off.  The font is a little wonky, if you want to get picky about it...some of the letters have gaps in them as if they were from stencils.* The switches in these are great.  They are outemu blue switches, which are Cherry MX clones.  They are very slightly livelier and clickier.  I actually prefer them to the Cherry switches but if you don't own a cherry board to compare, you will not be able to tell a difference.* The switches are mounted on a metal plate, which makes the keyboard heavy and solid, with no flex.  I haven't tried it but based on the way it looks I'm quite certain you can actually disassemble the switches all the way without desoldering them or taking the keyboard apart.  Basically I think the keyboard is a DIY dream.  You can probably easily lubircate the switches or swap out the springs for stiffer or weaker ones if that is your preference.* The LED lights are very bold and bright.  When you turn the computer on they are on full brightness.  You can easily toggle the lights on and off or dim them using the keyboard (without installing any software or anything).  Red is a good color to use if you use this in a dark room because it doesn't ruin your night vision.  Basically this is a perfect gaming keyboard for playing in a dim or dark room.  Or typing, I guess.  You can find wierd keys like the ampersand in the dark using this keyboard.Like all clicky mechanical keyboards these are very loud.  There is a click as the key actuates half way down and then a clack when it bottoms out.  I like the click but I mitigate the clack using o rings under the keys.  My preference is for the thinner ones that do not make such a drastic difference in the key travel nor make the keys mushy.  For example I like the red O rings by.The cord is quite long and a little stiff.  It's not removable or anything.  It has some velcro on it you can use to bunch up the slack.  it also comes with a very cheap key puller.  useful if you have one but about as poor quality as you can get.  But no one gets this keyboard for the key puller...in fact, it is again amazing that you get one at all at this price point.Overall not a good package: a great package.  I wonder if they will raise the price when they realize how great their product is.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1524614400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Glorious and epic","reviewDescription":"So I was hesitant to purchase this at first.I had read some review somewhere on another redragon product, claiming that it was not true mechanical switches, blah blah blah.I gotta say, this is probably one of the best keyboards I have owned so far.I don't usually spend a lot on keyboards with the exception of a Razer DeathStalker Ultimate that I had bought one day to use for work (and it worked out perfectly, it literally did like 30% of my job for me lol, but it was $300 so .. IT BETTER :D ).Back to the keyboard...I was how they say. FLUUSSSHH WITTHHH CASHHH.And thought what the hell I'll try one of their \"Mechanical\" keyboards, and if its a flop, then lesson learned...Once I had the box in my hand I was already impressed.The box it comes in is nice, and I can tell the product was heavy, which is usually a good sign.Once I pulled it out, I knew that it was meant to be (that's what she said...)It is pretty thick (doesn't bother me one bit)It is heavy, (also doesn't bother me).And because its heavy, it doesn't go sliding around the desk when I type at my nutty typing speeds.The build quality is excellent, honestly, I don't know how they are making money because this thing is solid, and I bet I can weaponize it..There is no bend or give to this thing, its literally like a rock, its a thing of beauty and brings a tear to my eye.The red glow is intense and clearly visible even under the high-intensity interrogation style lighting they use at my office.And the ominous red glow looks amazing, it fits my offensive IT role perfectly (I deal mostly in heartbreak, and \"Like A Boss\" situations)The flip tabs on the bottom are heavy duty, and are super solid, like crazy solid, you flip them back and they sound like someone cocking a gun.They literally SNAP! into place, I love it, I have been known to break these things off.. That is just not happening with this keyboard..I think I might just snap them back and forth now if someone comes to bother me in the middle of an intense keyboard bonding session.The keys themselves are beautifully designed, I love the font, it's not your typical boring look.This thing says I break all the rules,And its the type of font you want to send an email with, but know you can't because you will get fired when someone realizes that you've gone beyond their realm of times of new roman, and into a whole new dimension of professionalism...They are crystal clear, no blemishes, and the glow comes through the keys perfectly, the glow underneath the keys makes it look that much cooler.The mechanical keys are solid and work exactly as you expect, whether the actuation force is exactly what it should be, I don't know.But they do the damn job, and I like to use my keyboards, not measure them in a full-on anal manner.The click is fairly loud and obvious, and there is no volume knob on it, so that is something to consider if you buy a mechanical keyboard for the office.I feel like this really does give me confidence in my high-speed typing ability as I am no longer wondering if I hit the key I wanted or if my keyboard had a derp moment (cause I don't make mistakes! YOU HEARD ME! {ok sometimes I do}).I really do blast through my typing though, with ease and a sense of accomplishment ( cause I feel accomplished when I hammer out a memo and it literally feels like I hammered it out... That is mission accomplished right there!)I am sure there are going to be moments when someone asks me questions whilst I am typing, and I am just going to keep slamming away while staring at them as I give them the look of \"I know what I am doing\", while confident clicking noises radiate from the dominion that is my office.My boss came in and just immediately went wow mode on it, he loves it and stated that it makes him want to get rid of his laptop and switch to a desktop just to have a badass keyboard like this one.I didn't mention that he could just hook it up to his laptop (MUAHAHAHA)And thus my reign over awesome keyboards stays unchallenged (as planned).Overall this thing is solid, and it makes a statement.It says, now mechanical keyboards can now be owned by anyone and not just those who are less impulsive with their money.I love it and I am going to buy 2 more, one for home (or should I call it my lair o.0) and one for my coming Mad (IT) Scientist Lab.To the manufacture: good job on an excellent product!I honestly didn't have confidence in your brand when I first made this purchase, I have never used your products but now I am a believer.And don't change the price, I am still a cheap impulsive bastard and will have to panhandle if you do.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"465 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1521763200000}
{"reviewTitle":"This product is what it claims to be!","reviewDescription":"First of all, I purchased this keyboard because I was curious at what the performance would be like. Is it great like those expensive keyboard mechanical keyboard that you can buy on the market? The answer is no, you can't expect a budget mechanical keyboard to compete with those, because they simply are not at the same level. But for less than 40 dollars, I think that this is perfectly fine for what it can offer. My version comes with the outemu red switches because I prefer linear switches; they fit better for the environment that I'm in, and they sound fine (without lubing). However, since outemu switches are basically cherry mx alternatives they are not as great. The cons are:1\/ whenever i press down on a key, I keep hearing the spring, and this is really annoying especially when I have to hear it almost every time I use the keyboard.2\/ Basically, this keyboard can only take outemu switches, so if you think that you can just replace them with cherry mx, you can't.3\/ The cable is not USB type C, it is connected directly to the keyboard, so you cannot remove it.4\/ This last one is not really a con, but the giant red dragon logo located on top of the arrow keys just don't look that great. I have seen videos of people removing this logo online, so do check them out if you also don't like it.As for the pros, you are in luck, since I think that there are more pros than cons1\/ RGB, for less than 40 bucks, you can get a keyboard that come with many options for rgb lighting, I think that this is the biggest pro so far.2\/ The keycaps are pretty solid, I mean, you can replace them as you wish, but I have seen other budget keyboards that have horrible keycaps; this one comes with solid keycaps so you don't have to worry about that.3\/ The key switches are dust proof, so I think this is also a plus for this keyboard.4\/ The sound: I don't know about the blue version, but these red switches beside the problem with the spring does sound great. Yes, they sound solid, and I would say for people with no experience with mechanical keyboard, you will not be disappointed with this as your choice.5\/ They are pretty light, and I don't know if this is a plus for many people. But for me, this means that I can bring it around to places instead of having it staying on my table 24\/7.What can I say more about this, I'm giving this product a 5 stars for value-wise, but it is not the GREATEST keyboard I've ever typed on, and within this price range, you can only get those membrane keyboards or mechanical keyboards from brands that I wouldn't trust. So yea, do get this keyboard, and if you wonder whether or not to just get the keyboard+mouse combos for gaming; NO, stay away from them, most of them are membrane, this red dragon k552 is far superior even when it doesn't come with a mouse.Thank you for your attention!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666742400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Affordable and very nice, a little noisy but can be modded","reviewDescription":"My daughter uses this keyboard, we both love it, but it's indeed loud. We've tested other keyboards including Razer, Logitech, Cosair, as well as some varieties of Chery Brown and Red, but in the end still love this Cherry-Blue clone.Tried some dampening O-rings, didn't help much, so I decided to open it up and experiment (need to remove the keycaps to access the screws holding the top plate down). Here's what I found.The noises come from:- the click of the switch itself. It is what we like over the other switches, but the keycap amplifies this click quite a lot.- the bottom-out noise when the keycap hits the switch's box. The O-ring can dampen this sound a bit, but the boxy plastic base amplifies it multiple times. Coupling with an IKEA tabletop, it sounds like hitting a drum.- the sound of the switch hitting the switch's box on the way up. You can hear this sound when you hold a key down and lift your finger up quickly (like when typing fast). Again, this sound is also amplified by the keycap.The good news is, if you take the circuit board out of its boxy plastic base, all the noises are reduced to around 25-35% (my rough estimation), the only noticeable sound is the faint click of the switch itself. If you like a really quiet keyboard, you can just make a custom base\/footing (a block of foam for example). You just need to cover the exposed circuit board on the underside, the top metal plate is pretty solid and won't bend. I'm pretty sure it's even quieter than the typical Dell keyboards at my office.However, my daughter prefers the keyboard with its base, so I tried to stuff the inside with foams, hoping to muffle it, and it seemed to work. But upon tightening the screws back in, it's noisy again. So, the noise is transmitted through the screw poles to the plastic base, then the base amplifies it. Stuffing might have helped a bit, but not noticeable.To decouple the keyboard from the screw poles, I cut pieces of foam to the same height as the screw poles and double-sided taped them to the base. The poles are of different heights, shorter near the space bar, and taller near the Function keys. When putting the keyboard back, the circuit board and top plate sit on the foams, I tightened the screws very lightly, basically the screws keep the top from jumping out rather than holding it down. This significantly reduces the noise. I also filled the base with thinner foam rods, to reduce the void space in case it does act like a speaker enclosure.The keycaps were still problematic, with the switch's click, the bottoming-out, and coming-back noise. Instead of using O-rings, I stuffed cotton ball in the keycaps, just little enough to muffle the sound, and acts as a thin layer of O-ring. The more cotton, the muffler the sound, but also shorten the travel distance. I didn't want it to interfere with the great feeling of the switch so I didn't use much. I was lazy and didn't stuff the function keys as they're rarely used, also to serve as a comparison. You'll have to experiment a bit to find the right amount to your liking. The cotton does block the backlight a bit, but not much (and don't look straight into the backlights after removing the keycaps, they're blinding).One last thing, whatever the small amount of noise left, transmitted to the tabletop and got amplified. So I rolled a thin foam bag into little feet and taped them to the keyboard, no noise from the tabletop at all.Overall, I'd definitely call it a success. She was ready to compromise for a quieter keyboard, but now more than happy to keep it. I used to be able to hear her \"smashing\" the keyboard in her room from the living room, now I can barely hear the \"light\" click if I really pay attention. She wanted the RGB version, so I'll buy one to trade with her, and probably will experiment with a custom base instead.

My major complaint is that as soon as I pulled it out of the box, it wobbles. It's uneven, so it wobbles as I'm typing on it. Extremely irritating and I'm sure it wouldn't be pleasant to game on.

Now that I am looking to return it, I see the price has been slashed ridiculously and I can see why. THIS IS NOT A GAMING KEYBOARD.My inputs are very inconsistent and unreliable, especially when I need to hold down my keys: the input flickers between registering and not. Sometime inputs are registered by simply resting your fingers on the keys even.That being said, for the price its a great general use keyboard. Its very quiet for a mechanical feeling keyboard. I just wish it hadn't been listed as a $120 gaming keyboard when I bought it. This is much more an everyday use keyboard for people who want a mechanical feel but need quieter typing and aren't looking to spend a ton of money.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1598745600000}

Buyer beware...Edit: I am upgrading my review to 3 stars after doing some research and finding a few youtube videos about the keyboard. The switches are rather easy to swap out and I did swap out the \"m\" key switch with another switch on the keyboard that I would not use as often. So, I still have one faulty switch, but the ease of the fix made me a little happier about the keyboard. I was looking at replacing the keyboard, but now I will keep it unless I more switches go out.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1572998400000}

I'm typing this on a \"Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard\" after having just returned a \"Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard\" which behaved completely differently, i.e., same model number, completely different lighting functionality.Bottom line: if you're looking for actual RGB capability, which means (or at least strongly implies) that you will be able to use Red, Green and Blue color components to set customized colors, be sure you're NOT ordering the K552 RGB model variant that says \"Rainbow\". The Rainbow's keys ARE NOT RGB, they are FIXED COLORS that can't be changed. Only the non-\"Rainbow\" K552 model variant will allow you to select from a predefined list of keycap \/ backlight colors and arrangements, as desired.Plenty of reviews here discussing the keyswitch action, which is determined by the switch \"color\" selected at the time of your order. Both keyboards are fine in this regard, i.e., they function as described.Thanks, Amazon, for supporting such a fast and painless return policy and for shipping out the replacement so quickly, all with no shipping cost.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1652227200000}

{"reviewTitle":"True mechanical keyboard -- Wish keys not so close together and it had a numeric key section","reviewDescription":"If you are looking for a mechanical keyboard, this is one. It has fairly nice feeling keys, and under each key is an outemu brand switch. The switch brand \"to have\" in the gaming world is the Cherry MX. Outemu is a competitor that manufactures a cheaper alternative -- some might call it a knock off.The Cherry MAX Blue these switches are trying to replicate have a \"clicking\" feel (and sound). This is to give you tactile feedback that you have passed the keys activation point. Some gamers like it, some don't. If you don't know then this is probably the cheapest way to find out.I can't speak to how the outemu switches feel or perform compared to Cherry MX Blue, but I can speak to the things that make this keyboard not too great for office use. They keys are just a little too close together to be a perfect fit an adult male. Also it does not have a numeric pad. I personal can live without a numpad, but the person I bought this for has learned to type using the numpad for numbers, so to them it is a foreign as using the numpad is for me.Otherwise, it is a fine keyboard. Yes it is a bit noisy. If you don't want the noise then you really aren't shopping for a mechanical keyboard and you should be looking for a \"membrane\" style keyboard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1569024000000}

The keyboard has held up and acts like a good functioning keyboard. There is still minor inconveniences like the (E) key still gets stuck on something. I haven't found the issue as the switch and key cap seem un-damaged and there wasn't any thing sticky when I took the key cap off in order to examine it.

I thought, \"Hey, it's less than $40, why not try it?\". I am so glad I did.While my DAS was a Brown, I have also used my friend's Blue. I haven't tested these two boards back to back, but this K552 is everything I remember from the DAS Blue. Very click-ey. The only things this board doesn't have that the DAS did are dedicated media controls and a num-pad. I do miss the wheel on the DAS, but the flip side is that this K552 is much more compact, and I appreciate that (my board hand and mouse hand can be closer together while gaming, which is more ergonomic for me). Also, Redragon makes other full-size keyboards with the same mechanical action and media controls, albeit at a slightly higher price-point, if you really want that.Construction is SOLID and HEAVY. I have zero concerns about the longevity of this product (though I will update my review if my experience with it proves otherwise). Also, the backlight is really nice, which was a feature missing from the DAS. It has a few brightness levels, which are intuitive to use, though I keep it on the dimmest (enough for me). And the ability to quickly disable the Windows key is a really great feature, too.Overall I am extraordinarily satisfied with my purchase so far.

Keyboards from Corsair and Logitech or even Razer that come in Tenkeyless designs and RGB cost about $99 - $129. Maybe $80 on a day where there's a good sale going.The keys are Cherry-Clones from Outemu, which means they are very similar to Cherry MX Reds. They are rated for 50 Million keystrokes, so this keyboard should be able to stand up to many years of gaming.This keyboard is a big upgrade over cheap membrane keyboards.

I just wanted something relatively cheap, compact and keys that don't feel like mush. When I removed the keyboard from the box, it had a lot more heft to it than I was expecting for an inexpensive device. Once I plugged it in, I was surprised to discover that not only did the keyboard support full n-key rollover, it actually implemented it properly. lsusb reports two HID interface descriptors: one with the boot interface subclass for BIOS\/legacy OS support and a second one which supports n-key rollover once an OS with full HID support has taken over. This is in contrast to some keyboards that do something janky like pretending to be a hub with multiple boot subclass keyboards plugged in.My biggest complaint with the keyboard is that the alternate \"media key\" functions of the F-keys are not illuminated. As a touch-typist, those are the only things I'm typically going to need to hunt and peck for, so the illumination is kind of a fail on the functional side for me. I also found the illumination to be a bit on the bright side at first, but this can be adjusted or turned off completely.As for the keys themselves, they do seem to be proper mechanical keys. Presses register well before they bottom out and make the satisfying click you would expect. Typing on this keyboard is quite noisy, probably not more so than your average mechanical switch keyboard, but I would guess more so than some of the quieter ones. I'm not much of a mechanical keyboard connoisseur so I can't really compare the key feel to actual Cherry brand switches.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1460246400000}

Blues are too weak, they never have greens in stock to try, and everything else is too quiet, or doesn't offer enough resistance.I also recently purchased a Unicomp Ultra Classic (about $85ish after shipping) from massdrop, and was horrified at the build quality. Key feedback also felt...weird...compared to my old Model M's, but I'm currently writing that off as it just not being 20+ years old.This keyboard is worth every bit of the $39.99 paid, and I'm seriously considering getting the full-sized layout version. I've gotten about 5 hours worth of typing in on it, and my only complaint so far is that the printing on the WASD keys is slightly raised, which keeps making me put my fingers in the wrong space (they're at about the same height as the F and J bumps on one of my other keyboards, so muscle memory is the real issue here.)Build quality is incredibly solid (especially compared to the Unicomp), and key feedback is exactly what I was hoping for (stiff and clicky).As far as key sound, it's not as loud as my oldschool Model M, but you can definitely put out that, \"I'm doing important things, leave me alone.\" level of key clatter. Red backlight is...red, and can be turned on or off by hitting fn+scrlk.The only other slight nitpicks are that I hate the font on the keycaps, and I'm wishing they made a version of this keyboard with the RGB option. I'm not sure if this is just a Cherry MX switch\/clone switch issue or not, but the return action on the keys sometimes feels a wee bit like the key is sticking (especially when holding the key down), but it's potentially just my imagination.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1453420800000}

Everything from cheap $10 keyboards for a TV, to my most recent favorite keyboard the Ducky Shine 5, but something about this keyboard just ticked every box of mine that makes a good keyboard. Size, Build, Key Switches, Lighting, and Response.First with the size, this is just like any 10 keyless keyboards that you have probably seen before. If you don't use the 10 keys on a keyboard it's not worth it to have the extra space on your desk, especially if you're going for a minamlist look.Second is the build quality. For being such a cheap keyboard I was expecting lots of plastic and flimsy build all around but I was suprised to see that, that wasn't the case. The build seems quite robust and sturdy. I would have only thought to see this kind of build from something like a $100+ keyboard.Third is the switches, maybe not your typical \"cherry\" switches but great all around. I'm most familiar with cherry blue switches and I felt like these were more like that than a green switch. Very clicky and very good feedback. Not mushy like some other cheap keyboards.Next is the lighting. This is the 21st centry and this should have RGB but it didn't so it won't match every color scheme that your setup may be but if you can get away with just red or no color at all then this won't be a problem.Lastly is response. With other keyboards I have bought in this price range when gaming always tended to lag or not be instantly responsive.

As a first time mechanical keyboard owner I won't pretend to have an expert opinion. However, I spend 8+ hours in front of a computer pretty much 7 days a week so I have some not inconsiderable interest in the nature of my \"Hardware Interface.\" When my previous deck (a generic wired logitech) finally pooped out on me I promptly ordered a replacement moving up toa ultra-cheap wireless key\/mouse bundle. For the first time, my attention was directed to the importance of desk and keyboard layout and quality. Retiring to the internets, I read various articles and watched numerous videos of roundups and ergonimcs lessons in the hopes of finding a suitable replacement on a limited budget. I encountered numerous references to this new species of mechanical keyboards being released with the most heralded model being the Redragon K552 Kumara. I was dubious, the mechanical bandwagon seemed pretty gimmicky and the I was more inclined to purchase another Logitech. However, this redragon keyboard had the superior build quality and features like a through-key backlight and media keys. By this time, I had already ordered and returned another budget gaming key\/mouse combos and I so I just bit the bullet and ordered this one. I could not have been more pleased! This is an absolutely fantastic keyboard, by tar the smoothest and easiest to use that I have ever owned. My wife actually noticed that my typing speed had increased, that's how dramatic the effect was. The only real CONS that I can see anyone having with this board are the lack of a numpad ('TENKEYLESS\" configuration) which takes a little getting used to when doing arithmetic, the audible \"click\" when typing is extremely satisfying but loud, and the cord could be, I guess.

{"reviewTitle":"Best keyboard under $50","reviewDescription":"I must say, I am blown away by how nice this keyboard is for the price. I got this originally to be a to go keyboard and to work on my server at a remote location (which has a keyboard with a broken spacebar now), but this now became my main keyboard, replacing my Cooler Master TK Quickfire Pro with Cherry MX blue switches. I love how these keys feel and sound heavier (perhaps because they're supposed to mimic green switches). I also found I like this keyboard layout better than the one that combines the 10key with all the delete\/home\/etc. keys. This keyboard also requires you hold down the FN key to use media keys, which I prefer over the other way, or like my cooler master, the FN key has this awkward lock implementation.Onto the negatives, I like that the keyboard feet that fold out have rubber grips, but one side doesn't stay in place when the legs are tucked in, so I have to always have the legs out which is fine by me since I do that anyways. My last gripes are that the media keys on the function keys aren't backlit, there is no indicator light for the meta key lock, and I wish they also offered a less gamer font type. They should really consider making one of these boards with a more vanilla font.Conclusions: Just get this keyboard. Ignore the Cherry MX Blue\/Green switches, after using them for years, I'm not coming to this keyboard thinking I'm using cheap, crappy switches. This keyboard is a total bargain. The switches are rated at I think 50M clicks, so lets hope that's true. But even if it was half that, I'd buy this keyboard again. Oh yeah, and the keys are loud, expect that like you would with other blue\/green switch boards","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1492473600000}

{"reviewTitle":"A must buy","reviewDescription":"If you're on a budget, looking for a good mechanical keyboard, but don't want to spend $100+? This is an absolute must buy if you are looking for a quality product. At first I was a bit weary of this, but now that I've had it for a bit, and the initial impressions wore off. I must say, that I still love this keyboard as much as the first day. I used to only care about name brands, and only ever bought Corsair or Razer. After using this, I would have to say that I no longer even care about those brands. I got this keyboard for less than $30 (roughly 24-25 at the time and reason I went with just red lighting instead of RGB) thinking it will break after a bit or I'll hate it. The design is perfect. It's minimalist, but at the same time everything that you need is present and the layout is just right. If you aren't a heavy user of the number pad, I recommend trying out keyboards without it, such as this one as it saves a ton of space if you can just get used to using the number row. The feel of the mechanical keys on this keyboard are also really nice. Sure it's not CherryMX but honestly, I don't think most people would be able to tell the difference. The only thing that I wish the seller would do is include other variations of keys and not just blues. I'd personally prefer reds as that is what my previous keyboards used.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1572480000000}

Whatever they used for stabilizers on the spacebar and longer keys feel solid.

Each switch has 2 different colored LED's that can turn on and off to give a rainbow effect, but it is not really RGB.2.  The corners are sharp.  I like how it looks but when your mouse hand gets to whipping around it can knock your thumb.3.  The top row of F keys is physically lower than the 2nd row of the number keys.  This hasn't actually bothered me.  I really don't use them that often.  Just seems like they should be the same or higher.Overall I love the keyboard.

{"reviewTitle":"the price alone...","reviewDescription":"I think this is a great product. The price is easily worth it.  I have some preferential dislikes but I would file them under \"feature requests\".Well-built, I think it will pass the test of time.  The keys are a good texture.  Responsive.  The feet that flip out on the bottom are actually amazingly well-made.  Like an old IBM PS\/2 mechanical, except lighter plastic. But they're not the little dinky cheap ones found on the keyboards that come with retail PCs in the box.Extra little features you might find nice: You can lock the WinKey.  You can lock all the keys.  And you can swap the WASD\/arrow keys - but note that when you do you're pressing FN+W, and during the swap with each press of just the W key both the W and the UP keys are sent. I can't see that being a problem but interesting quirk.The keys as far as their mechanics... The click is tinnier than, say, a brand-new Cherry Blue. A bit more pronounced. And you can hear the spring vibrate, like a faint bell, when the key returns. Like a older worn mechanical - the bell sound, not the feel.  The feel of the actuation is good, I think, but it feels a little lower than the Cherry, and the tactile bump of the return is stronger so that may be the reason for the bell sound.  They're not really Blue clones. Not bad, just different. Maybe louder.  IDK it's hard to tell (I don't have both to compare, just from memory - my usual Browns are tactile with no click, so that may be skewing my assessment?)  I wouldn't fault anyone for choosing Otemu switches.  Utility-wise, I'm sold on their quality at least.  And note the price, and I think it's more than fair.  Also - it's a trade-off, but you're not buying junk. I'm not sure how to put into words what you're trading off but it's not craftsmanship or quality.So anyway, some dislikes\/wishes:I got the Red LED one.  You can change brightness (and make it breathe-blink at different speeds), and you can turn it off.  But, the lowest brightness setting is a bit bright.  I feel like it should go lower by like 50% from the current lowest setting.  The thickness of the letters, which light up, is what makes it harsh.  Maybe it wouldn't be as bad if the font was thinner. But I like the font, and I would appreciate a lower brightness setting. I actually expected the light bleed from underneath the keys would be worse - but that's actually a reasonable amount.I would really like more switch options - I'm a fan of Brown ;)UPDATE: Yeah so turns out I really dislike clicky switches. I felt like a 70s reporter the night of deadline while writing this review.  So i bought Otemu Browns and started swapping the switches. Much happier, no issues during replacement. The ones sold here on Amazon are $10 for 20 but it's still less than the cost of most retail mechanicals at the end of the day, or equal price in some cases. This is a fine build board and I'm so far perfectly happy with Otemu switches.  I think I'm going to put some LED-dim stickers on the inside-bottom of the keycaps to fix my gripe from above. A bit of an adventure, but that's half the fun for most of us :)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1527206400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing Build Quality and Hefty!","reviewDescription":"I bought this keyboard strictly cause I was curious about mechanical switches and this was a cheap way to buy into into it but I wasn't expecting what I got. Depending on when you read this I might already have a video review up on my channel. Search Youtube for Eshcole.com!BUILD QUALITYFor ~$35 I wasn't expecting a keyboard with this kind of build quality. This keyboard is amazing and also amazingly HEAVY. Seriously, this keyboard is built like tank. That's not a bad thing. If you're a serious gamer, student, or just someone who works from home, you don't want a keyboard that's moving all over the place as you type. The Kumara has a very clean, simple look that would blend into most setups. The key caps let a lot of the LED light shine through so it looks great when they're on but you can turn them off if you wish. Mines stays on all the time. I love the look.FUNCTIONThe keys are supposed to be equivalent to Cherry MX Greens but once you pop the key cap off, you find the keys themselves are actually blue which is a little strange but doesn't bother me. I've never owned a Cherry MX Green keyboard so I can't speak on how accurate that claim is.The keys screams durable and are comfortable to type on for long periods. At first, the clicky sounds was loud and I was worried that I would wake the house as I typed cause I was so used to quiet membrane keyboards but after a few days, I either got used to the sound or maybe the keys get a little quieter after excessive use. Not sure but don't care.There's not a lot of extra features with this keyboard that more expensive alternatives would have like dedicated media or macro buttons and USB pass thrus but for the price I can't really complain. I would have really liked at least one USB pass thru however. The function keys double as media keys so you're not wasting space having useless dedicated media keys. There's no number pad which I thought would take some getting used to but thankfully it was a pretty smooth transition. There's only one LED effect and that's breathing where the LEDs fade on and off real nicely. That's it.CONCLUSIONIf you're curious about mechanical keyboards like I am or you just want a great keyboard for typing and gaming, this is definitely the one. At this price point you really can't beat a keyboard that feels and functions this premium. If you've owned more expensive mechanical keyboards and you just need an extra one that's good but affordable, this is for you. You won't find it as amazing as me whose never owned a mechanical keyboard but you'll definitely find it awesome!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1488499200000}

All my peripherals are Redragon if available. They are normally great quality for the price point. I have a deep affection for the brand.  So when I needed to get a keyboard for my new laptop, I went to my favorite brand. I received my  K552 on August 1, 2023. I once again fell in love with the esthetic, the small form factor, the feel and how bright it was. Everything I expect from Redragon.  Then yesterday, December 2, 2023, it went haywire on me.  A press of any key would open multiple windows, exit game, etc. At first I thought a switch went bad or maybe I got it wet somehow. I don't even keep drinks on my desk or eat near my computer. So that couldn't be it, and I live alone. So I took some switches out and replaced them with extra I had in a drawer.  Plugged the K552 back in and it continued to act as before, key presses of any key doing odd behavior.  I plugged in an old keyboard and everything was working fine. SO it was the K552 that had failed.  I have only had the K552 for 4 months. ONLY 4 MONTHS! Before the fire 18 months ago my KALA K557 lasted years. My Vampire mouse has lasted 17 months and still going.  I am utterly heart broken.

{"reviewTitle":"YMMV! Quality control issues.","reviewDescription":"I tried many different brands of under $50 mechanical keyboards. Here\u2019s what I found.They all look nearly identical in design. It appears that most of these are using the same generic circuit boards. The only difference is that some are not backlit, some are single-color LED, while others have multi-color backlight options. The font on letters and number are also different.Given that these are nearly identical in design, the only thing that really differentiates them is the quality of the material. Some brands have really shiny packaging while others are plain dull boxes. This one came in the shiniest box that makes you think that the product itself might be as good. But then you open the box and REALLY inspect the product and realize that you really do get what you pay for and should never judge a book by its cover.I really liked the red LEDs on this keyboard. I almost kept it until I found the really bad quality of the keycaps. The cheap plastic that the keys are made of was missing a big chunk from the front side of the spacebar key. I am uploading a picture with this review so you can see what I am referring to. This kind of shows that if they had any quality control whatsoever, someone would have just taken a look at the keycaps before they were putting the keyboard into a box to ship to their customers. If not before shipping, someone should have noticed this clearly defective keycap during the manufacturing process. I would not have noticed it if the key was one of the middle keys and this defect was not so obviously visible.Now I wonder if others who gave raving reviews here may also have received bad keycaps that they never noticed until it was too late to return\/exchange. Going forward, I would be removing all keycaps from these cheaper keyboards and checking every single one of them - basically doing their quality control myself. I highly recommend you do the same within that 30-day return period.I was wondering how many stars I should give this. My review is my personal experience with this product. I don\u2019t think a product with such a gaping quality-control issue deserves more than one star. Of course, my purchase decision was highly influenced by the hundreds of 5-star reviews so it\u2019s possible that this quality issue was just a rare occurrence.In summary, you should totally order this keyboard given the low price, but you should thoroughly inspect it and rigorously test every single key as much as you can as soon as you receive it. That is because that shiny box it comes in does not mention anything about \u201cwarranty\u201d anywhere. There is an \u201cemail address\u201d for support and a physical address for their factory in Guangdong, China. I also went to their website and nowhere on the product page or FAQ do they mention anything about warranty. Since I noticed this issue right after opening the box, I am glad that I bought it from Amazon that offers 30-day returns so I can shop confidently knowing that Amazon will back me up if the manufacturer or the seller does not deliver. This particular keyboard that I received is going back to Amazon for a full refund.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"111 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1545523200000}

I've had several and been happy with Red Dragon mice, and they have all performed as expected, their feature sets were as advertised, and they were perfectly capable mice for all use types so long as you accepted that you'd be replacing them more frequently than with higher-end products.But this keyboard is on a whole other, lower level. Sure, it's a cheap keyboard and I don't expect the world from it, but I do expect the keys to be relatively consistent and not degrading after just one month of use, and I do expect to have purchased an RGB keyboard when I bought what is labeled as an RGB keyboard.Critical:  Inconsistent key actuation creates unwanted input \/ cheap switches:- Key actuation pressure varies significantly between many keys, sometimes even on the same key.- Some keys require the same actuation force needed to overcome the initial resistance to the keypress all the way down the stroke, while others rapidly give way and actuate after the initial resistance is overcome.- For example, if my 'a' key strafes left in a game in which I do a lot of strafing I frequently wind up inadvertently strafing left simply because the key has slowly sunk and activated under the light weight\/pressure of my finger. I've more than once accidentally strafed into friendly fire or off of elevated terrain because of this.- This same behavior has made it impossible for me to safely use this keyboard to code as I never know when I may have inadvertently entered a character (or string of the same character) from that or one of five other keys with the same problem.Aggravating:  \"K552 RGB LED Rainbow\" version is NOT an RGB keyboard- Each row has its own permanent color - red, blue, green, orange, or purple  - and all keys on that row will always be that color, and that shade of that color.- You cannot blend colors to create shades and tones.- You cannot mix different colors on different rows.- You can't set WASD to a single color and other keys to a different color, or set different function keys with their own specific colors.- Lighting effects are expectedly limited, but mine doesn't even seem to provide the same effects I see others demo for this same Rainbow model on Youtube.

I repeat, please DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD.Buy this keyboard if you just want awesome backlights to showcase, because that is the real good thing about this keyboard, it looks beautiful and it has lots of transitions and modes (I could never find the software to configure and personalize them though).To make you notice how bad the keyboard is, after just one week of use, I was already having these typing issues, read more reviews, you are gonna see this is not an isolated problem.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1621728000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Very loud, repeating keys issue","reviewDescription":"I bought this keyboard back in Feb. 2017. This was my first mechanical keyboard. I did not want to spend a fortune on it and after comparing a few others, I bought this one, it was a big mistake and a waste of money for me.When I first started using it, my wife started complaining that it is too loud and so I shifted my work setup to the basement. The keyboard worked fine for the first few months. After that, 3-4 keys started repeating. I tried adjusting the keyboard properties, but it did not help much.I was using this keyboard with my work computer and I am used to locking it when I step away. But every time I unlock, I end up with an incorrect password. After two failed attempts, I have to use another keyboard or open the laptop lid and type the password. Three failed attempts will lock my account and will have to go through the hassle of unlocking. I cannot afford to do that multiple times a day. So, I stopped using it for a while.Over the last three years, I have used it on & off but the keys repeating issue persists. Last year, I installed the rubber o-ring dampeners hoping it may help with keys repeating and dampen the sound as well. It did help reduce the repeating frequency but not completely. The rubber rings made no difference to dampen the sound even after I added two of those.I cannot rely on this keyboard when I have to type the password. I login to multiple systems at work any given day and so I need a keyboard that does not repeat the key on a single stroke. And this keyboard is not the answer to it. It is now lying in a corner collecting dust. My suggestion, spend more and get a good one instead of wasting money on this keyboard.Hope this review is helpful.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1656288000000}
{"reviewTitle":"If you need a keyboard, this is a keyboard. (That you should probably skip)","reviewDescription":"I had my main keyboard finally die on me the other night and saw that this was only around $30 and could get to me in a day so I went ahead and bought it.For what you pay, it's pretty solid. Don't let the colors trick you into thinking this is RGB though. It's as the title describes, a backlit array of rainbow.... a pretty bad looking one, but I won't gripe about it too much.My main problem with the keyboard is that it's sort of hard to push down on the keys. It feels like extra effort is needed to work with them. Also, the font is kind of silly. Wish it had normal letters and numbers, but instead I have to look at the number bar and assume what I click is what I want. The 6 especially looks like a capital G.If you want mechanical and colors, I'd really recommend looking somewhere else. If you need a cheap and decent quality keyboard, this does the trick I suppose. Definitely replacing it soon though. I got way too comfortable with higher quality keyboards. For an interim keyboard, it's alright.EDIT : Oof, that went from 4 to 1 star pretty quick. Owned for just a few days now and Ctrl is already not reading half of my clicks. I was actually experiencing this sooner than I realized, but had thought I was just being dumb when copy and pasting things.Especially considering how common this issue seems to be, I would genuinely just recommend buying a cheap non-mechanical keyboard, because then you'd at least be buying a good quality basic keyboard, not a low quality mechanical keyboard. If you go mechanical, go above $100.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1659571200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Mixed Experience with the Keyboard for Gaming and Work","reviewDescription":"I've been using this keyboard for about 2 months now, primarily for gaming with some development and work tasks on occasion. While there are some great features, there are also some drawbacks that have led to a mixed experience.On the positive side, the keyboard backlights are bright and high quality, which adds to the overall aesthetics and functionality of the keyboard. The keycaps and cores can also be swapped, which is a great feature for those who like to customize their keyboard.However, there are some drawbacks that make this keyboard less than ideal. The keys are a little too close together for my liking, and the formatting is a little off. This can lead to accidentally pressing the wrong key or misfiring during games, which can be frustrating.Furthermore, after only a month of use, I've noticed a few dead keys that only work about half the time. This is especially annoying because one of them is my \"A\" key, which is a frequently used key during gaming and typing. This is a major drawback that significantly impacts the overall usability of the keyboard.Finally, the RGB backlight is not customizable, which is disappointing. The colors are set for each row of keys, with the order being Red, Blue, Red-Orange, Green, Orange-Yellow, and Purple. This may not be a major issue for some, but for those who prefer more customization options, this can be a drawback.Overall, while this keyboard has some great features, such as the bright backlights and the ability to swap keycaps and cores, the drawbacks, such as the keys being too close together, the dead keys after a month of use, and the lack of customization options for the RGB backlight, make it a mixed experience for both gaming and work.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1639267200000}
{"reviewTitle":"The \"F\" key stopped working properly after 8 months.","reviewDescription":"UPDATEI've had the keyboard for just a bit over 8 months. It didn't get a lot of use until the pandemic set in and I had to work from. That was mid-February. Since then, the keyboard receives extensive use five out of seven days. Four months of that and the \"F\" got fussy. (It just took me six tries to type the F in fussy.) Sometimes it works. Sometimes I press it and nothing happens. If I press it again, trying to get an F, I'll end up with 2, 3, 4, or more Fs.I think a keyboard should last for more than 4 months of regular use. It's probably a defective switch, but there's not much I can do about it. I removed the keycap, blew it out w\/compressed air, which did no good.I'll contact the vendor to see if they can help, but I'm not holding my breath. I guess I need to order another keyboard. Looks like I'll be staying away from this manufacturer. Too bad. I actually got to the point where I really liked it.What I like: - Keyboard clicks are just right. - Red backlighting is easier on the eyes in dim light. I have a white light keyboard as well, and I prefer the red. - Can turn the backlighting off, which is nice since my computer is in my bedroom. - 10-key-less is great. Takes up less real estate, and I never used the 10-key keypad anyway. - Key response is perfect.What I don't like: - Backlighting is either on or off. No way to dim the lighting, as far as I can tell. There's a \"breathing\" setting which has the backlighting fading in and out. No idea what purpose that serves. - The FN+F12 key combination is supposed to fire up the calculator, but it doesn't. Not a big deal for me since I rarely use the Windows calculator.Other comments: - You absolutely need a wrist rest with this. Just 10 minutes of typing and my wrists are hurting. Not the fault of the keyboard, clearly. Just an observation. - I think I'm faster on this keyboard than I was on my Microsoft membrane-style keyboard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1568419200000}
{"reviewTitle":"I don't recommend it","reviewDescription":"i'm really disappointed. i don't know why i thought i could get a decent mechanical keyboard for this price. i'm definitely going to return it. the keys are very noisy, but that's not even the bad part (it's not uncommon for mechanical keyboards to be noisy). the real advantage to mechanical keyboards with gaming, as far as i understand, is that you can rest your fingers on the keys while playing with out triggering the keys just by the weight of your fingers. these keys are actually more sensitive to touch than the free, non-mechanical keyboard that came with my desktop PC. i think the worse part is the general feel and sound of the keys when you press them. the sound is just awful. i don't mind that it's loud, but it's not a satisfying \"click\" that you'd expect from a halfway decent mechanical keyboard. it gives off a subtle metallic sound while you type. it's hard to describe, and it might not bother you on the first day you get it, but today is the third day i'm using it and it's incessant. i don't really understand all the positive reviews. maybe if you don't plan to use it much it's a good pick, but personally i use my computer for my full time job and then i also use it for a few hours of gaming after work. so i'm just going to spend $30 or 40 more to get one that i'll enjoy using. the only positive thing about it is the lights--i don't have any complaints about the lights on the keyboard. i like that there are adjustable brightness settings and the lighting pattern options are pretty fun. it would be nice if the caps lock key did something to signify when it's selected (like on a mac laptop keyboard) but for $35 i wouldn't expect that feature. overall, i do not recommend this product. I guess this is pretty much what i should've expected for $35. I was only surprised because the reviews were so good. either stick with the basic keyboard that comes with your computer, or save up a good $70 to get a nice upgrade for your keyboard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1603670400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Solid Mechanical Keyboard","reviewDescription":"Unlike the Mammoth Mouse I bought at the same time, this keyboard has stood up to gaming over the past 14 or so months. It is a true mechanical keyboard, not a hybrid. So if you like the clickity clack, you will love this thing. Took away one star for my only complaint, which is that the space bar is a little loose and will sometimes \"double-click\" when I'm not intending to. This isn't an all the time thing and I've known other keyboards to do this as well, so I'm not too upset about it considering that altogether this is a solid keyboard for the price.Side note: This keyboard does not have a number pad. Which does bug me from time to time, but I knew what I was getting when I bought it so I'm not holding it against Redragon. I believe they have other models with number pads.Update: I have changed my review from 4 stars to 1. Having been my first mechanical keyboard, I did my research on the different types of switches and settled on red, since it would be mostly for gaming. However, after having recently bought a new keyboard a few years later, I pulled a keycap off the old board to use as a replacement for cap that was broken on the new board, and to my surprise, the switch was blue! I pulled off a few more caps at random across the board and all blue. I double checked the amazon listing and sure enough, it said the keyboard was equipped with red switches. It's obviously beyond the return window, but the fact that I've used blue switches this entire time makes total sense. People would comment about how loud my keyboard was over comms, and I responded that I had relatively quiet switches (red) as I just assumed the product was as advertised. Clearly, it is not.I would avoid buying this product unless and until their QA improves.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1564531200000}

I decided that it was time to give the mechanical stuff a try, and for under $30, this seemed to be good choice.Good news: It was.I feel that my typing is a bit faster, but I've got no bench-marking to prove it. The experience of typing is made more enjoyable by the responsive keys, the inevitable click, and the fact that I don't have to slam my fingers repeatedly on a key to get the thing to engage.I didn't want the LED lighting, but I got it because -- at the time anyway -- the non-LED was more expensive, so I just turn the lights off.

People are jelly. ::brushes dirt off shoulder::The build quality is good, and the keys are very responsive. It's pretty heavy, so it doesn't wander off while I'm typing.

First, it'll be a waste of putting new switches in this, so keep the Outemu Reds - they do the job.Once you add sound damping, holy-mod the stabilizers, and lube the switches (without opening each one), they feel ok, and their stabs feel pretty good.Even though I own mid-level modded keyboards like KBDfans & CTRL Drop, at 10-20x the price, this dinky keyboard is my daily driver for games.

{"reviewTitle":"I like this keyboard","reviewDescription":"I'll make a short summary, then get straight into the pros and cons.I like this keyboard, it's very cheap and works very well(most of the time). I've only ever had problems with it for two days that hindered my experience, and there's a constant annoyance in my keyboard.I don't know if this is just mine or what, but my D and A keys don't properly function. The D key occasionally doesn't work, or it works two well(pressing anywhere from 2-5 times per click). Already in this review I've had to backspace dozens of times to delete extra Ds. The A key has started doing it to, though much less often than the D key.This is a huge problem, not just an annoyance, because I use this keyboard for gaming. Not being able to strafe in an FPS game is like cutting off your left leg, especially in games like counterstrike that require constant shoulder peeking and such.The error of the keys not pressing at all happens very rarely, and I press the key enough (during gaming) that even if it doesn't register, it works the next couple times I tap it. All in all, this is still a solid keyboard, and I probably messed it up somehow and that's why I have this error.PROS:Satisfying clicky clicky noises, the amount of force required to push the keys is a good amount, not too heavy not too light. This keyboard is very good for the casual\/semi-serious computer junky. If you're going to be on this all day every day(like I am), it would be in your best interest to save up and drop more cash on a better keyboard.No NumPad could be a Pro, depending on the person. For me it's great because the smaller keyboard doesn't interfere with my mousepad as much as my old one did, which makes it easier to play games comfortably and for long periods of time.The keys are very responsive, have a good feel to them, and the backlighting is very soft(doesn't hurt the eyes at all even in the dark).Cons:The A\/D key thingThe keyboard only coming in red could be a con if you really wanted a different color(I have a Razer mouse, so the red and green is kind of an annoying mix, but oh well).This keyboard is a little bit taller than others I've used, this is a preference thing.No NumPad makes it very bad for any kind of office work, or for MOBA\/MMORPG type games that require you to have a ton of keybinds(I know Starcaft 2 uses a ton of those, and many pros use the numpad religiously. CSGO pros also use it to buy items quicker).All in all, I love this thing other than the problems I've personally had. It was a good buy, but I will upgrade to something better after about a year(hopefully with customizable lights!)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1494720000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent low-budget mechanical option","reviewDescription":"I've gone through a couple of Blue switch keyboards (Cooler Master QuickFire Rapid [Kailh switches I believe] and the Corsair K70 [Cherry MX]), but this one was by far the least expensive. I'm also the most impressed with it, primarily due to what you get for the price. As others have stated, this is an actual mechanical keyboard (not \"mechanical-like\"). My use-case was that I wanted something more tactile for use at work without spending a ton of money, and this keyboard fits the bill nicely.The switches definitely require a bit more force than both my QuickFire Rapid and K70, but it's not like doing finger push-ups on your keyboard or anything like that. One reviewer stated that these have a 55g actuation force and from what I've found authentic Cherry MX Blues have a 50g actuation force; without doing any measurements of my own, this feels about right. They do feel a bit cheaper than my other two keyboards and there is an audible \"spring\" sound on occasion when the key returns that O-rings have done little to mitigate, however this is by no means a dealbreaker for me. I cannot overstate, however, that this is a LOUD keyboard and will probably not be acceptable in most shared quiet settings. I use mine in a fairly noisy office and get the occasional good-natured ribbing from coworkers who hear my keyboard, but no one has put in a legitimate complaint. Cherry MX Blues are notoriously noisy, but these Outemu switches easily out-clack the competition in terms of volume.Some don't seem to like the design, however I think it's pretty minimalist with the small exception of the Redragon logo above the arrow keys (which doesn't bother me much and seems like it *might* be removable somehow) and the cheesy gamer-esque font. The font can be forgiven since I've seen these very keycaps on other inexpensive keyboards, and I'm guessing economy of scale is what helps keep the price as low as it is. The backlighting is fine; basic but good and easily turned off, although it will not remember your settings and will default to on. If you don't like backlighting, save yourself a few dollars and get the non-backlit version. There is no wrist-rest, but I've purchased a(I was not paid, just hyperlinking for your convenience) that goes quite well with this keyboard. Some people also seem to want a detachable cable; I've always found these to be more annoying than worthwhile but I suppose it's a matter of personal preference. Some have modified the keyboard to use a detachable cable, so it's definitely possible. I'm sure this also came down to cost. The keyboard also has a very nice weight to it and quality legs with rubber stops if you want to raise it a bit.I'm deducting a star because of questionable quality control. While I really like this keyboard, it does misfire on occasion (the \"e\" key, specifically). It's not annoying enough to send it back, however I also purchased a Redragon Brown switch keyboard (\"Devarajas\") and it has more defective keys, both in functionality and quantity. It's unfortunate because the Devarajas seemed like it was going to be an equally good keyboard. I'm keeping the K552 and returning the Devarajas.Pros:Inexpensive \/ excellent valueOther than the font, the design is fairly minimalist and doesn't look too out-of-place in an officeGood weightNot specific to the keyboard, but Blue switches are wonderful for typingCons:Extremely loud, even with O-rings and compared to other Blue switchesQuestionable quality controlIn summary: I still prefer using my Corsair K70, but if I were limited to either a Redragon mechanical keyboard or something like a \"gaming\" keyboard with rubber domes, the Redragon would win out every time. The value is great, as long as the quality is consistent.Other notes: I may try some different key caps out at some point.

So, my Razer finally gave out.  I need my keyboard to work, not game, and it is, so to speak, my third arm.  I had a stack of backup keyboards here from various other computers and I hate them all.  All are membrane, non-mechanical keyboards.  Those are a problem for me.  I worked on a couple of them for about one hour and gave up.  The only reason I ordered this one was because the replacement Razer will not arrive until Saturday (this was Thursday) and this one could be delivered same day as I had urgent work that needed to be completed on the double.  It arrived same day - thank you Amazon.  Plugged it in and away I went.  This keyboard is tiny.  The layout is about an inch in width shorter so the keys are closer together.  That took some getting used to but, all-in-all, I have to say, I'm impressed.  The backlighting is nice.  The blue is difficult to see.  I work in a mostly dark environment so the blue of the # keys is harder to see than the rest but for a two day use, it's fine.  I normally work on a keyboard with the tenkey pad so that too takes some getting used to but, for a backup keyboard, it will do just fine.  I almost never write reviews for anything but I just wanted to say, at least for me, this little keyboard fit the bill for a backup and I'm going to order another one for a backup to the backup.  I can't speak, of course, to the longevity as I've only worked on it for about 24 hours but, as I said, compared to my $150+ Razer, this one will do quite nicely in a pinch!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671148800000}

You can change the patterns that the keys light up in, but the rows' colors will always remain the same (red, blue, red, green, orange, purple - from top to bottom). In the past I've had keyboards that were annoying for friends to listen to when we played games together, but this one isn't loud enough to be picked up by my mic (unless I were to move the mic closer to the keyboard). No problems with the keyboard and I'd order it again, but it definitely sucks that I can't change the backlighting to a single, solid color. Kind of an eye sore to have a bunch of different colors in an office where I'm trying to establish a solid-colored theme. But hey, for $40?

This keyboard feels great and does not feel low quality for how low the price is. It has great sound, a great look, great speed, and is overall satisfying to use.My only problem is that this keyboard easily starts to have issues when you press keys quickly many, many times. I play a rhythm game called osu! and this game requires fast, repetitive tapping of two keys, typically the \"z\" and \"x\" keys. After playing osu! with the \"z and x\" keys on the keyboard for two weeks, I've noticed that the keys begun to register the keys as being pressed multiple times, or not being pressed at all from just one key press. I have switched my key bindings many times in osu! with this keyboard because of this issue, and every week or so, my new keys I bound will begin to have the same issue.When I first had this issue, I contacted Red Dragon about it and they apologized and sent me a replacement keyboard. The customer service was very kind and generous for doing so. They handled the matter quickly and without much hassle. My replacement keyboard still has the same issues, but I do not believe there is a quick fix to my issue.Long story short, this keyboard looks, feels, and is amazing for casual\/intermediate usage.

The issue is when it comes to gaming and the inconsistencies with the sensitivity.  At lease with me, when gaming I rest my left hand over \"wasd\" and the keyboard requires very little pressure most of the time to press a key(less then I am use to using a shitty dell office keyboard for the last 20 years); this causes accidental key presses, and sometimes it causes a key to not press at all.  What I mean is that if you rest your ring finger and the \"a\" key and rest with too much pressure you can accidentally press the key when you don't mean to; alternatively sometimes when you go to press the key it doesn't go at all, you have to depress the key fully and then press it again.So far I have only experienced these issues in watch dogs 2 but I haven't been playing many other games where I would notice it.

I hate laptop keyboards, and because I travel, I needed something that could also take a pounding, because I type very hard (learned to type long ago on a teletype) and very fast (100 WPM+).  So far, this keyboard fits that bill nicely.  It is small and lightweight enough that it doesn't add significantly to my laptop bag weight, rugged enough to travel, and very comfortable to type on.  It is also very responsive.  Even at my fastest typing speeds, it doesn't have any noticeable lag or delay, and the keys are consistent across the keyboard.  The travel is smooth, the click quite pronounced under my fingers, and the character is generated the moment that click takes place, not before, and not even a moment after.About the only thing I don't like is the post-modern looking font used on the keys.  Because I touch-type, this doesn't affect me, but the first time I looked down and saw the number 6 on the keyboard, I wondered why the letter G was in the wrong place.For the price, it's perfect for my use with the work laptop, and for the occasional need to talk to one of the Raspberry Pi devices around my house.  The backlight is nice looking, and it's got options to adjust brightness, turn it off, or to put in in \"breathe\" mode (a slow oscillation, on and off, which has an adjustable rate).  All of that is only moderately off interest to me, but it does look cool, and if you aren't a touch typist, useful in darkened places.Highly recommended.Update:1 year in, Spacebar has become intermittent, which makes the keyboard useless.

Every time I start price checking though, I would be looking at a minimum of $100.00 bucks for even a cheaper entry level mechanical keyboard. My frugal nature refuses to pay that much for a keyboard, when I know I can get a standard run-of-the-mill one for pretty much free... heck I have 2-3 regular keyboards laying around in the closet. I simply didn't want one bad enough to pay $100.00 or more for one.  By the same token, I'm not going to spend 40-50 dollars on something that ends up being a piece of crap, either.  I am not a brand snob for sure (too often we are paying a premium for the \"brand name,\" not actual quality), and I like high quality at the most affordable price point, and with some items, that is difficult to find. That was the boat I was in the other day when I was researching,. I was almost convinced it was just not feasible to find a decent mechanical keyboard for less than 100 dollars.  Then I found this redragon K552 Kumara.  The price seemed too good to be true. The reviews out there were awesome (check out some youtube videos), and the price point is low enough that I was able to convince my frugal conscience it was a bargain.  As I am typing on the keyboard now, I would have to say that is very much true.  This keyboard is a bargain at this price. It looks and feels very premium. Heavy, sturdy construction. Lights look great.  It's very loud and clacky, which I LOVE. The tactile feel, and the SOUND of the mechanical keyboard is the entire reason I wanted one to begin with, to be honest.  I just love it.

The different color for each row  makes it extra easy to find the home row in a hurry.  The basic tilt of the keyboard is good, and the very strong popout legs are even better, though I still have a problem with the highest setting, which tends to slip out of position just as it does in other keyboards I've tried.  The typing is easy and sure, the keys are the right size and spacing for my hands, so I make fewer errors than I've been doing. The bumps to guide the fingers to the f and j for touch typing are high enough to be unmistakable. Unlike my last keyboard, the enter\/return key is reachable from the home position; the pipe\/backslash key is back up in the qwerty row where it belongs.  I just plain LIKE this keyboard.  I've already persuaded a computer-professional friend to buy himself one, though he talks of using it with his raspberry pi....","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661731200000}
{"reviewTitle":"A phenomenal value","reviewDescription":"Redragon is an extremely underrated brand. This keyboard is among the best I've used, and happily joins my < $20 Redragon gaming mouse as my daily driver. I'm happy to say, I'll never purchase another poorly made Razer product again as long as Redragon is around. For half the price I get twice the quality.I work in IT, and I'm only slightly ashamed to admit I'm THAT GUY when it comes to my peripherals. But, when you type for 15+ hours a day, you notice the small nuances. There are very few keyboards I'd say I enjoy typing on (most are just OK), but this board most certainly falls within the enjoy camp.It feels well made, has the satisfying tactile feedback and clickiness of the \"premium\" cherry MX boards, but at a fraction of the price. As listed, It's NOT made with the real cherry mx switches, but I honestly can't tell the difference. The gripes I have are mostly aesthetics, but I rarely find myself looking directly at the keyboard, so it's hard to really list them as cons.The only real issue I have is the odd empty feeling of the spacebar. Every other \"special\" key (backspace, return, shift, tab, etc) has a satisfying level of feedback when pressed, however, I've noticed the spacebar doesn't quite have the same \"oomph.\" It's hard to pinpoint exactly what the issue is, but the best description I can give is it feels... hollow.All in all, it's a pretty standard mechanical keyboard, and there are plenty of descriptions online, including the reviews here describing the experience of using a mechanical board. For those looking for comparison to cherry MX flavor, I'd say this is closest to a Blue. Only time will tell if the switches will hold up as long as the true cherries, but for $40, I'm more than willing to find out.Oh, I almost forgot to mention, this works flawlessly with a Mac. All the media keys work, and the command (windows)\/option (alt) keys are properly arranged without having to re-map anything.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1457827200000}
{"reviewTitle":"it was a good gamble. I LOVE IT","reviewDescription":"This is a review for the K552 Redragon mechanical keyboard.  This is the first mechanical keyboard I have ever own.  I did a lot of research, and read reviews on nearly every mechanical keyboard out there.  What stood out for me on the K552 was the price.  Since it was my first mechanical keyboard, I didn't want to spend $80-$100 for it.  So, for $40, it was a good gamble.  I LOVE IT!  It was just what I was looking for.  I wanted a compact, backlit mechanical keyboard, and the K552 was the answer.  And for $40, it's worth it.Pros:Heavy duty, nice weight to it.Crisp and responsive key clicks.\"It's backlit\".Came with a keycap remover.  I switched out my WASD keys with the arrow keys.  Use for gaming.It's plug and play.  Dummy proof.It's nice and compact, which sits on my desk nicely.The length of the cord is decent, about 6ft., which works for me.It has about 9 or 10 level of dim setting.  I set mine to a level of 4 of 5.Locking windows key. I never used it.Alot of little features which might be of use to some. ie. music control, play, pause etc etc...I don't really use these features.  Even on all of the keyboards I ever owned.Cons:Only has one color lighting.  Red.  However, on the back of the box, it says 4 different light colors, which is not true.  It's only RED.Doesn't have a save feature.  Light dim setting have to be reset after you reboot the computer.  It's a little annoying, but what do you expect for a $40 backlit keyboard.The WASD keys, and the arrow keys are not the same height.  But not off by that much at all.Overall, I highly recommend this keyboard if you're looking for a budget mechanical \"backlit\" keyboard.  I would buy another one and keep it as a spare at some point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1454457600000}

{"reviewTitle":"but they are really more like MX Blues","reviewDescription":"I own a few different keyboards. At home I am using a CODE 87 w\/Cherry MX Clears and at work I am using a Realforce 87U 55G. I also own a few boards by Ducky, Deck, POK3R and a few others.I was curious what you could buy in a mechanical boards on the cheap. After reading many reviews of different boards I decided to order a Redragon K552 w\/Red LED's. Amazon shipped the board very fast and it was delivered the same day for free.The board is  well made and feels more expensive than the price paid. I would say on par with a KB Paradise that I also own. Board is solid without any undue flex, plastic does not feel cheap, has a metal switch plate and decent double shot ABS keycaps with a slight textured feel. The red LED's are a plus and work really well. Font is subjective, but I don't have any issues with it.The K552 comes with MX clone switches made by Greetech which are the same brand used by the far more expensive DAS 4C. Redragon lists them as Greens, but they are really more like MX Blues. But the actuation force sits between a Blue and Green compared to a real Cherry MX switch. Over all the keys all feel equal and there are no issues with chatter etc. There is a slight ringing with the \"enter\" key, but that is about it. Just be aware that Blues can get kind of annoying if you work around other people or if the clickyness will get on your nerves. I suggest you try a board with Blues if you can.Anyhow, I highly recommend this board to someone that wanted to get their first mechanical keyboard. It is pretty nice and for the price paid, it is a steel. In fact I plan to use this at home on another computer I have for a little while to see how it holds up over time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1471305600000}

Add a USB port or two.A few things I like about it:* Keys have a nice solid click to them* The arrows and other navigation (home, end, pg up, pg down) keys are all in the right place. Some smaller keyboards try to save space by mashing these together in a weird order and it makes finding them by touch much harder. This layout is excellent* It takes some getting used to where the media controls are, but I prefer them being Fn+ keys rather than waste desk space on dedicated buttons* The red backlight is subtle and doesn't distract at allI can easily recommend this to anyone looking to try out mechanical keyboards to see if you like it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1537056000000}

The backklight is, I would say, exactly bright enough. In reasonably lit room it's not glaring, and in a slightly dim room is helps you find keys if you need to. The construction is solid.It is pretty loud, which I kinda knew getting it but since getting it I've realized the problems that can cause. My microphone picks it up, everyone in the house can hear when I'm typing- not great features, but it's what you're buying and that's what the \"Blue-like switch\" noise indicates.After 4 years it's starting to have some mechanical issues. Mainly occasional double-typing, like in \"backklight\" above. This used to never happen, but has been getting more common. I don't believe my typing habits hhavve (ugh) changed, so I do believe this to  be a problem with the keyboard.However, for the price I think surviving 4 years of heavy daily use is pretty respectable. That's why, even though it's starting to fail now, I'd still give it at least 4 stars. I use mine primarily for gaming and productivity tasks, and I would say it's adequate in terms of feature set.

{"reviewTitle":"Great Starter Mechanical Keyboard","reviewDescription":"For a budget mechanical keyboard, this keyboard really hits the mark. If you appreciate the clacky sound of Cherry MX Blues, this keyboard's got you covered. I appreciate them not changing the layout of a standard keyboard -- standard sized backspace and enter keys (I hate keyboards that change the size of those keys for no obvious reason). I can only see two downsides to this board thus far. 1) The \"gamer\" font that covers the keys. A standard readable font would be appreciated on a nice mechanical keyboard that's under $50. Apparently, being poor means you have no taste. And 2) While I appreciate the Fn Multimedia keys, those parts of the keys are not backlit. So when I'm watching videos in the dark, I can't quickly use my keyboard to play\/pause or volume up\/down. I feel like it kind of defeats the purpose of having a backlit keyboard to use at night if you can't see the secondary functions of the keys. It's a great starter mechanical keyboard, but likely when I choose to upgrade other components of my computer, I'll also upgrade the keyboard to something not so tacky and with better lighting for a backlit keyboard. 4\/5, would use as a starter mechanical keyboard\/budget keyboard again, but not necessarily something I'll stick with for years.Edit: Owned now for over 6 months. Backlight still works fine, key finish still works well. Certain keys (most notably the \"h\" key, sometimes others) have started to \"double press\" without input from me. So words come out like \"thhis\". Somewhat frustrating. Frequent enough to be annoying, not frequent enough that I feel I need to buy a new keyboard at this time. Probably next year I will, also assuming the problem doesn't get worse.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1492041600000}

My \"E\" key for instance when pressed would type multiple \"E's\" at a time with just one press, and now half the time it just doesn't type the \"E\" at all. Up until this started happening i very much enjoyed the keyboard and would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately my 30 day return window is now up so i'm not sure if there's anything i can do about it but i will be contacting the seller and updated my review accordingly.***UPDATE***After contacting the seller they told me that there was an 18 month manufacturers warranty and i would be able to replace it but that i would have to pay for the shipping. I told them i would do so but was then contacted and told that they would cover the shipping for me after they had read my amazon review ( nice to know sellers actually look at this stuff). All and all the process took about a month and i was out a keyboard for about 3 weeks but i didn't have to pay for shipping and after testing it today the keyboard seems to be good to go. Now i have only had it for a day so time will tell if it goes bad on me again but i am confident that if it does i will have it replaced again without a problem.

{"reviewTitle":"A sturdy but incredibly loud keyboard!","reviewDescription":"TLDR. Definitely worth if you don't mind the high accentuation point and loud nature of this keyboard.Unboxing (10\/10)Simple, everything you need is going to be there... The keyboard and a very useful keycap replacement tool. That's it, you don't need anything else. The package itself feels neat, and the keyboard is well protected inside of it.Setup (10\/10)Just plug and play, no annoying software, no messing with your devices or trying to get obscure drivers.Usage (8\/10)*I'm biased on this one, as I've been using reds for YEARS, switching to a \"blues\" like keyboard is tough, specially for how clicky and LOUD this thing is. The keycaps are a bit slippery and lack grip, so *sometimes* you'll find yourself with a \"weird feeling of not actually having your fingers firmly set up on top of your keys\"-type of feel. While typing this issue is less noticeable since you will only \"click them\" and not have to \"hold them\" or \"rest your fingers on top of them\" like when you play games.Build quality (9\/10)This thing was like $30 but it feels more sturdy than other $80+ keyboards that I've used... There's 0 bend, a TON of weight, and a crap ton of quality with this thing. The ONLY thing I'd improve is the cable itself, it's not braided but well, it is a $30ish mechanical keyboard after all.Bottom line, get some keycaps replacements for your most used keys, get some noise cancelling headset, a good microphone (unless you want to annoy your friends), and you'll be set for this!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1538784000000}

For the price you get a solid built full mech keyboard. Keycaps are good enough. It does remember whatever light setting you had it set to after shutdown\/restart.  The cable is not braided, but it does have a thick protective layer and it is plenty long.Cons: The \"RGB\" is all set colors, so you can turn them on\/off and a few preset effects, but you can not change the color of individual keys. Also, they are not the brightest, so in a bright setting, they would not do as well. Also, there is a noticeable \"ting\" to some of the keys, mainly the ones located nearest the screws and edges. These are the points that hold the board to the case, so there is the most noise transfer.  If you are using this in a quite space, it might be a deal breaker.Possibilities: With o-rings and a bit of case dampening, I'm sure this very inexpensive board could rival many much more expensive mech boards.

Quite frankly, I don't get it. You need to use more force and press further in order to press a key. Additionally, the base is about an inch tall, so I will probably need a large handrest to use this comfortably. I just looked and found there are kickstands to make it even taller!My understanding was that there would be a click when the key is pressed, and a click when it's released. That is not entirely the case. You can release the key a bit, and it still registers as a hold. Release a bit more and it's no longer a hold, but it still hasn't unclicked. Then you can press back down and its a hold again. I can't really think of a situation where this would matter, but it's odd.Anyway, I needed another keyboard and this is built solidly.

I'm not giving up my solar keyboard. It has a very light touch which I also like  (Logitech).Another thing I like about this one is it's not overcomplicated. I have a high end Logitech gaming keyboard and it's always asking me to upgrade the software, the \"wave\" pattern seems to pop up unexpectedly and I have to reset it (that could be a bug), and it's just too big for its britches. However, the Logitech also has a wonderful feel and BEST, an analog sound controller. Nothing better! So check it out if you are not price-sensitive.The price point is very favorable for the Red Dragon. I like its garish red lights. Sometimes tastelessness is just sort of what you want.Will report back if it flakes out prematurely.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1540252800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great Keyboard for the price. Switches are cheap might need replacing later","reviewDescription":"Had this Keyboard for about a year now and it works great. Can't be beaten for a mechanical keyboard of this price tbh. However, around the 7th month or so, some of my keys started responding with delays where I had to press it multiple times for it to register the input, Namely the common 'gamer keys' WASD etc.I figured that the problem was the switches as these are really just cheap cherry MX clones. The great part is that this is keyboard is a hot-swap keyboard meaning that cherry mx compatible switches are pretty much plug and play with no sort of soldering required.So I was easily able to replace my switches with some kailh box jades and now it works great.

If you need a good hot swappable keyboard then I would recommend this one - note you can only swap it for other Outemu switches.

I feel it's more a thing that will go away the more I use it rather than a defect.3.) If you go from using a keyboard with a number pad to one that has none, it takes alot of getting used to. This is ESPECIALLY true with this keyboard.On the flip side, here are some good things about it:1.) The reinforced metal back plate makes flexing nonexistent.2.) It is really satisfying to use the keys, unlike other mechanical keyboard I have seen.3.) If you plan to switch out keys, the keyboard comes with a removal tool.4.)

The K552-N doesn't have the double-shot injection molded keys that the colored ones do, which means that the lettering on the keys may rub off after 1-2 years of heavy use, which doesn't really matter since you can always get new keys. But if this worries you and you enjoy having the backlit keyboard, go for the backlit ones. This keyboard's quality is pretty good so far, and the weight of it speaks to that fact. I mainly use this keyboard as a programmer, but also as a blogger. For gaming, I have no idea how well this would perform, but for programmers, typists, and anyone who wishes they could have an IBM Model M keyboard that defined keyboard quality in the 1980s and 1990s, this may be your best choice for <$50 keyboards.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1484697600000}

This new version is much quieter than the first version that I bought. It also addressed the duplicate key issue that some other users have mentioned. For the price, I do think this is a really good deal (for a mechanical keyboard). These ARE hot-swappable, so if you're not happy with the feel, you can replace the switches.

I use my laptop keyboard at work, which has one, and then when I get home and go to enter numbers (which I do more than I thought I did when I bought this keyboard), I feel silly going over to hit a numpad that doesn't exist. I guess the old saying is true - you don't know what you have till it's gone - and I miss my numpad. Like I said, a great keyboard.

Keys are not responsive: Reading other people's reviews, it seems like this is a pretty common issue that will happen to you eventually. I will press on a key, and it will simply not type. There is no response and I need to hit the key 5+ times for it to actually respond, and this issue is not exclusive to any one key but happens to all of them.2. Multiple entries on one key stroke: This also seems to happen to most people eventually. I will press a key once, and multiple entries will show up. For example, I will press the letter 'a', and 4 a's will show up. It's super annoying and has hindered my work. Again, this isn't exclusive to just 'a' but it happens to all the keys.I have downloaded the drivers and reinstalled them but that hasn't fixed anything. I also cleaned the keyboard and that also hasn't changed anything. There's no damage done to the keyboard since it never leaves my desk.

The keys feel and work great and have endured daily constant use for more than 2 years, I have not had to replace any keys or parts. My only complaint would be that it gets dirty between the keys but cleaning is not too hard since they are detachable. Overall, just a really good affordable option if you're looking for a mechanical keyboard for gaming or just general use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1690934400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Love old IBM keyboards? You will be in heaven.","reviewDescription":"This keyboard has exceeded my expectations beyond belief.I've longed for a keyboard that was like my old IBM, the one that had the clicking sound so that you knew that you pressed a key and it felt so natural.The keyboards they sell now are complete garbage in my opinion, for someone who start it on computers before they were graphical interfaces you will know that an IBM keyboard was the best way to type.The only little grape I have this is a tiny bit smaller than I thought it would be, that is a good thing anyway because the old IBM keyboards would take up a ton of space this one does it plus this baby lights up and it is beautiful.I can now go back to writing 80 words a minute without even a typo, give me a regular keyboard that doesn't have much feedback and basically just cheap keys I get about half that and we're talking typos also.I also understand this is great for PC gamers, I basically use gamepads I'll admit I suck I'm used to consoles but when it comes to typing this cannot be beat.I would have easily paid double for this keyboard.All these years I didn't realize that the mechanical keyboard was similar to the IBM, always confused mechanical keyboards being gaming keyboards.I wholeheartedly with all my heart can tell you if you enjoy typing and you enjoy that feedback that you get know that you press the right key, this will be the best keyboard you can ever own for this price.Please be advised this is a USB keyboard, it's not wireless not Bluetooth you have to hook up a USB cord, that might be a small con for some people but for me it doesn't make a difference I've tried other keyboards that plug directly in USB just like this one and the response rate is garbage.Mechanical keyboards are the way to go if you enjoy typing, of course there are other mechanical keyboards that go even further for gaming, that's not for me but like I keep saying if you're an old-timer basically anybody that grew up with computers when they first started with the IBM's you will be in heaven.I want to thank Red Dragon for producing an amazing keyboard also it lights up, for this price, for this quality, this is like almost stealing without a gun.Yes it is that good I promise you :-)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1525564800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Absolutely amazing, great first mechanical keyboard. UPDATE: 4 years later","reviewDescription":"Just a quick update (9\/22\/2020):Over 4 years later and I everything I said in this review still holds true. I recently recommended this keyboard to a friend, so I looked up the information on Amazon to tell him more about it and in the process I re-discovered my old review; so I felt a need to leave an update. I also noticed that some of the new reviews have reported build quality issues. While I do feel bad for the people that have been experiencing that, I would like to report that my keyboard has not had any of those issues. But it could be possible that their quality control has weakened over the years, so I can't guarantee you won't get a faulty unit. That being said, at this price, you don't have much to lose. And even if you do get a bad one, Amazon has a pretty flexible return policy. Also, it's cool to see that it has RGB now, it didn't have that when I first bought it in 2016. Just had a single color red backlight. Anyways, on with the original reviewThis is one of my first mechanical keyboards, and after using this for just one day, I don't think I'll ever go back to regular old chicklet keyboards. This thing is seriously awesome, the build quality is fantastic, and the typing experience is orgasmic. I have always been thinking about buying a mechanical keyboard, since I always hear that they are far superior, but I used to think that I would have to spend at least $100 for a decent one. When I saw that this was both mechanical and backlit, I was very interested, but also skeptical because of the $40 price tag. When I read some good reviews, I decided to take the plunge. I am sure glad that I did. I am writing this review on this keyboard, and it is just so wonderful, so much better than my old keyboard. There probably are better keyboards than this one out there, but this is definitely the best keyboard that I have ever owned. Funny story, I actually spilled some soda on the keys while writing this; but it's easy to clean because of the included key remover tool, and there is a key lock toggle so I could clean the keys without unplugging the keyboard.TL;DR I just freaking love this keyboard, if you never owned a mechanical keyboard, but I have thought about getting one, I'd highly suggest getting this one as your first.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1459728000000}

{"reviewTitle":"It's good but not what I was expecting - UPDATE: I love it","reviewDescription":"I like this product but I just don't think it's for me, I was excited about getting this mechanical keyboard for such a good price, but overall this has been an all right experience. I still like it and don't want to return it though. If I could give it 3.5 stars I would, it's good but not good for a first mechanical keyboard, the price is fair too.Things I like:Many light modes and it is a very well lit keyboard that is customizable on how they show up but can't change the colors themselves from the keys.Comes with a keycap removal tool.Is pretty loud, satisfying.Doesn't feel cheap, the packaging is great and the weight of it is perfect.Very nice design and the key texture feels good, looks cool too.Things I disliked:Not really clicky or clacky, the keys feel like a big mush so you never really get the feedback of when you clicked a key or not.Is nearly silent when typing quietly however when typing hard the inside of the keyboard literally echoes because it's made out of metal and it is very noticeable and VERY annoying.Along with the mushiness of the keys, the keys themselves are pretty sensitive so I accidentally press things a lot, even when I'm purposely trying to take pressure off of it. I slightly rest my hand on the keyboard and it just holds down a letter, I have big fingers so when I press a key I could literally just touch another one beside it and it would register as both of them, a lot of other issues I can't really explain without making this review way too long but its summed up with these keys being way too mushy and sensitive so I don't really know if a key has gone through or if it's stuck or anything until I see it register, this wouldn't be as big as a problem if only it didn't affect my typing. I noticed an immediate change in my typing speed from averaging 100wpm - 130wpm, to in the 40wpm - 60wpm range which gets super frustrating. I make tons of errors by accidentally tapping other keys and having it register as a full click and I feel like a beginner typing.Hopefully, I just get used to it, I'll update if anything else new happens, I haven't had this keyboard for too long so I don't want a refund at least just not yet but if anything changes I'll make sure to update it too.Overall, this is a solid keyboard for gaming but typing has led me to a bad experience, it can be seen as a personal issue sure, but this keyboard is meant for a certain kind of person, I guess not for me.Update: Giving it 5 stars, I've had it for some months and I've definitely grown to like it, it sounds good but the weird metal echo is still there, feels nice, and it's really easy to clean. This is a definite steal, back when I wrote this I wanted a clicky keyboard but this feels way nicer, I also did no research and didn't know my switches, so that's on me. I have grown to love it, all the issues from before are no longer present after like 2 weeks of use, and my typing WPM has boosted up to 140, not from the keyboard really, but because I love typing on it so much I do nonstop tests for fun and slowly improve. All it took was some time for me to realize just because its not clicky doesn't mean its bad, which I'm sure is obvious to literally everyone except me in the past because I'm dumb. I prefer this now however, they reduced the price too so easy 5 stars.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1597017600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Exceptional and Functional!","reviewDescription":"First impressions:D***, this thing is heavy. D***, this thing is sexy. D***, this thing is magical.This is my first mechanical keyboard and I already love it more than any other keyboard I have ever typed on. (And I have had it for a grand total of five minutes.) I did a lot of research on mechanical keyboards before making any purchases, and with research comes discovery of the prices. They're daunting to say the least, especially when you\u2019re still unsure if you'll even like them. This keyboard is $40, now is that a lot of money? Eh, maybe, it's all about perspective. Do you go to a particular, and popular designer coffee shop on a daily basis? If yes, then I am going to assume you pay at least 5 dollars every day for that coffee. If you cut out that coffee for 8 days, you could have this keyboard; and it\u2019s something that you can have for several months or years, and not just reprocess.Anyways, getting back on track.-My initial experience of the keyboard was perfect. I plugged it into my computer (Windows 10) and it lit right up. I waited a few seconds before using any of the keys assuming it was going to install new software or do some kind of update but that didn't happen. It was literally ready to go straight out of the very nice packaging. All of the \"F\" keys worked as well as their secondary \"FN\" functions. 100% impressed.-The sound of this keyboard is very audible; if that's what you're after then look no further. It's clicky, very, very, clicky.Each press is more satisfying than the last and I love it. Not only is the sound phenomenal, the pressing of the keys is even better. You will notice immediately that they feel different from your laptop keyboard and that free \"membrane\" keyboard that came with your dell computer in 2005.It blows them out of the water. It feels so much more accurate than any other type of keyboard I have used. I am a heavy inaccurate typer; I'm not a fat blind guy, I just smash the absolute hell out of my keys with little to no precision. Since these keys are harder to press down I am noticing right away that I am making fewer mistakes from my run away fingers. So yay, no more rapid fire pressing of the backspace, for which I'm sure it's grateful. But long story short, it feels really good to type on this keyboard, and the keys have a very satisfying feedback.-The LED's are great; they shine brilliantly through the key caps. They can be turned on and off, so you aren't forced to be assaulted by red 24\/7. They can be dimmed which is wonderful because at night I'm sure these bad boys are like the sun. There is also a breathing mode where the keyboard will \"inhale\" and \"exhale\" which is pretty cool.-The size of letters are larger than normal and they look very tactical against the black theme. (With or without the lights on) The keys can be removed, and the keyboard comes with a key puller.-The switches are NOT Cherry MX, and at first it turned me off to this keyboard, but anything else with Cherry switches and LED's was almost double the price. However, they are Cherry MX key cap compatible, so if you plan to switch out keys for different ones it will increase your buying options.-The cable is long and fairly thick (phrasing) however it isn't braided, so keep that in mind if that is one of your \"must haves\".-The windows key can be locked.-There is no number pad; I don't need one or want one.-You will notice a slight mechanical sounding echo, similar to the those echoing mics from the 90s. It's slight, but noticeable in a quiet environment. It doesn't bother me, but at least one of you would probably prefer to listen to a blender full of nitroglycerin and screws.-The keyboard is made out of plastic, but it still of very high quality. It doesn\u2019t make any of those stress pop noises when you pick it up or move it.Overall: This keyboard has far exceeded my expectations and I am exceptionally pleased. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is still on the fence about getting their first mechanical keyboard. I will be updating this review at some point in the future to go over its longevity, wear and tear, or any issues that I may encounter.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1462233600000}

{"reviewTitle":"The same quality as a $90 corsair for less than half the cost?","reviewDescription":"With most half mech keyboards costing around 30-35 usd I wasn't expecting all that much from this mechanical board. But as someone who has used membranes all his life and after buying a laptop that made my wrist hurt after a few hours of gaming I figured I'd dip my toes into the water and buy a mechanical keyboard, but since I had no experience with mechanical keyboards aside from using them at my local Best Buy I wasn't ready to sink 80+ dollars into a board that I might end up hating, so I decided to pick this up. I picked this board instead of some others (like tomoko and gamdias) because I got a Redragon mouse back when I bought my laptop so sticking with the brand and theme seemed wise. Plus I like to beat pretty hard on my keyboards so I figured 55g of force seemed about right for me. So before I do pros and cons keep in mind this is from the perspective of a gamer that plays games like fps shooters (tf2 mainly) to other game types like WoW.PROS:-The feel , you wouldn't think a keyboard could feel very different from another but I'm glad I was wrong, the sharp click and medium force required to actuate the keys is near perfect for me, my fingers don't get fatigued even after hours of gaming.-Build quality, while you are normally touching plastic on the board there is certainly metal in this, as lifting up my membrane board and this reveals that even though this is a 10 key-less board and my membrane isn't the Redragon weighs near twice as much, it's a very solid feeling product.-Lighting, The keyboard that I purchased was the non rgb red version, and wow I'm awed the light of the board goes from off to a very bright and obvious level. (It also includes a breathing mode something I haven't used but I'm sure is fine)MIXED:-The noise, while I quite like the sound that this keyboard makes to the rest of my family it's really annoying I can't recommend this keyboard to someone like a college student with a dorm mate.-Weight as I mentioned earlier, the keyboard is quite heavy especially for a 10 key-less board. While I quite like the hefty feeling and like that it doesn't slide around on my desk anyone that is going to carry this around say from office to office every day it's far too heavy.-Key font, the key font here is definitely targeted towards gamers with large obvious lettering and unique letter design (zoom in on b if you want to see what I mean) this isn't going to fit in on a typical office desk (not that it should the noise would drive your co-workers mad). While I like it a potential buyer should keep it in mind.These ARE NOT cherry mx switches. While I personally can't tell the difference between cherry mx blue switches and these greetech ones if you have been using cherry blue switches since their release back in 1980 whenever you might be able to tell the difference but again I can't.Ten key-less, the removal of this feature really doesn't bother me (I'm not an accountant) I'm sure some people will dislike it but I really can't mark it as a con since I enjoy the extra mouse room and have never really used the num pad on my keyboard. To anyone that absolutely MUST have a num pad for a cheaper price than flagship  mech board from corsair, ducky, joker or whatever look at the Redragon k551 or the Gamdias Hermes lite (both of which can be found on amazon and had for less than 80 usd pretty comfortably)CONS:Missing features, while a lot of higher end keyboards (mainly corsairs and Logitechs) include features like a pass through USB on the keyboard, phone stands, and wrist rests this keyboard includes none. BUT as this price point no one should really expect it too.That's about it, to rap up if you can put up with the noise and don't need to travel anywhere with the keyboard on a day-to-day basis I can't think of any reason to spend more money than this. I love the keyboard and will update this review should anything happens.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1472515200000}

They greeted me in the mornings and evenings and invited me to Christmas parties and Easter egg hunts. I came to know the names of their kids, their anniversaries, and their favorite foods. it was the best of times.Then the clicking began. Click, Clack, Click.You can imagine the surprise when i opened the Amazon package expecting a regular office keyboard and this otherworldly device was in its place. Even though it was an error in the purchasing process, I was up against a hard deadline to finish a project and so there was no time to return the keyboard - I decided to use it after asking myself \"It can't be that much different, can it?\"....Oh....Oh yes it can.Click. Click. Click ClackLittle did I know how wrong I was and it became evident the moment I plugged it in and gave it life. Not power, but life - Instantaneously the keyboard hummed to life, and similar to Gandalf the White casting light from his staff while charging down the hill to Helm's Deep on the first light of the fifth day, the keyboard blinded me as it cast its red light from its perch on my standing desk. Quickly I regained my posture, but it was too late, my curiosity was piqued. I pulled out the owner's manual and to find answers but it read more like a lost scroll from Morrowind. Deep in the manual I was able to find a single recognizable word - \"\u7ea2\u9f99\". Ah yes, finally I had a name- the Red dragon. Mistakenly I mumbled its name and, looking back, this must have been some incantation and like the Book of Amun-Ra I was possessed.Clickety Clickity ClackIt seemed as if I was in slow motion the first time I began to type. The keyboard, sharing the power of its' Redragon, was like a mythical dragon awakening in the lair entrapping the poor fool that disturbed it from its thousand year hibernation. Powerless, I could not stop. I will not stopClack. Click Click, ClackSince that day, my coworkers opinions of me soured. They blamed me for disturbing the peace in the mornings. Instead of songbirds to lift your mood in the morning all they heard was my overwhelming CLICKY CLICKY CLICK. But it was music to my hears. They began to avoid my work space even after i would greet them with \"GoCLICKod MorniCLICKg CLACK guys CLICK CLICK\". I don't know why. Your brain begins to filter it all out after the first ten thousand or so clicks. Though I admit, there are times when the clicking doesn't stop. Like an addiction it is always there; waiting for your moment of weakness to once again enthrall you in its darkness.Clack. clack. clickety clack clack- Cool keyboard.- Def go with the one that includes the num pad though.

Contacted the company and they asked me to pay to ship it back to them so they could replace the whole keyboard. The cost to ship it back wasn't worth another one of these keyboards.  I'd value this redraaaagon around $10 and I'd rather just spend a little more and get an actual keyboard instead of having the replacement breaak in a few months. So i super glued the W key as a temporary fix.Shortly after that, the A key started to triple press randomly when using it.Throwing this one away whenever I settle on a new one.Avoid this at all cost.

Couldn't have been more wrong. The keyboard itself is quality made, heavy as a brick, compact, and just works fantastically.  I love using it .The only problem with it is the type of keys.  They take a lot of pressure to get down (for a keyboard key).  For gaming, they work pretty well but for typing they lowered my WPM from somewhere between 100-120 to around  85- 95ish.  It also became quickly fatiguing and causes finger pain for lengthy typing sessions, just again, from all the extra force it takes.  I don't believe this is something that will bother most people, even touch typers, simply because my pace and usage is so much higher than most consumers.So, if you're on the fence of trying mechanical- get this one.  If you're just looking for a \/new\/ mechanical keyboard, this will do in a pinch, but you should consider paying a bit more for cherry red equivalents if you type fast or game long.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1470009600000}

Now it does it almost constantly.  At this point I've completely removed the keyboard and went back with my 15 year old Logitech G-15.  No problems with it.  So, great for about a month then progressively gets worse.  I'm well past their 90 warranty which is garbage.

I bought some cheap replacement switches which look strikingly exactly like the one in this keyboard and swapped it and everything works fine now. You are getting exactly what you pay for with this keyboard. A well built keyboard made with I suspect budget parts and so buyer beware. My other complaint really is a minor one which is that the RGB patterns on it are pretty crap compared to the mouse I bought with it by the same company which creates a weird contrast.

I did encounter one problem when I was gaming which made me extremely aggravated.  I was playing Valorant and suddenly my \"a\" key stopped working and I could not move left.  This caused me to blow the round.  I used the tool to take the key cap off and put it back on but I still occasionally cannot move left or register the \"a\" key.  Just something to be aware of.

{"reviewTitle":"LEARN WHAT YOU'RE GETTING: Cherry MX Blue, Tactile-Clicky keyboard","reviewDescription":"Despite putting this as 4-stars in my review (which means pretty good), this keyboard is actually not meant for me, as it is a very loud keyboard.There are many types of keyboards. Generally we steer away from the non-mechanical keyboard... which uses a rubber dome that creates its resistance. Mechanical keyboards use physical, actual switches, and there are 3 main categories for mechanical keyboards: Tactile-clicky (which is this keyboard), Tactile-quiet, and Linear.I\u2019ve learned that this is what is called a Tactile-Clicky keyboard. Cherry MX calls this \u201cBlue\u201d... It is the loudest-of-the-loud variant. The keys click with every keystroke; Even when applying gentle pressure onto a key, you will find that it is intentionally made to produce the clicking sounds.This is however unnecessarily loud. Additionally, when you\u2019re typing on this keyboard, you can hear the ringing of metal; which if I\u2019m correct, comes from the springs. I think that not only would typing on this be intrusive to others near you who will no doubt hear you, but the noise it produces is also going to be distracting in moments where you'll be just trying to enjoy a game.However, this keyboard has many pros: It seems to be of very high quality; it is compact and orderly. As far as I can tell, Redragon makes solid keyboards. But also, as Bob Barker would say, the price is right. There are two reasons why I bought this keyboard... the prices being one of them. The other is that, as I saw in the pictures, there is not much bottom light, and the LED is primarily focused on making the letters visible. That is the right use of LED, and I give this keyboard props for that since I am not one who cares for light to shine in extra places where not necessary. Because of that, this Redragon keyboard is recommendable.In the end, it comes down to preferences and what you\u2019re looking for in a keyboard. But for me, this Cherry MX Blue, Tactile-Clicky keyboard is way too loud for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1574812800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not MX Blue equivalent!","reviewDescription":"This keyboard uses Outemu Blue switches which are not as good as MX Blue switches. They have quite a bit more resistance to them than the aforementioned switches. I feel like I have to stab my fingers into the keys to get it to register anything. It's hard to find official documentation for these switches but from the looks of it they require at least 5 grams more activation force. This doesn't sound like a lot but it actually makes a huge difference, especially if you're a light typer.If you're expecting a good MX Blue clone, this isn't the keyboard for you. If you want something with more resistance you might be happy with this keyboard, but I think it is a little disingenuous to market it as an MX Blue equivalent when it really isn't. I've been using this for about a week and a half and so far it has not \"loosened\" up. If the typing experience doesn't improve, I will probably return this keyboard.In short, if you want consistency and you know you like Cherry MX keys, get a Cherry MX keyboard, not this. There's a multitude of cheap MX clones out there now but they all behave slightly differently. This keyboard is louder, clickier (some may take this as a positive), and requires more force to press all keys.Edit: I am updating my rating from a 3\/5 to a 4\/5 partially because of the good service from ChallengerUSA. My keyboard that I originally ordered had a good amount of key chatter - meaning some keys registered more than once when pressing them. They were very helpful in processing a replacement and so far I am not seeing any problems with the new one. This might also be psychological but the new keyboard feels a little bit better than the old one in terms of how stiff the keys feel.But that being said, I still stick with my original point that the Outemu Blue switches feel quite a bit more stiff than MX Blue switches and other similar clones (like Gateron). If you want a more tactile feeling you may enjoy this but if you're used to MX Blue switches you might find these too stiff and you may not enjoy the typing experience.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1530057600000}

{"reviewTitle":"A very good keyboard at a budget-friendly price","reviewDescription":"I am a skilled touch typist and when I happen to look at the keyboard as I am typing I often have to ask myself, \"WHAT is that key I am about to press?\" I mean that the typeface (font) used is like a heiroglyphic to me. The shift legends are side-by-side with the unshifted ones. It looks so peculiar. Some of the keycap characters have divider bars which gives them a stencil effect. \"D\", for one example, is open-faced at the back. It's just so weird. It is hard to notice this in the product photos because the red color has poor contrast against the dark background.As a keyboard, it is good. I am an old-school typis,t and I enjoy typing on this keyboard. It has a nice mechanical clackiness and the feel is good. The switches seem to be imitation Cherry Blues. I can't speak for the lasting quality but they are a very capable knock-off of the real Cherry in my hastily formed opinion. The \"Return\" key on mine was mushy, though, and it bothered me whenever I pressed it as it made no sound. Sound and feel is part of keeping a good typing rhythm. I found that after pressing it down really hard the operation became more normal with a very muted click. I suppose it was not seated well from the factory.This keyboard is nice for home use but it would be considered noisy if others are around to hear it as in an office. That's a characteristic of the \"blue\" keys used. The price is hard to beat and illuminated keys can be very helpful when trying to find home position in the dark. Mine is the red light version and it dims well and can be turned on or off, too. Unfortunately, after the computer restarts each morning I have to readjust the lighting and settings as the keyboard has no memory. I really like that I can turn off the awful \"Windows\" key.

If not for a short list of things I dislike about this keyboard, I'd give it a 5 star review.Pros:- The tactile response of the switches feels excellent and I my typing speed was fast right out of the box (I typically type between 80 and 90 wpm).- The base of the keyboard is solid and there is zero flex when typing. This is especially important to me and any flex results in a pretty poor review from me.- The keycaps are decent, not bad but not that great. Definitely acceptable for a keyboard in this price range.Cons:- Under the F5 key, there was a little piece of plastic material left over from the manufacturing process (I imagine). This piece of plastic is stuck inside the switch enclosure, and blocks the LED for that switch, making it dimmer than the others. I was able to get the piece of plastic out of the way of the LED, but it's still stuck inside the switch enclosure, which I find annoying. It's the kind of issue I'd expect from a product at this price point, so I didn't detract points for this but I find it irritating.- The spacebar has an annoying ring to it if you hit it hard. I often trigger this sound and it bugs the heck out of me. Hopefully I can learn to go lighter on the spacebar.- The shift, enter and backspace keys are a little mushier than the rest of the keys, giving the keyboard an inconsistent feel. Once again, this is the kind of thing you could expect from a cheaper product. It's annoying as heck but I'll probably get used to it. The backspace key in particular suffers from this mushy feel.All things considered, this is a really decent keyboard in its own right, and definitely great for it's price.

I expected to receive a keyboard that was indeed mechanical, with it's generic brand green switches like it advertises. I also expected it to be made of a cheaper feeling plastic, etc.However, what I received was completely different. The tactile feel of these generic green switches are incredibly satisfying. The sound of the clicks are superb considering the price. I've genuinely had worse feeling mechanical keyboards that I paid over $100 for. Also, the build quality is impeccable. Again, considering the price you pay for this keyboard. It's heavy feeling. The good kind of heavy. It's high quality. You can even tell that they care about the quality before you even open the box. It's made with a sturdy cardboard that actually allows you to keep and repackage the keyboard if you move it, or switch keyboards. Not like the flimsy weak, low quality boxes of most membrane keyboards.The rubber feet that flip up on the bottom of the keyboard are once again, great quality. The rubber on it really GRIPS the surface it's on. You can put it on a surface, and tip that surface to ALMOST 90 degrees, and it'll stay put right where you put it.Even comes with a key cap puller, which I half didn't expect because of the price of this board.I am VERY pleased with the quality of this keyboard. It is above and beyond the price you will pay for this keyboard. You will not be disappointed. If you're someone who's looking for their first mechanical keyboard to try and see what all the hype is regarding mechanicals, this is the absolute PERFECT keyboard.

I had to get used to pressing down a little harder and further than on a thin \u201cregular\u201d keyboard.

You'll get a much better tpying experience with a mechanical keyboard and to be honest the noise isn't that loud at all from what I've noticed and the switches feel very close to Cherry MX blues and the construction of the keyboard is a very premium feeling metal plate with plastic sides, very strong and can easily last years even with hard typers like myself. My only complaints is that the cable is not braided or removable, so just be sure not to pinch the cable or tug it, and also there's only a 'clicky' variant.

These are not Cherry MX Green equivalents as listed, but Cherry MX Blue equivalents. About the switches, they accept standard keycaps make for Cherry MX stems. These are blues, which are great for typists (that don't share a room with anyone else). These are loud switches, as all blues are. Great tactile feedback and great press.Function - Works great as a MX Blue starter point. All keys work perfectly, and the back lighting is just the right intensity. Each press is satisfying.Fit - It's a standard tenkeyless size and fit. As with all tenkeyless boards, it has no wrist wrest. If you spend multiple hours at your desk a day, investing in a wrist wrest is a wise decision.Finish - Aluminum construction, ABS construction, and ABS keycaps (Not PBT). It looks nice, keys feel nice on the fingertips. Gold plated USB is a nice touch. All in All, the finish on the board is well above the 40 dollar price range. RGB lighting would be preferable.Other Notes: My wife hate it.

Eventually after messing with the A key a couple times after a couple days I managed to get it back. I stuck with the keyboard and have not had problems since and hopefully it stays that way because I do like it.Also this model does have RGB features to change light patterns on the keyboard but for example if you wanted to make the whole entire keyboard purple or red or blue you cannot you can only stick with the select patters they have provided with the keyboard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1611619200000}

Furthermore, the thing took less than 3 months with NO GAMING USAGE TO TURN INTO A POS. 3 MONTHS. That is absurd. Save your money, do not buy this piece of junk. Moreover, learning to type with this toilet machine is terrible. Absolutely would recommend this to someone I hate.HonestlyLet me repeatDO NOT BUY.EDIT: Company reached out and sent a new one. I\u2019ve been so busy I haven\u2019t even reconnected it and been able to send back the old one. However I am impressed by their customer support. I explained due to health reasons I couldn\u2019t leave. They had it delivered and said it can be sent back in the same bag.This keyboard took getting used to - but I\u2019ve never been able to accurately type, game or do anything so well. It all depends on your ability to adapt from something you\u2019re used to. If the lights fail you are still left with a good keyboard at the end of the day. It simply takes a decent amount of time to get used to. Between the possible speed and keyboard support from the company I\u2019ve changed my rating. It will most likely be a five as I finally hook it up and verify lights don\u2019t instantly crash again. I\u2019d prefer the lights be off - instead of 1\/4 still work.Thanks for the customer support.

{"reviewTitle":"Great for first mech or rebuild, others so-so","reviewDescription":"TLDR: For my modding purposes this is perfect, but for others might be meh.I wanted to buy the cheapest mechanical keyboard I could and rebuild it custom to learn rather than dumping $$$ into something I might not like.

There\u2019s some metallic pinging as I type, some keys feel clunkier than others, so on. In my personal opinion I like the Outemu Red switches on here and will likely keep them or swap for their browns. They\u2019re similar enough to Cherry MX Reds and feel lighter oddly. The RGB is not as bad as I expected or as others reviewed here and despite it not being stable (flickers), it\u2019s easier on my eyes than my full size membrane keyboard. Overall a solid purchase for modding or if you\u2019re okay with putting in a little elbow grease (lube switches, maybe some sound dampening) this can be a good bang for your buck purchase. It\u2019s cheaper than many other membrane or mech keyboards and has blue or red switches that are Cherry MX equivalent.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1632700800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Mechanical clacky goodness on a budget.","reviewDescription":"This review is for the K552 Tenkeyless Mechanical Keyboard.I've had this device for a few weeks now; obviously only additional time will speak to its durability.  My decision on this plank was based on mechanical keyswitches, price, and size (specifically the tenkeyless option).  It's being used in a variety of applications on my home workstation, including word processing and casual gaming.Pros:* It's compact without being undersized and has a solid feel to it. The USB cable isn't braided but the PVC jacket seems more than hefty enough.* The key layout is very standard without any attempts at re-arranging or over-sizing the navigation keys.* The keystroke response is solid, maybe a little on the deep side but the pressure is ideal for my personal typing style, which I must admit is a little heavy-handed even outside of gaming.  Couldn't say if they're Cherry brand or what Cherry model they'd be comparable to, but I like them so far.* All plug-n-play - no drivers or software required.Cons:* Not really a \"con\", per se, but it *is* a mechanical keyboard so don't depend on it to be stealthy - I live in an upstairs apartment and I imagine my downstairs neighbors can probably hear me clacking away.* It would have been nice to have a few bytes of NVRAM to retain my settings; as is, you'll need to re-set any preferences on each boot.* The backlight is red.  RED.  Again, not really a \"con\", especially for me as it's my preference and I knew that when I purchased it, but if you don't like red, best look for another device.* It's all plastic.  I'd suspect from the weight of the thing there must be some metal other than the screws in there somewhere, but outside it's all plastic.  Appears to be a pretty durable matte finish though.If you don't have a need for a slew programmable keys (I have a Logitech G13 pad and G600 mouse to cover those needs) then this looks to be an excellent budget-wise choice for keyboard.IMPORTANT NOTE to the seller\/manufacturer: ~You REALLY REALLY should un-group your products - the reviews here are for a variety of devices and the mix-n-match of them is NOT conducive to accurate or informative ratings and reviews.~","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"99 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1454198400000}

It is amazing for the price, really nice quality, rgb look really good, and its got some weight to it to keep it in place. My desk is 31 inches so I don't have much space for gaming, but this keyboard is a little under 14 inches so it's perfect for the people with a small desk. The rgb is a good brightness when turned up all the way but it won't shine super bright with your room lit up. It has a lot of cool patterns and effects, oh and it comes with a keycap remover which is nice to clean them off.  If your on a tight budget and want a small mechanical keyboard with rgb then this is the right product. Even with the price the keyboard has really good quality that you are going to respect.

(both of which can be fixed, though) The backspace and enter keys are especially mushy. Other than that, the switches themselves feel perfectly fine out of the box. They could maybe go with a little lube, but I like them a lot as-is.There\u2019s like, no deck-flex in this board whatsoever. It\u2019s built like a rock. You could throw this thing against a wall in a fit of blind video game rage, and it would come out relatively unscathed, save for a few missing keycaps. I also really like the LED lights. There are some nice pattern options, but the colors are not customizable. You would have to do some extreme DIY to replace the lights.If you don\u2019t like the Reddragon logo on the board (like me), I discovered that if you go at it for 15 minutes with a pencil eraser and some elbow grease, it can come right off.The one I got is hotswap-able, which means it\u2019s very easy to replace the switches with something you like better, but I am perfectly okay with the reds that came in it. This keyboard being hotswap-able was a major selling point for me because I\u2019m interested in modding mechanical keyboards. It increases the value and potential of this keyboard for beginners and veterans alike by a lot.Reddragon has become a very reputable company, and I use their M913 Impact Elite mouse alongside this keyboard. I could not be more satisfied with both the mouse and this keyboard for the money I spent on them.Pros:- solid build quality- good switches- easily moddable to increase performance\/value- cool lights- you could buy like 4 of these for the price of an entry-level custom mechanical keyboardCons:- spring ping- awful stabilizers- keycaps get greasy over time- (for some people) made by ReddragonOverall: Compared to other, more expensive, custom keyboards? 6\/10.Not compared to other keyboards that are heaps more expensive? 8\/10.My biggest gripe is the spring ping, which can easily be fixed by opening up the keyboard and stuffing some foam in there.

I do however know that while I was shopping around and looking for the best budget MKB (between $40-$60) that included some form of RGB and for me personally having red-style key switches over blue, that this keyboard kept coming up, and for $40 you really cannot go wrong. Although these are not your true Cherry Red MX switches; for someone like myself who has not had any experience with any type of switch, i.e. blue, red, brown, black, silver, etc., these Outemu Red switches are doing a great job so far. I'm sure the true Cherry MX switches are a lot nicer and whatnot, but besides the HyperX Alloy FPS Pro ($69.99) that doesn't even have RGB, just red backlighting, isn't even in stock for at least another week, it wasn't worth it to me. The $30 I saved is basically paying for a pack of case fans or going towards an aftermarket CPU cooler.Ultimately, if your anything like me or in a similar situation as me, where you maybe just built your first ever Gaming PC and you have already spent a lot of money on perfecting the build you wanted, but you totally forgot about the accessories like your monitor, mouse, and keyboard, and you don't wanna have to go and spend another couple hundred dollars for them 3 things then I would highly recommend this keyboard. The fact that I was able to receive the Red Dragon K552 in just a day, even when it was estimated to arrive in 2 days via Prime's 2-Day Shipping, I had actually received it before I even received the last part of my build (Motherboard) that I had ordered in stock and that shipped with the rest of the parts 6 days earlier.Aside from being a complete noob and not knowing much about mechanical keyboards; I can safely say that for the price point, the features (RGB), and the durability of the keyboard (steel frame) any other first-time gaming PC builders out there will not regret this board, especially if this is going to be your first mechanical keyboard with some form of MX switches or you are coming from a membrane keyboard.Is it the best? No, most definitely not.Is it reasonably priced and full of features for the average user? 100%.

{"reviewTitle":"OK keyboard especially good for the price","reviewDescription":"This keyboard is great but turned out that I do not like mechanical keyboards. I have only been using this for a few days and I generally like it. For the money this is a great keyboard. It has real mechanical switches and definitely some metal inside, judging by the weight. It has nice rubber feet and it stays put on the table. Key feel very good and typing experience is very nice. The keyboard has at least 10 key rollover. I could not test more keys than that since I only have 10 fingers, so for the rest of the keys I trust the description. The cable is very solid and should not break. I actually never had keyboard cable break so this one should be OK too.Now for the not so good parts. The keyboard is loud. It is not excessively loud for this type of keyboard, but it is loud. Turned out that I prefer membrane keyboard better and do not like the noise of the mechanical one. Typing at night when people are sleeping is not a good idea. Also I would not be getting mechanical keyboard for the office, unless I want everyone around me to hate me. It also slows down my typing but I think it is because I use different keyboard at work.The backlight does not stay off. I have to turn it off every time the computer powers up or wakes up from sleep. I got the keyboard with the red light and had I known that the light does not stay off, I would have opted for the one with no light. Absence of light memory is definitely a miss on the manufacturer part. Without backlight however the writing on the keys is not clearly visible even in good light.Although media keys are present, the sleep button is not. This is also a definite miss. Pretty much every keyboard these days has a sleep button. I fixed this with an Autohotkey script but it would be nice if the sleep key would be included. After all it is just a software fix in the keyboard. Something like Fn+Pause would work nicely.The keyboard is quite tall. This is not really a negative but just an observation. You may want to invest in wrist pad to use with the keyboard. I also think it would be hard to clean. Generally I clean my keyboards about once every 6 month or so. With membrane keyboard, one can take off the key part and just give it a wash in the sink with some dish soap. The dry it for a bit and it is a good as new. This may be a problem since every key cap is separate.But overall this is a great keyboard for the price. If you want a mechanical keyboard that clicks and don't want to spend a lot of money I would highly recommend this keyboard. Even if you want to just try how mechanical keyboard would feel you may want to start with this one.

At around 2 pounds this thing won't move around, and with the rubber feet that can be extended, it won't be going anywhere.* The heavy aluminum backplate means there is literally 0 deck flex* The overall build quality of the keyboard is very good. the keycaps feel good and the home row is easy to find.* This is a more compact keyboard so it saves space on your desk.* The switches are Outemu red switches. These are basically an equivalent of Cherry MX Reds. So they feel very similar.* Since this keyboard uses Cherry clones replacing the keycaps is very easy because all you need is any keycap set that is compatible with cherry switches.CONS:* The \"Gamer font\" on the keycaps that come with the keyboard is hands down the most god awful keycaps that I have ever seen. I'd much rather replace them with a set of keycaps that have a more professional looking font. Personally I'll be buying a new keycap set to replace this one soon.* This specific keyboard does NOT have full RGB. That is only available on the $44 variant. This one has 1 color for each row of keys. i.e. the number row is blue, the first row of keys is red, etc. And these colors cannot be changed.* Personally id like it if there was more customization available in the lighting department, there are quite a few lighting modes but in terms on making your own it's virtually impossible the software that can be found on redragon's website is actually horrible and I would not recommend getting this for the sole purpose of the \"RGB\"* There is a weird branding lip above the arrow keys that wobbles horribly anytime that I touch it. If they really wanted to drop branding on it that badly they could have done it without the cheap-feeling plastic lip. I personally will be using black paint or nail polish remover to get red of the branding.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The RedDragon K552 is a great tenkeyless keyboard.for around $35 this is a great keyboard with linear outemu red switches and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a cheap truly mechanical keyboard, and not one of those trashy \"mechanical feel\" membrane keyboards.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1599436800000}

The outemu blue switches are very good. Very similar to the cherry Mx blues.  Status leds ( e.g. capslock) .  The key switches are hot swappable, but the switches are fairly difficult to remove.  The 2 pin holes are also for  the narrow outemu pins. I have a set of Halo clear swithes, and with determination and hard work I was able to replace a few.  (I swapped the switches to halo clears for the arrow keys just to see if this can be done). I had to file and lubricate the pins, and the halo-s almost but not quite click (lock) into place. After doing this I decided it is not worth the hassle. Using 2x 0.2 mm o-rings or a single 0.4mm o-ring per keycap decreases the key noise to the point that the keyboard sounds reasonably quiet although still a bit clicky.  So:A set of 0.4mm  o-rings and a new set of keycaps ( the razer set works)  are a reasonable easy  upgrade.Dislikes:-The double shot keycaps feature rather ugly, hard to read  lettering.  Seems like all  cheapo keyboards use the same ugly generic doubleshot  keycap set. ( I got me some white razer keycaps, I like those a lot better)-As the keys bottom out, the keyboard has some sort of faint ringy echo, which grows more annoying over time,.  -No bypass USB port.-The key switches are solderless\/swappable but not really cherry-mx interchangeable. In theory they are, but the pin holes are too narrow, so it is an unreasonable amount of work and risk.  The pcb has no holes for stabilizer pins either.  The Outemu sky blue-s  or similar outemu switches may be an easier option.Consider, that you have to spend another $40 on the new keycap set and the o-rings, and for that kind of moneyyou can just buy a Razer Black Widow Lite tkl with nice keycaps, o-ring set, and razer orange tactile but silent switches,  all you have to do it put on the o-rings.

It's got good key feedback and supposedly is a cheap alternative to Cherry MX Blue keyboards, which are pretty pricey.  It should work very well for gamers who want clicky feedback for gaming, and for home users who want clicky feedback for typing.  I suggest trying this keyboard out for a while before you swing for hundreds of dollars on an expensive mechanical keyboard. You might decide this one is sufficient, or you might decide that mechanical keyboards are not for you.Pros- Clicky feedback is great for typing - just the right resistance for me- I haven't measured my WPM but I definitely type faster with this keyboard than membrane keyboards- Cheap and easy entrance to mechanical keyboards- Very solid and sturdy build with good weight and non-slip pads so it doesn't slide around- Removable keys for easy cleaningCons- Clicky-ness is loud and might disturb others if there are others around you- FN-key functions aren't backlit (such as volume control, etc)- No numpad at this price point, though they do have a model with a numpad for more money (the K551)- Seems to be wearing out after a couple years of heavy use (see comments below)- Key press clicks aren't always 100% representative of key presses (on some keys, the key press registers before the click)- Not the greatest for gaming where finger speed is criticalAfter several years of use, a couple keys (notably space and dash) have developed some kind of double press.  Sometimes (and this is rare, maybe 1 in 20 times), I'll press the dash key and two dashes will appear. It usually only appears if I'm typing really fast. Maybe I press two keys at the same time and that throws something off inside.  Most often it occurs when I press word-space-dash-space-word, I might end up with word-space-dash-space-dash-word instead. I'm 100% sure I only pressed the dash once, but it registers twice.  I've seen this occasionally with the space bar and a couple other random keys. It hasn't bothered me too much because I make enough errors in typing that it's no big deal to add these errors to the corrections I already have to make.  But beware, there may be long-term issues related to the switches.  Keep in mind I use this keyboard for programming and probably put 10,000+ key presses a day through it, so it does get pretty heavy use.  Maybe I just need to fork over more money for a keyboard with real brand-name switches.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1563148800000}

I used Krytox 205g0 and it took a full day to lube all the switches (though this was my first time lubing). I lubed the stabilizers with Krytox 205g0 as well and band-aid modded them. This heavily reduced the rattle and I would look up \"band-aid mod for keyboards\" if you don't know what it is if you want any stabilizers to sound good.

Not only is it mechanical it's actually backlit too! and it's not too bright, just right, easy to see even with the monitor right infront of it.Raised keys, a simple little touch, but makes the keyboard look that much better.Now onto the cons:There aren't that many cons really, at this price point it's bettery tactile wise than literally every keyboard out there, due to the fact it is an actual mechanical keyboard.But the only real Con that I can find is that it says the switches used are a Cherry Green Equivalent, but they're not. They're a Cherry MX Blue clone if even that, a real cherry MX Green has about 70grams of actuation force, this keyboard has 55grams. I measured using quarters, it took 10 quarters to make the switch depress. But more on these switches, they say that they're Greetech switches, however I can't find the same or similar switches anywhere online! These switches might be a knock off of a knock off.....but lets be honest, it's a $40 mechanical keyboard. that's actually mechanical.

I play a lot of R6 and Rocket League and I began to notice that certain keys would not register. After a bit of testing I realized that the \"D\" and \"Space\" keys were the one not registering and if I wanted them to register I would have to press it multiple times. Hopefully this problem doesn't get worse because it would just make games way more unplayable than they already are. Excluding the key issue its a great keyboard but I just can't see this problem not getting worse in the future so I recommend getting a more expensive keyboard from Logitech, Corsair and Steelseries so you don't run into this issue.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1603584000000}

Does that make it static RGB LEDs? Like they're RGB but only a single color is configured. Otherwise there's also no software to configure the LED patterns or feedback. The larger keys like shift, enter etc all have very different required pressure to depress them than the other alphanumeric keys. I think plainly the main problem I have with the keyboard is the LEDs and I do not fault redragon for that, but Amazon because Redragon's website clearly states this a 'rainbow' keyboard without using the term RGB at all.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1599004800000}

The WASD keys are sometimes unresponsive and I usually have to use force to actually move or tap on it a few times. The same goes for the spacebar, T, E, F, G, R, basically all of them.

{"reviewTitle":"I've got good news, this keyboard is the real deal","reviewDescription":"I can't believe that since I started PC gaming more than a decade ago I've been buying cheap $20-$30 rubber dome keyboards because I assumed that I couldn't afford a mechanical. When I saw this keyboard I assumed that it had to have some kind of catch to it, that there's no way that a real mechanical keyboard could be this cheap. Well, I've got good news, this keyboard is the real deal. And it's an amazing upgrade from those cheap keyboards I've been gaming on for my whole life.I will preface this review by saying that I haven't spent any extended periods of time with a mechanical keyboard in the past, only here and there at friends' houses, so I'm not exactly an authority on mechanical keyboards. That said, the keys on this keyboard feel like the perfect balance in terms of responsiveness and clickiness. They give just enough resistance to feel satisfying to press, but they won't wear your fingers out. They're loud, sure, but they're not so loud that I worry that they'll keep my wife awake when she's trying to sleep in the next room over.I also love the build and form factor of this keyboard. It feels weighty and well-built, and its small form-factor has freed up tons of space on my desk.I do have a few irks, though. I'm not a huge fan of the font; it just seems too large and gamer-y, but that can be changed with new caps I suppose. Also, I find it really weird how the arrow keys have WASD printed on them for some reason (I guess so that you could theoretically swap them with the default WASD keys maybe) and it just looks really weird. Small details, sure, but they kind of take away from the elegant beauty that this keyboard could have with better keycaps. I don't think that anyone would take a look at this keyboard and mistake it for a $150 peripheral, but hey, looks aren't everything.I also wish there was a way to change the LEDs to blue to match the rest of my setup but there doesn't seem to be one; there's no software included with the keyboard and I can't find anything online.Overall, though, I'm extremely happy with this keyboard and it just further goes to show that Redragon makes great, underrated peripherals. Highly recommended if you're looking for a mechanical on a budget.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1468368000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Absolutely great mechanical keyboard at an equally great price.","reviewDescription":"What a buy! I have been looking for a mechanical keyboard for years to replace my old POS membrane keyboard and happened upon this one through a Youtube review.  For the money, I honestly couldn't be more impressed.  I got the red LED-backlit version, and this is my \"pros and cons\" review of that.Pros:1) The LED backlighting is pretty great, and the controls are intuitive and subtly marked on the keys.  The keyboard comes with an instruction manual, which clearly explains the different features of the backlighting and how to use them.2) the \"feel\"- The \"click\" is supremely satisfying and tactile, and even converted my girlfriend who knows nothing about computers.  Her exact comment was \"something about typing on this keyboard just feels really d*** good\".  I dont know enough about the various switches to clarify what exactly this most closely resembles, but both the amount of force needed and the corresponding feedback really remind me of why I love mechanical keyboards.3) The build.  The keyboard itself is very well built and sturdy and so far has held up to my fat ham-hock hands pounding away as I do.  The bottom of the keyboard has some very sturdy feet that elevate the angle about perfect for my usage, and the rubber pads hold it in place on my desk very well.Cons:1) None.  I mean, I suppose I could complain that it it's a numberpad-less keyboard, but I dont use the number pad and I wont miss it.  (Plus the pictures clearly show what you are getting).  I could also complain it's only a single color backlight, but again, I bought the red LED model and I knew exactly what I was getting.  Heck, I could have bought the RGB backlit model for 20$ more.  Maybe next time?Final thoughts:Just get it.  It's $36 at the time of writing this review and I would buy another in a heart beat.  Super cheap, super sturdy, backlight is awesome, feels fantastic- I couldn't recommend this keyboard more and in fact, I WILL recommend this keyboard to others.Let me know if you have any questions about the keyboard and I will answer them as soon as I can.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1487980800000}

That could be a con for some but it makes things easy and straight to the point. The k552 was my first every mechanical keyboard I have gotten a few years back and recently I have just purchased another one but this time to fully modify and rebuilt it for a friend. Coming back to the keyboard I have realized somethings.1. its a fairly good prebuilt keyboard especially for its price2. its price dropped over the years and is more accessible3. its really easy to mod with the right toolsI Do have some cons but there very minor and looking at a keyboard this accessible it is totally fine.1. it is loud if you are a heavy typist or use a lot of strength while gaming2. most of the keycaps are very hallow so that also contributes to the noiseBut these cons like I said are totally pass able. If the keycaps are a issue you can always get another set of keycaps or find a way to mod the keycaps. And as for the noise its mostly ping from the case being to hallow but a fix to that is opening up the board and putting foam in witch is not a hard prosses. But most people buying this board is probably on a budget so there is really no need to be to worried about these small cons.Over all its a very normal keyboard that is very functional and has good moding potential","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620777600000}

{"reviewTitle":"The cheapest entry into the realm of truly mechanical keyboards","reviewDescription":"The first obvious pro of this is that it's about half the cost of even the cheapest mechanical keyboards. They get the price down in a couple of ways.First of all, the switches, while they work under the same mechanical principle as Cherry Red switches, are their own in-house version. I can't think of a reason why that's a bad thing unless you really think no one else can build keyboard switches like Cherry. These look and sound just like them. I can't say fi they'll last as long since I just got this keyboard today.The other major way is the LEDs. They are not RGB LEDs. Each row has its own color, and what you see in the photos are the only colors each key is capable of. That said, there are different patterns and movements that can be cycled through on the keyboard itself, as well as patterns that light up different keys for different games. They can also be set to constant on.The third way is no ten-key on the side. But let's be real: when's the last time you used that anyway? If you're not an accountant, you won't even miss it.So after telling you what's wrong with it, here's what's great: This keyboard is a joy to type on. Keys are nicely responsive with a pleasant clicking sound. It's full-size for those used to touch typing, and it will take up less space on your desk.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1628294400000}

The function keys row is always the same color, same with the QWERTY row, ASDFG row, etc, etc. it does however do all the other functions like pulsing lights, breathing and that cool rain effect from the matrix movies. as for the rest it is 100% legit mechanical Keyboard. I bought it for work so the RGB aspect doesn't bother me so i'm not gonna doc em a point for that or anything just though it should be known if you're looking for that feature specifically.The keyboard has a nice sound and feel and it's not so loud that it bothers my coworkers. Lighting has several brightness stages that look good in office lighting and can even be turned off. it feels hefty and doesn't slide around on my desk. I haven't played any game with it as I bought it mainly to replace the crappy work keyboard and to force myself to type by touch on the top row number keys since I haven't really used them since I graduated college except for the \"@\" symbol when typing email. It\u2019s worth the price and if you need the number pad they have a model with that for and extra $5.

{"reviewTitle":"Great keyboard","reviewDescription":"This keyboard is great, I've had is for a solid three months now and I haven't had any problems with it. I actually enjoy typing things out on it, it's just so satisfying, though it is louuud so if you tend to be around people when doing your typing you might want to think twice about getting this one. The red backlight looks fantastic, it's not overly bright, even at it's brightest setting, but can be dimmed to your liking and honestly I don't know how I've gone without a backlit keyboard all this time, it's both visually appealing and functional, as it makes the keys really easy to see in the dark. I really like that they didn't go with any absurd \"gamer\" looking fonts on the keys, they are stylized, but it's subtle enough for me. The branding is subtle as well, I hate how on many mechanical keyboards the manufacturer will have their logo slapped across somewhere extremely conspicuously, which has often times deterred me buying a certain keyboard. There is a breathe functions to the leds where they'll fade on and off but I just think it looks a bit weird and would be distracting to see while doing anything so I don't use it. The anti ghosting functionality is great as well, it's one of those things you don't realize you need till  you have. It allows you to press any number of keys at the exact same time and the characters will all appear on screen. This in and of itself isn't that useful, but when doing a repetitive task such as entering something over and over into excel cells it's great because you cant go as fast as you humanly can without any hiccups.I can't testify to the quality of this mechanical keyboard as compared to other more expensive and more well know brands as this is the first mechanical key board I've had, and I'm sure that this keyboard isn't as good as the more expensive ones with the brand name switches, but I don't doubt that it can hold its own in the mechanical keyboard market quite well, and for the price I think it's fantastic.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1488672000000}
