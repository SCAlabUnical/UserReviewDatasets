{"reviewTitle":"Okay for the price...","reviewDescription":"I read the reviews and expected to get a great vacuum cleaner with an amazing suction power. So many people praised it and said it surprised them with how powerful it was. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It sucks but not in a good way. It takes a lot of moves over the same spot to clean it. It misses a lot of dirt, even on the hardwood floors, and especially so on the carpet.But why did I decide to keep it?1. Because it still does its job. Yes, a regular vacuum is still needed once a week, but this one is okay for everyday, not-so-perfect cleaning. I can definitely feel the difference under my bare feet. I will be using it every day to clean the bathroom's floor where my cat's toilet is placed (and for other rooms too).2. It's super lightweight. This is crucial to me. If it was too heavy to move, I would be too lazy to use it often. But this thing can be held with one hand! I think even a child or an older person can use it with ease.3. It's slim and can be placed somewhere in a corner. I keep my regular vacuum in a closet, but this little one can be stored somewhere in a hall or a room, which makes it convenient to use whenever I want.4. Easy to empty the trash.5. There is nothing better for the price. More powerful models cost $100+, so I decided this one does its job fairly well and I'm keeping it.UPDATE: okay I\u2019m changing my opinion. Initially I gave this item 3\/5 stars, now I gave it 4 stars and even think it deserves 5 stars, but there are minor objective cons.The cons: the sound is pretty loud; the suction power is mild.Other than that, it\u2019s an amazing vacuum that solves all my issues with chores. I really needed this thing. It\u2019s so lightweight that I sometimes use it multiple times a day, because it\u2019s super easy to pick it up and do a quick cleaning without treating it like a hard procedure. It does its job despite being less powerful than regular vacuums. It\u2019s thin and I put it in a corner from where it\u2019s easy to pick it ip any time. The cord is long enough for my apartment. I\u2019m glad I bought it, and I hope it won\u2019t break too soon!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"247 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717977600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Lovd it so far","reviewDescription":"I have been using the vacuum for just over a month. This makes vacuuming my stairs and hard floors so much easier. I do it a lot more often too because I no longer have to haul out my big vacuum and deal with the attachments and cord. On a full charge I can get my kitchen, 3 bathrooms, 2 small entryways, and my carpeted stairs done with medium speed. The battery is dead by the end. I do wish it came with 2 batteries though so I could leave one on the vacuum and one on the charger to switch out when it dies. The baterries take 3-4 hours to charge and I get about 25-30 mins from it.  It does just as good as my big vacuum on the stairs. Both my big vacuum and this one have a motorized brush attachment. It does well getting to the edge of the hard floors and picks up small debri. Something like a piece of cereal you would have to lift it a little since there is not much space between the floor nozzel and the floor. Not a huge problem for me since I am mostly vacuuming animal fur and sand. I do have a small complaint about empting the dirt cup. The filter really holds the dirt and it hard to tap the dirt out and I often make a mess around my trash can in the process. I do blow it out with our air compressor outside every couple weeks. The suction power will reduce as the filter gets dirter (I learned this after vacuuming the spider webs from my garage walls), but once full cleaned the suction power returns to normal. You can wash it in the sink, but why get it wet if I have the ability to clean it with air. I also have to use my hand to get the hair and dirt off from the metal filter.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717545600000}

I had already started a return, but, before I boxed it up I decided to give it one more chance. I realized the canister was in the position to empty, at approximately a 45 degree angle from the stick \u201cbackbone.\u201d (see photos for reference) I clicked it in before starting my second attempt around the house and it had so much suction that I could only use the lowest setting on my low pile washable rugs and even then it was lifting them up at times. I say this to mean, it was my OPERATOR ERROR the first go round that resulted in hardly any dirt, dust, or dog hair being picked up. I can\u2019t help but wonder if many of the others who gave low ratings had the same problem. It picked up super fine dust and dander from our living room and I\u2019m excited to run it again. Cons: 1) It always starts in medium mode and has to go to turbo before you can switch to low. 2) There is no option to turn the roller bar off on the foot attachment. 3) It is quite top heavy so make sure you lean it against something. 4) The foot attachment does not click into an upright position. I deducted 1 star for the above reasons.

{"reviewTitle":"Great Cleaning and Vacuuming power from the Bissel Stick Vac","reviewDescription":"I will say out right this little Bissel Stick Vac does and excellent job in cleaning and is much more vacuuming pick up power than I had figured on.  The first day I used my Bissel Stick Vac it performed very well out of the box.  I live in a 2 bedroom apartment, with a small living room and a kitchen with linoleum floor.  It is an older-building constructed back in 1965 according property tax records.  So the outside structure is failing apart. I live on the top floor of this 2 floor apartment complex with 19 units in total. The apartments are not enclosed so the upper concrete walk way has railings and covered by protective awnings but open air design still exposure to wind, rain, sunlight and other elements.Anyways the amount of dust and dirt the Bissel Vac picked up was amazing.  The filter was literally caked with dust and dirty like a dirty snowball or Cotton Candy you find at a carnival vendor. Believe me I keep my apartment clean as a matter of principle, so I mop and clean on a daily basis so things do not accumulate. I could dust more but this unit I live in does NOT  have central A\/C or Heating.  This apartment is cooled and heated by mounted wall units. The A\/C unit is permanently mount half way from the inner wall to the outside ear my front door. It is an older model and NOT very energy efficient by todays standard. However it is  closed end unit, meaning it only circulates air that is drawn from within the apartment itself and NOT in-taking Air directly from the outside of the apartment.  The outside portion of the Wall A\/C is mainly to house the compressor and cooling mechanism units where the refrigeration gases are stored. As well as provide for heat exhaust and exchange for the mechanism itself when in operation. (Sorry do not mean to get off the subject but I just wanted to give potential buyers for the Bissel Stick Vac an idea of the real world environment this product is performing in).The Bissel's motor and housing assembly also contain the detachable canister where the debris is collected, until the receptacle is cleaned out. The unit is light weight, so it is easy to maneuver in tight areas and is perfect for carpeted or hard floor steps.  The Bissel also detaches and as 1 extra attachment a long straight non-flexible nozzle which is great for cleaning the edges of floorboards or hard to reach areas or tight corners that a normal vacuum may not reach.  As far as cleaning under couch furniture cushions and around the bed areas where dust and dirt tends to collect around the post or caster feet of the frames or Chest of drawers it does a smash up job in quickly cleaning those hard to reach areas. However the straight non-flexible attachment is NOT very long just maybe 1 foot in length so you will not be able to reach areas that are more than an adults arm length to reach.I have lived nearly 2 years in this current apartment, and the edges of my matted carpet and floorboards have never been cleaner than after using the Bissel Stick Vac.  The roommate I had before this was lazy and did not vacuum him self a all. So I inherited a rather dirty apartment by my standards , when he moved out earlier last year. I just hope I do not find any other \"hidden\" damage in the unit that he is responsible for before I moved in.To get to the point here my summary of the Bissel Stick Vac model 2033.PROS1. Very good value for the money2. For a small stick Vac it has incredible cleaning power, it truly picked up much of the dirt, dust that is ground in  to this carpet. (Obviously this carpet has not been shampooed in quite some time by the previous tenants  which means not in the last 5-7 years give the tenant history of this unit.)3.  Very Light weight unit, easy to use and get into tight or difficult areas where you may not be able to move  heavier furniture by yourself.  (So it is perfect gift for perhaps older or senior or people with health issues who  can not use a heavier vacuum. As well as College Students who are always on the go or committed to their  studies and have little time to spare. since it makes cleaning easier and will give students an incentive to NOT  neglect their living areas and take 10- 15 mins just to tidy up on a daily basis.)4. This is my personal favorite feature. NO infamous rubber drive belt to worry about. Those Serpentinian drive  belts, which are on traditionally  Upright vacuum rollers. Which if you have ever had to change a drive belt out  it can be a messy and  unpleasant chore; as well as expensive. Since many vacuum drive belts can be expensive  as well as difficult to find if the unit is older or the model has been discontinued.5. Easy storage , as the Bissel Stick Vac has a standard power cord which will roll up on the bracket handles and  store away easily in a coat closet which may many large heavy coats that make reaching into the back of the  closet difficult. It takes up very little space when you need to store it while not in use!6. Easy clean up and maintenance! The dirt container easily detaches from the mounting clips so you may access the small HEPA filter and dump all the Dirt ad Debris into the garbage. The unit is also good for picking smaller objects like paper clips or push pins or even small coins in the event you accidently knock over some from your office desk and do not want to throw the items away and they may have spilled all over the place. Since the Debris the vacuum picks up does not pass through the motor itself and NO moving parts like rollers near the vacuums nozzel  so the will not jam and cause the motor to overheat or cause a short circuit because the motor has seized which is a definite fire hazard! The Dirty canister is placed in before the motor assembly and has a solid filter so no small debris like nuts, bolts, small screws or paperclips can enter into the vacuum's motor housing itself.CONS1). The dirt collection container ahs a small capacity so if you use it as the \"main\" vacuum cleaning tool, then you will need clean it out thoroughly depending on how dirty the floor is or what you are vacuuming up.  As a general of thumb this vacuum is best suited for smaller apartments that have no more than 2-3 rooms with a matted or shallow carpet. I would NOT recommend this vacuum for high pyled, shag or very high-end expensive carpets. NOR would I recommend this vacuum as the main tool for houses with more than 3 rooms. Though it does a excellent job for small chores or detail work around difficult tight corners or heavier furniture;. You will want a more traditional vacuum with a 30 AMP motor or better if you live in a large home or have a carpet or floor that is notoriously harder to vacuum.2) The floor nozzle assembly does NOT have any special in-take or moving bristles to collect suborn dirty, dust  or debris, which ironically lends itself to the light weight of the Bissel Stick Vac which allows the user to  maneuver the floor nozzle so the in-take can vacuum the dirt and debris up. You can also detach the unit from  the handle and use it like a hand held dust buster like vacuum and use the nozzle attachment to get to the  floorboard edges and tight corners  So if you are vacuuming in a flat straight line you will need to on an open  carpet or floor you will need to use a technique that will cover the smaller width of the active cleaning area of  the floor nozzle when you do use the unit as it will NOT vacuum wide swaths  of carpet or floor when the  vacuum is in use. Which makes it a bit safer to use around plugged in power cords ad power strip-surge  protectors in a home or small office settings. The power cords will not be entangled in power rollers which  could cause severe damage to the vacuum the office equipment and a strong possibility of electrocution to the  operator.+++++++++++++++++++++ Summary of the Bissel Stick Vac Model 2033 ******************************I would recommend buying this product for small chores or if you live in building with a simple floor plan with no more than 3 bedrooms or does NOT have a plush, or expensive carpets like a real Perishing rug! That would be insane! That would be like using an SOS steel wool pad on a Rembrandt or Vincent Van Gogh painting!  Which would be INSANE!

{"reviewTitle":"Good for mental health","reviewDescription":"I am an 'all or it's not getting done' kind of person - that is my conditioning. One from which I suffer enormously, because the free time I get from not vacuuming the floor, washing the dishes, folding the clothes, taking a shower, eating food, drinking enough water, is spent in a state of incompleteness, dissatisfaction and self-reproach. It kills my joy and creativity.Over the years I have practiced myself into feeling good if my environment is neat, clean, tasks are complete, I smell good, and I'm fed.But not having the motivation to complete a task to perfection, every time I attempt the task, is my everyday reality.For example, I have one of the best vacuum cleaners that I could afford (a differnt one than the one I'm reviewing), which, if I spent a solid 2 hours, can deeply clean most of the floor surfaces in my house.That vacuum cleaner requires manual labor -  it's heavy, it does not self-propel, it's clunky, and I have to store it in the garage becuase it is also big. But, it cleans thoroughly.I dread getting it out of the garage and working it. I dread having to work around the fringe work on my rugs and pom poms on my curtains - because it chews those up and I end up crying for destroying something that I bought with love. This isn't a sustainable or nurturing mental space for me.I tried many different ways to shift my perspective. Saying things to myself like \"That's privilege talking. You are not cleaning the floors and washing clothes by hand. Are you? So get off your butt and do it\" Believe it or not, replacing shame with more shame doesn't work.I have noticed that I get the same dopamine and serotonin hits if my floors are clean, regardless of if they are deeply clean or not.So I invested in thi,s a lightweight vacuum, that ways like a broom. No batteries to charge. Does not do deep cleaning but picks up all the visible crumbs, loose threads, the feather from my down pillow, my hair, and lot of dust. And I look around and see that the floors are clean. I wrap the cord around it when done, and stick it in the hallway closet. No lugging it to the garage.That is all I need to feel motivated enough to do the next thing. Which is, fold that 1 basket of laundry, not both the baskets that are waiting for me. Which then motivates me to at least empty the dishwasher and put those dishes away. Which then motivates me to eat before I pass out, regardless of whether it's a wholesome meal or not.I thought I'd share this in case there are a few of you who are struggling with starting tasks, because you expect it to be hard, because some of these tasks are harder when added on to all the other daily responsibilities.This little vacuum sweeper is a one of my best friends.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"48 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723161600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Glad I bought it","reviewDescription":"I bought this vacuum because I live in a small apartment and thought it would be better for tight spaces than my canister vacuum.  It's a simple tool, for which the technology existed in mid-twentieth century or earlier, if you don't count advances in plastic (by the way, the bright blue plastic is very cheerful).  It's basically a plug-in hand-held vacuum, a good strong one, with a foot and a stick handle attached.  (They used to call these \"electric brooms.\")  It doesn't have a bag; you have to open it up and empty the cavity and brush off the filter just about every time you use it. Because it is really just a glorified hand-held vacuum, you have to bend over to switch it on.  There is a fifteen-foot cord which wraps around two hooks for storage.  Simple!  Unpretentious!However, in spite of its almost primitive simplicity--or maybe because of it?--I like it a lot.  For one thing, it is lightweight and small; it isn't a production to get it out and use it.  It cleans quite well, though it doesn't get all the cat hair off my rug--but good enough for a quick cleanup.  Emptying the vacuumed-up dirt is a dusty job, but it only takes a minute and it is instant gratification: you can see how much you vacuumed up!  The 15-foot cord enables me to vacuum my stairs and even the mat at the bottom. Yes, I have to wind the cord up when I put the vacuum away, but again that takes only a minute.  And by the way, you can use it for the couch or the car if you make use of it as a hand-held vacuum.It's true that here is no comparison between this and the spiffy cordless vacuums now available.  It's a throwback to a simpler time.  But the fancy vacuums cost much more--and are likely to be heavier.  The floor attachment on this one doesn't swivel; I wish it did, but still, I can get into small places fairly well.All in all, I kinda love it.  I'm betting it lasts longer than a rechargeable one would, and I feel quite smug about having spent so little on it.

As others have said the cord is way too short for even an average size room.  I have a 12 foot extension cord permanently attached to it.  The other is that Bissell didn't seem to think it would be nice to have a place to store the nozzle attachment.  I solved that by Velcroing it to the front of the unit.And finally, my unit is starting to show its age in making a strange noise when turned on.  I think the motor is on the way out.

It's easy to use, thankfully, but just not have thr size or power to even begin to acceptably tackle this task.I exclusively use it in my small, carpeted bedroom (no bigger than 12 by 12 with a corner cut out to accommodate the bathroom on that shared wall) and I have to go over it about 10 times (and that's not hyperbole or exaggeration, literally 10 or more) and it still doesn't get the job done 100%. And I vacuum at least once a week.I thought the small size would be find for just my little space, but it just done have the power to fluff my carpet much less remove all the dust, hair and debris from the bird, the cats and the litter box (and I use silica litter, so the dust management is hyper critical if I want to avoid respiratory problems).To illustrate my problem, I will see a small tuft of hair in the carpet and despite running the vacuum (with the floor attachment equiped) over it a dozen or more times (and the tuft being pushed around back and forth) it still can't pick it up. I empty the compartment every time I pass over a small area just incase it's impeding airflow that much (which I presume it is). Using this thing can be a miserable experience.Unfortunately, I'm still suffering through a tight financial situation, so I haven't the money to replace it with something beefier. I guess I'm stuck with it for the time being where it is honestly better to remove all attachments and run over every square in of carpet with the bare nozzle angled just perfectly so it creates maximum suction on the carpet to remove as much mess from my carpet as it'd physically capable of. I'd rather do that than vacuum my room 10+ times with worse results. There always seems to be more hair for it to pick up, no matter how many times I empty it or how many passes I make.

(Green machine was my least favorite but still worth the money and did the job!)This vaccuum though? Definitely a flop for me. I was so disappointed. The lightweightness, amount of attachments, and cordless aspects are the only pros I found. The battery is super short lived, god forbid you use the power higher. Worst part of the battery is it takes forever to charge compared to its puny time it lasts. It makes it nearly impossible to finish vacuuming my sectional or the house all in one go. I wish I could say it'd be great for small messes, but it doesn't even have decent suction power most of the time. It's alright and I can get them cleaned up, but it's almost more effective or convenient to clean up small messes with a broom. For being a pet marketed vaccuum, it definitely doesn't meet those expectations. I made sure I frequently cleaned and emptied the vaccuum as well thinking maybe it'd clog or lose suction even before reaching the max line, but still didn't help. I tried giving a bit longer than usual of a test run too to see if maybe it was me.I knew the review were mixed but I figured I'd risk it and trust the brands name and my experience with other products by them.

{"reviewTitle":"Met my new butler, Mr Bissell !","reviewDescription":"Mr Bissell is versatile, lean but well-built, and highly-efficient. Knocked off one star on suction because he sometimes fails to suck up bigger particles from the deep ridge grooves of my doormat. Otherwise suction is excellent with both the floor head and cranny tool, judging by eye & the amount of stuff in the filter basket after use. Only major knock on the design is that there is no way to attach the cranny tool to the main frame when not in use. A velcro cable tie on the handle shaft works fine, but you'd like to see a built-in option on  such a well-designed tool.As to parts & accessories, the filter is easy to access & clean, the cable plug has a notch to secure it to the more-than-long enough-for-my-tiny-space & well-insulated cable when coiled. The clips attaching the handle shaft and hand-vac section seem durable, secure, but easy to use. Floor head & cranny tool likewise easy to attach but fit snugly. Also love that the floor head swivels fully flat so Mr Bissell  & his sleek profile can mambo  under the bed without issue. A little rubber bumper  around the roller head might have been a nice touch to prevent dings against furniture, though. I put a couple of adhesive felt pads around the vertical edge to bumper crashes if I get clumsy. Worth noting that the floor head has low-slung wheels outside & two tiny recessed wheels under the front edge  but no rotating brush underneath, just a rubber strip,like the edging on a good dustpan, to scoop detritus to Mr Bissell's ...ummm...suckhole  & off  whatever surface it rolls\/slides over. Probably why it works so well on bare floors, but it might not deep clean carpet as well as a  more traditional brush roller tool. I don't have pets so actually glad not to have to deal with hair\/fibers matting a roller brush that wreck  cleaning ability if you don't detangle  the stringy crud regularly. Remains to be seen how durable that strip will be , of course. I only have lino tiles to protect so I can't really speak to scratching wood floors, but no obvious sharp edges on the undercarriage that might damage delicate flooring.I don't have stairs to clean but I do have a wire shelf unit in my kitchenette with a fridge\/microwave on it, ie don't want to move it for light cleaning, & Mr Bissell's chiselled scnozz fits nicely through the wire mesh & sucks up the odd crumb very well. Ditto for the usual nooks\/crannies.The slim lightweight form factor add to ease of use and storage in my small living space.A great addition to the household , all in all. Never needs a day off, discreet & honest,, no gallivanting with the other staff, although I suspect he has an affinity for Mr Swiffer WetJet who is also purple. But what's life without a little downstairs romantic intrigue ? Naranja & Azul my mismatched dustpan and brush (orange & blue in Spanish) are certainly thrilled with Mr B's arrival, spooning most of their time away in the closet,  idle little scamps, not to mention my creaky spine\/knees.Oh dear, the trauma of moving apartments may have affected more than my back....","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"21 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1626566400000}

Recently, one of my cats decided she didn't want to come inside and liked sleeping on my porch,  I set up a place for her by using her plastic carrier (top and bottom nested on top of each other so top was wide open to air with the carrier wire door slipped between the 2 plastic carrier pieces).  She slept on a thick folded beach towel and\/or think large old towel which I washed\/changed out once a week.  Then she decided not to sleep there any longer and I forgot about it for weeks before bringing the whole thing into the garage and put the dirty beach towel in the dirty clothes open basket next to the washer where fleas proceeded to breed over the next 3 weeks as I just did laundry and didn't go back into the garage.I didn't want to spread poisons from DIYpestcontrol in my garage and spreading salt and Diatomaceous dirt did not kill the fleas.  Fleas were literally jumping on my ankles\/lower legs whenever I stood next to the washer.Vacuuming works but I did not want to use my house Dyson in the garage and possible spread those fleas into my house or ruin my vacuum cleaning a garage.My sister told me to buy Bissell stick cleaner 2773a (with a roller) (she uses one to clean her wood stairs)  because it would be cheaper and safer than buying all those bug sprays, bug bombs (from past experience they don't work) and it was not that expensive and I had nothing to lose by trying it.  I choose to buy this 2330 smaller blue Bissell because it it not have a roller and the fleas\/eggs\/larvae would not get stuck in the roller but be sucked directly up into the vacuum.  I put Vaseline on my bare legs from knees down (wearing shorts) (internet tip)  and went into the garage and closed the door between garage\/house to keep pets out and fleas in.  I vacuumed like hell and dumped the vacuum container every 10 minutes into a bucket filled with water that I swept (with a garage broom) and dumped all that salt and dirt into that bucket.  I figured flea eggs, fleas, larvae would be killed instantly in that salt water.  The Vaseline killed any fleas that landed on my ankles\/lower legs (GROSS). I exited the garage though the garage door and used the outdoor hose (I have hot water outside as well as cold - which I had put in years ago) and an old rag to wash the Vaseline and stuck dead fleas off.  I did this several times a day over 3 days and now no fleas jump on me anywhere in the garage.  I leave this blue vacuum plugged in in the garage right by the door and grab it as soon as I walk in and start vacuuming before I do laundry, before I take the wet laundry out and into the dryer and whenever I think about it because I am paranoid the fleas will come back.I leave this blue Bissell in my garage.  I purchased another Bissell 2773A (gray one with a roller\/bit pricier) to keep next to the litter box.  These vacuums are so light, easy to put together and are very effective on on fleas and cat litter.  I am surprised I didn't burn this blue Bissell vacuum (without roller) out since I used it so much in the garage and still do.  Plus even though I used a broom to sweep up the salt crytals I dumped onto the garage floor to kill fleas (didn't work), this vacuum did not clog up or burn out picking up the salt \/ dirt my broom missed.

Eventually, I thought I should get a big girl vacuum.  Since then I\u2019ve owned Sharks and Roombas.  I am back to the Bissel Featherweight!  It\u2019s light and perfect for wood\/ tile floors.  The Roombas, though very convenient, both died just after the warranties expired (wth!), the Shark sucked about the same as this thing (maybe less), sounded like a lawnmower, and cost $200ish.  For the price, I am honestly not sure there\u2019s anything better than this little vacuum.  Maybe one day, when I have several hundred dollars to spend, I\u2019ll try a Dyson or something.

Recently, it started making a chainsaw like noise after a heavy duty job. I ended up replacing with a new brush roller. It worked great again. The reason I got this 3-in-1 is because I wanted to get it for the stairs and my car. Overnight shipping was fantastic. First thing in the morning at 6 am, 3-on-1 was on my porch. I was very exctied to find out how it turned out. After the first try, I felt like it was better than I expected. I used to be struggling with vacuuming the stairs for years. This 3-in-1 made this job so easy. Furthermore, it does a great job for my sectional, sitting area, underneath my piano, and other small areas. By using it on my car is just lovely. It swept every corner. I felt so good with driving and sitting on my fresh and dustless car. Another thing I would like to mention is that I was amazed by the suction based on this type of small model. Please don't take me wrong. You don't expect this works as power as the big power vacuum cleaner. That is why I have two vacuums at home. However, if you live in a smaller space such as a studio or dorm, it should work fine.The downside of this item is that it doesn't pick up hair efficiently. I had to move back and forth until the hair was picked up. So, I brushed off the hair by using a toothbrush before vacuume the rest of the stairs. I wish it comes with a part with a brush. That way, I can a better job on picking up hair and not making scratches on the surfaces other than furniture.I am very happy with my purchase. I may give another review after one year. I hope I would leave another positive review by then. Lastly, I hope this 3-in-1 lasts as long as my Bissell 1240 does.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1712016000000}

I have lived in large homes and had high-end power vacs, but don't have room for a power vac in my trailer so bought this little thing. I am very impressed. I read a few reviews that faulted this little vac on having adequate suction. I have not found that a problem for me. This little vac has an amazing amount of suction. I just vacuumed these rugs and wanted to show you the pictures. They look lovely.I will share that the leopard spotted rug has a tighter nap than the completely black rug, so I did buy a little hand-held rug brush to pick up some of the lint the first few times I vacuumed. However, the brush seems to have lifted the nap in such a way that now the vacuum picks up the lint on its own quite nicely. (I did not use the brush today and as you can see the rug looks very nice.) If you have a tighter nap you might try a hand-held rug brush in combination with this little vacuum.If you have no room for a power vacuum, or want a light, little vacuum for quick jobs, I would highly recommend this one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716336000000}

{"reviewTitle":"A TINY VACUUM BEAST!","reviewDescription":"This little vacuum is a beast!  I have a 2 story 3100 sq ft home with vinyl plank flooring and a few area rugs so I dont need a really strong wall to wall carpet kind of vacuum.  I've been using a microfiber sweeper and robot vac.  Sweeper would pick up a lot but inevitably push some dust around and the robot vac wouldn't always go where I needed to (would get there eventually but I don't always have time to wait for it to get there).  Doing stairs with the sweeper would blow the dust and pet hair around and can't use robot vac on stairs obviously so I was looking for a small, light but decently powerful vacuum.  Found it with this.This little Bissell vac has great suction for its size and is super light.  I  rinse the filter after each use (takes literally 2 minutes) and let it air dry.  Can be used as a had vac also if you take the handle off but honestly the size and weight makes it easy enough not to take the handle off.  It is on the shorter side which isn't an issue for me but a taller person may find that annoying.Gave 4 stars instead of 5 for length of the cord.  I added a lightweight 6 ft extension cord though and it's perfect.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717891200000}

I do wish the battery lasted a bit longer. I find I can't do the whole house in one quick shot. That is not what I bought it for, but you can't blame me for trying! You do need to get into the habit of keeping the battery charged so it is on call 24\/7. With pets, you never know when they are going to make a mess.

I was thrilled to see the hair disappear into the vacuum as I ran it next to the wall.  The suction was great; all I had to do to get close to the hair and it would be sucked into the vacuum.  It also seems to have a good capacity to hold the hair - with three dogs, that is pretty important to me.  The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 stars is that the vacuum head is extremely small.  It is only 9 inches wide and when I want to run it in an entire room, it takes more time than I would like.  But I get good results and as long as I just want the perimeter of the room and maybe a little more, the time needed to vacuum is reasonable.

It also doesn\u2019t have a beater bar (brush) underneath which I hope does not scratch my wood floors.  The button to turn on the vacuum is too low on the vacuum cleaner and the cord is too short. The vacuum itself is ok to pick up light particles on wood floors and vacuum the sofa,  but putting the crevice tool  in the small hand vacuum and trying to get underneath my sofa and bed isn\u2019t  working well because the crevice tool curves up slightly instead of being straight when you insert it.

{"reviewTitle":"Good little crumb picker upper","reviewDescription":"I\u2019m very surprised people are leaving reviews that are so positive. That was why I bought it because I needed something for my travel trailer camper. I have two slide outs and they have carpet. I went over an area very well, slowly, overlapping, and thoroughly. Then I went over the area with my hand and had to laugh because there was so much dog hair this thing left behind it was quite humorous! This thing will suit my needs once I pull out a real vacuum that has a beater bar and more suction and clean the floor thoroughly. It did a fine job on the hard floors though. Another thing that I chuckled over was the size of the lint collector area. It has a filter smaller than a tennis ball and the dirt debris hair etc collect all around it. There\u2019s a rubber flap that keeps sand, etc from falling out, but this has to be emptied every couple of minutes. This is a great little duct buster and for picking up crumbs, but if I had to use this to clean anything more than a few hundred square feet, I would definitely need more patience than I have, and I\u2019m pretty laid back.To conclude, if you want a dust buster that can be used as a vacuum in a pinch on hard floors, this isn\u2019t bad. But if you\u2019re looking for a vacuum, this isn\u2019t it.Edit: I couldn\u2019t deal with it and bought another Bissell for 59.00. Soo much better, has a turbo spinner debris collector that holds 20 times the amount with a decent cleanable filter.

It may not be good for large-sized debris when in the standing vacuum mode -- but honestly what vacuum can really tackle that -- but for pet hair, thin material and normal dust or dirt this is a great vacuum to just whip around the floor once or twice.It's super lightweight and the assembly\/disassembly to use the different modes is super simple.  I honestly can't believe how good the suction is for the weight and size of the actual vacuum element.  If you had to pick a downside it's about as loud as you'd expect a vacuum to be; and at least on tile it is also decently loud rolling across the floor -- but a vacuum honestly sounds like a vacuum so it's a minor nitpick.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718409600000}

It's not a vacuum, it is a joke. Do not fall for the punchline of low price...  AVOID.This vacuum is designed for 1 room use. Like a craft room or a glitter room or whatever weird crafts you are into - that you do on hardwood or concrete.I purchased this to use as a replacement for a cordless Bissel Bolt Pet that had a dead roller. A new roller is almost the same price as this vacuum so I decided I would try a new machine out. Boy, do I have news for you...Cons-Cord length is a real issue. I thought I'd be ok with it - but it is so short. It is less than 3 Tom Cruise's...and that is short.-On\/Off switch isn't on handle so you much lurch over or pick up the vacuum to turn on-On\/Off switch is located exactly at the height of most things you want to vacuum under - like a chair - so you will turn off the vacuum just by using it.-No roller bar, so carpet and fabric use is sub-sub-sub-par.-Suction power ok - but not good. Like imagine a candy wrapper clogging it up. Not enough suction power to clear hair from the intake \"valve\" to the \"filter\" so you end up with a giant clump of hair that requires another dump out.-Limited filtering - definitely not hepa for my fellow allergen avoiding sneezers.-No rolling\/tilt\/swivel head - I guess I've never thought this was a feature I wanted, but it is. And you should too-Doesn't roll across floor as much as scrape across like an old Hotwheels car.-Doesn't stand on it's own for me.-Stick Feels so very cheap. If a robber broke in while you were vacuuming with this - it would not be a good option to deter. You'd be better off with a roll of paper towels or attempting some Indiana Jones moves with the super-short cord.Pros-$20 sale price-light-Hardly any moving parts to break (no battery to die, short cord that will always be in eyesight, no roller bar to get burnt out, no roller motor to die)-Makes your home to feel much larger than it actually is, because you have to unplug and re-plug it over, and over, and over. You must live in a mansion because you've unplugged it 8 times and you aren't halfway done vacuuming! Oh heavens, I might have to have a lay-down before I can finish. How tawdry of me and my vacuum.I guess I've not purchased such an entry level item before and have been let down by quality and functionality for the price.If you have ever been indecisive or even considered buying an expensive vacuum - this is not for you.If you think that you can use this until you are finally ready to pull the plug and buy a $300+ vacuum - this is not for you.If you have even considered any of the creature comforts the past 40 years have marginally added to vacuums - this is not for you.If you don't vacuum every other day - this is not for you.If you read Amazon reviews about vacuums - this probably is not for you.This is designed for children, but too loud for their tiny and sensitive ears.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"133 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1565308800000}

Absolutely NOT sufficient for a home with a long hair dog- my Great Pyrenees' fur overwhelmed the teeny tiny debris cup and I had to empty it 3 times over the course of the 1st floor of my home. Does not work on carpet- I have one very low clearance rug and this vacuum just balls the dog hair up on it and I had to go back over it with my other vacuum.

Small house, and used it a couple of times.  5-10 minutes per use at a time.  Left for a long holiday and upon return used it and it stopped working 2 minutes in.  Was past the return date for Amazon so I reached out to Bissell.  All went down hill from there.  Called, email and chatted.  Never had the sme person assisting me, they had me follow standard troubleshooting , like make sure the battery is plugged in, pull the on trigger to engage the motor.  They shipped me a new battery even though my existing and one form another of the same model with full charge did no twork.  And mine battery worked on another of the same model.  But they said that they could not verify I was using a good battery so I had to wait for it to get here and fail.  They they said they would send em a new device once I returned the defective unit.  Which I did. They then thanked me for it as they had received it and I should get my replacement in 3-4 bushiness days.  Fast forward 3 week and it still has not shown up.  They have been trying to close my support ticket as resolved.  I asked them for a tracking number so I could find the product.  To only hear that it has not shipped yet and will hopefully be back in stock in another 2 weeks.  Thus far horrible experience with this product and support.  I have a few other bissell products and have not had many issues, but unless they find some way to make it right (don't even know how they could do that at this point)  I would never purchase something from them again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724284800000}

I have since responded that they no longer need send me the missing part for the following reasons:I called customer support on August 5 at about 11 AM to determine the status of my July 30 request and to seek assistance with a problem I was having assembling the wall unit.  I was on hold for 36 minutes.  I finally opted for Bissell support to call me and I was promised I would not lose my spot in line.  It is now August 8 and I have not yet received a call back.  It must be a very long line.  Either Bissell customer service is understaffed or they are having an overload of support calls.

{"reviewTitle":"Top-heavy piece of junk","reviewDescription":"I bought this vac because it has FANTASTIC reviews EVERYWHERE. I don't know how anyone would write a great review, because when I tried it, I had it for two days before returning it, for these reasons:- it is extremely top-heavy, so it feels like I am holding a heavy weight while vacuuming. My hand starts to hurt after a short while- the start\/stop trigger is exactly where you grip the vac, so in addition to being heavy, you cannot get a good grip on the handle- it has weak suction- terrible design for the dust canister. Needs three steps to empty it (press the release button, turn the canister to unlock, press a button to empty)- and here's the kicker - it does not stand upright by itself.. You HAVE to install the wall unit, otherwise you'll have to lean it against a wall ... until it (eventually) slides off and drops to the floor- I returned this one and bought the Kenmore DS1030, which is not perfect, but is earth and sky better than this one","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721692800000}

I didn't like it from the moment I turned it on, but I thought I'd get used to it.  Two months in, my opinion hasn't changed.  First of all, it does NOT have a 40-minute run time.  Maybe 20 minutes.  And the thing simply doesn't pick up debris.  I have to go over small crumbs and pieces of grass several times before it will take it, and even then I often find a pile of pieces under the vacuum when I go to a different area of the room I'm doing.  I'm only using it on tile floors, so this makes no sense why it wouldn't work better.  I'm disappointed as I expected better from such a well-known brand. My advice: find another stick vacuum.

{"reviewTitle":"Don't Waste Your Money","reviewDescription":"This \"vacuum\" is basically a less-powerful, corded dust buster on a stick. The main reason I purchased this vacuum was to vacuum an area rug that has luxuriosly high-pile for which I can not use a regular vacuum with a beater bar.  It couldn't handle the rug, but I still thought it would be great for cleaning the floor mats that I keep in the doorways to the room with that rug in it.  The first time I used it, it did amazing on all three mats.  It's ability to clean the mats diminished with each subsequent use.  I emptied the dust chamber and throughly cleaned the filter after each use.  I've used it once or twice each day to clean the mats.  At first I could do all three mats and all the hard surface flooring near them and then clean the filter, but now, only a week later, it has to be emptied between each mat.  The level of dirt and dust on the mats has not increased, but the vacuum's suction has certainly decreased.  I've tried brushing the filter with a soft cleaning brush,  vacuuming the filter with my old cordless Black & Decker Dust Buster (which has much more power and suction than this one), and washing and drying the filter.  Nothing has made it work the way it did that first time I used it.  It's cute, but that's about it.  I'll probably put it out in my travel trailer or let of my grandchildren use it as a play vacuum.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"55 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1682035200000}

My friend has one and I was impressed with its pick up power for a small lightweight vacuum.  Mine however, barely picks up anything.  The last time I used it, I couldn't tell any difference between the vacuumed and un-vacuumed parts of the rug.  It didn't pick up fuzz or nail clippings, or even those bits of notebook paper that flake off the edge when you tear a sheet out of the notebook.  I had a regular sized Shark before, and of course it was excellent at cleaning rugs, but was large and heavy.  It was still going strong at 10+ years.

This thing should be something you buy for your 11 year old to start teaching them about responsibilities around the house. The suction power is VERY low, i have hardwood floors, ceramic tiles, as well as a 8\u2019 x 10x shag rug, and this performed ok on the floors and terribly on The rug. It ALMOST worked on the hardwood floor and ceramic tiles, however, if I missed the TINIEST particle (lets say a small crumb), and would back up the vacuum up over it, instead of it  rolling over the crumb and picking it up, the crumb would get stuck on the back of the vacuum between the wheels, and would just be dragged back, So I would have to physically pick up the vacuum  and run over the particle again, making sure I would only run over it with the front of the vacuum to have it pickEd up. So pretty much, the vacuum is ridiculous low, there is really no Space between the wheels and the floor so whenever you pull the vacuum back, anything behind it will just be dragged back, not picked up.  On the fluffy rug, this was an absolute fail. Due to what i just mentioned about it being to low, the wheels would just get stuck on the rug. I found i got the best use on the rug by not applying any pressure at all, which would allow it to roll on the rug, but because suction power sucks, this meant it wouldn\u2019t pick up much . Also, on the rug, whenever I would drag the vacuum back, the wheels would get stuck almost each time, which would result in the front of the vacuum completely lifting because it is so incredibly light ( i guess the only good thing), and this is where the suction part is.

I purchased this recently to use on my hardwood kitchen and dining room floors, just to get between the cracks and light kitchen messes. The suction is very poor overall, it couldn't pull up the dust\/dirt from between the cracks. If you remove the bottom part, which is awkward at best, there is a little more suction (using it like a hand-held vac), but still not the greatest. Emptying it over the waste basket results in the contents floating through the air onto your clothes and all over the outside of the unit itself. It quickly loses suction when the collection cup gets even less than half full.Did I mention the suction was poor?The length of the cord didn't get me completely across the kitchen. Also, a cloud of dust\/dirt blows out of it when you turn it on.I didn't have high hopes for this due to the low cost, but was honestly hoping it worked better than it does.Please note this is for smooth surfaces only, no carpet, which I knew.Bottom line: keep looking.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1674518400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very short battery, clogs easily, poor suction","reviewDescription":"On a full charge, the battery lasts about 20 minutes. The suction is so poor that the dust canister is still nearly empty after many uses. I have to unclog the hose every few minutes. I only have 1 dog who doesn't really shed and I use this on a few medium size, low pile rugs. It's lightweight, but really weak.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1717200000000}
