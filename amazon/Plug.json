I got it bundled with the Dot and I keep looking at it and wondering what I should plug into it.  Honestly I have no clue what I should plug into it.

I'm not about to become the clapper commercial so I really don't know what all the cost is worthy of the very expensive plug.  I think that is half the problem I paid so much for the plug I'm not thinking that I don't have anything that is plug worthy.  Maybe I'll just put the stupid thing on Craigslist or Ebay.  I don't really see the need for this thing.  The only thing I can think of is a lamp and have the light come on when it gets dark out or when I'm out of town so it looks like someone is home but I don't know.  I have close neighbors who keep tabs on my house so I don't know.  I would plug it in the radio but I have the echo dots that can wake me up with music that I actually want to listen to.  I also have an echo that I can use as an alarm clock even though I have never used an alarm clock.  I know when I need to wake up and  I wake up at the appointed time.

I choose these for their compact size and direct HomeKit compatibility, compared to my old WeMos that were connected via Homebridge. They\u2019re very easy to setup in the Tapo app which discovers the device, added it to the app, updated the firmware and working within minutes. After you add them to the Tapo app, you can select them and add them to your Home app via the QR code. That process was also very straightforward and they were controllable via Siri and my Apple ecosystem as a whole both inside and away from home.Unfortunately they only stay connected for about 16-24 hours after which they disconnect from both HomeKit as well as the Tapo app. Unplugging and plugging them back into the wall got them back up in seconds, but must be done once to twice daily. I\u2019m a network engineer and no amount of reconfiguring my network would keep these online, 16-24 hours is all I would get. So I setup the fourth outlet but this time only added it to Tapo, not HomeKit and that one plug never went offline while the other three were still a problem. So I searched the Homebridge plugins and they indeed have an up to date and maintained Tapo plug-in (homebridge-tp-link-tapo, added as a child bridge). So I reset the other three, added them all back to Tapo, skipping adding them to HomeKit directly, and added them via the plugin, and all four have been solid ever since and work perfectly in HomeKit via Homebridge now. I have a few HomeKit direct devices and none of them have any issues, so I don\u2019t know if this is a flaw in HomeKit or the Tapo implementation but thank goodness for the Homebridge community.My main reason for these plugs are their compact size so I\u2019m ultimately happy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1674950400000}

Once set-up problems had been resolved, it does this very well through the app. I haven't yet set up Alexa integration, so can't comment on that.  Setup appears simple - plug in, and use the app to guide through the stages, following flashing lights on the unit. Despite following to the letter, it kept stalling at the stage when the app was trying to communicate via the wifi network to the smart plug and (I think) trying to establish direct communication with my phone via its own SSID. It kept getting stuck at that stage, taking me down one of two routes,  the app asking if I could see blue and amber alternate flashing and if so, trying to select its SSID on my phone or otherwise doing a reset. Neither were successful. I sent the first back, suspecting a bad radio after talking to support. Same with the second, and having decided that it was unlikely I received two bad units, I spoke to TP Link support directly. They were very good, considering the low price of this item and got things going after a router and phone reset and a long (30 sec) reset of the smart plug.

The app showed everything offline.I emailed tech support and they asked about the house wiring (all new, just built the house 2 years ago) and if the signal was strong (it was). He said to do a factory reset and try again.  Each email took 2-3 day turn around.No solution was ever found. These plugs are now useless to me.  I bought a 4 pack of a competitors plug (round ones, can't recall name now, app is called Smart Life). I put them on the same network and used the same plug and had no issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1582502400000}

Not 3 per plug, 3 for all.  This is such a flaw I can\u2019t believe they released the product like this.  Completely terrible.  For example - I was using 2 plugs, one for exterior Christmas lights and one for my inside Christmas tree. I wanted 2 actions per plug - turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise.  Total of 4 actions.  Due to Kasa limitations I could only have 3 smart actions toggled on at the same time.  Completely inadequate.  In this age of the smart home the actions should be unlimited. Luckily I just ran the 4 routines through Alexa as a work around.If not for this my review would be 4 stars. Cannot give 5 bc the product is so bulky. Also bc Amazon sent me one plug that had already been configured elsewhere (I assume it was a return).  I had to run the reset on the Kasa app 4 times before it worked and allowed me to connect the plug to my network (about 15 minutes of wasted time).  I also don\u2019t care for the blue light that stays constant.  What is its purpose?

{"reviewTitle":"Blows away WEMO...","reviewDescription":"After growing frustrated with how pathetically bad WEMO is, I opted for this less expensive option. And I'm so glad I did. The WEMO devices, of which I have 3, were a headache to get installed (and this coming from a tech guy who is the one everyone calls for help setting things up...yes, WEMO is THAT bad, that even if you know what you're doing, it still involves a bit of luck to get it set up properly). The Kasa mini plug (and the same goes for the RGB bulb by Kasa I also bought) was a BREEZE to set up. Seriously, if all tech were this easy to set up, my family and friends would leave me alone with all the \"can you come help me set this up\" calls I'm routinely bombarded with.Within 5 minutes, I had set up the app and installed and used both the mini plug AND the smart bulb AND had already integrated them with Google Home (can't speak to the Alexa setup since I don't own one). It's THAT easy. Super impressed. If the durability on these devices is good (I'll update if I ever have any failures or other issues) then seriously, Kasa are the smart devices everyone should be flocking to.All-in-all...color me impressed. Will DEFINITELY be adding more Kasa devices in the coming weeks and months.

The plugs are easy to set up in the Kasa software and to import into the Google Home app for use with Google Assistant.  the plugs also have a manual on-off switch on the side of the plug for when you don't want to use voice control.  I've had a couple of these for two years and use them on a daily basis.  The only thing that could be better is that they are wide and if your plugging into a power strip they may cover up other outlets (depending on the orientation of the outlets on the power strip), but that's easy enough to work around.  T-P Link is a decent brand and the price is right on these -- since every brand of device will likely require its own app to set up and manage them, picking one brand and sticking with it is a good idea.  Once you have it set up in Google Assitant or Alexa, you probably will only need to use the Kasa app if you want to re-set the device, just fyi.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1613001600000}

Stays connected to the wifi and connects back quickly if the power goes out, I can tell it to turn off or on at sunrise\/sunset, the timers actually work, it always does it's firmware updates, and works after the updates. Kasa has never given me a problem.It's big, yeah, but one plug doesn't take up the whole outlet (they're smart plug\/wifi extender I got a few years ago does... Which I hate).

{"reviewTitle":"Works great but is mistaken by Alexa as a light source","reviewDescription":"These smart plugs have some useful features thru its app, such as Scenes & Timers. It is compatible with Alexa.I can set an \"aromatherapy\" Scene to turn on all oil diffusers. Using the Timer feature, I can then set the diffusers to auto-shutoff in 2 hours any time it's been used. I can use Scenes or Timers to have lamps turn on at a specific time on certain days, or everyday at sunset, then shut off at sunrise or what not.They do jut out from the wall quite a bit (almost 2 inches), but you are able to use 2 of these onto a regular 2-plug outlet with no space issues. If you use them on a surge protector\/strip or on an outlet with regular cords plugged in next to it, this can get in the way, depending on the surrounding cord's bulk. Most regular 2-prong cords (lamps etc) will fit next to an outlet with this plugged in, some will be a tight squeeze next to each other. (Air fresheners & 3-prong cords will definitely not fit next to this.)These don't work with devices that have an auto-shutoff or timed-shutoff safety feature, but that is more of an issue with those devices and not this smart plug. For instance, my bed warmer & light-therapy lamp won't work with any smart plug. Think of it this way: if your device is powered on & you have a power outage, does your device kick back on automatically when power is restored (like lights do)? If not, then it won't work with ANY smart plug.These smart plugs do NOT offer any other special features such as energy-use monitoring, parental controls, etc. It merely turns an existing outlet into a wifi-enabled smart outlet without having to do any electrical wiring.Alexa will, however, be able to give you energy use estimates thru its own app, but that is an Alexa feature, not the smart plug's.The only issue I had with these is that Alexa mistakenly sees them as a light source even though I have it set up to NOT be listed as a light source. For instance, I use these on an oil diffuser and a desk fan. When I tell Alexa to turn on the lights, it turns on the diffuser and fan as well. I then have to tell Alexa to turn off the diffuser and fan individually from there. But this is more of an issue on Alexa's end, not the smart plug.Overall, I've bought several of these and it works great for what I need, plus they're very affordable!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1625961600000}

I still have to get the app for it but once I connected it to the plug it automatically connected to alexa. I think you have to store your wifi password for that to work, but I find the integration very simple.I am not a whiz at this stuff, I am 60 years old so not great with all this new stuff, but this to me was pretty easy. I also liked that they let you put a picture of whatever you are controlling into the app so you can look at the photo plus the text name. This was nice to identify....in case you have a bunch of outlets that might have similar names it just makes it a little easier.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1576454400000}

I was hoping with Apple's typical polish, it would not be PITA to set those things up and it would keep working. Boy, how wrong I am! It's a maddening experience. But I did get this to work, through triangulating in the dark. Here we go.1\/ there's bunch of QR code label in the packaging, I thought I can maybe just scan any. But that doesn't seem to be the case. You need to scan the bar code on the outlet. I guess it might have seemed to be obvious, though why include those barcode to confuse people!2\/ It seems I need to put the device in reset\/pairing mode to connect with Apple home. That seems to mean I can't connect it both to Tapo and Apple home as both need the device in the \"pairing mode\" (blue\/orange light alternating).3\/ It seems you need to \"properly\" set the device in this pairing mode. It seems you need to keep pressing the power button for 10+ seconds. The button would first start to flash, then it would sound the outlet's turned off\/on with a clicking sound. I kept holding it down after that for maybe 4-5 seconds just to be sure.4\/ Since I do need to scan the QR code on the outlet itself, and once it's plugged in, it's not easily accessible, I first scanned with the outlet in my hand, then plugged it in. You need to wait the device to start up. I think the flash pattern's first blue\/orange alternating, then blue flashing, then after a while, moved back to the blue\/orange alternating.5\/ If the pairing is to work, it would work fairly quickly. So if you are stuck at \"connecting\" (in my case scanned the wrong QR code), or \"setup\" (in my case, I feel it's started the pairing when the outlet's not in the right mode), it would just be stuck there forever until several minutes' later, it just fail.6\/ And then you can give it a name in the Apple Home app, and well, it asked you to pick what type of device it is, even though it knows it's an outlet. So once I chose the \"lighting\" as this outlet is to control a string light. Well, if you pick that, the pair would seem to be successful, but won't work.7\/ Now, after all those hurdles, you get it working! Congratulations!

I can turn it on but it's on\/off state doesn't sync with the app very reliably, so sometimes I can't turn it back off.
