{"reviewTitle":"Poorly Designed Mount","reviewDescription":"I wish I had paid better attention to the reviews of this.  What is most frustrating is that you can go back years on this mount and see the same complaints repeated.  Amazon is still producing and selling a clearly faulty product (the built-in mount is garbage - I experienced this myself and many other reviews confirm it) and despite the many complaints they have apparently made no changes to the product.  Another review also mentions something I found as well, it is impossible to get this thing hung if you don't have the arms in a tilted position.  It is hard to explain, but this little metal piece jets out the less tilt you have, taking up the space you need to hook the mount.  We could not for the life of us get the tv to hook (and keep in mind this is a 70 pound 75\" TV, so the longer it takes to hook it the more frustrating and straining it gets).  So we set it back down, added extra tilt (and thats when I saw the design flaw), and then guess what?  It hooked first try no problems.  But then of course, the fact that it was not level was super obvious.  I should have returned it immediately, but I had no motivation to go back through the mounting process again after all that.  And now I'm out of of the return window, of course.  Listen to the reviews and skip this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1695168000000}

{"reviewTitle":"No Stud = NO DEAL","reviewDescription":"I have wall mounted over a dozen TV's over the past few years with ease. Whether mounting into a stud or drywall only, I have never ran into issues. However, this product was the a greater nuisance than the worst headache I have ever encountered. I was attempting to mount my TV (55\") in a wall that did not have studs, as it is an exterior wall. It would not have been a problem, had the screw holes in the mount been slightly larger. As a result of the painfully small diameter of the mounting holes in the product, I could not use the strongest drywall screws on the market. As you can see, this translated to four various iterations of drywall screws and three trips to Ace Hardware to complete this task, and there are a dozen ripe scars in my wall now to show for it.Long story short, the design is flawed. The strict vertical mounting mechanism places too much stress on the top screw hole. If it is not screwed into a stud, the mount will give at the top screw and you better hope you're close enough to catch the TV before it crashes to the ground. I was able to mount my TV for a solid 4 weeks until I heard a slow hissing sound from my wall. Seconds later, the drywall gave out and I had to save the device from splitting on the tile while it was ripping out of the wall. Very disappointed with the product, do not buy unless you are prepared to perfectly align the poorly designed product with a wall stud. Otherwise, kiss your TV and drywall goodbye.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1720828800000}

This is too small resulting in screws that cannot get all the way into the wall. I had to start over with a larger bit and by the then the screw were stripped because they are inferior metal.

My wife always wanted our TV mounted on the wall so that she could swivel it outward and watch it in the kitchen while she's cooking. This mount allows for just that.I recommend watching a video or two online to get a basic idea of how to install this thing. The instructions are pretty basic - just pictures - and if you have never done this before, just pictures isn't enough (at least not for me). I took off one star for that. Fortunately the VESA mounting system works for all VESA compatible TVs\/Monitors. There are a LOT of options of course, and figuring out which one works for your TV is the only real hard part.The package includes a dizzying array of hardware to accommodate all the various VESA configurations. It also includes drywall expanders in case you can't find a stud - which I think is crazy! I STRONGLY recommend you DO NOT use these and mount this directly to a 2x4 in your wall! Once mounted on a 2x4, you can feel how solid and strong the hold is on this mount. I think drywall expanders would be dicey at best to hold the TV safely.To adjust the horizontal direction or to pull the TV out further from the wall is simple and easy. The motion is smooth and easy to do. Adjusting the TILT is not so easy and requires you to loosen two nuts behind the TV.  That is the ONLY thing that is even remotely annoying about the operation of this mount. Though I really don't know if any other TV mount would allow for an easier tilt adjustment. Fortunately, I'm happy to set a slight downward tilt and don't foresee adjusting that at all.The mount has a good range of motion and can almost allow you to turn the TV at a 45 degree angle - almost - but not quite. I'd say it's more like a 30 degree rotation.

I have purchased more expensive tv mounts in the past, Kanto is very good, but was looking for something  bit more economic and simple. I ordered the Amazon Basic product after watching video. I could tell from the point of delivery it was probably better based on the weight of the package. This tv mount is simple and very sturdy, no wiggle. Easily holds the 33 lbs and probably would hold the advertised max weight with no problem. Also the tv hangs on the mount is a simple manner to allow connection and level adjustments. It is priced in the middle ground of products. If you are looking for a good, solid, straight forward swivel tv mount, this is very impressive. Depending on the your needs a higher end might be needed for more swivel range and other options. This mount will likely work on an LG tv because it has VESA standard extensions. Since LG doesn\u2019t follow VESA, sad, the layout out the extension may be a little unusual but stable (probably two holes in main mount and two out horizontally to the other two).

That would have been a lot more helpful to notice ahead of time. It is far better than the printed instructions that come with the product. Watch that first.--------I can see the frustration that some people have had with the lack of instructions. There are several different pieces in the box because this bracket is meant to be universal for several different types of TVs.  It does take a little bit of figuring out what pieces you need for your particular set up. It would be very nice if the instructions gave a brief description of what all the different pieces are for. You can see in the picture there are several screws, washers, and spacers included (even a little level which was nice!), and they are all labeled with letters.  There are no references to the letters or any of the hardware in the instructions.In addition, if you are not too handy, it is not clear what size pilot holes to drill for the bolts, or even if pilot holes are necessary.  It says to drill the bolts directly into studs and not to go into drywall, but it gives drywall anchors in the package, so it's not clear in the instructions if that really is ok or not (it's not).So if you are handy or good with tools and hardware, it may be easy to figure out.

I have deducted 2 stars for the following reasons:Compared to previous mounts I have purchased, this one by no means is \"Heavy-Duty\".  The metal flexes a little under torque.  It's fine for a modern lightweight TV, but I would not recommend this mount to hang a heavy plasma or older LCD TV.  The heavy duty mounts I have used in the past are much thicker metal and have zero flex to them.  (Minus 1 star for claiming to be heavy duty when its really not.)The built in bubble level on the wall mount is garbage.  I should have read the other reviews here first that clearly point this flaw out.  I made the mistake of installing the wall bracket and trusting in the built in bubble level (how can you screw up a bubble level?).  When I went to hang the TV it was close to 2 inches too high on one side compared to the other.  After taking back down the TV and putting a proper level on top of the wall bracket the problem was obvious.  The built in bubble level was way off.  I would have much preferred this mount to not include a level at all if its going to be inaccurate.  I have included a photo of the built in bubble level compared to a separate level after re-leveling the bracket according to the tool.  (Minus 1 star for misleading, inaccurate, useless bubble level)In summary, its a fine mount at a very affordable price point as long as you are aware of the downsides up front.

There were steps that were just skipped, steps that were in the booklet in the wrong order, steps that were so unclear I just had to take my best guess.  The step specifically for how to mount the arms to the back plate was so small I needed a magnifying glass to see which orientation I should use.  (I'm in my late 20s so it's not an eye sight issue)The screws\/bolts that are used to actually mount it to the wall were so soft that I was stripping the corners of the hex pattern with a hex wrench. I tried to drill them in with a Phillips head and that stripped them even faster.  Getting those bolts in the wall was an awful experience. And this is my third time hanging a TV in my house, so I know it's not always this bad.Aside from the awful mounting hardware and instructions, this product seems fine.  My 55 inch 20ish pund TV survived the night, and I don't for see it going anywhere any time soon.

{"reviewTitle":"Solid mount.  Challenge to fine-tune.","reviewDescription":"Purchased this mount for an older model TV that measures 55\" in width.  Installation was pretty straight forward.  The template supplied made it easy to figure out where to drill the holes.  One drawback is that there isn't much room for side-to-side adjustment.  The mount is designed to be drilled into studs with 16\" centers, although there's a second set of holes set a few inches closer together.  Once the mount is secured to the wall, it's possible to hang the TV off center a little bit (maybe 6\" in either direction of center).The TV can be adjusted front-to-back tilt, as well as horizontal tilt, but it takes some effort.  Front-to-back tilt is controlled by loosening a set of screws with the supplied allen key, moving the TV to the desired tilt, and then tightening them.  I found that I had to really torque these down tight to ensure that my 80lb TV didn't continue to tilt forward.  There's not a lot of room to turn the allen wrench, although fully extending the TV and turning it to one side did move the brackets out of the way to give some room to turn the wrench.For the horizontal tilt, there are 2 bolts with Phillips head screws that need to be tightened.  Again, its a matter of positioning the TV to level, and then tightening the bolts.  I found that I couldn't get enough torque using a screwdriver, but a socket wrench (metric size) did the trick.  I did notice that although the TV was adjusted to be horizontally level when up against the wall, it was a little off level when fully extended and turned.With my 55\" wide TV, I'm able to rotate the TV about 60 or 70 degrees from the wall.  Not the 90 degrees I was expecting, but it's good enough for my application.UPDATE:  After using this mount for a month or so, I've had to re-tighten the screws that set the vertical tilt two times.  I have my TV mounted outside, and I need to pull it away from the wall and rotate it every time I use it.  The act of moving it around seems to loosen the tilt adjustment screws.  I'm going to wedge something into the slots to ensure that it doesn't tilt forward anymore, but I feel like this is a design flaw, and I've reduced my rating by 1-star because of this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1653955200000}

When it is vertical or even semi-vertical it is, once again, practically impossible to plug in cables. To be clear it will tilt it just requires tools and a small hand.We are returning this as soon as our new one arrives. This model while twice the cost allows you to tilt by simple pushing the TV forward. No tools or having to unscrew and re-screw every time.https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00BMGTALQ\/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I'm a big fan of AmazonBasics but they really missed the mark here.

Both sets of the 4 included M4 screws (needed for VESA 100 mm by 100 mm TVs) included with the kit have a head smaller than the holes in the included washer and the back plate . You cannot use those screws as the back plate will not attach to the TV. I used my own Stainless Steel Fender Washer, 1\/8 in X 1 in and the 4 of the included M4 X 12mm screws to attach the back plate to the TV. I had to cut the washers to size and was more work than I planned for. After that was done all other tasks were simple. Just wanted to give fair warning to anyone else buying this kit as this will cause your TV to fall if you attach with or without the washers. The spacers were good but the design recommends using the spacer with the washer and as before the washer would not work with the included screws.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1512259200000}

So I took it all back down and remounted using my own level to finally get it level. Wasted about an hour of time to get it right.

It works just fine and is perfectly safe, sturdy, and functional. However, it is harder to mount than other types. First, the entire mount system has to be held up against the wall while you're mounting. You cannot just mount a plate or something and then attach the mount. You have to hold up the entire thing. Secondly, because of the first issue, it is EXTREMELY hard to mount perfectly level by yourself. This is further complicated by the fact that the part that actually affixes to the wall is relatively thin. If you are trying to hold it up against a level or level line you've marked on the wall, it is very hard to keep stationary.  All that said, after wrestling with this thing for longer than I care to admit, the TV is mounted, it does look nice, and it is perfectly functional as advertised.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1547856000000}

I wish it were about 2\" longer, as the way the studs in our wall are arranged the TV is off center on the wall, but that's no the fault of this mount. The mounting hardware provides a lot of flexibility so if you have a weird TV or it has recessed or uneven holes you can easily install the brackets on the back. The included guide that shows where the center line of the TV will be was extremely useful for figuring out where to put it on the wall.Overall, besides the leveling issue, a good purchase.

Also, the built-in bubble level in the center of the wall bracket is a great idea, but only if it is actually square with the bracket.  Mine was glued on crooked, so it was useless.  You should plan on using a real level when you install this product.All that said, It was easy to install.

{"reviewTitle":"Very basic mount","reviewDescription":"It fits the TV and mounts it to the wall.  So far it appears to be ok.  The included hardware works well.  The wall bracket should have been made out of a thicker metal.  Since you stud mount this, and its only so long you can't center mount the TV on the bracket (IRT to anchor points) to distribute weight on it.  This causes one of the sides to be extended beyond the wall stud anchor point, and with the TV weight on that side it slightly bends the bracket away from the wall.  My TV is well within the weight specs that is claimed.  The release cords for the mount are very long and require a little looping and tucking to hide them behind the mount.  As others have noted the \"level\" on the wall bracket is off, its useless.  If you don't have a level it will get you as close to level as eyeballing it will.  Thing I learned very quickly was how much of a difference my other mounts with extension capability makes so that you can pull the TV from the wall a few inches.  This mount, have two or three people to install the TV, one or two to hold it up and one to hook up the cables before you put it on the wall.  For the price though it is serving its purpose.

It definitely did and was quite easy to install.Worth noting that while the instructions (which are all picture, if I recall correctly) don't show all the permutations of the way you can configure the part that attaches to your TV, but I found a setup that works really well for the Toshiba FireTV I bought recently. This package comes with a paper guide to help you place your initial mount (don't make my mistake, though: make sure you or someone else eyeballs the TV placement *from the distance you'll be sitting to view* so you have it at a good height - mine's a wee bit higher than I would like, but I angled the TV to offset).I also appreciate it that it comes with a level. If you're a perfectionist like me, you will absolutely notice if your TV isn't 100% level and it'll drive you bonkers. But the good news is, even if you initially don't get your TV exactly as you want - it's pretty easy to make a minor adjustment.This was a two person job but the second person really just needed to hold the TV in place a couple times. It's very easy to tilt your TV with the device it comes with, so I have my TV tilted down ever so slightly. It's also easy to move the arm around. It also comes with a small clip to help you arrange your cords so they're not dangling all over the place. Very good value for what you pay and easy to get going.

Amazon makes so many products and things that are user friendly and this was so laughably strange, I thought I was on Candid Camera.

{"reviewTitle":"Good Motion, Good Mount, Bad Install Instructions.","reviewDescription":"I used a different mount on a larger tv, but didn't care for the range of motion. It was pretty easy to install that one. This one was a pain in the rear to install on a 55\" TV.  You'd have to be very strong and a little lucky to mount this one alone. If you don't have help, maybe try a different type of mount.The problem is the way the back brace attached to the TV fits into the mount on the wall. It's a small circular whole, and the mount on the wall has a circular lip to place into the hole which holds the tv so you can put the bolts in.  Maybe if you have a lot of experience blindly putting large things in holes and can hold a larger tv up by yourself for a long time, you can do it... But the mount may move unless it's flush against the wall, but then you can't see where the circle is at all.  I had to get help so my TV laid on the floor for a while.The instructions are also very unclear.  I went through them several times.  Even with reading glasses I had a lot of WTF is that garbled number thingy.  I eventually gave up on the instructions and used logic to piece it together.It's a little awkward that if you want the TV flush to the wall, you don't install the bracket in the center of the tv.  Be prepared to measure a lot.to get the placement right (and hope you find a stud where the mount goes - thankfully, I did)  I wanted to be able to move the tv to the corner when viewing, and push back flush against the wall afterward. It definitely fits that purpose and the motion is smoother and easier than the other mount I installed (with easier installation on the other mount).In the end,the mount is sturdy and I have no fear it's coming off the wall anytime soon. Now that I've done it once, I'd buy the mount again should I ever need one, but if you need clear instructions, this isn't it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1592784000000}

My monitors serve several purposes, I work from home and I also use them for my crafting projects, and just to watch\/stream tv when I'm in my office and not working. I needed my monitors to move, turn, and adjust. I purchased these because of the price point and because the reviews were solid compared to other versions. I've also been dabbling in Amazon basics and really like their products so far.To mount these I first mounted a piece of plywood to the wall, there was no way I was getting both mounts into a stud and still getting the range of motion I needed, plus having them side by side for work. The plywood was directly mounted into the studs, then I mounted the brackets to the plywood. It's been up for several months and I'm pleased with it so far.I have one issue, the holes to mount the monitors, while plentiful, only mounted my monitors slightly high on these mounts, so I can see the bottom of the square the monitors mounted on. There was no way around this, I tried every way to get them mounted lower, but they were the only holes that lined up. As a result, and because I wasn't prepared for it from the get go, my monitors around about four to five inches higher than I had intended them being. I can move the brackets down if it bothers me, but I don't want to deal with it again, I just wish I had known to look out for it prior to mounting, so I could have redone my measurements.

Rock solid stable, with far more range of motion than I expected.  But it does have some drawbacks.  First, I would suggest installation be done either by two people, or one very strong, highly coordinated person.  I say that because lifting and placing the TV onto the mount's TV support rails is real tough.  I ended up having to tape the arms together so they would not move out of position.  The main drawback, though, is the method they use for mounting the TV.  It has these wide rails that extend 18-20 inches side to side.  Its a good idea since it lets you further adjust the side to side placement.  Plus you can adjust the height of the TV by attaching the brackets higher or lower on the TV.  BUT, on my TV they pretty much obscure the place where you do most of your connections.  I ended up having to replace my perfectly good optical cable with one that has a right angle connector just to get an audio connection.  That is the good news...\u2026.I cant even get to some of the other connections for legacy peripherals with old tech outputs.  That forced me to buy a Component to HDMI converter for about $30 to hook up an ancient DVD player.  Yeah, I could have purchased a new blue ray player, but at 2X-4X the cost of the converter.  But who buys discs these days with streaming so easy and inexpensive?  I think that if they had an option to somehow reduce the length of the rails, but I doubt anything I say will have any bearing on how they design, or re-design their product.

{"reviewTitle":"Spend more money","reviewDescription":"The TV hasn't yet fallen off the wall. That's pretty much all I have that's good.There were obvious quality issues upon opening. There was a loose locknut on the pivot of one of the tilt mechanisms. Those mechanisms themselves are pretty junky - impossible to adjust the friction once the tv is on the wall, but that doesn't matter because it's pretty much either \"won't budge\" or \"flops down\".By far the biggest issue is a misalignment of the attachment arms that results in an unlevel TV.  As the attached pictures show, the wall plate is perfectly level, but the TV is askew.  That's totally down to slop in the brackets themselves.  I think I can jury rig a shim to take out the slop, but it's a total failure on one of the most important functions of a TV mount.Spend the money on a better option, you're going to wish you had.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1640390400000}

{"reviewTitle":"I Installed It Myself","reviewDescription":"I'm a 70 year old woman and I purchased this in order to get the large flatscreen TV off the dresser and higher on the wall. It sat on the floor in the bedroom for about 6 months while I waited for my boyfriend to install it.  Finally, when he was on a trip out of state, I decided to install it myself.I unpacked it, checked the box contents, measured and marked the wall as per the instructions, drilled holes and put the whole thing together. I had never done anything like this before, but the job went perfectly. The hardest part was lifting the big screen TV up high enough to hook it on the support bracket and even that was achieved without too much fuss. (And I didn't drop the TV even once.)When he returned from his trip, my boyfriend wanted to know who installed the bracket and hung the TV because he had bought another bracket for the TV upstairs. When I told him I did, he didn't believe me.The following week he went to the flea market for the day and when he returned, I had the second bracket installed upstairs and just needed help to lift the heavier TV onto the bracket.I guess it's never too late for an old lady to learn new tricks!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1715212800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very nice and heavy duty mount offering great tilt ranges but 1 problem...","reviewDescription":"This is a very strong, yet inexpensive TV mount that comes with everything and more you could need to mount most any TV.  However, the bubble level built into the mount was off a bit so don't trust it.  Before I drilled my holes for the lag bolts I double checked the levelness of the bracket with my contractor's level and also a smart phone level app and they both confirmed the built-in level was off a bit.  Now, many people may not notice it but I would.  I mounted a 55\" TV and decided to only use 2 of the 4 included massive lag bolts.  There is just no need to drill 4 holes in a wall and sink 4 lag bolts for a 55\" TV but if you are up in the 70\"-80\" range maybe?  Anyway, having the expanded tilt range allows a TV to be mounted higher and still properly pointing at you.  I put this one in a spare bedroom so with one's head on a pillow in the bed the TV is still aimed directly at guests.  Anyway, a great value for the price and the fact that the mount is one piece and wide means you can tap 2 studs that may not be centered where you want the TV to be and still get the TV perfectly centered for your room along the mount.  Yes, this is a 2-person job no doubt and it takes some time... as they say, measure 2 or 3 or 10 times and then drill once so everything ends up just where you want it.  Adding 1 more hint... If you are going to mount a TV higher like I did and you need to angle it down more you want to attach the 2 brackets to the back of the TV so they are as low as possible so the bottom of the TV doesn't hit the wall when tilted down.  So, when you are putting the 2 brackets on the back of the TV you want the top holes on those 2 brackets screwed into the 2 top holes on the TV.  Then adjust put the other 2 screws into the lower holes on each side.  I did this first so I could then measure and know where to place the permanent mount on the wall that requires drilling and sinking those lag bolts into 2 studs.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693612800000}

Don't plan on getting your arms in behind it once mounted, because its so close to the wall, you're going to either have to hook up cables beforehand, or have a partner hold the TV while you mess with it. Its definitely a 2 person job to hang the TV, and the only way to adjust the tilt is when the TV is pulled off the rail that mounts to the wall. Also, don't over tighten the bolts because it is fairly flimsy and bends to whatever shape your drywall is, making it nearly impossible to hook the TV onto the rail, and forget about trying to level it. Also the little level that's built into the wall mount is way off, so measure or use a legitimate level when installing it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1558051200000}
