{"reviewTitle":"Good Quality, Good Comfort, Good Looks, Good Price. Guitarist approved. \u266a\u266b","reviewDescription":"I bought this chair for my music room and I wanted one that would be comfy and allow me to leave the arms off so I can play guitar sitting down. Installation took me about 20 minutes because I did not have to bother with installing the arms. The only part that was tricky was installing the headrest in the back-cushion.  I was vigorously stretching and pinching the fabric to avoid tearing when zipping it up. I have strong hands, and I cannot imagine someone without decent hand-strength managing this. Mine was a humdinger to get in there without breaking it.Anyhow, I can now play guitar comfortably. It does lack lumbar support, but I can stick a lumbar pillow back there if I wanted to. As a gaming\/office chair, it's OK, but gaming usually means long hours and better lumbar support would be critical for it.  But still, great chair for the coin. I am pleasantly surprised.

{"reviewTitle":"Respawn model 110 black\/red gaming chair","reviewDescription":"I was looking for replacement office chairs, preferably high back. Prices were all over the map, and so were the reviews. I spotted these--not office chairs, but definitely usable--on sale, so I jumped and got two. As it turns out, the wife doesn't like her new chair and opted to keep using her squeaky old one.Amazon said it was going to be 4-5 days and the chairs would arrive separately. A couple updates later and the chairs were arriving early. And, they did, one shipment at my gate 2 days early so the shipping thing was grand.After lugging the cartons onto my porch and contemplating lint for a few minutes, I decided it was time, so I opened the first carton (which was damaged) and went for it. Took my time, didn't get carried away organizing stuff, and half an hour later the first chair was built with the second one unboxed. Assembling the second chair went like clockwork. About 45 minutes from starting I had both chairs ready to game.The cartons, though damaged, had protected the contents just fine. There were no visible defects in any of the parts. All the screws in the hardware packs had thread locking compound on them, the parts were organized along with two hex wrenches, and one set of spare hardware (one of each type) was included.The pedestals assembled quickly and solidly: attach spokes to hubs, insert casters, drop lifts into hubs, drop covers over lifts. Next seat brackets were bolted to seats, seat backs were lowered into place & bolted, arm rests were bolted on, pillow secures with elastic, and done.I left hardware a little loose until I was sure the parts were aligned, then I tightened the screws fully. Do this to all the screws including the armrests. The assemblies will be 'tight' at first but they will break in! Better a little stiff when new than screws falling out a couple months later!I am about 5'10\" and 170 lbs and so far the chairs are just peachy. The backrest is slightly taller than me when I'm seated; lumbar support is in roughly the right spot. I don't use the auxiliary pillow unless fully reclined. The reclining mechanism on one chair slips a tiny bit but then locks solidly. The pedestals have a little flex in them but not enough for concern. The armrests feel reasonably solid but I don't put my full weight on them. Same goes for the footrest, which feels a little springy, and reaches to my ankles when fully extended. The padding is adequate for me on all parts and I have slept in the chair.My only critique so far is the armrest pads should be a couple inches longer at the backrest end, and the seat should be at least one inch longer. Overall, it's a nice chair for the price, fingers crossed that it will be reasonably durable.Side note: apparently my legs shrank while writing this. The footrest reaches to about 76 mm or 3\" above my ankles, oops.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665619200000}
{"reviewTitle":"This chair is nice","reviewDescription":"Had a friend over not too long ago. We, uh, did things in my previous chair and it broke. I always wanted to try one of these gaming chairs just to see what they were like. Some seem to like them, some seem to hate them. I decided to go with this chair since it has thousands of reviews and is still above 4 stars. Also, the price helped. Time for the review.It was delivered by UPS in two days. The box arrived with no noticeable imperfections. Everything was included within. I have nothing to say about the quality of the materials. They all looked new. I inspected them carefully since previous reviews revealed people receiving damaged or used items. That wasn't the case for me so I was relieved. Next, the assembly went smoothly for the most part. The only thing that gave me an issue was attaching the back to the seat. A second person might be needed to hold the back in place for the holes to align. I eventually got them in myself. Lastly, everything worked as it should. The gas lift works properly and the reclining functionality works properly with the lock.On comfort, since this is my first chair of this type, I'm not sure how to rate it. The bottom is very comfortable with ample padding and I hope it stays that way for a long time. The pillow for my neck is a new thing for me. It feels like it pushes my neck forward, but I haven't noticed any pain or discomfort. Maybe I need to get used to it since I'm not accustomed to sitting up straight. I don't think it's needed since unlike other chairs of this type, the back is very well-padded. There's more than enough cushion without the head\/neck pillow. The lower lumbar pillow, I like. It supports me well, although it does sink into the little space between the seat and the back. This means it has to be pulled up before sitting down again. The armrests are also comfy.  I'm a tall person which means I have long legs. The footrest is too short for me to use unless the chair is fully reclined. I don't see myself using it much anyway.ProsThe chair arrived on time with all parts and no damage.Assembly was very easy.It is very comfortable.With the recline function and the footrest, it is possible to sleep in this chair. It is that comfortable.ConsThe footrest is short and flimsy. The slightest weight makes it tilt.Even with the chair at the lowest, it's still noticeably higher than my previous chair. Some people might find it too high by default. For me, it's still fine.The armrests aren't adjustable. They only move back when the chair reclines.Overall, without the head pillow, I find the chair to be much more comfortable than my previous chair. For now, my review is a 5\/5 and I think it is worth it at this price. I will update my review if the chair deteriorates in any way within a year. Also, as an aside, there's a manufacture date under the seat. Mine was made in October 2019.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1579910400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Updated Review - 2 1\/2 years later","reviewDescription":"8-13-22I abuse this chair, and it just won\u2019t die! I still love it!I have gained a bit of weight since I got this chair, but I have never stopped flopping into it full dead weight, and it always takes it with ease!I sit in it sideways with my head on one arm and my legs propped up on or draped over the other.I push against the back way harder than I should while seated to stretch out my back, it has never even hinted at slipping\/breaking.My grandkids push each other around on our hardwood floors, spinning it roughly and intentionally into other furniture.The arms now wiggle a bit, and a screw fell off it which I could not ever figure out where it fell from; other than that this chair is flawless!The hydraulics still work flawlessly.The reclining mechanism still works flawlessly.The upholstery basically still looks like it did when it was new; and the cushioning is still cushiony.I rarely use the leg rest so it still functions as new.Highly recommend this chair!2-22-20I am still head over heals in love with this chair and stand by my original 5 star rating.My original concerns are  addressed here:STITCHING - The stitching has held up beautifully!  I am super rough on this chair, I sit cross legged on it while wearing Doc Marten boots with metal clasps and drag my feet across the seat constantly.  The stitching has not been affected at all by this (nor has the PU leather for that matter).ARM STABILITY - A week in the right arm became wobbly, I discovered the screws were loose, tightened them and the arm has not wobbled since.  NOTE:  I am super rough on the right arm in particular.  I often sit slightly sideways in the chair leaning my full 140 pounds against that arm, and in order to adjust the recline I have lean over the arm at the waist to reach the lever, again pushing against the arm with my full 140 pound weight.LEG REST- The leg rest is used frequently and I quite often forget to be gentle with it.  Despite this the leg rest is no more wobbly than the day I put the chair together.This chair is proving to be a fantastic buy for the money, much better than I had even hoped!  I would most definitely repeat this purchase!Original review follows:1-15-2020  The chair arrived right on schedule.  I have been in possession of it for 3.5 hours, and am sitting in it now writing this review.Facts to consider when reading this review:> I am a 5'2\" woman of average build - 10 pounds overweight is average right - in my 40's>  I have very short arms> I have absolutely no upper body strength to speak of.>  I am NOT A GAMER - I bought this chair for use at my writing desk and watching television> Any numeric ratings in this review are on a scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being the worst and 10 being the bestPACKAGING  > RATING: 10 <>  It was like Tetris inside that box, with each individually wrapped stuffed component, and two boxes of hardware  being separated  by simple sheets of cardboard.  There was absolutely no Styrofoam - it was beautiful!>  Despite appearing like a tightly packed Tetris board I had absolutely no trouble getting everything out of the box,  even with my complete lack of upper body strength.EASE OF ASSEMBLY  > Rating:  11 <> From sealed box to fully assembled in about an hour  > This includes unboxing, taking inventory, sorting and arranging the components in the order and groups they  would be needed  > OCD what can I say <  >  I completed the entire assembly by myself, completed unattended with one exception:  >  I had boyfriend hold the back in place while I got the screws that hold it to the seat started - I only got them  started enough to stay put, then sent the boyfriend away, but I could have done it alone if necessary  >  I could actually follow the instructions ... I am, unfortunately, stereotypically female when it comes to  following instructions that contain only pictures with no text at all - these instructions were over the top easy  to followINITIAL INSPECTION AFTER ASSEMBLY  > RATING: 9.9 <>  Every component, from the upholstered pieces to the washers in the tool kit, was in pristine condition>  All joints and connection points were flawlessly aligned, smooth and sturdy>  It is very visually appealing and identical to the images the seller supplied on it's page  >  NOTE:  I did not use the wheels it came with as we have hardwood floors, so I had also ordered inline skate wheels  at the same time and used them instead - it should be further noted that the wheels appeared to be pristine and  are being saved for use on another piece of furniture in the future>  Loss of .01 in rating due to the thread used in the stitching looking thinner than I would expect for a chair of this  price and quality design\/manufacturing  > It should be noted that I had read about feature on several \"Top Ten Gaming Chairs of 2019\" websites so I was not  surprised to note thisFUNCTIONALITY  > RATING: 9.25 <>  I cannot rate the wheels, as I mentioned earlier I have not yet used them.  They were therefore completed excluded  from the rating.> The seat is very comfortable, the padding is very firm, but gives just the right amount for me to feel like it stay comfy for a good long time - when comparing this note to other reviews remember I am 5'2\" and about 130 pounds fully clothed  >  Due, I assume, to my size, I am unable to lower the chair! LOL  Apparently I do not weigh enough to activated the  hydraulics!  LOL  Being a little overweight, I was quite pleased with this discovery, but, to be fair no extra points were added to the rating for this.>  The seat back contour was very well designed.  Again, due to my stature - and I keep mentioning this because so  many of the reviews seem to be written by big and tall men - it doesn't \"hug\" me like it is designed to do,  HOWEVER, it is still quite comfortable.  The contour was apparently designed around the center of the seat in a  slope so that I can still feel the hint of the hug.>  My feet do not touch the floor in the lowest position!  LOL  I knew from the dimensions that the seller provided on  the page that this would be the case.  No points were deducted for this.>  The arms that are mentioned in almost every review as being wobbly, are, at least at 3 hours into use not wobbling  at all, but definitely feel like they could more secure.  > This has been mentioned to varying degree in almost ever review I read and I visited and read reviews at four top  ten websites, Amazon, Walmart, Sams, Costco, and about a half dozen other random websites.  >  Loss of .25 in rating for mediocre arm stability>  The lumbar support just got in my way.  The seat back has enough of \"bump\" in just the right place for me.  I am  saving it for possible later in the chair's life.  No rating points deducted, this is just personal preference.>  The head rest is nowhere near in the right place for me and I am not using it, although I am saving it for possible use  on something else down the line.  Again, personal preference, no points deducted.> The leg rest is an AWESOME FEATURE!  It was most definitely a selling point for me.  >  The farthest edge of the leg rest falls at the very top of my ankle and is very comfortable. > I am 5'2\" <  >  Engaging and retracting the leg rest is apparently a learned skill and at 3 hours in I am still a little stop and go.  >  No points deducted as I can tell it operator learning curve and not a mechanical problem.>  In the retracted position the leg rest mechanism feels extremely secure.>  In the engaged position it is obvious that the arms holding it to the underside of the seat are not as secure as they  should be; enough so that I worry about accidentally putting too much weight on the leg rest and snapping the  arms off their mount.  >  The arms are attached to the seat bottom much too close to the edge of the seat; if the back end of the arms  were longer and mounted further back on the seat bottom they would be much sturdier.  > Loss of 0.5 points deducted from the rating for insecure mounting of leg rest.>  EASE OF CONTROL  >RATING: 10<  >  Reclining and return action is very smooth with only minimal learning curve.  I was a pro in less than a minute.  >  The Recline Lock and Height Lock controllers are just barely within my comfort zone of reach, I have to lean over  the side quite a bit to reach them.  Furniture is not designed for short people, no points deducted.  >  I cannot speak to the wheels as I am not using them, and they were not included in the rating.OVERALL RATING:  9.85Please forgive any typos, I am sure I missed some.

{"reviewTitle":"A review after 2 years of daily use","reviewDescription":"Like many of you I scour the reviews and do comparison shopping here when I'm buying something and eventually land on the item I think will meet my needs after checking all the reviews for pros and cons.  This chair is the item I landed on doing that 2 years ago.I'm glad I did, because it was the right call.  I'm 225 lbs at 5 foot 7 for reference.Chair is solid, sturdy and if you build it well will hold together.  I've had to tighten one screw in 2 years on the armrest.I've added additional support on the arm rests via those cushioned armrest supports you can strap on as I like more padding for tender areas like joints.  That's all it needed other than the standard gel cushion I put on any chair for extra support.  What I'm saying is that you might need to modify yours with add ons if you want more padding and if so it's easy enough to do.  Plenty of brands for arm rest cushions out there.  The chair comes with padding but I prefer more is all.Outside of that if I have to pick a complaint it's that I wish the leg rest extension came out further as your feet are left dangling off even at 5' 7\", but you can always just use a pouf or ottoman or something for a heel rest.Spent countless hours on this chair working and gaming and buying this wasn't about comfort out of the box it was more about \"Will this chair break on me or wear down after heavy prolonged daily use.\"  The comfort part is subjective to a person's tolerance and body size etc... But the durability is all there on this unit, for that I have no complaints and again it was the right call to buy this one.As far as assembly I don't recall any issues, on par with any other office or gaming chair you'd put together.  The chair does all I need and I'm sure I'll still be using it years from now, which was the big hope.  Something that would last and serve me for it's purpose without regretting buying it later on.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1717891200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Fantastic chair. I was pleasantly surprised.","reviewDescription":"First of all I only looked at this one because I wanted to get one of those DXracer ones all the cool kids on Twitch have, to see what all the hype was about and I could not find one for sale anywhere. Secondly all the other \"gamer\" chairs and other \"gamer\" stuff in general look like trash, way too busy with \"gamer\" colors and bizarre designs in general. For this model I went for the black and gray one, naturally.Wow. after sitting on a $35 walmart thing for years (and the $200 \"executive\" chair my boss bought for the office that is nowhere near as nice or comfortable as this), what they say is true: the things youre gonna spend the most time using, shoes, beds, and chairs, dont cheap out (and keyboards too. I'm never buying non-mechanical ever again). And I sit and type alot so thats important. I'm most shocked at how stable this thing is, even when fully reclined. I recently cracked some ribs and so when i started putting it all the way back I got really scared, because I've never had a chair that did that before and being that this is the \"budget\" option I had no idea if this thing was gonna tip over and pop my still healing ribs. It is incredibly stable, and I'm a reasonably big guy (for you) (sorry its a Dark Night Rises joke that I cant ever help but make) at 6'2\" and 210lbs. Even trying like an idiot to tip it over back and forth and side to side. I'd feel comfortable reclining it back and having a nap. The material seems and feels nice enough, its got metal internal construction, there are actual bearings, like real ball bearings in the armrests at the mount points.Time of course will tell how the material and of course the padding is going to hold up. But the underlying metal frame construction was impressive. One little complaint I have is that the armrest wiggles just a hair bit. But hey, theres ball bearings holding it on and its gotta have a little play in it to move when you recline. I do worry about the material of the elastic straps that holds the pillows on, because it seems to me that in, probably a years or so time, is going to fray. Especially the optional (both are optional of course, and after getting them adjusted for you *just right*, I'd never take them off) lumbar one what constantly gets gets forced around by your body, this would have to be my guess of the first point of failure, but not really that big of a deal. Everybody's got a sewing kit and can pop down to walmart or order it here to pick up some more elastic fabric for like $3 and spend 20 minutes just popping a new one on. I will say that the included Allen wrenches for assembly are garbage. I tried to use them for something else and after putting like 10 or so foot pounds on it the head just rounded right off. But they were otherwise just going to get used once then thrown away or tossed in your \"garbage tool\" bag for doing stuff you dont want to use your good tools for, so whatever.Easy to assemble, solid construction, insanely stable, very comfortable and of course excellent value.

{"reviewTitle":"Get what you pay for","reviewDescription":"For the price, four stars.  As an absolute, I'd give it three.  This review might seem negative since it will focus more on what I don't like\/didn't think about before ordering, but I do recommend this chair if you still want it after reading this.  My main reference point is an Octane gaming chair I bought 20 years ago for about $80; this is intended to replace it.It looks nice, and the assembly instructions were excellent.  Other companies could learn from Respawn.  Absolutely no problems with assembly.BUT...The cushion really is as thin as it looks.  I'm over 200 lb, and use this as an office chair so I am in it a lot, but a little more padding would be nice.The armrests are not padded nor adjustable.  I bought some clip-on cushions.  Note I needed to get longer ones - 11.5 inches.  The armrest height is OK for me, but I'm coming from a chair that has armrests tops that slide for and aft, and rotate.  I did not realize how much I would miss that.The casters are OK, but I do miss the smooth urethane scooter-style wheel from my old chair.The base is plastic, not metal.  The chair is light, but I don't see it lasting 20 years.The material is soft fake leather.  It is smooth and easy to clean, but coming from a fabric chair, this one gets hot during extended sessions.One concern i have is how much it squeaks already after just a few weeks of use.  I have tightened the assembly bolts, but it still squeaks as much as the old chair it is replacing.Overall I don't like it as much as the chair it is replacing, but I am not in a position to spend hundreds of dollars on a chair to fix the issues I have.

{"reviewTitle":"It's all what you're used to","reviewDescription":"This is my third desk chair. I still have them all. I bought the first one in 1992, the second in 2002, and this one in 2022. The first was a entry level desk chair. I don't remember what it cost, but it was expensive for me at the time, so let's say $150.  The second is an Aeron chair. It was a gift, but listed for about $800. Then there is this one.I wanted a new office chair because the Aeron chair, which I\u2019ve been sitting in nearly every day for 20 years, is dandy for work, but uncomfortable for watching video. Amazon reviews are nearly useless because people overrate (\u201cI replaced all the screws, added arm rest pads, and a seat pillow \u2013 five stars!\u201d) or have no point of comparison (\u201cThis is so much better than my $30 army surplus chair!\u201d). I wanted a yellow striped one to go with the John Deere Green desk, but camo was the best I could do \u2013 really, I bought it for the color. My only requirements were that it recline and that it have padded arm rests.The new seat is harder than the 1992 chair, which has been in use for forty years, now; albeit not daily use. The seat is definitely deep enough to support a memory foam pillow, so I bought one. It's a bit small for the chair, but it's a vast improvement.It does recline, but it doesn\u2019t rock back and forth, which the Aeron chair does (technically, \u201ccan be adjusted to do\u201d; it\u2019s optional). The footrest is fine, despite the reviews. There\u2019s just a trick: As you recline the back, one\u2019s butt tends to slide forward from the seat\/back hinge, so one\u2019s feet start to dangle off the footrest; just push yourself up to keep your butt in the correct spot and the footrest is fine.The head pillow is actually quite nice, if the back is mostly vertical. As one reclines, the angle toward a vertical monitor becomes too steep (\u201cshallow\u201d? whatever) for it and one must crane one\u2019s neck for good viewing. An airplane pillow solves that problem (as it does for a traditional recliner and watching TV).One nice feature: The arm rests are tied into the reclining mechanism so they stay at the right height as the chair reclines. This is \"your mileage may vary\" because the arms are not adjustable. They are quite nice for me - at 6'2\" with a long torso.4-star justification: For a shot in the dark purchase of a medium-grade chair, I'm quite happy with it. If I need\/want another desk chair, I'll roll the dice and try something else.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"21 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663545600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not bad for the price","reviewDescription":"I ordered this gaming chair to replace a pretty comfortable office chair that I had to leave behind after moving.  My thinking was to find something that I could work in and also could recline in for \"working from home\".  I bought the Respawn because I see them everywhere and I didn't want to spend a fortune if I wasn't sure I would like working in a gaming chair.I like the deep recline feature and even though the foot rest is probably not going to last long, I have used it a few times and am glad it is there.  I wish the footrest was higher though.  It would make reclining more comfortable.  Overall build quality isn't bad.  No rips or tears and the material looks nice. But that isn't why I am giving only 4 stars.The chair seat cushion isn't thick\/comfortable enough.  After a few days of regular use, I am now ordering a seat cushion on Amazon to add to it so that my rear end doesnt hurt.  I weight 215 lbs and have completely flattened out the cushion in the back in about 3 days.  Assembling the chair was simple but the left armrest bolt hole had a problem and the bolt wouldn't go in all the way leaving a very wobbly left arm rest.  I was able to makeshift-tap the threads inside out by slowly and forcibly cranking on the bolt with a cheater bar until it just wouldn't go any further.  Though it still wasn't deep enough to take the entire bolt, I hacksawed off about a half inch of the bolt and now the arm rest is secure.This might seem like a 3 star review but to be fair, for $175 dollars, I believe I will get plenty of use out of it and if $40 worth of extra cushion and 5 minutes with hacksaw make it comfortable, then I'm still well under what some of the competitors are at.  I also really like how the armrest reclines with the motion of the back on this style and many of the others don't.If I had to pick right now to sit and work in this chair or the office chair I left behind, I would choose the office chair.  It didn't recline but I kind of miss the rocking motion now :(","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1631664000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Truly uncomfortable... wish I admitted it sooner to myself","reviewDescription":"I hate to leave a negative review but this chair is genuinely so uncomfortable. I seriously wish I didn't pretend it was comfortable and returned it instead. I have been suffering with it for 6 months now.Mind that it might not be universally uncomfortable. My apologies for the awful review if others disagree, but I hate sitting on this chair.The \"seat\" part (where butt and thighs sit) is far too long for the length of my thighs. And I'm probably the most average sized female out there. The length of the seat would mean either: 1. I sit correctly with my butt and back right up against the backrest, but my knees are unable to fold, or 2. I sit incorrectly with my butt and back spaced far away from the backrest so that my knees are able to bend. Option 1 leads to me having to sit with my legs folded up, which, regardless of my exact position, results in incorrect posture and back pain. Option 2 leads to me sitting in a very, very bad posture which cannot be good for my lower spine at all.Now, this may very well be a unique \"me\" problem. Just be aware that the seat part is very large, much more so than an average name-brand gaming chair.The cushiony, plush, soft, cloud-like expectation based on the images provided is all but a sad lie. The chair is stiff--it's like a weird stiff though. It isn't lacking padding, more so that there is TOO much padding stuffed inside a rough leather fabric. The material it is covered in is stiff and hard, though not rough but smooth. It's not an ideal feeling to be in contact with it; bare thighs stick on it like sitting on a plastic chair on a spring day. In other words, it is not breathable whatsoever-- seems like an irrelevant aspect on a typical gaming chair, but in this case, this causes the \"padding\" to feel stiff like car tire. So then this massive padding is also on each arm rest, meaning that my chair does not comfortably tuck under my desk. It does not go any lower, and I have a standard Ikea desk. The pillows are stiff as rocks. I don't know how I'm expected to sit on this thing, like am I doing something wrong? The pillow and back pillow forcibly protrude my head and lower back forwards--it's like the chair wants me to curve just the middle of my back backwards. And if I'm just supposed to sit straight up 90 degrees with no support for comfort, then I might as well sit on a well cushioned backless stool? While playing an intense match?Basically, nothing about this chair is cozy or comfy at all. I literally think that I have unconscious avoidance of this chair because it's so uncozy and the thought of running a good old gaming night sounds less appealing because this chair is in the image. Pros, I've started gaming less. Cons, I've started studying less.\"Shouldn't you have noticed the lack of comfort earlier? Why didn't you return it?\" you may ask. I've been using it for the last 6 months, after all. Yes, I did notice the lack of comfort the first time I sat down in it. The big smile of excitement on my face humbled down instantly the moment I took seat. But I thought that maybe all gaming chairs were uncomfortable and it was a \"beauty is pain\" type scenario. Well, quickly the face of disappointment and discomfort became a common occasion as I consciously had to readjust my sitting every 5 minutes and even brainstorm sitting positions; with a normal office chair, all I did was sit and sitting wasn't even in my thoughts. But I was so excited to buy a cool gaming chair, finally, I was able to save up for a big buy. I decided to be ignorant to my discomfort and subconsciously started placing pillows in different areas, sitting on a blanket, and adjusting my monitor to minimize the pain. It's not bad with these adaptations. But I still wish I returned it.What made me finally admit the discomfort? My boyfriend's gaming chair. His chair looks so pleasant and sleek, while my chair looks so fat and chunky. His chair feels so good and soft on my skin, my chair feels so sweat-sticky and awful. His chair feels flexible, and reclines to allow you into the position you want to rest in. My chair doesn't, it doesn't feel \"springy\" but feels like a hard, bone crashing stop when I put any velocity towards the backrest. Like I actually crave to sit in his chair, and I truly wish I could feel that way towards my chair. His is a big name brand gaming chair I wont specify, but the most basic racing gaming chair out there. At almost half the price of this chair, it is infinitely more comfortable. I can't afford another chair, but even if I could, I'd feel so guilty replacing it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1660608000000}
{"reviewTitle":"*Update*Chris McGuinn is spot on. My chair faired a little better at least.","reviewDescription":"**2 year update** - If you read Chris McGuinn's review that's pretty much it.So as far as the plether or whatever it is, on mine the covering has faired much better than Chris' chair. There is no cracking and the seams are still good. However... Arms flapping\/maybe better to just take them off at this point. I have tightened them and at this point just over it.The main issues? The bottom seat cushion and the arm rest fluff is either distored to heck now (arm rest) or becoming hard and flat (seat cushion). At first I could sit in this chair all day. Now I can only stand it for about 2 hrs at a time at best and then have to take breaks because the cushion is worn the F*** out. I mean it is flat.. Like sitting on a griddle. I have thought about getting fiber fill and putting into it since well.. It's still a NICE looking chair. And I can't send it back. Do I wish I would have got the Amazon special for cheaper? Yah.. At this point but can't look back now and well.. It's mine now. So I'm going to mod the f*** out of this chair with fiber fill and hope that takes care of it. If not oh well.. The Amazon special i'm talking about is only about $119 and is the chair I was looking to buy before I decided to 'upgrade' my purchase and buy this one.. Search for this, evidently you won't regret it and maybe I would'nt have either - OFM ESS Collection GAMING CHAIR RED, Racing Style.Original review-I have owned and used this chair 5 days a week\/8hrs a day for the past month.3 stars for arm and leg rest build quality (padding is great and seams are well made\/only the structures that support the arms of the chair and leg rest I am unhappy with).I am around 5'8 220lbs (bigger belly\/skinny arms\/legs)Pros:This chair looks sharp and though feels a little awkward at first if your not used to having an ergonomic chair, after a few days your back will thank you for it and otherwise is very comfortable. Some of the seams are double stitched which should make it hold up for a good long time. It was easy to assemble, rolls very easily on short\/medium length carpet, it's light if you need to physically pick it up, and it doesn't feel cheap as far as holding you in. The controls for height and recline work well and those parts feel sturdy. The seat is good and supports me through 8hr work days. Other chairs in this price bracket and lower seem to have reviews of the seat cushion wearing thin very fast and not supporting people's weight, resulting in basically feeling like sitting on bumpy metal. This chair's seat has not done that to me and feels like the pad or fiber fill in it will last a fairly long time. The seat back lines up well with my head. The included head pillow is way too thick for me so I'm going to take out the pad it came with and put a proper amount of fiber fill in it to support my head\/neck about half the thickness it is now. I could see this chair working with heights up to maybe 6' but no taller, your head would end up right at or over the top of the backrest.Cons:The leg support is a joke. Now that seems to be the case with most of these 'racing style' chairs, but the only thing you might be able to do with it if your over 4'8\" tall is lay your foot on it if your sitting half indian style. Also it flexes very easily so I wouldn't dare put any real pressure on it.The arms have play even right when you take the chair out of the box and put it together. And yes I did install everything correctly and tightly. I have had this chair for a full month and have been extremely careful with the arms after reading similar reviews but they still ended up with a lot of play in them. Also for my chair, whoever installed the mount points to screw the arms in with on the seat didn't align them properly resulting in one arm being about an inch higher than the other. Not a deal breaker for me but an annoyance for sure.Conclusion:It's a nice chair but a cheaper one would probably work just as well with a seat modification (adding fiber fill to it or your choice of fluff). Also if your looking for one of these types of chairs, look for ones with the standard arms that come from the bottom of the seat and do not connect to the backrest because those should be more durable than these even though these look like they would be more sturdy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1589068800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Owned for 3 years, don't recommend.","reviewDescription":"In my honest opinion, this chair is not worth the price you pay. I have had this chair for 3 years and I have finally replaced it. Within the first 2 week of owning this chair, the seat went flat. I'm about 210lb and I spend the majority of my days in my chair as I work from home and game frequently. So the fact that the seat cushion didn't last a month was very disappointing. I had to buy a separate memory foam pad in order to sit comfortably. THAT has lasted me these 3 years so I'll rate the pad 5 stars! But the seat turned into a cement block; no cushion AT ALL.Along with that, the plastic leather material began to crack at the bottom front where my legs are. It eventually started chipping away. The arm rests started to crack and split so I had to put tape over it to keep pieces from falling off and from scratching my arm.The arm rests themselves are not very sturdy. They wiggle side-to-side even though the screws are tight. When repositioning in the chair, it always creeks, groans, pops, or whatever. It sounds like something breaks each time but  that's not the case. It's just very loud when repositioning.I've came to learn very early that the thick padded backing is not worth it. Unless you intend on taking extended naps in this chair, I never lean or lay back enough to get anything out of it. Not worth having in my opinion.The head pillow is nice though. The times I have leaned back to watch a video, it makes it much more comfortable. No complaints with the pillow. The lumbar support pillow I took off. Didn't make things anymore comfortable, in fact it made thing more UNcomfortable. It never stayed in the same spot, it pushed you to the front of the seat, and when trying to lean back it felt like the pillow was trying to bend you in half. I saw and got no benefit from having it, so I just took it off.Overall, I rated this chair at 2 stars mainly because of the seat. The cushion only lasting a very short while is not what anyone wants in a chair that they are going to spend this amount of money on. And the fact that the material started to break down and within this time is not good quality. If you are looking to spend this kind of money, I would suggest using it towards something else.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1677974400000}

My hydraulics in the chair do not work anymore the chair goes completely down when I sit in it and goes straight up when I get off it, cushions are wore down on the arms and on the seat. It had good first impressions, but now I see how bad this chair actually is. I work from home and game. So I'm in it 10+ hours a day. It just does not hold up for heavy use and within 6 months I noticed how bad it truly was. I wish I listened to other reviews!****PURCHASED MAY 13TH 2020: JUNE 23RD 2020 UPDATE******Tl;dr arm rests, and lumbar pillow wore down. Seat is okay for now. Overall, comfortable at first but wears down wayyy too fast. Will be purchasing a different chair in the future!Okay so I've had this chair for almost 2 months and I sit in it for atleast over 12 hours if not more a day, because I work from home and I play video games. But I have a few complaints that have made this chair a 3 star from a 4 star because I think this depends all on user experience\/use. My cushions are wore down already, specifically where my elbow rests, my lumbar support pillow, is also flat. The seat is fine for now, but I can definitely tell it'll be bad in the next couple of months. Overall this chair is probably perfect for people who don't plan on sitting in it for as long as I do, I think overall I'd rather spend my money on a different product next time because it is comfortable at first, but it definitely has wore down too fast for me.Tl;dr An affordable and comfortable chair with some minor issues, arms become slightly loose quickly, footrest loose on left side but still functions fine. Nice support for my back, head, and neck. Don't let other reviews scare you off!So I bought this chair after having a simple office chair from Staples for about 5 years after it finally gave out. I've had it for a couple days and I will agree that the arms come loose a bit easily, and I've tightened them atleast 2 times now. But it is a cheaper and affordable option when it comes to \"gaming chairs\". I bought this as I now work from home but I also play games, so I'm in a chair for 12+ hours a day. I've used a dxracer before for a few months and can say I can't notice too much of a difference (the arms on that were also loose and had to be tightened almost daily). One thing I could never get right and still can't get right is the adjustment on the pillows, I'm constantly having to shift them to the right spot, but when in the right spot give me the support I need. Also the footrest is a bit loose on the left side, but nothing that is too concerning, the packaging came with slight damage which is normal but all the contents were undamaged.Overall I think this chair is really good for its price. Many of the reviews were scaring me, but I went with my final gut feeling and purchased it, I rated it a 4\/5 due to it not being perfect and definitely having its flaws, but nothing that deserves anything lower as it does what its meant to do.

{"reviewTitle":"After 6 months of use...would not buy again. Style was chosen over function.","reviewDescription":"Have had 2 of these for 6 months now and I can honestly say this is absolutely the worst office\/gaming chair I have had to use. The setup was straightforward and relatively easy.Despite multiple retightenings and even thread locker arms are wobbly and useless. One side is so bad i have actually contemplated removing the arm entirely.The biggest design flaw for me is the seat is fixed in a flat position, and does not move with the back so your lower body is stuck in flat position no matter if your sitting up or leaning back. This is not mentioned in the ad but, this is the first chair over $50 that i have not seen as a basic feature.Within first day additional padding was added to the seat by both users as the included pads were as comfortable as a wooden church pew.The recliner leg support is perfect....assuming you are under 4ft 6inches tall.  Even guests i have had that were 5ft remarked at its pointless positioning. Basically it is functionally useless.After 6 months i have finally given up on trying to convince myself this was anything other than a poor purchase on my part. I have reverted to using my 10+ year old office chair.The chair does LOOK nice, but if you plan on using this for more than 20 minutes at a time I would recommend looking elsewhere. I am not wanting to sound jaded, the chair does have some nice heavy duty components, but there are some glaring design flaws that I am honestly not sure how slipped past into production. This chair is suitable for kids or even younger teens, but for work or even moderate gaming sessions i have to rate this a failed product. I often found myself standing up after even short uses to alleviate pain in my glutes and lower back.1 of the 2 original chairs was damaged in shipping and despite the rapid $50 price change, amazon and the seller did provide a replacement.

{"reviewTitle":"1 year later review - not bad, but not worth the price","reviewDescription":"I see this chair is listed at around $100 right now. I paid about $160 for it almost exactly 1 year ago. It just now started to have issues with the reclining lock. When I recline, it no longer locks the position. This is a critical feature, so I'll have to figure out a way to rig this myself.The leather and arm-rests have maintained their quality so far. No rips or cracks yet. The left side arm-rest is slightly loose, even when the bolt is tightened, but this a minor annoyance at worst.This is not the most comfortable chair, but it's pretty decent. I have a horrible spine, with issues in L5-S1 and this chair has been pretty good for that. I don't feel any additional pain sitting in it, so that's a huge plus right away.Putting the chair together was very easy. When I received it, there were markings and indications that the chair was lightly used. I'm guessing somebody utilized their prime return window and sent it back. No worries though as it's on the bottom part of the chair and didn't impact its functionality or how it looks on the main components.I almost never use the footrest. It's just not comfortable for me to use with the way it's positioned and the weight of my body pressed against the chair. The headrest is odd. I don't really understand chairs that have a headrest which encourages your neck to angle forward. Seems like a bad idea and recipe for pain if not worse.It's a relatively firm chair, especially the seat portion. If you like soft chairs like the mesh stuff, I wouldn't recommend this. I personally dislike mesh chairs because it encourages bad body positioning by allowing you to \"sink in\" with whatever bad sitting habits you may have accumulated. A firmer chair does a better job ensuring you're sitting correctly. That being said, the seat portion of this chair has a strange \"angle-forward\" feeling; as if sitting slightly with the seat sloped downwards towards the front. It's not a big deal, but every now and then gets annoying.Altogether I wouldn't pay more than $70 or so for this chair. Possibly even less. Given the reclining lock is already broken at the 1 year point, seems a bit wasteful to spend so much on it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666915200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Mixed feelings as a \"gaming chair\"","reviewDescription":"As a maintenance tech for a school district, I've assembled and repaired hundreds of task and office chairs in the last 20 years, so that should qualify me as being \"familiar\" with chairs at the very least. As a gamer, add on 10 more years of experience sitting on my behind for hours at a time. So getting to it, the chair is built extremely well. Even though it's made in China, the quality of the hardware, machining and powder coating are all better than average. Parts mate perfectly. Nothing was dinged, scratched, chipped or dented out of the box. Packaging was better than average. I would expect the weight rating to be right on the money, and anyone under 250 is going to have a difficult time breaking this chair by not being gentle with it. Probably the only thing I would deem underwhelming are the casters. They do not roll as freely as most run-of-the-mill plastic casters. Some folks will actually be okay with that, but when I push away from a desk, I need the chair to glide a little. This one requires more than normal effort to make it move.Totally assembly time with the allen key provided was around 25 minutes. I could have used my impact on it, but since I wasn't familiar with the build quality, I didn't want to risk over-torquing anything even a little. Instructions are clear and concise. With the exception of zipping in the headrest, I can't see anyone having a hard time with assembly.Comfort! This is where improvement is much-needed. While it's a sleek and mostly ergonomic design, it lacks sufficient cushioning in the seat. I'm around 200 lbs. and feel \"bottomed out\" in this chair, enough to where I feel pain. This is something I've never experienced in ANY articulating chair, including automotive seats. Lack of padding or height adjustment in the arm rests may be problematic for some. For me, it's a matter of an inch too tall with the chair adjusted to its lowest (I'm 5'10\"). At this price point, I don't understand how at a minimum, simple height-adjustable armrests are left out. Reclining is the only feature where this chair might excel. I could comfortably nap in it without any added cushions or support. Upright is a different story. Being aware of the seat back height\/headrest, you'll want to naturally let your head fall back, but it's not a comfortable position while looking at a screen. And since there's no forward adjustment, you'll now need to add about 4\" to 6\" worth of cushion to keep your head upright enough.So with about $70 worth of add-ons (memory foam head and seat cushion plus footrest), this chair can work as a long haul gaming seat, but that's an extra $70 you could put towards a different chair with possibly a thicker seat cushion, adjustable headrest, lumbar support and maybe even 4D adjustable armrests. I like the design, but if I had to do over, I'd increase my budget cap by an extra $100 and shop for something that checks all or some of the aforementioned boxes.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686873600000}

I'm waiting for the Killabee 8257 to come back in stock, which looks to be the perfect chair for me. I'm 6'2\" & 190lbs, so I'm a little big for most chairs and prefer the big and talls. However, I insist on padded armrests, and there are only a few chairs out there that have them.Unlike some, I didn't just buy this chair because it was cheap, though at a sale price $109, I knew I wouldn't be mad if it wasn't perfect. I honestly have few options as most gaming chairs just have solid plastic armrests, which I hate, and I really don't like add-on pads. My old chair was about 20 years old, and I milked it as long as I could, going so far to have the metal on the bottom re-welded when it broke. It was made of preforated real leather, it had a huge seat, and was very comfortable. The arms were never that sturdy, and the back wasn't quite high enough, but it was very comfortable. It was breaking badly, so I couldn't wait on the Killabee. I ended up deciding between 3 chairs:Respawn 110, Downix, and Bossin.I had a hard time choosing between them without sitting in them, but decided on the Respawn based on reviews and apparent shape. So I've spent 2 days with the chair, and here are my impressions:The Good:-It has all the \"features\" I wanted padded armrest, foot rest, infinite position reclining (the 90 to 155 degrees is fine)The PU material has a softer feel to itThe shape of the chair butt area is good for meIt's kind of comfortable- If I get everything set just right, helps my posture- Looks nice- Stitching is well done for it's class- Rear holes and shape prevent heat soak- Not a dumb name like some models- Overall look makes it appear higher end than it isThe Bad:- The lumbar pillow is too thick for the shape of the chair, and the chair back is not very padded without it.- Padding is weak throughout. Needs more in multiple places, and is easily flattened already.- I feel like I'm constantly having to readjust myself and the pillows while gaming- The PU material, while soft, is a little powdery\/grippy feeling (hard to describe), but you stick to it easily, as with many PU chairs. (I miss my perforations, but nothing has them anymore :(, though most leather cars do???)- It's not as big as I wanted, but I knew this going in. I want about 1 to 2 inches more in every direction.- Build quality is obvious corner cutting (Rear Seams, Hard Plastic Wheels, All-Plastic Base, Cheap feeling plastics throughout)- Without lumbar pillow, shoulder area feels like there is no support at all, due to the holes in the back.The Ugly:- On day 2, after adjusting the lumber a few times, I went to just take it off for a while, when I unclipped one of the clips, it exploded. Sent in replacement request to.- This chair just doesn't feel like it's going to last. Between the weak padding, weak clips, weak base, and weak leatherette, I doubt this chair would be usable after 2 years of heavy use.ConclusionIt's just not that great. It's not awful and on sale for $109 I don't think it's a bad buy. However, I use my computer chair way to often to settle for this. This would be great for occasional use, say a guest chair, or for a preteen\/smaller person.As planned, this will get demoted in my house to a guest chair, and I'll be look elsewhere...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1574812800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Review after one year of use","reviewDescription":"First off, I'd like to address the quality control of these chairs. I ordered two- one neon green\/black for myself, and one dark purple\/black for my fiance. Mine was super comfortable and supportive to begin with, but his was noticeably less so. I swear, there was padding in mine that there wasn't in his, despite the fact that they were exactly the same make and model. They were assembled at the same time, the same way, exactly according to the instructions and yet there was a noticeable difference in function as well- mine reclined just fine, and his... not so much. It was jerky if it reclined at all, and squeaked like broken brakes on a car. And for reference, we both weigh about the same, so I seriously doubt that was a factor.Secondly, they're not very durable. If you weigh less than 190lbs and aren't that hard on chairs, this may be fine for you, but my fiance's began to deteriorate almost immediately and mine after about the six month mark. One of the arms detached from the front (of BOTH chairs!) on the right side and just kind of hangs there, broken and sad and begging to be pulled off.TL;DR: I suspect the weight limit listed here is BS, and there's quality control issues. If you're tiny, this may work for you, but if you're not this is one hell of an expensive gamble.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697155200000}
{"reviewTitle":"I think perhaps good for gaming, but for work, maybe not the ideal option","reviewDescription":"I wanted to give a gaming chair a try - this one has good reviews and looks very sturdy.  Like many, I spend about 10 hours a day in a chair for work at home.  It does the job, but I think I may give this to my son and look into a different, more ergonomic chair for me.Pros:- Easy to install and set up- I like the leg fold-out, and the back lays all the way down (comfortable for those quick naps)- Base seems stable, feels secureCons:- At its most elevated position, I still feel too low compared to my desk (needs to come up a bit)- Arms feel a bit weak and wobbly (even after a good tightening)- I like to put my feet on the legs when I work, but the leg extension blocks it (not that big of a deal)- The arm wrests come too far forward - they always bump the desk when I swivel to stand up- This is going to sound petty, but my rear gets hot in this chair (didn't with my other chairs)- After about 15 minutes of sitting in the chair, I can always lift the height adjustment and it pops up an inch or so (as it its slowly losing its height over time).  I have to pull the lever to pop it back up in its highest position constantly.  This get tiresome real quickly.- Always feels like I'm kind of sliding forward.  I think the front edge of the seat should have been elevated a bit.Those are the main gripes.  its not terrible by any means.  Just probably a bit too clunky for a good work chair that you will spend many hours in each day.  I don't know what a good alternate chair is, so I guess I will keep looking.

July 4th, 2020Excellent chair, very easy to assemble (just be patient) VERY comfortable. I use it all day and night for gaming (when I\u2019m not busy lol). The cushions where you sit are soft and thick so it makes it extra comfortable. The pillows for your lower back and neck are also a HUGE plus, especially if you have pain in those areas like I do. The armrests are also very nice and soft and make you feel comfortable ( I wish it was adjustable though so you can move them more towards your elbows, because of the way I lay my arms really close to me it gets uncomfortable at times since my arms lay on the plastic sometimes. Which is easy to fix though but adjusting the leaning distance for the chair. It\u2019s not a big issue though it\u2019s more of a personal preference tbh). The foot rest is amazing for me since the cushions are very soft and thick.  Final thoughts: I honestly recommend this chair to anybody looking for a chair with features like this at this price range.Good quality, soft cushions, very comfortable (to the point where I almost fell asleep multiple times btw). For $150 this is honestly the best chair on the market for the price and features it boasts IMHO. I absolutely love it.

I spent hours looking for a gaming chair that was sturdy, comfortable, and affordable. I saw many highly rated chairs @ $300+ but not one chair with decent ratings under $200 let alone under $150. I ordered my chair about 3 weeks ago while it was Out of Stock as I was sure that it would be worth the wait. I didn't see any Available a week later so I contacted the manufacturer and was sent to voice mail. I got a call back within the hour and was told more would be available in about a week. Sure enough, the chair was in stock as promised and was being shipped. This chair has proven to be so popular that it sells out the day it is restocked.Fast forward to today. I received the chair two days earlier than promised which was nice. The box is well packaged inside and out with each piece bubble wrapped. Assembly was a breeze, instructions were easy to follow, and build time was maybe 10-15 minutes. The build quality is exceptional. It includes all bolts and washers pre-lubricated for ease of assembly and the wrenches that you need.I will update this review over the next few months but my first impression is simply WOW! I love how comfortable this chair is. The base cushion is firm but soft and forgiving, the back and head pillows have excellent support, and the seatback feels strong enough to hold up for years.In summary, I am extremely pleased with this chair and I highly recommend it!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1520985600000}

But my first had a crack in the plastic that I think I\u2019m going to try and fix because when I asked the company for parts they offered a new chair instead. So no I have one that will be slightly modified but still basically brand new from the naked eye, and a completely new one that is actually the color I originally wanted but at the time was more expensive. I can\u2019t say enough about this chair and brand, even though my first one broke which was unfortunate I think I may have been my fault so I will be more gentle from now on (bottom of footrest cracked) but either way they confirmed my order and sent me a new one within a few days.

It normally costs around 170 but it dropped to 148 so I bought it. I'm 5'7, and the neck rest is a tiny bit short for me but I can rest my head on it. The foot rest isn't really useful and it's a little flimsy. The chair feels mediocre quality and shouldn't break if you use it correctly. The chair height adjustment is fine and the lumbar support is great. The armrests are a little wobbly, as stated in the other reviews. The leaning mechanism is a little unstable but It leans really far back. The box came in a little beat up but nothing inside is fine. You can't use this chair for long without a shirt because it can get a little moist on the lumbar. It's not really as comfortable as I expected but that's the same with all gaming chairs. They're mainly for show. If you want something comfortable, use an ergonomic office chair. One last thing about this chair is that the right arm rest is about an inch lower than the left. This is a tiny detail but it really bugs me. Also, if you learn back with the lean mechanism locked, the chair still leans back a little and creaks.

I've used this chair literally from 8am to midnight sometimes and what I can tell you is that the cushion is good enough for its size (im 150 lbs) but it could be better. The longest I've sat on it without noticing any discomfort is probably about 6 hours of straight up doing school works. I didn't noticed much of the synthetic leather material smell that everyone was complaining about . The arm rest definitely gets a little lose so I'm very careful to move it side ways.

The first delivery was in terrible shape, thus I returned it right away.How for the product side. I saw one negative video that complained mainly about the leg rest. I had the same problem with the loose fitting of the left side of the leg rest. The solution I employed was to take the whole (larger of the two) side screw out and use a spare lock washer (that came with kit) to hold that bold in place. So far, there hasn't been any re-loosening of the leg rest screw.I love the features of this particular chair, especially the cushioned arm rests that move as the back reclines. I love the concept of the leg rest, though it seems to be for someone shorter than me, which is 6 feet. Nevertheless, it is workable for me. Though this is my first gaming chair, I still highly recommend it for it's different configurations and functions, like the head rest and the lumbar support as well. Secondly, I purchased this chair for $50 less than what it retailed at some other stores. Once again, the packaging was horrible twice. On the other hand, there was no damage to the merchandise inside. This works as advertised and I only had to tweak\/tighten a screw or so. I feel sorry for the guy that gave it a negative review.

{"reviewTitle":"My honest review, from start to finish","reviewDescription":"I bought this chair to replace a chair I was gifted that had no back support and a broken arm. I figured with the pillows and the foot rest this would be an overall good chair for gaming and working from home. Firstly, the package came absolutely obliterated, so I didn't think the chair would still be in good condition as there were holes in the package and it looked like an item someone furiously returned with the loads of packing tape on it. I took all pieces out of the package, and started to assemble. The pieces themselves feel very sturdy and premium, and even the tools and screws are very heavy duty. It took me about 15-20 minutes to put it together, and when testing out the product, it rates a solid 7 (so far).I think the product itself is solid, and perhaps worth the price (being that the previous chair I had was about $99+tax and this one being about $50 more. The pillows and leg rests seem like an added bonus, but in my opinion, the pillows are too firm and put too much pressure on your back to sit comfortably. The leg rest does not feel sturdy enough to be promising, and flips up awkwardly, making it something people probably won't use, being that it feels like a task. The leather feels very nice, and I like that you are able to lock the chair in place or recline all the way back.I think if you're looking for a decent gaming chair for a reasonable price, look no further. There are a ton of chairs doubled in price that are exactly the same as this one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1586217600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Near-Perfect for \"smaller\" sized Gamers","reviewDescription":"When I purchased this gaming chair initially, I was a bit skeptical due to the mixed reviews from all the customers. As someone who doesn't really write reviews, I thought it would make sense to write a review for people who were skeptical like I was.IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO'S 5'9+ or 160+ lbs, I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying this product. Based on the people writing negatively about this product, they are people who are taller\/heavier. I mean no disrespect to people who are that height or weight, it's just the truth for this product.I am 5'5\" at around 140 lbs and this is nearly perfect. Yes I've only had this product for a week but, even after several hours of sitting on this product, I hardly feel the cushion deflating. It's only towards the end of the day where I feel it slightly deflated(even with someone who has a bone-y behind). And even then, I just move away for 10-20 min and it's inflated again. In regards to the screws coming lose and the arm rest being wobbly, yes I also have the same problem but, it's due to reclining the chair a bunch of times. I just re-tighten the screws and the arm rests are perfectly fine. If you have 8+ hours to play video games or work on this chair, you can take at most a minute to re-tighten the screws. Overall, I really like this chair. It does the job and it really helps with my lower back problem. I gave this a 4 out of 5 just due to the minor faults.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1593993600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Nice chair","reviewDescription":"((The cushion on the seat shown in the picture was bought from Walmart separately and was not included with this product))I've had mine since September 2021 and it's been a nice chair. I bought this to replace my gigantic Papasan chair I bought in-store from Walmart since it was so huge and way too short to be reaching my PC table. I believe this would be better if mother didn't insist on building it herself despite not knowing what she's doing, but I understand what problems arise from her faults and I don't want to discount from that. I have two other friends that have their own (one even goes 100 something pounds over the weight limit and he's had his for years) and both claim theirs are sturdy. I don't use the leg rest, it feels too uncomfortable and I'm too afraid to use them on any sort of chair but big, sturdy recliners. When I rest my legs on these I can feel the leg rest go downwards slightly, as if the metal itself is weak and bending. I only weigh 160lbs for reference. Leaning back in the chair normally feels comfortable and leaning the back rest backwards seems to do fine, but I rarely push back the upper part of the seat and I never adjust the height of the chair.The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star is because the seat cushion itself feels somewhat hard. I know I myself do have problems finding a seat that's comfortable for my bottom. They have to be very, very soft. Although, even feeling it with my hands it feels stiff and hard. If you couldn't tell from the pictures, it's made from faux leather. So take that into account when thinking about comfortability and design. Also, I don't use the pillows that are provided along with the chair. The head one sticks out too far for my liking and made my neck uncomfortable. The back one I couldn't find a good place for it, and it only made my lower back pain worse. They are entirely optional and it is totally up to you if you want to leave them strapped to the back rest or not.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1648944000000}
{"reviewTitle":"My first gaming chair.... not the best experience but got it fixed.","reviewDescription":"Updated review (4\/5) 06\/30\/18:FINALLY GOT MY CHAIR FIXED!!!!! I went to home depot and bought the according size nuts and bolts for the step 5 installation of the chair. There is; however, a difference in measurements in the nuts and bolts at the hardware store, because  they were in inches while the chairs were in mm. If there is anyone having the same issue I had with this chair, go with 5\/16'' x 1'' bolts and nuts. I REPEAT. GO WITH 5\/16\" X 1\" BOLTS AND NUTS. They are the best size to replace the faulty screws that came with the chair. It was; however, a tight fit when I repaired it and it does require a 10mm wrench to secure it in.After the repair, I got to actually enjoy the chair. What really sold me initially compared to other racing chairs was its seat measurement. For a guy that has a larger waist and likes some leg room, a decent leveled 21\" seat width was ideal. The comfort level is amazing and the kick stand is a plus. The head and lumbar support was a nice commodity, but I don't really like using it. The material of the chair could be better, but at its price point, it holds up pretty well. Lets just hope this chair holds up for a long time, but so far, I am satisfied with the overall product.Initial review (1\/5 rating) 06\/29\/18:Got home from work on a Friday to see this right outside my house and I was ecstatic to build it. Most of the installation for me was a piece of cake, but my biggest issue was installing part 5 where you would connect the seat to the back of the chair. I first noticed it when I try testing out the chair and fell on the ground back first. Luckily for me, my back landed on top of the back cushion.  I don't know if my product is defective or i'm missing a piece, but the seat and the back part are not secure at all and cannot recline and comes loose when I lay my back against the seat. It's taking me all night to try to solve this problem, but I just had it with this chair. I'm heading out to home depot tomorrow to grab some securing nuts for those screws in an attempt to resolve this issue.For what little I could get out of seating in this chair, i would like to give it a 4\/5 rating I love the comfort of the chair and the kick stand is amazing. Unfortunately though, the product does feel cheap with its product material and I found threads of loose string scattered around the chair, which I had to cut. For the price of this chair; however, you can't go wrong, except in my case.Overall, I'm very displeased and frustrated with building this contraption. I am very close in returning this chair, but I will be contacting customer service on monday if i can't solve it myself. I will update this review once I get it resolved, but the overall product at the moment stands at a 1\/5. I just want to relax on this chair and play my video games this weekend....","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1530316800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great for working from home","reviewDescription":"I purchased this chair because I needed something comfortable to sit in while working from home all day. My previous chair caused me horrible back pain. And this chair had mostly good reviews. There were some indications that the arms weren't fully  secure but some people have the solutions that they used so I thought I'd give it a try.I've had the chair about two months. Of course sitting in a desk chair for 8-10 hours a day isn't ideal for the body, but I don't suffer every day (and night) like I had previously. It's a pretty comfortable chair. The chair is as it was when I bought it except yes, the arms have gotten a little wobbly. It's likely because I shift in the chair every now and then and use the arms to do so. It's not a big concern for me and when I get some time off work I'll probably take them off and use the solutions that were offered in the other comments (Glue or lock tite if I remember correctly) to tighten them up. The chair is otherwise we'll made and I'm very happy with it.The pillow is a nice touch for neck support when you lean back. The wheels roll nicely, considering I have carpet in my office. The foot rest is a nice touch as well though I don't use it often due to my desk not being all that compatible with it sticking out. That's also not something you would put too much weight on. It reclines nicely too but I don't use that either. I do put a throw over the seat when I'm wearing shorts as the  leather like fabric makes your legs sweat. All in all it's a great chair, comfortable for work, which is what I needed it for.

{"reviewTitle":"Good Value","reviewDescription":"I like the chair. I ordered it Used from Amazon open box and although the box had several rips in it, everything was there. Assembly couldn't be much easier it took maybe 10 minutes with a 3 year old wanting to try it out at the same time I was tightening down the bolts. The recline feature is nice though I wish it had the recline lever near the pivot point of the chair rather than down by the telescoping (raise\/lower) lever though. Overall, i'm happy with the chair and it fits me well. I know others have complained about the head pillow moving around a lot but mine rest exactly where I need it for my size ( 175lbs and 5' 11\"). I use the chair daily as a CS student as well as a CNC hobbyist designing parts in Fusion 360 and the chair has held up well. It has made 8 hour sessions much more tolerable. With all that said, i'm not sure if I would feel the same if I had paid full price but I like a discount and that goes a long way with my appreciation of things.Update:: Other reviewers mentioned that chair gets noisy after a couple of weeks and the bolts constantly need tightening. I have the same issues. Bolts aren't that big of a deal but I need to investigate the squeaking. Likely now that some paint is worn of the mechanism allowing for rough contact. Still an upgrade from my other chair and is comfortable for long sits, but pad has flattened.Buddy of mine has the Shaq o Neil chair that I tried out and if you are look for a great chair that is a good value (still expensive but cheaper than other options and not that much more expensive than this one full price) I would highly recommend it. If I hadn't bought this chair for the discounted open box price I did I would definitely have buyers remorse after feeling his chair.

{"reviewTitle":"Not a bad chair, but also not a great one.","reviewDescription":"I bought this chair at the beginning of COVID Quarantine because I knew my chair wouldn't last. I figured for around $150 this wouldn't be the best chair I would ever buy, but with my job solely being based on social gatherings I didn't want to spend a ton on a chair at that point.Here are some of the biggest pros and cons I've discovered so far:Pros:-Overall the cushioning in the chair has made it pretty comfortable. I know chairs are not designed for sitting in for as many hours as I have but it's still pretty comfortable at the end of the day.-Easy to assemble. I glanced over the directions and really didn't need to. It's a pretty simple and quick assembly.-Leg rest is a nice feature.Cons:- The arm get loose over time. I've had this chair since mid-March, I've had to readjust\/tighten the arms twice already and as I sit here and test it, they're loose once again.-The extra cushions that came with it were so stiff they were unusable for me and caused worse back pain.-The chair sinks. My desk is tall so I require the chair to be at the highest setting which because I am short is still almost too low for me. So when it starts just randomly sinking, (sometimes its right as I sit down, other times its as I sit in it.. and recently its been sinking overnight when no one is in it. I look at it under my desk the next morning and notice the height difference) it is incredibly noticeable for me.-The leg rest already has stitching coming apart.-The leather is hot. I know this one is a bit a personal preference, but I never realized how warm I get in leather chairs until this one, so sitting in it for hours at a time while gaming can get rather gross and for lack of a better way to phrase it, swampy. I just try to make sure I get up and walk around every now and then to help that, but thought it was worth mentioning.I've spent a lot more hours in this chair than I normally would, and the comfort level for the cushions still is pretty  solid. However, the rest of the chair leaves a lot to be desired.So for the price, its not bad, but its not the greatest chair ever either. I will definitely be looking at other chairs when I need to replace this one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1593993600000}

It does have a slight \"odour\" but that's like complaining about the new car smell.  The seat\/back padding is GREAT.  The (easily adjustable) lumber\/headrest pads are very comfortable and easily adjustable.  The assembly was easy\/clean (no Styrofoam).  There were about 5-6 pieces (look at the pictures) all bubble wrapped and two boxes.  Inside of the two boxes, everything was individually wrapped.  And as a side-note... They have the EASIEST packaging to \"pop-out\" the various lettered screws\/bolts\/tools.  Personally, that was the first thing I noticed\/enjoyed lolUPDATE: 1 1\/2 months in... After using this chair extensively for upright gaming\/work and full reclined movie viewing I can still stand by the 5-star rating I gave it. The chair always feels solid in any position (200lb+ guy) and the footrest doesn't feel flimsy at all if treated properly (ie, no excessive weight on it or being rough).  The only two very minor complaints are (A) it doesn't breathe at all so, on a very hot day and long sitting times, it can get a bit hot, and (B) the bolts for the armrest that attach to the back of the chair did work themselves loose that required about two full turns to tighten back up.  But, like I said, very negligible complaints for the price\/features of this chair.UPDATE: 1yr 3months:  Both the seat and armrests are cracking.  Luckily their support team is pretty responsive.  Between the correspondences and the delivery of my replacements (today 8\/20) it took about 3-4 weeks.  I'll be hanging on to these replacements until the seat and arms are so far gone since apparently they are only good for about a year.UPDATE almost 2yrs later:  Don't ever buy this brand lol  I still have the above-mentioned replacements in the box for the last possible moment.  Now the foot\/leg rest just falls out\/off.  No more padding\/support, such a crappy chair.  Was great for the first 6-12 months.  After that, expect to replace the whole thing.

But i\u2019m going to be brutally honest about this chair.The setup was easy, it took my maybe 15 minutes and then I was able to use it. I followed the instructions to the letter and after a couple month of owning it and honestly barely using it, I regret buying it. It is so unbelievably uncomfortable, not only with the seat itself but the backing and the armrests. The armrests are hard plastic which, in all honesty, isn\u2019t too big of a deal, you can just get some pads, but the backing just feels like metal. The seat part of the chair is decently cushioned, but sitting on the floor would still be a better alternative.The part where the chair and wheels meet with that metal pole, also has issues. none of it is stable. It feels like i\u2019m going to fall over or the chair is just going to collapse. Genuinely just an issue of poor quality.This is my biggest issue with this product, the noise. I had another respawn chair prior to this and it was nicely padded and honestly comfortable, but had this insufferable squeaking noise every time I moved just an inch. I thought it was because I had the chair for a long time. Well after buying this one, I can see how wrong I was. There are so many times I am playing games with friends and they ask what all the noise is, and it\u2019s just me moving my arm but the chair makes all the noise.

{"reviewTitle":"Overall Review","reviewDescription":"Hey! This is my first gaming chair and also my first review, going out of my way to warn all my other gaming people out there just getting their feet wet like I did with these gaming chairs. If you are reading this and considering buying this chair DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.Comfort:The chair is an upgrade from the old wooden chair I used to use for gaming but over the course of the last 60 days of ownership I\u2019ve noticed the foam the chair used is cheap and does not provide any support anymore, the base of the seat is so flattened to the point where it just feels like I\u2019m sitting on bare plastic. I only weigh 170lbs. The arm rests have indented and become flatter as well, still providing a small amount of comfort. The only cushions that still provide support are the back rest and the neck pillow, thankfully.Design:As it comes in a box for you to assemble, and I\u2019m not sure if this is just specific to this chair or not, but, it does really show it\u2019s lack of quality when you see all the cheaply made plastic pieces you use to assemble the chair. The armrests really start to make noises and they loosen up constantly having to make you grab tools to tighten them unless you like the wiggling arm rests. I also noticed that they have a lack of movement and it really became a nuisance once I got comfortable with the chair, sometimes you want the arm rests higher or and in a different position and unfortunately with this design you do not have that luxury. The other thing I noticed the chair lacked was the inability to \u201croll\u201d or \u201clean\u201d forward or backwards for a more relaxed position. The only thing that moves back and forth is the back support and with that the arm rests, very poor design.This leads me into the foot rest, I read a lot about how it didn\u2019t work for people who are 6 foot tall, etc etc but I actually really enjoyed it. So much so that everyday after work I would find myself using it. I enjoyed the placement and the length it was sturdy enough not to sag or bend in any weird way seeing as how the only metal part of this chair are the two bars that extend outwards to hold the foot rest up. Overall the design leaves you wanting more.Quality:As you can see the attached pictures the foot rest quite literally is being held by a flimsy plastic that just broke over time. It\u2019s only been 60 days since I\u2019ve had it, the companies warranty only covers 30 days from proof of purchase, just adding to the lack of quality of customer service, it\u2019s like they know it will break after 30 days. And for those of you who live outside of the contiguous U.S. states they don\u2019t cover you.Overall design is a mix of flimsy plastic, and the pleather they use coupled with the cheap foam.Conclusion:Take your money elsewhere, if I had the opportunity I would\u2019ve taken the extra time to save up for a more solid chair, which is now what I\u2019m forced to do. I cannot recommend this product to anyone else!DO NOT BUY!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1625011200000}

This chair doesn't have as much padding as it seemed from the pictures, there is far more padding in the on the sides of the seat where you don't even sit than in the middle where you would actually be sitting. I would rather that padding be under me, not pointlessly to the side doing nothing. Another important note, if you are looking for a chair that leans all the way back, this one is not it, as it only reclines about half of the way back.also one of the elastic straps holding the back support cushion on ended up snapping right off at the stitching while adjusting it.Stitching quality on the elastic straps could be better, and the cushions for the seat could have been FAR better than they are. there is already an indention where i have been sitting which causes my butt to hit the wood underneath when i sit down. ( I weigh less than 140lbs I should not be able to flatten the seat cushion by sitting)For comfort, i would give this chair a 3\/5 (the cushioning on the leg rest is far better than the cushion in the seat, i want that cushion under my butt)assembly 5\/5 (easy to assemble)Durability: 1\/5  (Recline mechanism fails within months.) Changed from 3\/5 since literally every replacement has failed the same exact way.overall 1\/5 (assembly and comfort doesn't matter when the chair is going to fail within months)EDIT: have had a new chair sent to me, after the first one I got ended up having a mechanical issue causing it to not catch and instead constantly lean back, no matter how little I lean on it. Within a few months, the new one has the same issue. I barely lean on it, and even though the mechanism is locked, the chair reclines all the way back. Seems this chair simply uses a faulty mechanism, and this time It happened much sooner than it did to my old chair.EDIT 2: I have had 3 replacements sent to me now, and every single one of them has had the mechanism that locks it from reclining fail, So it seems this company has absolutely terrible quality control. I am only 130-140lbs or so, so this chair has no excuse to be failing under my weight. On top of that, even though I paid for a warranty, the company said with the last replacement that \"This product is not covered under warranty\" so if it fails, I guess we will see how that goes., Also with the last one I got, I ended up having to put a sticky note between the riser and the hole in the thingy, so that I would be able to take it apart again, because the first 2 times I tried to take it apart, following their instructions, the metal was stuck together, which Is why I ended up needing a full chair replacement, and couldn't use the replacement mechanism they originally sent me the first time. I am now using that replacement mechanism (the sticky note trick worked, and it slid right out with a little tap), and anticipating it failing just like all the others.(Edit whatever number) it's starting to fail if I lean back on it again... ugh this stupid company.Don't buy this trash, you will regret it.

I'm changing my review to a 1 star. I found the foam in the seat did not hold up and degrades pretty quick. Was probably 4-5 months before it felt like I was sitting on lumpy concrete and started to give me hell with my back. I also came to hate the fact the seat is huge almost for someone extremely big. I'm not very big so this was super uncomfortable. I know they are supposed to have a warranty that might cover this, but it'll just do the same thing again. What happens with cheap foam. A competitor with a more expensive chair makes a point of using high density foam. Probably ends up being closer to the foam in a car seat. That's what it needed.Have had the chair all of two days, but feel I can give a fairly realistic review in that time frame so far.Chair is super easy to assemble, probably one of the easiest I've put together. Took me less than 10 minutes which is awesome. Most chairs I've purchased in the past become a fight and can take 20 minutes or more of fighting them.There is a strong chemical smell, I noticed that the chair felt like it was coated in something. I grabbed a leather cleaner and wiped the whole chair down and besides a very light leather smell from the cleaner, the chair is odorless.Chair is super comfortable, the leg\/foot rest is great. Easy to flip out and use. Feels very sturdy. I'm 205lbs and to no surprise the chair holds the weight fine and the leg\/foot rest feels very sturdy.I really love the fact that reclining can be locked in place at anything between 0-130*. You just lock it in place and you're done.Have a few cons, hence the 3 out of 5.First is the chair doesn't breathe worth anything. It's actually pretty bad. low 60*F in the house and 30*F outside and my back and legs get pretty hot. I have a feeling this chair will end up unbearable in the summer.The armrests are nice but also annoying. They clear my desk at 0* and a very slight tilt, but as you lean the chair back they actually get taller before they then get shorter again due to design. Means that sometimes my preferred recline amount causes the arms to hit the desk. May not matter to most, but was something I didn't catch from the pictures. Its not end of the world.last annoyance is that the feet for the chair sit towards the back. I know this is to allow the chair to balance at a 130* recline position, but when sitting on the edge of the chair it tips. You have to sit completely on the seat. Again, not end of the world, but for some people I know this would be an annoyance just like for me.All in all it's hard to complain for the price, it's a really nice chair all things considered. Working from home 4 days a week this might not be the best chair for me in the end, but I'll have to be fair and give it some time and see. My biggest concern is the summer months and how awful that might be.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"171 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1521590400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Hard to beat the price but time will tell","reviewDescription":"1\/11\/2021 EDIT: I'm out. Both arms are super wobbly with no way to tighten. The padding on both arms has collapsed (second time for the left arm). It still makes crunch noises when you sit back. I still felt like I was sliding out of the chair a bit at all times. I'm probably done with \"leather\" chairs altogether. I went with a Union & Scale\u2122 FlexFit Dexley Mesh Task Chair from Staples. I paid $125 and it was delivered for free the next day. Super easy to put together, it's comfortable, lots of adjustments, and overall I feel way better about this.8\/10\/2020 EDIT: My positive thoughts about this chair are diminishing. Less than 4 months in and the hydraulic lift is failing. It will not stay in its extended state unless I sit perfectly still. Any moving around and it starts to creep down. I've submitted a warranty request for a new one but it doesn't make me excited for the future of this chair. Downgraded to 3 stars.7\/6\/2020 EDIT: I've owned it for a little over 2 months now. I don't love it. It still makes lots of creaking\/crunching noises (minor issue of course) but I think the chair makes me hot (sweating more) and it still feels like I'm always sliding forward out of the chair a bit. Not sure if that's how it's built or if there's an issue with my specific unit. The padding on the left arm fully collapsed not long after my original review - it was very uncomfortable. I submitted a warranty request through Respawn's website and received a reply the next day (approved for replacement). I had a new left arm on my door step in less than 2 weeks. I don't feel a reason to change my score (4 stars) but I'll update as time goes on.----------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW----------------------Preface: I've only owned it for just a few weeks.Assembly was outstanding - one of the easiest things I've ever assembled. I used a ratchet and hex bit, not the included hex wrench. I'm sure the wrench would be fine.I was worried it would look a little goofy being a gamer chair but, seeing it in person after assembly, I think it's pretty sharp. Not professional but definitely not ridiculous like I expected.Other reviews have stated the arms feel loose - I can confirm that. The bolts are as tight as they go but the arms aren't real solid. They're not loose enough to make me concerned but it is something to note. The left arm already has a divot where my arm constantly rests (relaxed or typing) which isn't a good sign for the padding.The \"infinite locking positions\" concept works well. It's easy to adjust based on your needs. There is sometimes a crunching noise when I sit back in the chair - the chair back noticeably tilts back 1\/4\" or so. I think this is just something with the tilt mechanism. It's not concerning yet but time will tell.I do wish the front of the chair bottom was tilted up just a bit to ensure you're back against the chair. If I recline back, my butt will slide forward a bit.I need to continue to try out the footrest but so far I don't like it. I'm about 5'11\" and the end of the foot rest is mid calf which is not very supportive.Overall I don't have any major complaints. We'll see how long it holds up. I had my last chair for 10 years (too long). The padding was very worn and a large portion of the bonded leather had flaked off.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1589760000000}

You have to zip the cushion in (see picture) and it was almost impossible to do. This is a \u201cnew\u201d sleek model so most of the older reviews would not had to deal with this huge issue. I consider myself strong and could not pull the zipper shut without a pliers and it was still tough. I thought I was going to break the zipper but at that point I would not care. Had that happened I would have had to return the chair which would have been a huge hassle to get it back in the box and drag this heavy item somewhere to return it. So I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to have to deal with this potential problem. That being said, I got the chair on sale, it is sturdy and looks great.

{"reviewTitle":"Good quality. Save some money and get this vs exp models. BAD SERVICE FROM AMAZON\/RESPAWN.","reviewDescription":"I like the chair. A big box retailer sells this same brand so you know its good. The only problem i have with the one i received from amazon, is the left arm rest wobbles left\/right. The right arm rest is relatively secure. It was like this since day 1, which is only a couple days ago. Id really like to just get a new arm rest. I dont want to return this chair and get another one. Can support please help me? Only option in amazon is full return.So far i just wish the leg rest was a foot rest like a barber chair. Thats probably the only thing I'd change. The leg rest is nice but sometimes i need to be able to step or press my feet down to adjust and i cant do that with this leg rest. I end up pressing on the arm rests to adjust my position and then the left arm rest problems shows because my left hand wobbles.Cushioning is good and firm. PU leather is nice, but of course only drawback is you can get hot quick, especially if youre a warmbody type of person. Maybe if they had an awrated model it would be better for ventilation. The cushion in the arm rests is firm but you can hear the glue separate if you mush it on the sides a little, like squeezing it. Maybe its double sided tape? Not sure, but you can clearly hear it separate.The adjustable back support is probably my favorite feature. It is comfy to have especially since Im only 5'5.  The chair depth is pretty deep so the lumbar support helps to feel more full when sitting in it. Taller people may benefit more without the support or placed higher.The neck pillow is nice. I would like to be able to adjust the location but it is not possible. Too bad the straps on the lumbar arent on the neck pillow. It could pass through the neck holes and then through a slot at the top of the chair, allowing the height to be adjusted on the neck pillow.Long term, ill provide another update if i still have it in a couple months and it hasnt broken down.Future changes, would like to see a foot step like a barber chair instead of just a calf rest.laying down completely is not practical especially since torso weight could cause it to tip.Maybe an inclusion of a seat belt or shoulder harness. I notice this would help with posture to stop\/prevent desk creep (when your shoulder droop forward and you slump). Id like to see a feature like this.UPDATE: I tried removing the left arm and reconnecting it, it still doesn't stay firm. Additionally, now the foam in the left arm rest has become detached from the base. This is inside the upholstery, so now the cushion moves around. I have tried to contact RESPAWN 3 times now in the past 1.5 weeks and no one is responding to me.  I try to look for the AMAZON customer service here and there is no contact information either. I just want a new arm rest that doesn't move.  Otherwise I'm going to return the chair.  I was willing to give this product a chance, and I even liked it so far, but support from both AMAZON and RESPAWN are lacking or non-existent.  Only option is return.  No contact information to talk to a representative or a person.  Extremely frustrating...especially considering I'm using this product for a home office.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1586736000000}
{"reviewTitle":"2023 Faze version, major design flaw, cannot assemble without damaging cover","reviewDescription":"Be aware: the reviews listed here actually appear to be for multiple models that they all call \"110\" over different years.  The pictures clearly show different styles between, say, 2019 and 2023.  I purchased 2023 Faze.  I thought it would be good because the reviews average 4.2 out of 5.  The 2023 Faze version, at least, has a severe design flaw not apparent in the photo.  On the backrest, the headrest is actually a separate piece you have to attach with screws (fine), then zip the extremely tight covering back over it (impossible on the chair I received, the zipper broke during this attempt).  If you search \"zipper\" in the reviews, several people have had this problem.  I don't know if we all won the unlucky chair lottery or what, but this seems a terrible design.  There seems to be a video in the photos regarding this, but did not match my chair, it was not realistic for the experience I had trying to zip the cover closed.  They also say to \"carefully\" or \"use care\" three times while demonstrating it - hey, if you have to say it 3 times, I think you know you have a bad design.  It is so tight that even had I not broken the zipper trying to zip the covering closed, I can't imagine that the sheer strain upon it during use, because of how impossibly tight this cover is, would not have caused the zipper to split apart later.  Respawn should really design the back of this chair in ONE SOLID PIECE that THEY cover with a covering that is of an appropriate size to not rip due to the tightness.  I will be returning this for a refund; I only hope my review will stay up as a warning to others.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706918400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not easy to assemble at all - expect to spend an hour; no product support","reviewDescription":"I just got the chair this morning.  It was delivered in a large box to my front door.  The box weighed over 50 lbs, so I had to \"walk\" it into my house.  I see where people said that assembly took 10 minutes.  Nonsense! It takes at least that long just to unpack the box and the boxes inside the larger box.  Each of the pieces is individually wrapped.  The assembly instructions are IKEA-like (no words) and poor graphics.  It took me about an hour to assemble it and I am totally accustomed to assembling stuff.  One of the pictures was totally backwards, showing levers on the wrong side.  There were no directions for the pillows, one of which arrived damaged (popped zipper).  Two different sizes of allen wrenches were included and you have to figure out which allen wrench goes with what screw.  Also, mounting the back onto the base is a 2-person job.  It can be done by one person, I suppose (I didn't try), but it took some effort with 2 people (my wife held it in place while I screwed it in).  So don't listen to these people who said that it only took 10 minutes to assemble it.  Expect to spend an hour, at least.  One nice thing is that part P seems to have some spare parts - washers, bolts, etc.As far as the chair itself goes, I obviously cannot speak to the durability of it, but it seems to be fairly comfortable.  The \"leg rest\" seems odd, only worthwhile if you want to lay back in the chair for a nap or something.  It does not fold down to support your feet while sitting.  But the chair seems functional.I am asking the vendor for a replacement pillow.  I will update this review when\/if they respond.Update: The vendor told me that the pillow cannot be replaced - they have no replacement parts.  So I must either live without the pillow or return the chair.  The chair really cannot be disassembled, as far as I can tell.  Once the seat is on the base, that is it.  Game over.I managed to get some support from Amazon on this, but not from the vendor.  Not recommended, unless you like spending a long time on the phone and online.  The vendor is very frustrating to deal with.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1641600000000}

I spent close to 30 minutes getting the headrest assembled. This was due to the headrest sitting higher than it should have due to poorly drilled guide holes. Even though the holes were only off by about 1\/4 of an inch, zipping the headrest into the chair took 2 people and a lot of pressing a zipper together while moving the zipper centimeters at a time.The leg that you have to attach to the chair was also not cut precisely, and I had to shave 1-2 millimeters off the plastic to get it to sit and lock in.Overall, a 20-30 minute assembly ended up taking about an hour and 30 minutes.Chair is pretty comfy though.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1670544000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Wish I could say it was better","reviewDescription":"Bought this chair after my last one gave out, wanted something new because I always had office chairs before, was great for like the first week and then I started noticing the cracks in the armor. Very easy to assemble, but after about a week the padding on the armrests started to flatten and would form back to it's normal shape, I also had to re-tighten the arms multiple times because they would come loose very easily, the back rest started to make crack noises and move back when I would lean against it after like 3 days, almost felt like I was breaking it. Could be do to my weight but idk, lighter people will probably do way better in this chair than me, and I'm not even that much overweight, loved the leg rest feature and the pillows it cam with got the job done, but sitting in the chair after a long time did cause my butt to go numb, could be just my problem though. So basically, if you weigh more than the average person and plan on spending a very long time in this chair each day gaming, it won't last.

Firstly, the backrest lock lever is a bit awkward seeing as how you have to push it down to lock it instead of pulling up on the lever. It feels a tad unnatural but not a deal breaker. Secondly, the rods that extend for the foot rest fit loosely in the support on the bottom of the chair so they rattle a little but not too bad. Although it feels as though if you put too much pressure on the footrest, it may break off. (probably shouldn't be trying to stand on it anyways, but that's beside the point. So in all the chair is comfy and assembles easily. Love it for the value. Lastly, this is my biggest issue: the chair's footrest arrived broken. Now this may be a packaging or shipping issue and I understand that. However, the footrest can be replaced and I asked both amazon and the manufacturer would not send me just the footrest. I did not want to have to send the entire chair that I just unboxed and assembled back. So I am disappointed that I cannot just replace the footrest as it was not my fault that it arrived broken so I will have to live with it. But I will notate that they offered a full refund which i appreciate but in the long run, is just a pain in the butt.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1575936000000}

One person can do it in about 20 or 30 minutes- Nice features... lumbar and neck cushions, pull out leg rest- Fairly pricedCons:- Cheaply machined threads that bolts screw into.  Use extreme caution when attaching bolts, making sure everything threads evenly.  If a bolt gets cross threaded, it will destroy the internal threads and will not hold tight.- Questionable design on seat bottom.  While the seat back can recline, the seat bottom does not rock or recline at all.  This can easily be an annoyance if you are used to a desk chair where the seat bottom can rock and recline (as I have unfortunately found out).- Only 2 bolts securing side arms to chair (1 bolt in seat bottom and 1 bolt in seat back).  This raises questions on sustained durability over time (I can feel a slight wobble on mine because of this).

I needed to have my feet up while using the computer and this feature was the reason I purchased the chair.  It is a useless feature, and I found that a regular footstool kept my legs up higher than the \"leg rests\" that came with the chair.

The bolts etc were in an unopened blister pack.(Maybe that sounds like silly thing to be bothered about - but it's a bad first impression and just makes me view the product negatively from the get-go)Assembly was straightforward, just Allen wrench stuff, but once done the back seemed to lean slightly to one side.The \"foot rest\" may work for some people, but it's more of an uncomfortable leg support for anyone over 4 feet tall.Since it tucks under the front of the seat, it can cause problems when I go to stand up because I can't get my feet far enough under myself to push backwards - maybe that's just me.Head and lumbar support pillows just kind of attach loosely with clicky elastic straps and the manual doesn't show how to do it properly - which is an issue for the lumbar one , I ended up criss-crossing the straps and it held pretty well.The head one was uncomfortable and I removed it, the lumbar one is so so.The material is pretty robust and seemed well put together, I didn't really notice any strong smell from it.Sitting in it is reasonably comfortable so far but somewhat stiff - it certainly wasn't an \"ah, this is nice\" moment when I first sat down.I haven't sat in it for a really long period of time yet, but even after a hour or so I could feel it getting hot but not to the point of discomfort.Reclining is a bit different to other chairs - the seat doesn't seem to tilt at all, just the back part moves.It feels a bit odd if you're used to tipping back in your chair.For the couple of hours a day I plan to use it for, it's serviceable and unless something fails in the return period I'll probably hang onto it.If I was looking for something to use for hours on end every day, I'd probably look for something better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1562889600000}

Shipping was fast and the chair was easy to assemble. I raised the chair all the way up and sat down. First thing I notices was the seat is not as cushy as I was lead to believe. I don't have a lot of padding on my backside naturally, so I tend to need a little more. The top side of the chair was the perfect size for my upper body and the lumbar support was decently adjustable. The neck pillow however was not adjustable, there are only two spots it can go and neither are in a comfortable position, which doesn't make sense considering the rest of the chair is perfect for my body. Unfortunately all of my height is in my legs and even at the top the chair is a little too short. The arms sit about 1\" below the top of my desk , which makes for very uncomfortable game play. Next I tested out the levers. The height adjustment was just in reach, which means if you want it all the way up you have to stand up first. The recline adjustment I have to bend over the side of the chair for, which makes getting it to just the desired angle much more difficult than it needs to be.Instead of making it so I can sit at the computer longer, this chair makes things worse.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1603238400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good chair for the money not much support for people over 200+ lbs","reviewDescription":"The RESPAWN 110 Ergonomic Gaming Chair with Footrest Recliner is a good chair for the money, but it may not be the best fit for everyone. While the chair is designed to be ergonomic and comfortable, it may not provide enough support for people over 200+ lbs. This can be a major drawback for some users who require more support and cushioning.Additionally, I have noticed that my chair now makes a loud thump when I get in or out of it, which can be quite distracting. This is not something that I had experienced when I first got the chair, and it's disappointing to see that it has developed this issue.Overall, I would rate the RESPAWN 110 Ergonomic Gaming Chair with Footrest Recliner a 3\/5. While it is a good chair for the price, the lack of support for heavier users and the issue with the loud thump make it difficult to recommend. If you are looking for an affordable gaming chair and don't weigh over 200+ lbs, this chair may be worth considering, but if you are a heavier user or require more support, you may want to look elsewhere.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679875200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not so good for those not as mobile. Fix footrest","reviewDescription":"The chair itself looks great. I spent hours narrowing down this purchase.  I chose this one over other options for these main reasons: (1) high ratings\/reviews, (2) sturdy looking arms, (3) reported as able to hold more body weight, (4) looked well padded, (5) adjustable features, and (6) built in foot rest.However, the foot rest proved very disappointing for me.  I am wondering if the designer might consider having the padded portion open in the opposite direction than it is currently designed.  Having to push out the bar in itself proved challenging, but somehow, I managed to get that far. Subsequently, after such extension, the next step includes flipping the padded portion out prior to positioning your legs.  If you watch the little demo video they have included, notice how they conveniently left out that part.  The model lady carefully shows you how it's done while she is standing upright.  It is not extended when she takes a seat in the chair.  There is a video scene gap right before it shows her comfortably reclined. I believe that is omitted because of the ackwardness of how one must unfold the footrest while sitting in the chair.  I am not physically able to accomplish this feat!Don't get me wrong.  I really  enjoy the extra padded seat while working at the computer for several hours straight now (stay at home orders still in place).  However, I wanted to be like the model in the picture after done with work and just stretch out and unwind.  Thus with that not possible, my overall rating for the chair now changes from a 5 star to a 3.  Sorry!  Let me know if you would like to trade out the foot rest for one designed to flip open in the opposite direction.  Great chair in concept, but not in design at this point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1591142400000}

THE ISSUE WITH THIS PRODUCT IS THE HARDWARE OR PARTS NEEDED TO ASSEMBLE THE CHAIR. The assembly can be done by yourself with one or two beads of sweat to show for it. The reason I am giving Respawn 110 Gaming Chair 2 stars is because you will need to go to your closest hardware store to buy 3 crucial missing parts.

This chair provides key support when I am spending long hours online. The right size for a computer desk. Rolls around the room effortlessly. I am pleased with my RESPAWN. Feels secure not wobbly as some. Ordered the color red keeping me focused while I am in my hot seat so to speak. This is the seat I get things done in. I like it because unlike many others the RESPAWN has full arm rests, an important feature because as I am working I am also relaxing. Made the right choice with this product I tell you, certainly shopped around for a long time before moving forward with this purchase. My thoughts were if I am to be spending so much time in my gaming chair it better be the right one. Does all that it says it does. I did however place coasters on it and a heating pad that gives a massage.

My back is in terrible pain after about 5 hours of usage and my elbow is in pain.

This COULD just be that this chair was used as a quality control model, but it could also mean it's a return.The chairs' cylinder was in perfect condition though (if that had been scratched I would not have assembled it).So I'm going back to my cheap Serta microfiber chair.This chair is going into storage until my 7 year old is big enough for it.I'm not returning it because:a) I knew it was a gamble given my arms and legs are is slightly out of proportion to the norm.b) I REALLY do not want to take the thing apart without damaging it and putting it back in the box which is ripped to shreds, then dealing with returns.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1600041600000}

This was purchased to help me work from home and to be a treat for my back.

I don't smoke, don't have pets, don't have anything that would damage the fake leather, but it is still falling apart on the arm rests.That stinks, but even worse so, is the wobble of the chair. So the arm rests (yet again the pain point) don't fully fit flush with the back and seating cushion. What that means is that if i am sitting down and move my arm rest, it literall wobbles from left to right around 5 centimeters. I have tried on various occasions to take the bolts out, reseat the arm rests, and nothing has fixed it. It has been this since day 1 of having this chair.On top of this, if you think the footrest is a good thing, it isn't. It really is useless. Because of the weight distribution and the leverage that you are putting upon the footrest, it doesn't really feel stable. Mine at least works (seems like a lot of people have their broken).

The backrest lay in an angle, not straight. The bottom bracket is fixed and was placed on the chair off-centered making the backrest crooked. The ink that was used to color the material comes off and bleeds on your arm or any skin that touches the material. This is very concerning. What type of dye did they use? It's bleeds thick and dries quickly. Moving on... The seat is not at all comfortable they need much more Cushing if you are to play a game for 30 minutes it might work for you. However, if you try and play battle royal for 6 + hours than this chair is a no go. I had to purchase a seat cushion to make this comfortable for long games. The lumbar support and neck support that is included is not great neither. The lumbar support looks as though it's been through a ringer. Flat and not as it came out if the box. Once your body warms it up it becomes flat. No support for lumbar. I in turn purchased a lumbar support for it. Ok let's move on the installation is very easy and the wheels are great. That's all the positive I have for it. The foot rests or leg rest is not that great. I weigh 215lbs  at 6\u20193\u201d tall. I feel as the foot rest may break. Pretty good design guys.

Then I have one day that I work remotely and spend about 8 hours in it.1. Chair leans forward.  No tilt adjustment means I constantly feel like it wan't me to roll forward.  Not a huge deal but I think this is more because of how quickly the chairs padding became... flat.2. Arms wobble.  You can tighten them up, but they never get snug to the point of being stable.  Numerous people complained about this but it isn't huge in my book.3. Padding is pretty well non existent.  When I first got the chair the padding was sufficient, yet after a few months of use, the padding lost its lift\/expansion.  Because of this the seat is minimally comfortable at best.  Additionally, the lumbar pillow that comes with this also quickly becomes compressed and doesn't really help any more.  I've had a few back surgeries so the seat and back padding was pretty significant in my opinion and a large reason for the unfavorable review.4.  Lastly, the leg rest that stores under the chair feels flimsy when you pull it out - I never use it because of that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1544054400000}

I have had the chair for less than a year, and it really doesn't see that much use.  It really disappointing, as I otherwise like the chair.

Well first, it showed up in a completely wrecked box and had some minor damage, but it was really easy to assemble and was up and running quickly. The seat is permanently leaning forward, which makes it feel like you are constantly sliding off of it. Because of the terrible arm design, you can't adjust the armrests at all. And aside from the general discomfort, this is the noisest chair I have ever owned. It's constantly making pops, loud pings, and creaks, and no amount of white lithium seems to help. On top of all of that, I can't even send it for a refund because the box is destroyed, and that stupid air compressor thing that allows you to raise and lower it is stuck in both the chair and the wheel section, and I would have to destroy it to get it apart.

It was not until its components were placed together by blind monks who had no comprehension of the concept for comfort or ergonomics that it could begin to perform its terrible works, gaining some form of consciousness founded only upon suffering, and the unceasing desire to inflict misery upon as many human souls as possible. The footrest? Bends badly, making you slide forward. The clips for the cushions? Made with the most brittle plastics from components gathered from the most miserable places on earth. The cushions themselves? Impossible objects, that manage to be painfully firm while not offering enough support all at once.

I am open to suggestions if someone knows how to repair damage such as this.Also, I feel like I have to mention that the folks who wrote reviews about the hardware missing nuts were simply assembling the chair incorrectly. The metal flange on the top piece has threaded holes. It is supposed to slip inside the metal potion on the bottom piece (not outside).

The adjustable headrest and lumbar support were not exactly what I expected, but they work well and are quite comfortable, so no real complaints there.  Just be aware that they are held in place by elastic straps, and you adjust them by sliding them up or down until they're where you want them.  My only real complaint is the seat cushion itself.  It's sort of thin, so after a bit, you feel like you're sitting on a board.  In my case, I can work around it, since I'm supposed to get up and move around every couple of hours, and the discomfort really encourages this, believe me.

The hex wrench they included was also pretty niffty as it had a pointed hex shape. After completion, a few downsides became immeadiately apparent. For one, the arms although moving with the reclining feature, were wobbly even only a few hours after use. Not bad though as I imagine they are intended this way. The footrest is also kinda of a pain, especially for my dad, since it really requires you to move you legs and bend down to pull out the footrest, kinda hard for those with spondolosis and nephropathy.As a product, its great for what it is.

Good center of balance even when fully reclined and the wheels are perfect--smooth enough to move around with a bit of force from your feet but they hold steady when leaning on your desk or gaming so you don't move around too much.UPDATE: So after about a year of having this chair, the bolts have started to loosen so the arm rests wobble.

{"reviewTitle":"Wobbles After 1 Year","reviewDescription":"The chair itself looks great and feels great. However, after nearly a year of owning this, I'm getting pretty concerned about its stability. When I first assembled the chair, everything was very stable, but over time I'm now seeing:1. the central pole wobbles back and forth to the point where you can feel the chair tilt forward\/backwards by 1-2\"2. One of the arms will wobble nearly 2\" while the other wobbles ~1\"3. The lumbar support pillow is nearly flatFor some frame of reference, I'm 6'2\" and 175 lbs, and I use this chair quite a bit as someone that games a lot and does a lot of software development at home.Also of note - the footrest is kind of difficult to use. The poles it is on don't slide out super well, then you have to flip the rest up between them. It doesn't have great support, it's literally just two metal beams with a rotatable piece between them. When I've used it (which is honestly kind of hard to do at a desk), I tend to not extend the rest fully since I'm a bit concerned the metal might bend.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1590537600000}

Assembly was simple and straight forward. First use was great, the chair was comfortable and sturdy; but after a few months of use the right arm wobbles, and the back creeks when i lean back. What made me write a review was the seat cushion. I am not a big guy (155 lbs male) and i am not sure what padding they use, but it is completely deflated and feels like i am sitting on hard wood making it very uncomfortable. In fact i have grabbed one of my wife's thinner couch pillows and i have put that on the chair for some sort of padding. this is coming from a guy who had lower spinal fusion...it hurts a lot. The lower back padding might as well not be there, its completely deflated also. I refuse to use the neck pillow because it forces my head forward and in uncomfortable..but both those are optional to use. The leg rest is nice when i want to lean back to watch movies, but i do wish the leg rest could bend and lock instead of come straight out. If the seat padding was better and arm rests were sturdy i would recommend. If you have the money to spend, find a better chair....tight budget this will work, just have a pillow to use also.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1568851200000}

I recently tightened the screws, and only a week or two after doing so, the right armrest became even looser and wobblier than it was before tightening. I'm not sure why. The piston also completely collapsed, leaving no upward adjustment. Those three things led me to replace this chair with a Dowinx, which was about twice as expensive but basically similar chair.I did use the recline feature often both for desk use and movie watching. One thing I liked about the RESPAWN-110 is that the backrest was infinitely positionable, while the Dowinx's is not (it has gear teeth).I didn't use the footrest much since the chair did not go low enough below my desk to allow room for my legs on it.I would say the chair served me well enough for the $140 I paid if it had lasted 4+ years rather than the 2 I kept it for.

If you\u2019re buying this chair for gaming just know you probably won\u2019t ever recline or use the footstool. I thought they were nice touches but at the end of the day are unnecessary for anything other than relaxed casual gaming. To that point I would like to add that after 6 months all of the padding and cushion has completely flattened out. No longer is it soft and form fitting but rather like sitting on a hard squished sponge. After about an hour or so I find my tushy to be sore and my elbows\/forearms stinging. The arm rests also wobble significantly side to side I should note it was like that since day one and Is double checked that I had it assembled correctly and tightened fully. Moving around in the chair and shifting weight causes horrible creaking and cracking sounds, nothing damaging just audibly uncomfortable and turns heads.

The foam (stuffing material) on the seat went flat, granted if I was close to the max supported weight for the chair I wouldn't be bothered, but I am 162 pounds, which is 100 pounds or so lower than the max weight for the chair. The loss of padding causes you to butt slide forward on the chair and put your back in a horrible curved position, also uncomfortable bottom due to no padding. The chair rocks when not at absolute bottom height, the leg extension sags. The best feature is the recline lock that gives out under a moderate yawn and stretch and you find yourself on the floor after going a&& over t1ts backwards defeating the supposed anti tip over feature.If you are looking for a 3 month chair, then great buy.

At this price I can buy 3 for the cost of a basic real leather chair. I use this for sitting in front of my computer in my man cave. I liked the armrests that moved as you recline. When I assembled it the left armrest was looser than the right. I was worried that I had stripped the threads or the threaded insert. After closer examination, it seemed like the insert that the bolt threads into was a shallower depth than the right arm. I just used one of the extra washers that came with it, (a nice feature), and put the washer between the arm and the chair before inserting the bolt. Voila! It tightened up nicely! Granted, it is not as stable as a non-moveable armrest, but it needs the ability to pivot too. Time will tell how this holds up, but it comfortable and functional right now. Update: Foam padding has taken a permanent compression where my elbows and butt sit in less than a year. I can feel staples under the foam on the armrests. The seams are already starting to split.

So let me get right to the point.Construction is great. The \"leather\" feels soft and similar to premium car leather. The plastics are thick and solid. The metal is thick steel and painted with durable black paint. It's a solid product. The base is very heavy duty. The wheels we're the only thing I question a bit. Felt a bit like cheap plastic wheels. They do work well and I don't have any real complaints on them, but they were the only thing that did not feel quite as solid.Putting it together was easy. The instructions are basic but a little common sense does the trick. If your stuck, they have a great website with videos, automated help, and easy to use contact solution to let them know if you need help.The foot rest is cool. With a slight or more recline it feels good to have something to put your feet up on. It can feel a little wobbly but it's sturdy and isn't going to break. The wobble is really the entire chair moving, as all office chairs do.The arms do have some give in them. I think the reason is because when you recline, the arms fold back with you so that you have arm rests while reclined. It's cool actually. But because the arms need to move, there is some give in them if you really put a lot of weight on them. However, don't confuse that with it not being sturdy. Even with the give, your not going to break them unless you put 300 pounds all on one arm rest. They are stable.The head rest pillow is a bit overkill but some might like it. The limbar pillow is definitely appreciated. My lumbar pillow came with a broken clip. Their support has been easy so far and I assume I will get a replacement. If not, it's prime and Amazon always takes care of the customer. I'm not worried about it.There is a smell to the leather. It's normal with new leather and pleather products. Couches have it right from the manufacturer and new cars have to as well. It goes away over a week or so. It's like that new car smell.The support seems to be great! Intuitive website allows you to ask for help and they get back to you quickly. Also, if you get it on Amazon with prime, they also take care of you if the seller will not. But so far, I haven't even had to talk to Amazon for my small clip issue.Don't listen to the people on here with their negative reviews. I could talk about fat trolls in moms basements, but I will instead say that gamers are an interesting breed.

{"reviewTitle":"New to Racer Chairs","reviewDescription":"This review is more for anyone who is debating about buying their first racer style chair. This is my first time experience with them as well outside of office chairs.Right off the bat the comfort of this chair is amazing. On my longest days I sit in this chair for about 6-8 hours. You can imagine how much a good chair means to people who sit for long periods of time with work or gaming. I typically play games stream\/edit videos which takes a lot of time. My previous chair I could sit for about 2-3 hours a day before my back would begin to hurt. Even with proper posture I had to limit myself to keep from injury. Immediately after using this chair I can feel a huge difference. My back no longer hurts even after sitting for long periods of time. I've found though, if you sit consistently for that amount of time your butt may become sore, however that is more likely just from the lack of moving rather than the chair itself. As when I make sure to move every now and then, I have no problems.The reclining feature for this chair is very good. I never feel like I'm going to lean too far back and fall. The footrest is a little weird at first because it doesn't really hold your feet up. As a 5'9 person myself I find the rest to be at about my lower calves. No complaints about it being uncomfortable however. The arm rests also feel very nice and they recline with the chair.The material of the chair also feels really nice. It doesn't feel super cheap or like it will wear and tear fast. Even in a hot room while sitting, it doesn't feel super sticky.This chair is perfect for a large set up or small one. I personally have a smaller desk set up and this chair fits exactly how I need it to.The only complaint about this chair, which is a personal opinion, is the pillows. You receive two small pillows for your head and lower back. Personally I found no use for them as my back does fine with the chair on its own. Being 5'9 the headrest pillow was more so pushing my head too far foreword that it was uncomfortable. It rest around mid of my head. The lower pillow which is for your lower back I did not enjoy either. Perhaps if you like to sit more foreword in your chair you wouldn't mind this. I like to sit fully back into my chair so the little pillow pushed me foreword enough where my back had no support. Other than this, I have zero complaints about this chair.

It was the cheapest chair there (but about $70), and, at the time, it seemed to tick all the boxes for what I needed. A couple of months later, I began working my day job from home, as well as another roughly 40 hours a week doing my second \"job,\" solo game development.I ended up spending about 16 hours a day in that chair... upwards of 20... and I paid the price for it. I ended up with Hip Bursitis, and I've been walking with a cane for the last month or so, healing up.Obviously, the chair wasn't fully to blame. I should've taken more stretch breaks, excersized more, etc... Fast forward to the end of November (Right before the Hip Bursitis struck) and I mentioned to my mother that I was shopping for a chair. She ended up offering to buy me one for a Christmas present, and I decided to go with this Respawn Chair, primarily because of the inclusion of the FOOT REST (to put my leg up and stretch out throughout the day).When I got the chair, I was blown away. easy to put together, fantastic materials, and just head and shoulders above my old chair (granted, my old chair was the cheapest one I could find brand new).I am SO glad I upgraded. I love my new chair. A few days after purchasing, however, I cracked the Foot Rest a tiny bit. The jury is still out on whose fault it was.... but office chairs are pricey, and I figured I would take a stab at getting a replacement part.When I sent in the form to possibly get the Foot Rest part replaced, I was replied to immediately.

{"reviewTitle":"Great chair, if you seldom use it.","reviewDescription":"I tend to hold off on doing reviews as soon as I get the product. I\u2019ve now had the chair a little over 30 days. At first thoughts, this chair is great for the value. It reclines, the seat is padded, has extra support that is able to be added and removed. Not to mention it has a foot stool that comes off from under the chair so you\u2019re able to fully relax. I found being able to recline fully the best benefit to this chair.Now the reasons why this chair did not get a 4-5 star. Quality begins to deteriorate extremely fast. A couple weeks into ownership I kept having to adjust the height. Which at first thought, I assumed I kept moving the chair by accident or forgot that I moved it. Well, as of recently I\u2019ve literally felt the chair lower in height. Thankfully currently it doesn\u2019t go below a certain point.Next, the seat is as some have described very padded but wears out quick. I attached a photo of how the cushion is starting to mirror how I sit. I weigh about 200lbs so maybe this would vary depending on your weight.Also, the head pillow seems too bulky. I haven\u2019t been able to find a comfortable spot.Lastly, the arms and leg stool do not feel sturdy. I would say if you were sitting in the chair with the stool extended, and if a child sits on that portion it would probably snap off as the way it attaches to the chair is not the strongest way to do so. The arms wobble from left to right.If this chair didn\u2019t suffer from long term durability concerns I would definitely be giving this a 4 or 5. At this time I\u2019m debating rather or not to return the chair, or to contact the manufacturer for replacement parts. The pump that supports the chair will definitely need to be replaced since it\u2019s loosing its height.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1589760000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Get what you pay for","reviewDescription":"So I'm going to start with some positive highlights for this chair:The style is very clean, very cool looking chair and offers some pillows for 'lumbar support'.The smell that the chair gives out when you first open it isn't as bad as everyone says it is, just smells like new car leather. I opened the packaging and luckily everything was in the box that I needed and nothing was broken. Assembling the chair was extremely easy and fast, since the pictures and tools are labeled and the video amazon provided helps. I was able to use my chair within 30 minutes.Now I have had my chair  a little over a week and I found the chair to be pretty uncomfortable. The main butt padding is not dense at all. After sitting in it for an hour or two while gaming I start to move around more often and then numbing starts to take over. So, I recline my chair and open the foot rest to making myself a little more comfortable (Mind you I am 5'9 and about 190 lbs.). While reclined all the way back and legs fully extended, my heels hang off the leg pad so it causes strain in my lower back, unless I bend my knees and rest my foot on the leg pad. The back padding is just as bad as the main seat pad, After a while the padding will wear out and I am uncomfortable again and find myself moving in this chair to find a comfortable position.As for the arm rests, like every other review, the arms rests wiggle side to side even when you first build the chair and tighten the screws all the way on, so that is an issue that Respawn needs to fix.The only thing that saves this chair from getting a one star is how fast it is to put together. I have had it for a week and it is already causing some issues and padding is not of good quality. I will give it another week or two to see what else happens before returning it. You're better off investing in a more expensive chair with guaranteed dense padding.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1587081600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Sadly, not the awesome chair I was hoping it'd be","reviewDescription":"I'm 6' tall and 260lbs, so I was excited to read reviews that the back of the chair would fit my height, and that the weight capacity would support me for this price.  Those two things were true HOWEVER the padding in the seat part itself didn't support my weight at all! Very uncomfortable after about 20 minutes. Like sitting on plywood. Thankfully the chair went together very easily and came back apart easily, as I'm sending it back after only 5 hours of use. The arm rests made my arms numb and my elbows sore after about 2 hours  of just sitting regularly. I like the shape of them compared to some of the convex shaped pads other chairs offer, but still uncomfortable. And just like the description says, you can't adjust them, which might have helped significantly! The casters and wheels are nice on my wood floor, giving enough to move, but not enough that I'm struggling to stay in place. The seat back is very comfortable, and I love being able to tilt back and lock the seat in any position, but that's all that's good about it. The footrest (calf rest in my case) isn't that bad, but I feel as though the chair seat dips forward slightly while it's out.  It's also a little wobbly for my liking, but does support my legs comfortably enough and if I sit forward with the leg rest tucked away, I can comfortably cross my legs and lean forward without hitting it.I could tell after 5 hours that it was a crap chair overall. I would read the other reviews and decide for yourself if the cons we all mentioned are things that you can live with. If so, enjoy!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1602288000000}

The back of chair is crooked dibs back and to the left, and the right arm of chair doesnt assemble all the way making it lose cause of defect or damage, the cushion of the back of chair is not damaged its just uncomfortable and very bad design, its only comfortable if you reclining it almost all the way back.

Amazon gave me 20% refund cause of damage or defect, i would of returned it but you need pipe wrench and rubber hammer to dissassamble it and plus it had a lite chemical smell and i used baking soda and white vinger, it got the smell out but you see the baking soda in the creases. Im guessing the respawn version 1.0 is good and version 2.0 the one i bought, well they should discontinue it, even it mine didnt come damage, the back is so uncomfortable and cause me back pain.

{"reviewTitle":"Major upgrade","reviewDescription":"I had purchased a gaming chair from another retailer before this one. But it did not sit straight when put together and actually broke in less than 6 months.This one is very different. The arm rests have actual cushion, and are not just a hard foam covered in harder plastic. There are no 'wing' on the sides to break. The seat is thicker with more cushion. The underside of the leg rest is completely supported by hard plastic.  And it was actually straight and lined up when put together. The legs with wheels also bend down and in so the base won't get in the way should I ever need to load it into a truck and move it. And the arms attach to both the seat and back for more stability. The arm rests also have a pivot that allows them to come back with the chair when it leans reclines! It gives me somewhere to rest my elbows if I use the chair with a game console instead of my PC! My old chair had stationary arms that wouldn't move, and stayed way up by my knees when the chair was reclined.I was pretty nervous about getting another gaming chair after that cheap one broke so easily. So I browsed negative and 1-star reviews and many of them seemed to have similar problems - including this one. But I noticed none of them had \"exchanged\" for a new chair before writing the review, and the ratio of negative views was very low, so they could have just been an occasional bad chair that makes it out now and then. So I took a chance, and don't regret it! Now my back just needs time to adjust to a straight chair, again!UPDATED: It felt great! At first. But just over a year in and the \"brake\" for the back support, that releases to allow it to lean back, seems to be broken. I had it upright today and just leaned against it, and the brake released, and the back of the chair slammed backwards! Looking for a new one, now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1576627200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Might work for some, definitely didn\u2019t work for me...","reviewDescription":"This was a difficult review mostly because chairs are subjective and not everyone is going to have the same experience. I\u2019m 5\u20197 at 220lbs and I find this to be one of the most uncomfortable chairs I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of sitting in. I believe this chair would benefit someone who is taller. The area behind my knees hurts pretty badly after sitting in this chair for a couple of hours gaming. My lower back tends to hurt as the back of the chair doesn\u2019t seem to have very good back support, in my opinion. Lastly, my buttocks suffer the most as the cushion on this chair doesn\u2019t hold the same firmness as it once did.Some might argue that I need to see a chiropractor and while that might be true, I\u2019ve used the Markus chair from IKEA which is a great chair for my body type but the seat padding was too thin and after a couple of hours you could feel the hardware beneath the cushion. I\u2019ve also used a Tempur-Pedic chair from Staples and while that one had the best seat cushion it lacked good back support as the mesh was flimsy and loosened over time.So back to this chair, aesthetically it looks nice but if you\u2019re looking for something that looks cool, that says \u201cI\u2019m a gamer\u201d then go for this chair. If you\u2019re looking for something comfortable for long hours of work or gaming, I recommend you pass on this one. Again for some, depending on body type this might work for you but the quality of the chair you can feel just after using for a few hours, weeks and months that it won\u2019t hold up for long over time. I\u2019ve had it now for 3 months and I regret this purchase.I hope this helps anyone who was undecided about purchasing this chair. My recommendation is to spend more on a better, more comfortable chair if you\u2019ll be sitting for long hours.

{"reviewTitle":"Started great, but the quality is subpar in the long run","reviewDescription":"When I initially got this chair I was in love with it. The look is great, it's comfortable, and the included back and neck pillows are a great plus. However, in the following months I started to notice multiple faults.For one, I noticed the left arm was loose. I couldn't actually determine why, because the screws were tight as could be, and the right arm had no such issues. Then, I noticed that the whole back of the chair tends to get loose as well if you use the reclining function frequently. This isn't as big of a deal, as you can tighten it back up fairly easily, but it's irritating to have to keep an allen key on my desk just for that.There are two bigger issues though: the first being that the heights of the arms are off. For some reason, the upper screw hole is higher on the right arm than on the left, so the whole right arm is always higher up than the left. This seriously interferes with keeping proper posture, and can cause real pain over long periods. The second big problem is the attached photo. I've had this chair for less than 6 months. Last week, the left arm developed a crack in the faux leather. A few days later, the crack grew exponentially and started pealing right off.I expected since this chair is at the upper end of the \"budget\" gaming chairs available here that I'd be able to at least get a year or two out of it, but honestly I'm probably going to end up having to replace it within the next few months at the rate things are going. I couldn't recommend this chair, or anything else from this manufacturer based on my experience. The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the features you generally wouldn't get from a similar cheap desk chair, such as reclining and the included pillows.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1597795200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Had some manufacturing issues","reviewDescription":"Overall the chair is...alright. The construction instructions were not great, but manageable with a degree of patience. However it took awhile to get it all together (and no small degree of swearing), however one thing patience did not help, was the fact the lower lumbar pillow for my chair came in with a defect. One of the straps being far shorter than it should be (and without the ability to adjust it's length), so it will not attach to the chair properly. When I contacted respawn customer support about this asking for a replacement lumbar pillow, as sitting without it can make certain positions less comfortable (like when using the foot rest).... they essentially just passed me back to amazon without really much of a second glance. Told me I'd need to disassemble and send back the entire chair to amazon, after I spent two hours putting it together. All for one pillow when the rest of the actual chair works fine. So I'd lose the time I spent putting it together, the time to take it back apart, and the time spent shipping out and waiting for a replacement to put back together again. No thank you. So I'm currently just using the chair without the lower pillow, which is not great. For how pricey the chair is, you think they would put a little more effort into the manufacturing to avoid things like this, or have better customer support. Not thrilled. Using the chair for now, but unless something changes I don't think I'd buy from them again, and wouldn't be likely to recommend them either.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1618099200000}

I\u2019ve been sitting in it every day for work for three months, and this chair is absolute garbage.  This was my worst office furniture purchase of the entire pandemic!  I\u2019ve had to retighten the socket head cap screws four times since I put this piece of junk together.  The seat cushion has flattened, I\u2019ve started to get a few areas the pleather pealing.  The only good thing about this will be the space it takes up in the dumpster in which  I throw this chair.Previous post:As a mechanical engineer, one of the key concepts taught in my first year in college was to design the product for longevity, manufacturability, and assembly.  As you can see from the pictures, this was not done.  Basically, what should have taken me 10 minutes to put the chair together, instead took 45 minutes because I had to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to pop in those three socket head cap screws.  It also meant that I had to take the seat cushion off of the seat mount, attach the seat mount to the back (with said needle nosed pliers) then reattach the seat to the mount.Fast forward a few days of use.  It\u2019s ok for comfort, but not really all that great.  It could be much better, but it\u2019s not.  The arm rests are mostly comfortable, but a little too high for my desk, so that\u2019s a problem.  Speaking of the arm rests, they are unnecessarily wobbly and yes, I\u2019ve tightened down the SHCS properly.But the smell!  Oh my gosh the Oder is awful.  I\u2019ve used soapy water, baby wipes, (not vinegar and water yet) but the Oder is really terrible.

Every time, I got a shipping notice, followed by a message that the order couldn't be fulfilled. A normal person would have given up. But I was soooooo tired of reading reviews for chairs, and didn't want to go though the process of looking for a new one. So I just kept ordering until one finally shipped. It was like a month before my bank account looked normal again, after all of the pending and reversed charges.BUT. That's all ok. Because once the chair arrived, I LOVED it. I don't actually like the way gaming chairs look. I think they look like the furniture equivalent to tribal tattoos. This one kinda grew on me, though. It's comfortable enough that I don't notice that it looks like the seat of a spaceship that was designed by Vin Diesel.Well, after a year and a half with this chair, I have to revoke my positive-ish review. A few months in, the chair lift cylinder started giving out, and the chair started inching down. This really sucks, because my desk is pretty high. I talked to the company, and they sent me a new cylinder with no problem. Unfortunately, for the life of me, I couldn't get the old one out to replace it. I tried WD-40, a rubber mallet... I followed every tutorial I could find, and it was just stuck in tight. So I've had to deal with just adjusting it every few minutes. Which has suuuper sucked. Now, it won't stay up for more than a few seconds, so I had to build myself a pillow booster seat, like a baby at Denny's.On top of that, the seat cushion already felt like I was sitting on a phone book. It was soft at first, but after a few months, I might as well be sitting on the floor.I almost never use the arm rests, because I'm usually working at a desk. But even with no real weight on them, they are all wobbly, and they're beginning to tear out of the sides.Every time I turn around, screws from the back of the seat have fallen out.

My first thought was that there was probably going to be a broken part or two or maybe a missing part within but to my relief all was well. The chair wasn't difficult to assemble because I know enough about washers nuts and bolts to get me by but the fact that they will refuse to send you any kind of assembly instructions in order to try and get you to pay them more money to assemble it themselves is a travesty. After assembly, though the chair was comfortable, it laid back well and was very nice to relax in. Around a month later however a plastic part for the thigh rest snapped and prevented me from using the chair much at all until the replacement part was sent, which was received quite quickly so I will give props for fast support. Once the chair part was replaced I haven't had a problem with parts breaking since but moving past that point in time the chair has only gotten worse.Getting to today will tell every problem that you can expect to have with your purchase after 6 months of use and they will be listed below.1. Armrests will become loose without the screws coming loose and making it unable to be fixed at all due wear.2. The seat cushion will collapse to a hard block on a slab of wood making it completely useless and it will not return to its shape3. the chair itself will not sit flat and will continuously shake around with any movement you make including angling down permanently so you will never be able to comfortably sit up again.That about sums up what you can expect when you purchase this product. For its price, I would say go ahead and spend just a little more for a name brand high-quality gaming chair and to not waste your time with a cheap product like this.Thank you for reading and I hope this helps you decide on whether or not you wish to purchase this product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1577664000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Bad design, bad construction, bad support.","reviewDescription":"Apparently I bought this chair in March 2018. So, I've had it just over a year.Initial construction was somewhat more difficult than a regular 'office chair' : Assemble wheel base, attach hydraulics to chair base, screw back to base... Which I'm quite comfortable with, and have done many times. This chair I suppose, includes 'more bits' but immediately it's obvious that the arms are deficient. There's a single bolt which attached the arm to the seat base, and another to the back, but it's wobbly. No amount of tightening makes it rigid, and if you press it from side to side it's got a noticeable wobble on it.  ( picture supplied)Worse though, is the construction of the base. The bit where the hydraulics attach to the seat. Now, this seat is rated for 275lb's and I'm no-where near that. After a year's use, the seat 'tips forwards'. The cushioning is compressed and it feels like you're falling out of the chair when you sit on it. The support construction under the chair is less than halfway along the seat itself. Which means that if you sit forwards ( your backside is not right at the back) then pressure on the seat forces the front against the metal support beneath. Mine has 'dented', forcing the metal support into the seat base itself and caused the 'tipping' effect.The piping on the seat is all torn. There's obviously tension points, and the seams have split on the seat, but also oddly down the back, and the sides.The footrest attachment is laughable. As noted in some of the other reviews it's no-where near sturdy enough - the two metal pipes which extend to support the rest are easily bent, wobbly and I never even tried using it, after constructing the chair, and noting that it was never going to work ( you'll bend the pipes and have a hell of a time getting them off \/ out \/ back in'Respawn offer a 'limited lifetime warranty' which apparently means '2 years' and appears not to cover fabric. Their amazon page doesn't seem to offer any 'support contact' so, one imagines it'll be a hassle to get this looked at.I would not recommend this chair for anyone looking for more than 'light use'.

It has a fairly decent look to it and it has the term \u201cgame\/gaming\u201d associated with it which is why there\u2019s a little bit of awe to it... however, the chair is not even worth the cost even though this is an entry level gaming chair. You\u2019d be better served to invest $160+ into an ergonomically sound office chair!! This chair has what appears to be a forever smell to it. Almost like a fake leather smell that\u2019s been here for several weeks. The padding on this chair is cheaply made... after sitting for about an hour it becomes very uncomfortable and you can begin to feel the bars or whatever is inside the \u201ccushion\u201d (if you can even call it a cushion) seat. (Of note, I\u2019m about 185lbs). Also worth mentioned the \u201clet rest\u201d feels cheaply made and does not seem sturdy. Half of the time I\u2019m timid to use it because it feels as if it\u2019s going to snap off when I\u2019m cautiously resting my legs on it. The picture attached shows the left armrest screw that WILL NOT screw in... it just free spins and the screw eventually works it\u2019s way out... causing the armrest to fall down until you reinsert the screw.

The bottom portion of the chair where the legs\/feet rest just randomly broke off!! I only EVER rest my feet on it and the bulk of my weight isn\u2019t even on it.

{"reviewTitle":"It was easy to setup and assemble but its NOT a chair meant to last","reviewDescription":"It's a comfortable chair but I cannot bring myself to give it any more than a one star because of build quality. The right side of the chair already has a hole through the leather and I dont sit in this chair for any more than 2 hours a day. I've only had it since the 8th it is now the 14th. I only weight 140ibs this chair should not be breaking down already and it's only been 6 days! Ive only been using it for 5 days because I wasn't able to put it together the day it came. The build quality of this Chair is absolutely atrocious! If this is what it looks like after 5 days I'd hate to see it at a year of use. The pictures are of the right side which has the hole in it. I'd expect more out of a 200 dollar chair. Overpriced garbage I knew better than to get a \"gaming chair\" My next chair will absolutely be a high end office chair. They are so much better anyway and won't break down on me in less than a week. Absolutely rediculous! After looking at other reviews I looked at my chair and it has all of the other problems people have mentioned. My right armrest is really loose compared to the left and they are both tightened down to the max. Also it has major tilt going on with the back. The left side I can slide my hand in and it doesn't even touch the leather back. The right side my hand can't fit without me shoving it in-between the cushion and the back. I'd expect so more out of a company as known as Respawn. This is the first and the last product I will buy from respawn.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644796800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good for the Price","reviewDescription":"Update: Within a year, the footrest broke off on one side. It never suffered any abuse besides resting my feet on it.  I contacted Respawn's customer support asking for a replacement part under warranty, and have yet to even receive a reply two weeks later. If this is how Respawn handles their customer support, I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase their products. Additionally, the armrests became wobbly after only a few months. Tightening the bolts had no effect.Just bought and assembled this as a replacement for a similarly priced chair. I'll start by saying that it does look nice, and it's fairly comfortable. I have a few issues with it, though. The biggest is that the armrests can't have their height adjusted, and for me they're a bit too low. It's not a dealbreaker, but it'll take some getting used to. The production quality is also somewhat lacking. The holes drilled into the underside of the seat for the screws to be run into aren't lined up perfectly, so the back of the chair is slightly off center. Again, not a dealbreaker, but not preferable. One side of the leather strips that Velcro onto the seat is a bit wider than it should be, so there's a bulge due to the extra material.  That, however, can be entirely ignored.The assembly wasn't problematic for the most part, aside from connecting the back to the seat. I struggled with that for around five minutes before I managed to get the screws in by lying on my back, holding the back up with my knees, and holding the wheels on my stomach. If I had a second person to help, it would have been much easier, but I had to make do on my own.Tl;dr: It's worth getting if you're on a budget and can't afford a higher quality, $300+ chair. It has flaws, but it's a $150 gaming chair, so that's not exactly unexpected.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1628035200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Look elsewhere","reviewDescription":"I have had this chair for a total of five months and it is definitely not worth the price. The piston that raises\/lowers the seat is already at a point where it doesn't stay raised up where I set it and over the course of the day I find myself lower and lower to the ground. The extra pads for the next and back are probably good for some people but they weren't ergonomic for me at all. And the arm padding is already flat, so if you put your elbows on the elbow rests it's basically putting it on leather-wrapped plastic as the padding has worn thin. Eventually all things wear out, sure, but this was a couple hundred dollars and I am already looking to replace it. I don't \"game\" in this chair, I use it for my home office since we all work from home these days and for the price I don't think it's been worth it at all. I could have got something else for half the price and likely had better results. \"It looks neat\" is about the only thing that can be said. It's really noisy!**** 6 1\/2 Month Update ****This chair honestly is a piece of garbage. The height adjustment piston can't retain pressure so I've ended up going to my local hardware store and cut a piece of 2 1\/2\" ABS pipe the same height as the piston as a shroud to prevent it from slowly lowering in height every ten or so minutes. This chair was definitely not worth the price I spent on it and it's outside of the window to return it in any meaningful way. There's a lot of negative reviews on here for this chair, but there's also a large number of positive ones telling you \"don't listen to the negative\". Let the buyer beware. I was expecting a couple of years out of this chair and that's why I bought it. At this rate I'll be lucky to get a single year and I've already had to modify it.

{"reviewTitle":"Not Worth The Price","reviewDescription":"This chair had no business being listed for the near-$200 price tag I spent on it. The main issues are:\u2022 The locking mechanism doesn't work -- Yes, the chair has a tendency to snap back if you lean back with the slightest bit of force, regardless of whether the recline knob is in the \"locked\" position or not. Yes, I'm well under 200lbs and, yes, I carefully and closely followed the instructions when putting it together. Go ahead: Search the reviews for the term \"lock\", and you'll see that this is a consistent issue for these chairs. Rule number one for a chair: Make sure it can remain a chair.\u2022 The incessant clicking when you move -- Trying to move around in this chair (even if it's just to slightly shift your weight or move your legs) is maddening, and incredibly distracting if others are nearby. This is a loud and sensitive chair.\u2022 It's difficult to clean -- Due to the design of the stitching, piping, and joints, this bugger is a crumb magnet. I clean it by spreading the piping seems with one hand, and holding a vacuum pipe with the other. In other words, this chair does not have a simple, wipe-down surface, and you might sometimes find it easier to just flip it upside down in order to get most of the debris from it.Overall, the biggest takeaway from this chair is the lack of locking support. The product certainly looks attractive, which is one reason I ordered it, but the snapping back of the back-side of it is enough to make you want to toss it. Unfortunately, I was just beyond my return window when the problem really escalated.I'm actually so incensed by this chair, that I'm writing this as my first Amazon review (after 10 years of Prime membership, and well more than a decade of purchases).

{"reviewTitle":"Decent chair for the price","reviewDescription":"For the most part, I like a lot of aspects of this chair. I like that it can lay back far and has the foot rest. I like the colors. It's easy to clean up. It was very easy and fast for me to put together(probably around 10 minutes) The lumbar cushion is something I didn't realize I needed, but since I have a bad back, It seems to really help with that. Both that and the head pillow are a bit stiff though, but the lumbar pillow softened up a little after I opened it and fluffed around the loose foam a bit. The head one is solid foam, so couldn't do anything with that. Maybe in time it will give a little.On to the seat... It's not as cushioned as I thought it would be by the pictures. I figured with it being meant for bigger people that it would be, as I'm 5'4 but around 240. My husband is 5'10 but under 180lbs and he says the seat is just fine for him. It's a little hard after a while for me though. I just folded up a small blanket to place under me and that works out. I do like that the seat is wider. I don't fill it entirely but I'll assume it should fit anyone closer to the max weight just fine and if you're around the 6ft range of height it should work out too. I noticed the arm rests tend to get a little wiggly if messed with or climbed on over by my 6 yr old, but easily enough to remove the rubber plugs and tighten the screws back up. Overall only 4 stars because of lack of ample seat cushion but it's decent for what it costs. If you can though, I'd pay a little more for something better. If not, this is at least worth a try, as some have had better results than I.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1619913600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Nice but uncomfortable after a while","reviewDescription":"I've had this chair for about a month now and I use it everyday for a number of hours per day. The build quality is great so far everything fit correctly and assembly was easy. I did add some different gliding wheels instead of the ones that come with it, this made the chair super smooth and quiet when rolling around.Pros:Easy assembly, good build quality, footrest easy to use and comfortable, neck pillow nice and plush, arm rests are relatively comfortableCons:The lumbar cushion is nice and plush as well, however it's a little difficult to find a comfortable spot for it, too low and your back gets sucked between that and the headrest, if it's too high it just feel awkward. Going to try using it without the lumbar cushion.Next, my biggest complaint, although the cushion of the chair itself is soft and plush, it's way too soft. After a while you sink into the chair and it ends up being your butt on top of the plastic because the seat cushion has flattened out (I weigh about 160lbs) and obviously that's very uncomfortable. It does however \"reinflate\" after you leave it alone for a while, but again it \"deflates\"Overall I would say it's relatively worth the money given the other options available. If you use it for a couple hours at a time I'd say you're good. If you're sitting all day long I would suggest trying to go for higher quality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663113600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great so far","reviewDescription":"Update : Nothing is wrong with the chair, persay.I like how it reclines. I like the lumbar support that can move up\/down to where you, specifically, need it. I like how it's nice and tall so I can lean fully back (and have totally taken a nap).Honestly, I removed a star from my review just because it's not perfect. And when I pay out more than double what I did for a chair I walked into walmart and went 'eh, it'll do', and never gave me issues - I expected to be like sitting on perfection. I still am happy with the chair. Still sit in it every day. But it's not a 'perfect' chair. And thus, it doesn't get a 'perfect' rating.First impressions : As I just literally put it together.It was easy to assemble, went together great, and is comfortable. The seat size is just a bit bigger than my old (7 year old, mesh chair thing) which is kind of what I was looking for because I love to sit cross-legged in chairs.The seat recline is easy, and can be stopped at any point to customize how you'd like to recline (which I found use for in kicking back to read up on some stuff after assembly).The neck cushion is weird and I doubt i'll find myself using it. The lumbar pillow so far is great. Firm enough for support, but squishy enough to be comfortable.The arm rests are nicely padded, but honestly probably wont have my arms on them much.The seat cushion seems firm enough to hopefully offer lasting comfortable seated sessions at my computer. And gives just enough when seated.The colors are great as well.I will admit I find the foot stool useless. I can see where I agree with other reviews stating it's wobbly. It doesn't go out far enough to use unless fully reclined. Considering I don't intend to sleep in the chair, it's a bit useless. It's also just how my desk is set up (It's a hutch style, so it's got shelves under the desk). I wouldn't be able to extend it anyway, as it would hit the shelf I currently use as leg support (with a pillow).Hopefully I won't be updating this review with it falling apart.

I had never sat in a bucket style racing chair so I wasn\u2019t ready to commit to a higher tier one like Secret Labs. I thought I\u2019d pick up this budget chair and see if I liked it enough to make a greater investment later down the road. I also work from home so I needed something that would get at least 8 hours of use a day - on top of gaming.Assembly was super easy. It comes in 6 or 7 parts and you screw it all together with a provided allen wrench. I had it together in less than 30 minutes. My first gaming session was 4 hours and I loved it. The chair is super comfortable. It\u2019s firm but not hard. The head rest and lumbar cushions are fine - nothing to write home about. The leg rest is a cool design - it folds up and slides under the chair. However, I can definitely see it not lasting very long with extensive use or if you\u2019re rough with it. It\u2019s only held together by two metal poles. Even so, very comfortable in the fully reclined position and I\u2019m happy I picked one with a leg rest.The arm rests are the same cushion as the rest of the chair. I\u2019ve seen some other reviews where people complained about them coming loose and while that hasn\u2019t happened in my first few days - I can totally see it. They aren\u2019t very sturdy and are only attached by 2 screws each to the chair. They\u2019re fine for now. My only real complaint so far about the chair overall is that it is hot. It doesn\u2019t breathe - like at all. If you tend to sweat a lot or get hot even a little bit - something to consider.This is a good budget chair. I\u2019m totally happy with my purchase for now. If you\u2019re on the fence about it, so was I and while I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have this chair for years, it\u2019s definitely worth it for the price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1598832000000}

I am not a gamer much these days but I do know about chairs since I work on a computer all day. So I need certain things.  It's very comfy, the seat has THICK foam that I can float on before I feel any resistance. Armrests too. The back can be adjusted for comfort and the pillow two. The color is great. I got the purple and it's subdued but not boring like an all black chair. The armrests were KEY. Since many of these chairs have those flimsy skinny ones with one metal part attaching from underneath. This one has a two point attachment so these won't wiggle off and snap. Leaning back with the leg rest is great, very cushy rest. I guess that's an overall thing that's really a standout on this. It's a very CUSHY chair in all the paddings. They didn't skimp.  The base and wheels are kinda lacking feeling plasticky, but really it's still real thick and strong so only time will tell. Overall it's an imposing looking and great feeling chair. I was iffy spending the money on it since it's not a \"cheap\" chair but I am glad I did. It's a serious chair, not some shot in the dark with a random company that will be gone by the time you call customer service. You can tell these guys understand the whole science of extended use with the way they built this.I only didn't give 5 stars since the top of the chair had a tiny tear from shipping.

It also has a super nice feeling faux leather that I just can't get enough of. As for the reclining and footrest features, the reclining is amazing once you figure it out. The footrest however is great but I can tell it's gonna break after extended use. It's only held on by 2 metal bars that slide back and forth through a hole and because of this, it's very wobbly and feels like it's gonna break if you put too much pressure on it. The chair itself is pretty big so you can sit criss cross and other positions if you're not too big.

I can find no signs of ware on the material at all and is is pretty easy to clean. Assembly was pretty easy and everything seems tight and solid.

I am 6' tall and weigh roughly 160lbs so I am a bit on the lights side of average. With the seat all the way up it is at a comfortable height for me, but it always feels like it is tilted forward slightly. This sensation is only heightened when I try to use the leg rest. And lets be clear - this is a leg rest, not a foot rests as it is too short to reach the feet. Another thing is that the seat cushion, while adequate for short term sitting, is a bit on the thin side and after a while it feels more like a hard leather saddle than a padded seat. It's a good thing that this chair comes with a lumbar support as the back is a somewhat odd shape and it would be really uncomfortable without one. The back is also lightly padded and gets a bit hard after a while.The last thing about this chair is that the tilt control for the back is below and behind the chair hight control making it difficult to find and operate.

Pretty sturdy.- Full recline with leg rests is a nice feature, though not sure how much I will use it.Cons:- Butt cushion not nearly as cushy as it looks.  Bottoms out, so feels like I'm sitting on a board after a few minutes.- Lumbar cushion is really thick and not comfortable in any position.  Maybe it will squash down over time.- Seat portion does not tilt, just the back reclines.I have already ordered an extra seat cushion to put on it, otherwise my butt wouldn't be able to tolerate it for long periods.

Im putting \"gaming\" in quotes because I dont really understand what constitutes a \"gaming\" chair to begin with.  But that is an entirely different discussion.  Anyway, the price is great!  But I still deeply regret this purchase.Pros:1.  Excellent price!2.  Build quality is actually good, robust plastic and sturdy fake leather.3.  Has nice cushioned armrests!Cons.1.  The chair is literally unusable.  Yeah, showstopper which negates all Pros.  The chair has absolutely NO seat tilt function and the seat is positioned about 10 degrees downward so gravity is sliding your butt out of the chair and there is NO way to counteract this.  The seat back will tilt but since the seat cushion remains tilted downward, any backward tilt of the the seat back aggravates your slide out of the chair.  It is absolutely insane.  You just slide out of the chair and get a wedgie in the process.  Nothing can counter a flaw of this magnitude, it simply makes the chair non-functional.  So even though it is decent quality at t decent price it should be a hard pass by anyone who doesnt like wedgies and falling out their chair under the desk.2.  The center of gravity of the chair is forward so if you try to roll the chair forward on its wheels while sitting in it, the chair will flip over.  Yet another epic design fail.3.  Seat cushion goes flat after just a couple weeks and becomes hard as a rock.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1552780800000}

I was glad it had a foot rest, and it was a good feature, until a couple months in when it broke, apparently unable to support my ... feet. You know, the thing it was built to hold up?

I ordered this expecting to get a comfy chair that was solid and supportive.I was able to assemble the chair easily and though this was going to be a great new addition to my corner of the world.Then I sat in it and that is when things started to degrade.1. The lever to lower the chair is in front of the lever to adjust the angle of the chair.  NOT AT ALL fun expecting to lean back only to slam to the lowest setting.2. The arms on the chair make it so you have to lean, uncomfortably, to adjust the chair. - poor design.3. The chair does not have ANY spring loaded back rest lean, as in every normal office chair I have ever sat in.4. When you want to move the chair back up, you need to adjust the lever, then manually move the chair (without any spring assistance) and then lock the lever down - all without messing up the position of the back of the chair.To summarize, this is a cool looking chair, and for some people it might work great.  For me, however, it is not functionally complete and will end up sitting in the closet or being sold on Craigslist.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"229 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1536105600000}

{"reviewTitle":"No Value","reviewDescription":"Going to give an honest review here:There is zero advantage to this chair for gaming vs just about any other office chair, unless you really need the recline feature and the pillow support as it include a lumbar and neck support pillow. The backrest is very comfortable and easily the best feature of the chair and the pillows are supportive BUT, the seat cushion is dismal. I'm 200lbs and the cushioning bottoms out completely. All I feel is the plywood (I assume) base of the seat. It's bad enough that I purchased a seat cushion specifically for this chair, just to make it usuable for more than 30 minutes at a time.The materials are standard quality polyurethane fake leather; nothing to complain about... keep it clean and it should last. It was easy to assemble and the necessary tools are included. The chair is pretty stable and I've been able to recline fully and retract the backrest to it's upright position, all without ever bracing against the floor.The sturdiness of it's design is questionable as it creaks and groans constantly. This started after about a week of ownership using it for 3-4 hours daily. The backrest also tends to slip about 1\/4 inch out of position when leaning back and does this with an audible metallic twang. Sitting back up will allow the backrest to \"pop\" back into it's original position. It's not a problem outside of being mildly irritating, especially if you tend to lean back then go upright multiple times as I do, from shifting positions.TLDR; I should not have fallen for the marketing. There is no value here. The chair performs and functions like a sub $200 chair (which is it's current price range).  Additionally, I've used $99 chairs with more basic functionality that are far superior in comfort.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1653350400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Decent for the first week, almost complete trash after that...","reviewDescription":"For the $150 price tag, you would think a chair made for gaming would use high-quality materials with minimal features--but nope. They went more for features, which is the only reason I rate this product one starts higher than 1 star. The cushions flatten out within weeks, the armrests get flimsier and flimsier as time passes on (and will break off within months), the whole board you lay your back into also gets flimsier and flimsier, and I have no guarantee this thing won't fall apart on me soon. I've literally had to put two pillows on top of the seat cushion just to sit in it for school. I have to take a break from it after that! By the way, I've only had this chair for 2 MONTHS. Your money would be better spent on a really nice office chair that will at least last you and be more comfortable for $150. The only positive thing I can think about this chair is that the armrest cushions are of high quality, and the leg rest feels nice...THAT'S IT. Even the leg rest itself is super hard to use since the metal bar holding the cushion isn't even LUBRICATED. Save your money for a DXRacer chair, it may cost more but trust me, it lasts WAAAAAY longer and is WAAAAAY more comfortable. I will hopefully be returning this piece of trash that isn't even worth it as scrap-metal and use that money to get a better chair for my daily needs, I would recommend you avoid this chair and most likely the company as well--but I don't know the quality of their other products. Heck, I don't even know if they make other products!Edit: Forgot to add, the lumbar pillow and neck pillow are also of high-quality, but the neck pillow is in an awkward spot so it isn't really a neck pillow unless you pull it up and hold it down with your neck. It also isn't really an upper-back pillow unless you pull it down and hold it with your back. Despite that, the back pillows are comfortable, everything else I said before still stands, however.

I didn't use the chair as often when I first got it as compared to now b\/c I have a new remote job. So before it was like two\/three hours of gaming in the chair a day. Now it's 8+ because of work. My buttprint is definitely visible and it definitely sucks to sit for longer than a couple hours. I've sat on metal folding chairs that are more comfortable for longer.BTW I'm 5'3 and am very light. I ignored all the other bad reviews because I thought I would be fine since I weigh next to nothing and have had really cheap chairs before that never deflated like that. It doesn't matter if you're small or large, the cushion just doesn't have the integrity to last in the long run and the material is just so easy to scrape up. I think it's just an overall design issue with chairs like this. I haven't noticed any other issues though, like the arm rests or the wheels as other reviews have mentioned. But wow do I wish I would have put $200 towards a better, albeit more expensive chair. My advice is either shell out that pretty penny for a really good chair or just go with a classic office chair that offers better back\/neck support.

It's creaking already, I've had it less than 3 weeks.3. The foot stool is okay, but again, feel like the chair is having issues supporting me and that includes the stool. The stool itself can't be moved up or down it just slides out which I didn't realize at the time of purchase (which that's fine, that's my fault).4. The chair is a bit plush but the bottom where you sit just doesn't have enough cushion. Within a week it has completely deflated and has become quite uncomfortable.In summary, it's just cheaply made. I get it, you get a lot of features with this which is great and it is priced well in reflection of that, however I thought being a Respawn brand it would be up to scratch being a well known gaming brand. Although it looks good, the back support of the chair, and cushions provided work well, I am overall sorry to say that I am quite disappointed with it. I'm probably going to be looking at replacing it at some point within the next year which for the money I spent \/ for what the chair is worth, shouldn't be the case.

Unfortunately my old chairs faux leather started to peel away and made a mess so I looked for another chair.I bought this chair thinking it would be a solid replacement for my old chair but was I wrong and I should have listened to the reviews.Let's start off with what I like about the chair:1. It looks very cool and I love the design.2. Has good back, neck, and ok lumbar support.3. Can recline all the way back with leg raised support. Great for watching movies on my desktop computer or gaming for relaxation.Here's what I don't like:1. The biggest gripe of the chair is that it has no bottom support cushion as it flattens after a few days and you can feel the metal support plate. Since I work from home 9-10hrs a day 5 days a week, it's extremely uncomfortable as it's like sitting on the floor. To get around this I had to spend an additional $30 for a seat cushion. Mind you in all the chairs I owned I never had to purchase a seat cushion. (See my attached picture-Look at the back of the seat)2. Arm support is extremely wobbly.3. Every time you lean back in the seat it makes a loud clicking noise. It's very annoying.4. The chair came with a big scratch on the top. (See my attached picture)5. In the up position, the seat rocks easily to front and back. I confirmed that all the bolts were properly tightened per the manual and still get the rocking.What could have been improved:1. Add a stronger seat cushion in the seat like memory foam with additional padding.2. Fix the up position rocking.3. Fix the armrest wobble.4. Fix the clicking noise when leaning back in the chair for the first time of the sitting session.Overall thoughts:If I could go back I would have never purchased this chair. I should have listened to the reviews. I will be reaching out to the manufacturer on what they can do for me.

I bought it nearly a year ago, and have decided that it is time to move on to something else.The first issue is that after assembly I came to appreciate how much space this chair takes up, it is a good deal larger than a standard office chair. The depth of the seat hits right in the middle of my upper leg, often putting my legs to sleep. The material doesn't breathe, being a faux leather, so you get sweaty sitting in the chair. The arms are wiggly in spite of the fasteners being tightened all the way down. Then there is the horrible *pop* sound that the back makes when I put my weight on it with the lock engaged.The real problem started once I began working from home and spending more time in the chair. All of those issues were annoying but given that I would only be sitting in the chair at most a few hours a day it wasn't anything to fret about. Now that I am sitting in the chair for dozens of hours a week in the chair I am able to definitively say that the chair is just flat out uncomfortable. The cushion material has gone from being fairly acceptable to being almost brick like. I frequently emerge from the chair stiff and sore after only having been there for less than a couple hours.Ultimately the size, flimsiness, and discomfort lead me to leave this review. This chair is not good and is a pass. Perhaps all gamer chairs are equally horrible. I'm inclined to believe so since they're all essentially the same thing with different branding.

Even the cushion couldn't keep this thing from feeling like I was sitting on a board. Felt as if I was sitting in some bleachers, but not ever leaving.  It's great for my 10 yo.  He loves it.

Not ok for a gaming chair at this price point.I am not a large man (5'5\" 160lbs), but within hour of sitting in it, I have bottomed out and it feels like I'm sitting on hard wood.

To start, the thing smells like cigarette smoke right out of the factory-sealed box. Is that the chemicals oozing from cheap fabric or fake leather on the chair? Maybe. Is it the traces of whomever packaged this thing? Probably. But it reeks.Next, the chair, while initially comfy for the first 24 hours, will start showing its true colors by mysteriously loosening up the screws across the board. Armrests will wobble, the entire back portion will lean to one side, and the height will start to decrease. \"Just re-tighten the screws!\" you will say. And that will fix the problem for ten seconds. Then it's back to Slouchtown.The headrest pillow thing will destroy your neck, like it did mine. It will hurt your neck and upper back to the point where, if you're like me, you will yank it from the chair and toss it in the opposite direction in a rage.Oh, and the cushion you sit on every day will become compact or compressed, and feel as comfortable as a cinder block.Amazon's customer service is no help, since they make it impossible to return this thing.

You\u2019d think the manufacturer would take into account the comfort and cushion of the seat since that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be for. Had some sort of cushion in it but they might as well should\u2019ve left it out completely. Its like sitting on a slab of concrete pretty much. I\u2019m in pain even a whole day later after sitting in it.

The seat is extra wide for those with a fat ass and feels like it would fit a 7 foot tall person. The lumbar support doesn't stay put and is more of an annoying obstacle. The head support pillow is not adjustable and again might work for you if you're 7 feet tall but for me at 5'7\" it is an extra piece I feel like is a waste. The past few days the swivel has started to make an annoying squeaking noise. The stitching on the chair doesn't match and I  wonder how this chair pasted quality control. There are flaps on the chair back that attach with Velcro but won't since they don't match up.If you purchase this chair you are ordering a chair you'll want to return.I had hoped that I would find how to be comfortable in this chair but I was wrong and should have sent it back before I got ride to the box. I'm looking for a new chair and this is going to Goodwill. I will never buy a chair online again, it's like buying shoes you have to wear them to know if they're comfortable.Now this chair will not stay at the height it's set at.

It worked wonderfully for this! The thrill of this chair was short lived however.My chair now suffers from very loose feeling arms, a broken foot rest, peeling seat faux leather resulting in VERY scratchy material being exposed, and the padding of the chair is basically gone it feels like.It is now August 2022 and there is faux leather peeling off the seat at the front, exposing sharp faux leather peeled edges, and a scratchy surface under the faux leather.This cause a LOT of leg discomfort as I am constantly scratching my legs when I sit in it.In addition, I am really starting to feel like the padding under has gone out somehow. I put a towl down on the seat to protect my legs but also to add a little padding to what feels like a pretty deformed sponge.The leg rest also broke within year one without me putting what I would consider an unreasonable amout of force into it. I remember waking up and trying to sit up and hearing a snap as the loop connecting the metal rod to the apperatus snapped. Now I am both pretty fit and reasonably small (5'4 155lbs) and somehow the force of sitting up--an activity that derives power from the core IF you have a stable base on the floor-- caused the foot rest to snap. I used to only use it to relax while the students were on break, or to watch movies at my computer, but wow... what a let down. It still extends but I wont put any weight on it anymore bc one side now hangs pretty loosely.Tldr: After a lot of use in the past year from being a remote school teacher, to long gaming  sessions, this chair, especially at its price point is a HUGE let down. I believe it was $169 at the time and it performed like a $70 chair would be expected to.

{"reviewTitle":"Absolute waste of money","reviewDescription":"I couldn't be more disappointed by this purchase. I paid about $30 for expedited shipping to get the chair asap. When it arrived, the box was in the worst shape possible. Large tears all over and barely held together by tape, even though this product was brand new. When I began to put it together, I quickly realized that the gas lift cylinder was not included in my box, so my chair lay on the floor in a pile of parts. I contacted Respawn to hopefully get a replacement part sent to me, but they completely denied the request and told me I needed to just return the product for a new one through Amazon. Not willing to repackage the already very beaten up box and large chair parts, I decided to purchase a universal gas lift cylinder on Amazon. Once that arrived and I was able to finally build the chair, the true disappointment set in. I had to manually force certain parts to move in order to line them up, which took considerable strength and ultimately barely made a difference. The back of the chair leans left even though it is firmly attached. The reclining mechanism of the chair is so weird, it freely reclines to almost fully horizontal unless you 'lock' it into place with the lever, which limits the chair from doing anything other than sitting in one stable position with no give whatsoever. Also, the chair will not lift\/lower for me at all, which is likely due to the \"universal\" cylinder I had to buy being faulty, but that's a whole different issue...All in all, just incredibly bummed and this chair will sit in the corner of my storage room until I can either sell it or just give it away to someone. My only advice would be to look into something a bit more costly with outstanding reviews, something I regretted not doing with this chair and I hope I can help turn somebody else away from experiencing a similar fate.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1665792000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Terrible! SAVE YOUR MONEY","reviewDescription":"I've only owned this for 7 months as of now, but the seat cushion almost completely flattened by 4 months of owning it. This chair offers no support! Even though I use an additional cushion for the seat now, it's still very hard. I can't sit in it for more than maybe 30 minutes without discomfort. And the chair itself makes noises when I shift in my seat now. I believe it's the seat springs ringing when I lean in any direction. The sound is very loud.Don't even get me started about the foot rest! It's a joke. It was incredibly unstable from the start. The screws were constantly coming loose despite tightening them, but now it's basically unusable. It must be a design flaw, because if I apply any pressure to the foot rest, it immediately gives in and starts bending in a way it's not designed to. Because of this, the plastic track is now worn down and the foot rest will not stay up on it's own. I can't use it now, and I bought this chair BECAUSE it had a foot rest. There's no way to fix it without replacing the whole foot rest, but I think the same problem would occur again. I'm female and 5'6\" but I don't think the foot rest would suit anybody taller than me. It barely worked for me as it is.The arm rests and seat fabric have also worn out already too. I've never had this happen to any chair I've owned before! Not even ones I've had for 3-5 years! And when I first assembled this chair, I had the problem of unstable arm rests like I've seen other people write about too.Overall I am just very disappointed in this purchase. I only bought this 7 months ago... I paid almost $200 for a poor quality chair that I'll need to replace very soon. I would never purchase it again. It's a poor design and the quality is bad.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669248000000}

As the chair does look really good I wouldn\u2019t recommend this chair. The armrest are a little wobbly on both sides and I\u2019ve barely rested my arms on them. I\u2019ve been refraining from resting my arms on the armrest as I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll break. I\u2019m returning the chair...seriously, look elsewhere.UPDATE May 10th 2019: I received and assembled my replacement and it is perfect. As I was assembling the new chair I did try and just place the new back portion on my previous chair seat and noticed the seat part was looking off also. So I guess that's why they don't send parts, if one part of the chair is off then the whole chair is wrong.UPDATE May 8th 2019: Contacted Amazon customer service who ordered a replacement for me and has shipped out the replacement which should arrive this coming Friday the 10th. I do have to disassemble the whole chair to return since they do not replace parts. Will update again once I receive and assemble the new chair. Fingers crossed this one is as it should be. Amazon provided return label.I just got this chair today and by far this is the easiest chair to assemble. I have two other gaming chairs that have fabric material. I decided to try this one out solely based on the armrest as the other two I have the armrest pivots in and out without any locking and when you recline back the armrest doesn't follow.I love how the chair looks but already I have an issue with chair. During assembly I noticed the back part of the chair was built wrong (pics provided). The metal part is off center which makes the chair look like its leaning a little. When I sit in it I don't notice the difference right away...yet. I'll update if it does pose a problem after prolonged sitting. I work from home and I'm a gamer. I will find out quickly if it'll pose a problem.I tried finding a way to contact the seller to see about getting a replacement for the back portion but I cannot for the life of me find where I can contact the seller. Only option I have is to return which I don't want to do at the moment. I'll update once I figure out how to contact the seller.Also, for those that want to know if the footrest adjusts to your liking....it does. You can pull it out as far out as it goes and close. This was something I was wondering myself. It doesn't extend out very far though.

{"reviewTitle":"Does not live up to the hype.","reviewDescription":"I have had this chair for 4 months! Assembling it wasn\u2019t too hard but it was far from easy as well. I lived streamed the entire chair building session and it took me a good bit of time. I did have trouble with some of the parts, and tried so hard to get in contact with the manufacturer. They do not respond at all and have ignored some of my attempts to get their attention.First off, the color and graphic design looks great. The leather seems to be of decent material. It is not the highest of quality but it is okay. For $175 after taxes, I cannot say that this chair is worth its price tag. The plastic material is okay but I am having trouble with both of my arm chairs. The left one started wiggling after a month of use and the right was never able to stay in one place without wiggling from the beginning. The right arm chair seems to be a manufacturing error. I really tried my best to get in contact with them.Let\u2019s move onto comfort and experience.  The chair comes with two cushions for your neck and back. Not even a month of normal use and the back cushion is flat and seems to have permanently lost its original shape. The arm rest cushions are at the perfect spot and they are the best feature. The biggest complain is the cushion on the left arm rest is flat and does not look like it will ever get back to its original shape. It is such a bummer. I really like the foot rest feature since I have never had a chair that had it, but mine falls off every time I use it. I don\u2019t know if it was intentional that the manufacturer did not put a stopping mechanism to keep it from sliding off. It seems very inconvenient so I barely use the foot rest. Onto the rolling function, I think it rolls smoothly. The bottom assembly is great. I have no complaints about that.Overall, I give cannot recommend this chair, especially at their retail price. I really thought this chair would be good for my back but it does not do it\u2019s job. A lot of gamers recommended me this chair and I cannot say that I fully enjoy it the way I thought I would. The build quality is at medium level. The cushion is not great at all.

{"reviewTitle":"Definitely NOT as comfortable as I was expecting","reviewDescription":"Pros  - easy to assemble  - nicely packaged (inside the box) all parts were included  - looks beautiful  - fits better under my desk than my previous chair due to the smaller floor radius of the wheels (I have a foot stool under my desk that my other chair wheels kept bumping into)  - the footrest is nice, but I cannot use it fully extended under my desk due to limited space overall  - adjustable lumbar pillow is kind of nice, only because I can adjust it up and down as needed throughout the day  - the best thing is the reclining feature and the padded armrestsCons  - The box was pretty beat up when it was delivered, which worried me, but thankfully, none of the pieces were damaged or missing  - Once assembled, I sat in the seat - and to my absolute horror, (and the worst thing about this chair) the seat was hard as a rock; after sitting in the seat for only 3 hours my bum is extremely sore  - the included pillows were very hard and way overstuffed; I am not even using the upper pillow, which is one of the big reasons I bought this chair  - Even though the lumbar pillow is supposed to stay where you put it via the very tight attached straps, I find that the pillow likes to migrate back down the chair over time  - Armrests are way too low in the upright seated position (I'm barely 5'5\") and not adjustableI really wanted to like this chair. I pored over chairs for days, looking at reviews and settled on this one - it provides lumbar support via the pillow, it has an attached foot rest, (I have an ankle injury that needs elevated), it has padded arm rests, reclines, and it has a neck pillow. Most of the reviews claimed that people could sit in this chair for hours without a problem. I'm starting to wonder what kind of chair these reviewers had before this one. This is definitely NOT a comfortable chair. Use a memory foam blend in the seat cushion and pillows and make the arm rests adjustable and then this chair would be just about perfect.  I will either be returning this or giving it to my son, I have not decided yet as I only just received this chair yesterday. My son expressed an interest in it, but I want to let him use it for a day to decide if he truly wants it.** Edit - My son did end up taking this chair and hasn't said anything about it.

For some reason, we followed the instructions and packaged assembly, but it did not work out. Upon reading the reviews, I thought this would be a quick and easy assembly. It was not. According to my father, there was no \"trade\" or \"train\" on the seat part with the 3 holes, which to him meant that it's not connecting properly to the back support with 3 holes because the screw placement for the nails is only on the back support and not on the seat. We tried to do it reverse, but there's no space to screw things in with the accompanied wrench or with hands\/fingers. (I attached some photos with review for proof.) The holes on the seat were just holes without the nail tracks that it can screw in.I will change this review later if things work out with my father or if I receive more support about this. It DEFINITELY was NOT EASY to assemble, though.[Updated: 1\/13\/2022] It is the same problem... it was properly packaged a lot more than usual, but it was the exact problem regarding the assembly of the chair and missing nuts. The company I called stated that Amazon should take care of it as I replace the product, but that doesn't make sense... I replaced the product, but there is no evidence of any nuts needed to secure the other end of the gaming chair.How was this an easy assembly for previous customers? Unless they either happened to have nuts in their toolboxes or they all sit daintily on the edge of their seats, I don't see this ever being made for use. My father bought bolts and nuts of the same size, so once he gets home, I will see if I can update this review in a positive spin. Otherwise, expect this to be returned and for me to get refunded. (I'm hoping to use my dad's nuts and bolts for this to work, because the aesthetic is pretty and is a waste to have to officially return it and get refunded... but I will do this move if I have to.)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1641513600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Had to purchase extra bolts\/nuts to fully assemble","reviewDescription":"The chair assembly was easy until I got to the part when I bolt the steel support at the base of the back of the chair into the steel support of the seat. There are three holes drilled into the steel support for three 8x20mm bolts that are included which require an included Allen wrench to tighten. The included bolts fit into the holes fine from the back portion of the chair to the steel support on the seat of the chair but there was nothing they screwed into such as a nut so they just immediately fall out and the chair falls apart and could not be assembled as received. I checked the instructions and it literally has an illustration of these bolts just going into these holes with nothing to screw them into to tighten the back support to the seat frame. They just sit there. The accessories are nicely packaged and clearly labeled so I knew I wasn\u2019t missing any pieces, plus again the instructions clearly state I was doing it right which is insane to me, how can anyone put this chair together? I had to purchase three 5\/16th (didn\u2019t have 8x20mm\/metric size at Home Depot so couldn\u2019t use factory bolts) bolts\/nuts and a matching ratcheting combination wrench to use with a torque wrench to install them at extra cost. This is why I\u2019m giving just two stars. I had to settle for silver bolts because I couldn\u2019t find black ones to match the color of the steel frame.After assembling the chair itself looks pretty nice. It\u2019s a pleather material, feels fairly mid to high quality. Chair neck support fits me perfect at 5\u201911\u201d. It just about fully reclines and feels comfortable and doesn\u2019t look too cheap. I\u2019m happy with it the look and feel. I\u2019d give it 4 stars but I just can\u2019t believe I had to purchase nuts and bolts to install it. It appears based on the instructions and illustrations that all of the chairs are like this, maybe I bought a manufacturer defect? I took a photo of what I\u2019m talking about. The nuts\/bolts in the photo are the ones I had to purchase and were not included, hence silver color. Again, I meticulously checked the instructions and box for extra parts and it was obvious there were none! Considering the extra 20$ I spent I may have been able to find a slightly better chair but probably not so it may not be a total deterrent if you don\u2019t mind the extra work.

I did have to tighten the bolts in the arms a couple times but they are moving parts so It was just \"settle time\". They are perfectly fine now.  The foot rest is my issue with the chair.  I did several hours of research and several blog\/ reviews sites highly recommended this chair. It ranked number 2 on several lists.  #1 was to rich for me.  :)  The issue with the foot rest is its plastic and considering how you sit, when sitting in the chair, there is pressure there. The slid out parts are metal but where the pressure is applied is plastic.  It just doesn't work unless you're 10 and can't reach it to rest your legs on.  Just to be clear, Im 5'8 and 200 lbs. Also, I have never SAT on the footrest, only rested my legs when the chair is reclined.There are a couple other Cons about this chair, but nothing I can't live with. Those are as follows: Doesn't rock or free recline at all.  You can manually recline it with a lever but a slight resting recline would have been nice.  2nd. The cushion on the seat leaves some room for improvement, but I remedied this by throwing a pillow and a blanket in it that stays there all the time and its fine.Pros..  The full recline is so Nice... I spent alot of time at my computer and I can just kick back and take a nap.. Its Great.THE BIGGEST PROBLEM for me was..

First I'll consider the pros:-Comfortable, for the most part.-Lasted me just past the normal warranty.Cons:-The leg rest is very unstable.  After a very short time of using the chair the leg rest fell off and I had to reassemble it.  Luckily I am not one who uses the leg rest in my gaming chairs much, so I just shoved it back under the chair and ignored its existence.-After about 6 months of us, the arm rests kept coming loose and I had to keep retightening them every couple of weeks.-Pleather is nice but began peeling after just a month of use.  Again, I am not overly concerned with the appearance of my chair, so I overlooked this as it continued to peel off in the areas where I sat.-As of writing this, the 5 point wheel assembly broke in two places simultaneously and the chair collapsed out from under me, landing me flat on my rear and very nearly hitting my head on my desk.  I've never had an office chair flat out break on me, ever.  I am also well within the weight limit of this chair.My chair before this one was a cheap office depot purchase that lasted me 10 years which I only replaced because the fabric had almost completely frayed off and I was just sitting on foam, but was otherwise structurally sound.I really wanted to like this chair, as it was comfortable for the most part.  Nothing superb to rave about, but comfortable enough.  It had its issues but I mostly overlooked those issues as they weren't big deals to me.  Respawn boasts a limited lifetime warranty on all of its products, of which I read the pdf for and it seemed like this kind of structural defect should be covered, however I am told by correspondence with the company that the structural damage of the wheel assembly falls under the 2 year normal warranty and is not covered by their limited lifetime warranty in the item description.  Perhaps that is expecting too much, but with the other issues that this chair has given me, the fall that could have badly injured me, and the response from Respawn, I would not recommend this chair.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1613692800000}

Next, it\u2019s noisy and every hinge point creaks and doesn\u2019t feel solidly constructed. Every time you lean back or forward it will make loud creaking noises. The back support is never sturdy and has a lot of give. No matter how tight you get the bolts for the armrests, they will wobble left and right. Again, not solidly made. The slide out foot rest also is really loose and is always moving each time you bump it. When fully extended it feels flimsy. I rarely use it. I wish I had gotten the model without the slide out foot rest. As to comfort, the height adjustment doesn\u2019t go high enough. As a 6\u20190\u201d man it just a hair too short for optimal comfort and ergonomics. The chair without the sliding lumbar support is not supportive enough, with the sliding lumbar it\u2019s too extreme. I can find a decent position for it but the second I lean forward or get up the cushion moves out of position and requires more adjustment. The neck cushion is way way too big and I can\u2019t even use it. It\u2019s a waste. All in all, I can never find a comfortable position with this chair and I wish I had gone with a mesh cushion chair like I was first going to.

{"reviewTitle":"DON'T BUY: (1) Chair with BIG hole on top (2) skewed parts at the bottom (3) cannot be assembled","reviewDescription":"Before buying, I was skeptical of the negative reviews and went ahead anyway. Now I realized they were spot on. The chair came in a big box. The package looks perfectly normal, but I was extremely disappointed to find a BIG hole on top of the back rest (pic 1 and 2). The rip that big cannot be ignored by quality control, so they must have intentionally sent the item out. I don't know who can accept such a defective product though.Then it got worse. The side of the sitting pad has 2 insert points for the arm rests. One side is normal, so the arm rest can be attached and bolted (pic 3). Then the other side is completely SKEWED (pic 4), and the arm rest cannot be attached to it. So now I have a dangling arm rest on one side. If I try to force, it feels like the entire chair will just collapse. Cannot imagine the lack of quality control that resulted in this chair.In short, chair has a big rip on top of back rest, and a defective part in the bottom, and cannot be assembled. I feel cheated and think other potential buyers should know.I was excited to get a comfortable chair for work and gaming, but for the money paid, I definitely expected better. I reached out to seller, and will update whether they respond to my request for refund.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1648857600000}

The people that use it are 2 teenagers 130lbs or less and one adult 160lbs. None of us use the chair in any sort of extreme way. Just sit and play computer games.It is now 5\/15\/21 (less than 6 months) and the chair is completely falling apart.The armrests lasted less than a month before they needed daily tightening. As of now, we can't even tighten them anymore. They are as tight as they will go and they still wobble around, right much worse than left.The bolts holding the seat to the rolling bottom part randomly fall out. Right now my husband is putting 3 of them back in. There is little to no padding on the seat so be prepared to splurge on a seat pad or grab a throw pillow.The foot rest is not very sturdy\/stable but kinda nice to have. It too had broken in someway but my son fixed it before I could see what had happened.The pleater fabric is actually not too bad and is holding up relatively well (at less then 6 months old). Some parts that rubbed are wearing.The chair is initially inexpensive but with how badly it is coming apart I'm not expecting it to last a year. Having to buy 2 chairs in a year makes this a very expensive chair!

My Problems were one of  Quality inpection at the factory. The  insert where you Bolt on one of the armpads  to the lower cushion seems to be welded up at a bent angle so its impossible to place bolt in through one  armrest  at 90 degree angle through the armpad.  Second thing was missing the neck pillow they show on the pictures and the box. It simply was not there. The Box seemed to have been a return because the tape used to close one end was different thickness and had tape running sideways across the seem. Lesson learned dont buy large items through amazon. Not dragging this huge thing to a Post office. I will just  remove the other armrest to match it . This chair is not the cheapest or the most expensive, but a 150 Dollar chair should have better quality and be checked before u send someone a open box item.UPDATE: contacted RESPAWN product support thinking maybe they just can replace the cushion with the bent bolt frame and send me the missing piece. That was a waste of time they basically all they said was \"great news\" you can still return it to Amazon.  Lol...like I didn't know that.less work for them I guess .

My son is only 13 and weighs about 140 lbs and is 6 ft tall so not a heavy weight and he takes good care of his things, especially the money he spent on this chair. Several months ago we noticed a loud clunking or knocking noise when he was downstairs gaming. I asked him about it and he said it does that when he has it locked and leans back. It is loud enough that we can hear it in the living room upstairs from the downstairs family room. His father tried taking it apart to see if we could tell what was making the loud clunk. We did not figure anything out. I then decided to go to the manufacture web site and follow instructions for a warranty claim. I filled out the form and took pictures and described the problem. That was over a month ago and have heard NOTHING.  My son recently moved all his gaming to his room, which is above his sisters room and now because she can hear the clunking noise when he leans or moves he can not use his chair after she goes to bed because she can hear it through the floor.

{"reviewTitle":"Weak Cushion = Uncomfortable","reviewDescription":"I want to start my review by saying that I ordered two of these chairs, one red and one blue. They both arrived in damaged boxes, but a cursory inspection revealed no noticable damage to the chairs. The assembly was fine, with the only hanging being where and how to place the pillow on the elastic straps. It ended up at the base of the back and just slides down if not there anyways.I liked the look of this and wanted to spice up my battlestation with it, so I was excited to test it out after assembly. I immediately noticed the right arm was wobbly and assumed I had failed to tighten it properly. This was not the case, as it was firmly tightened. There was simply nothing I could do about this, so I have to be cautious everytime I push up to get out of the chair. After a few hours of gaming I noticed that the bottom cushin had defailted and I was basically sitting on the plywood base.It was and has been uncomfortable ever since. In the 2 months since I purchased this chair the left arm has started to wobble and the right arm is even worse. I have decided to go back to the cheap amazon basics chair because it was more durable and more comfortable.Other Thoughts: The leg prop is a novelty at best. It too is weak, wobbly, and poorly secured. The back pillow on the straps is flat and useless now as well, and I removed the head pillow because it strapped around the top in an uncomfortable position. So if you want a chair that looks cool, this is your chair. If you want one that isn't rickety and doesn't leave you sore, consider another chair.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"91 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1536796800000}

I am able to recline all the way down, pull the leg rest out and just relax while watching a movie.  Also I play bunch of pc games for hours and find it very comfortable for the hours I spend playing.With that said why did I give it a 3 star?1st reason is the arm rests easily came loose and now rock side to side, I thought maybe the screws danced out.  I got my tools  pull the screws out and apply some thread lock so it doesn't come loose again.  Nope, the screws weren't loose at all, it was torqued down to the same as when I first put it together.  So I do not get why its going side to side like this.2nd reason is the shock on provided with the chair.  At first it was nice and sturdy and keeping me comfortable playing my games at the appropriate height to my desk.  Within 1hr of gaming or sitting in the chair I find myself lower as if the shock has a leak and just keeps on getting lower.Would I buy this chair again...I most certainly would, I just hope by then the manufacturer would improve the shock so it doesn't start failing within 5 months.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1620172800000}

The jury's still out on that. 3 stars because it was easy to put together & it hasn't totally fallen apart yet <--more on that.I don't use the head cushion because it just pushes my head too much forward than where my back is with the lower cushion. I feel as if they sacrificed some comfort with the design of this chair.  They could've increased the curvature on the lower part of the back rest, which would've made this chair much better.  There's a gap there once you tighten the screws fully, even with the back fully upright.Being able to tilt the back is pretty nice, which is necessary if you're going to use the footrest. The footrest feels pretty flimsy, as if it'd break if I put any pressure on it with my legs.The arms on this chair suck. I'll break the Allen wrench if I tried to get the nuts any tighter, and yet they still wobble. I  keep the chair locked in 1 position, so there's not much sliding moving, but these things don't stay tight.My other negative is that I'm concerned that this chair might give out.  I'm 5'7\" 160 & I hear a loud crack every other time I sit down on it. It sounds as if the wood base of the seating has cracked\/is cracking.

I'm 6'2 so fully extended it caches me about mid calf leaving the rest hanging off.  The lumbar and head pillow are nice but as it's not clear on the description they are not built into the chair.  They are held on with straps which when installed look like afterthoughts. It would be much nicer if they were built in and then you wouldn't have the straps showing.

The immediate comfort difference was incredible and the support pretty good too! The chair was pretty easy to assemble though the Velcro fabric is near impossible to pull into place and line is left undone because it physically doesn\u2019t seem long enough.After hardly a week I noticed some gripes right away. The foam in the arm rests blew out already meaning that there\u2019s none left or it\u2019s completely deflated and not recovering where I typically rest my upper forearm\/elbow. It feels like I\u2019m resting on plastic. Next, the foam in the lumbar support is already deflated and not recovering either. Lastly, the foam in the chair, while not AS bad, has deflated a bit and is a harder surface to sit on now. Not entirely unbearable yet, but it\u2019s let comfortable in longer gaming sessions already only after a few weeks of ownership.For the price, I would have saved up another $100-$150 and went with the next step up to brand name chairs. It seems this one is built mostly using cheap foam for support. The faux leather holds up well and I don\u2019t see any stretching, scratches, or tearing which is good.Lastly; this chair is sooooooo too heavy. If you have carpet, even low carpet, and you try to scoot forward then you\u2019ll almost always have to catch yourself from falling forward.

The seat is comfortable though and I've sat in it now for hours long sessions without problems. The lumbar pillow has its uses but I find that the pillow can be uncomfortable depending if your reclined or not. I remove the head pillow when sitting up but use it laying back. I am surprised to find how stable it is when completely reclined and was completely ready to fall back (which I didn't). The footrest is the second reason why I got this chair. It is sturdy enough and works easily, but maybe some extra WD40 wouldn't hurt. Even though it doesn't seem like it'd be comfortable since it only extends a short distance, when reclined it provided enough support.  Sitting up isn't as comfortable but is more for when I sit with my legs crossed does the foot rest come in handy.

Due to working for a living and actually having to lift things in my work day, I can say that it has only added to and instigates back pain at this point.The arms were always a bit wiggly as well, but it has been quite quiet despite that. If it squeaked, it would've been replaced long ago. It seems that most of the effort in this chair was put into the frame.I'd say if you need a chair, this definitely is one. In two years however, it will not.For this price I would ask more from your chair, but I'd honestly advise you to save just a bit more for a higher chair with better quality padding. The fact that their customer service doesn't even know the density of the foam they use or have a spec sheet referencing it just highlights the general lack of care for the product they are selling.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1606262400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Uncomfortable seat, decent for price","reviewDescription":"At first, I had no complaints. I was just excited to get a nice chair and being that this is the first and only gaming chair I\u2019ve owned, I had no idea what to expect. Assembly was  extremely easy and didn\u2019t take hardly any time at all. After some months of owning it, the arm rests are wobbly and uncomfortable at times. The foot rest feels weak and I always am careful not to put a lot of pressure on it in fear of it breaking. Like I feel nervous just putting my whole body weight down on them and I\u2019m only ~190 pounds. The biggest thing however is the cushion. I play games pretty often and sometimes I\u2019m sitting in that chair for hours at a time, and this is where I really get a sense of how durable the chair is. The seat cushion is horrible and even after only 1-2 hours without any additional cushion, you can feel your bottom starting to hurt from sitting. You could argue that sitting for hours on any chair could cause pain and I kinda agree but the cushion just isn\u2019t supportive at all. I now sit on the chair with 2 pillows on it for extra support and it still bothers me at times. Overall this chair can be useful and good for its price but if you play for long periods of time expect to have to buy another seat cushion to put on top of it","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1593302400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Very little butt cushion","reviewDescription":"After reading alot of the reviews on this chair and others I figured this chair would be great since it had mostly good reviews. Its incredibly easy to assemble and overall is a great chair even for someone with my size (6'2\" 280lbs). The only complaint I have is that there is very little cushion on the butt area. After a very short time of gaming or studying (about an hour) my butt starts hurting to the point that I have to stand up for a bit. Everything else is great. The arm rests do get wobbly just like others have mentioned but its really not an issue. Just tighten them back up. Or don't. I could care less that mine are wobbly, it honestly doesn't bother me. The foot rest is a joke for people my height but once again I could care less, I didn't buy a computer chair for a foot rest. The back support is great. The lumbar support pillow is in the perfect position and the head rest pillow is nice. It is weird though because I ordered one for my friend shortly after I got mine and his has more padding in the butt area. Mine is gray and his is green. Don't think the color makes a difference as its probably just a manufactured error? No clue. Anyway if you're a big dude like me I'd highly recommend you add a butt cushion to your cart to go along with this chair.

Customer service was easy enough to deal with as well -  that goes a long way for the consumer.  The armrests are attached to the back so they are non-adjustable for gaming but they are much more comfortable than many of the adjustable plastic ones in the market (why anyone would pay $500+ for a chair with plastic armrests is beyond me). The design of the pull out foot rest is manual and usable (we did have to replace the first chair because the first footrest broke) so if you are hard on things beware the footrest design is less than robust. Also the second chair feels more comfortable than the first one which may be subjective but makes me wonder about supplier quality standards. In this case, I mark it as a win.

It does not lock into place so as soo as you use any pressure it just leans back. This is something that is essentially impossible to work around. So while i was reasonably okay with it for the first six months, now I cannot use it anymore. Which is sad because while it is not the most expensive chair out there, it is not cheap either.UPDATE: Their customer service is very good. I put in a warranty request, they needed my order info and a picture of my chair with my name, and they have requested another chair be delivered. I am adding a star for their quick response time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1617926400000}

I would say used, not used great condition. I think partial refund would be necessary for 5 stars.The chair is very comfy pretty easy to put together by yourself, I put the seat on backwards by accident so it took me 40 minutes all together.

The arm tests are at perfect height, the wheels roll great on office carpet, and I'm over all happy I upgraded to this chair from my 30 dollar office chair. I havent used the footrest yet but I think its better then most people make it out to be, I will use it in the future.If the back of the chair didnt have a huge scuff it would be 5 stars.

I'd chalk this up to being on hinges except that the left  arm is significantly more affected than the right. I noticed this less than an hour after assembly so not a matter of having been leaned on heavily or otherwise abused.The padding on both arms collapsed and deformed within two days. The seat, back and both cushions have held up just fine though. I feel like they are padded with a different material, doesn't feel anywhere near as dense.The leg rest.. I really, really wanted to love that, but for a tallish guy (I'm 6ft 1in) the leg rest ends just below the knee. It leaves you in a really awkward position and makes you feel like the weight of your lower legs hanging off the edge of the rest is going to wrench the whole undercarriage off. There's no sign of damage actually occurring yet though so that last bit may be in my head.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1614729600000}

{"reviewTitle":"3.5 stars - Decent, but not Great","reviewDescription":"I purchased this chair as a cheap secondary option for my current work from home status. My primary chair is a DXRacer to give you some comparison.Price: Good, the price seems reasonable for the quality.Assembly: Relatively easy. Most chair assemblies are pretty similar.Comfort: Good, there is a reasonable amount of padding.Quality: Ok, but not great. Finish is a bit rough in some areas, casters while serviceable are not particularly good. The lack of any friction holding the leg rest in also means as you lean forward it slides out and hits the back of your legs regularly as well.Strength: Ok, but not great. I can already feel the chair flex and give a bit in some areas. While I'm sure it will be fine for a while it will eventually fail.Compared to the DXRacer this chair is much less expensive which is nice, but it is no where near as sturdy. Most default casters are pretty bad even on the DXRacer, so replacing them is highly recommended. But there is a very strong firmness in the DXRacer where it does not flex it all, the DXRacer will be a very long lasting chair while the Respawn will have a relatively short life I expect.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1587513600000}

{"reviewTitle":"For the price I am very impressed","reviewDescription":"So I am coming from the Homall Gaming Chair. I had it for I believe two years. Without scrolling up to see the price, I think it is about 40$ difference. For that 40$ difference you gain a padded footrest, MUCH more padded seats, and padded arm rests that adjust with the chair's recline. If you game for long periods of time, work from home, etc. these differences are well worth the added cost. WELL WORTH!To do a tiny test, I put my hand on the back center of the Homall, and pushed forward into the sitting area. You could easily see my hand pushing through the back. On this chair, my hand was stopped quickly by a support piece (probably plywood, but still).It was kind of a pain in the butt to put the screw in the hole for the back chair, but other than that, this is an upgrade in every way. Frankly, I think it might be underpriced, or the chair I came from might be overpriced.

The footrest was the main reason I picked this one over their others and it's great, I thought it was gonna be small but nope fits perfectly when I lay back. I had to wait for them to get back in stock and it was worth the wait! I will say if you have more money and you don't care for the footrest look at the RSP-100 The arms on this one are not that great while all their other chairs have amazing arms. Overall this is still worth the 5-stars and very much worth the price.Over 4 years later.I'm leaving my original 5 stars. I saw some negative reviews and honestly, In my opinion at the price point, there is not a single chair I would have rather had for 4 years. I as of today have replaced it with the Razer Iskur gaming chair and let me tell you I'm giving the razer chair a week to impress me before getting the Respawn 110 V2 chair because I love the original that much. As for the chair, I replaced it mainly because it has been 4 years. The handles are slightly loose from when I got it and the arm rest is starting to wear out. Also when I sit the chair lowers to the ground and I have to pull the handle to get it back. But 4 years later and besides that it works great. I don't think the Razer iskur is going to be a good replacement which is how i ended up here lol.

No trouble with the chassis or wheels. It's been very good for long gaming sessions and raids on Saturday nights. No complaints.I over did it a little on research and finally settled on the Respawn 110. It was a little late coming, due to weather. But, it was packaged fantastically. A breeze to put together, I had it done in 15 minutes while talking to my sister on the phone. The head pillow and the lower lumbar pillow were a little hard to deal with (personal preference), so I took those back off; the chair reclines a little stiffly, but that's fine. I do really like the lock feature so I can keep it in position of slightly reclined while gaming. It's very comfortable and it's the right pink. It matches my tower and desk without looking like Barbie's Gaming Room Gone Wild. It had a little squeak to it, but some lithium grease took care of that. The instructions say to use lubricant every six months anyway. I had read about some troubles with the arm rest. for those who have the wobbly arm rests, it's the way the screws fit in there and it needs pressure while the arm rests are being applied to the chair.

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing Chair for the Price!","reviewDescription":"Our beginning goal was to get chairs with adjustable lumbar and neck support without paying a ton. I've always heard people call \"gaming chairs\" a joke. But after looking through many different chairs these lined up exactly with what I was looking for and the price was low enough for me to gamble on it.I will start by saying the reason I picked these over other \"gaming chairs\" is for the arm design. These are not just pieces of plastic that stick up, they are nice arms and have cushions on them. I was skeptical on the leg rest, but that's where the gamble came in.Assembly: The directions are easy to follow, the bolts are labeled, it goes together real easily. I was very impressed with the build quality while putting it together.Comfort: It's great. It could maybe use slightly more cushion on the seat, but that really is nit picking. The leg rest really surprised me. I have reclined and caught some naps in my chair. They are extremely comfortable when reclining because of the lumbar and neck support.  And the arm rests are nicely cushioned as well.  The lumbar and neck support pillows were a bit big on day one, but after that they are the perfect size once they broke in.Build Quality: I was really impressed. Everything felt very solid, the leather doesn't feel like cheap fake leather. I've had numerous chairs in the $100 - $200 range. If this was a blind test I would have never guessed this chair to be in that range. I would have guessed $350ish easily.Summary: This is a very impressive chair, then you factor in the price.

{"reviewTitle":"Great chair and value","reviewDescription":"Update 5\/28\/19: Only problem I'm having with the chair is the arm rest bolts not staying tight.  I'm assuming this is due to the reclining feature and the more you use it, the more it will need retightening.  I suggest finding a happy medium for reclining and leave it there.  Everything else is great. and its really comfortable for hours of gaming.  I still don't feel confident with the leg weight on the foot rest.I bought this chair despite all the reviews I saw.  I found putting the chair together was super easy and took less than 30 minutes.  I wouldn't do it on a hard wood floor like I did.  Slid around too much lol.  The bolts and washers were lubricated which was really nice and it came with 2 different size allen wrenches and spare bolts for the arms.I saw in reviews several people complained about the back being crooked.  I resolved this by being smart and not screwing in the bolts all the way.  I adjusted the back by moving and centering it and then I tightened the bolts in.  It makes a world of difference when you use a bit of common sense when putting items together.I do like that it appears the chair can break down easy for moving.  You don't have to move it as one big chair if you don't want to.  Its such easy installation, reinstallation would be a breeze.The wheels are pvc and creates a soft, smooth glide across hardwood.  I have zero fear of scratches to my floor.  And the rolling is super quiet.  The lumbar support pillow is nice and the neck pillow rests a bit above my shoulder blades.  But honestly, Who leans their head all the way back to game?  Generally gamers lean back while still holding their head up.Lifting the chair to the highest setting was really high for me, so I lowered it some.  I'm 5'6\".  I really like the armrests and I leave the back recline open and not locked.  Its sorta on a spring so when you get up, it moves with you.  When you sit down and lean back, it glides easy with you and keeps you in the position most comfortable to your liking.I have one con.  The foot rest.  It seems a tab unsteady for me.  When I rest my legs on it, it dips down just a bit.  If you obviously apply too much pressure, I'm fairly certain it will come off.  Otherwise I'm really happy!

Was doing research and looking for my first gaming chair purchase because I refused to spend $300+ on a DX Racer lol. Finally caved in and decided to go with this chair after months of looking at different ones (mostly because I liked the design of this chair) and said to hell with it. Setup was pretty easy with instructions. Got slightly confused on one part but that was about it, and had it all assembled in maybe 30 minutes. I've seen reviews complaining about a ''strong odor'' and how it was unbearable at times. Definitely does have an odor. Almost like that new car smell....maybe slightly stronger but nothing that was what the reviews made it seem. I could smell that odor in my room for about 2-3 weeks before it completely faded away.....so yea maybe do what I did and open up some windows in your room if it's that much of an issue or spray some air freshener whatever.But outside of that, I've been completely impressed and happy with this purchase as my first official ''gaming chair''. Love the look, comfortable, easy to assemble, recline feature works great (even slept in it a few times no lie I'm about 175pounds) and the lumbar support works surprisingly well! Again this is my first gaming chair. I didn't even really know what lumbar support was for. Why have a stiff pillow sticking out into my lower back? LOL! But I tell you what.....ever since I attached it to the chair it hasn't move since. The other pillow though(the one for your head or neck I guess) I couldn't rock with it. Just didn't feel right in my opinion. Only thing that's pretty trash on the chair is the footrest underneath. Shouldn't even be included. Feels like it could snap at any moment when I put my big legs on it LOL! That's not the reason why I wanted this chair though so didn't really matter to me. But yea.....this chair is excellent overall for the price you pay compared to other chairs. Came shipped nicely as well. Box wasn't beat up and look like it was in a boxing ring with Mike Tyson in his prime for 12 rounds like some reviews said, but I guess it all depends on the day and who's the carrier unfortunately.Will be doing a full video review on my youtube channel soon that I'll later post here, but yea. 100% pleased with this chair considering what I paid.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1529798400000}

Did a few hour gaming\/homework session and the chair didn't fatigue, droop or lose it's recline angle throughout. I have seen some people say the back of the chair does not hold itself in place but that may be a faulty unit or incorrect assemble from my point of view because the mechanism to lock the rear of the chair in place should not be able to fail very easily. I have seen people say the arm rests get loose over time so I will see how they hold up after a few months of me hitting them out of anger after getting killed some kid on cod. With the way it's put together I would definitely recommend using some extra threadlike on top of what is already applied to the hardware since the screws will inevitable back themselves out, or keep the correct allen wrench size handy to re-tighten screws after a while of use.

{"reviewTitle":"Solid value","reviewDescription":"Assembly was standard for a chair, so I would consider it quite easy. The quality is absolutely adequate, and may even exceed expectations depending on how picky you are. I have used my fair share of chairs in my day, and would probably expect to pay over $200 for something like this if I were to walk into an office supply store like staples. The neck pillow is a welcomed touch, and the lumbar support does it's job. It stays in place fairly well, but may slide on you if you move around a lot. I cant really complain about that since it is in fact adjustable. I would rather it slide once in a while than be fixed in (the wrong) place. The footrest is honestly the only thing that seems like a gimmick. It feels a bit flimsly and tends to catch, but I added some silicone to the rails and that solved the awkward catching issue. Still, not something that I am in love with. Nonetheless, I would happily pay the same $150ish for this chair with or without the footrest.Other notes:-the PU\/Leather (whatever it is) seems suprisingly thick and durable compared to some other chairs that I have had. It should hold up well. It isnt the softest material in the world, but I am certainly happy with it.-The arms arent adustable, but they will move with the back of the chair when tilted.- It is an adequate size. As long as you arent enormous, you should fit. I am over 6'2 220lbs and I fit just fine. Somebody of my height would probably fit up to about 315 lbs. The piston on the chair would give you trouble at that point anyway.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1575244800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Honest review.","reviewDescription":"It's amazing. I bought the red chair. I've been having serious back pains and as a full time student doing 40+ hours in a chair each week it's not helping so I decided to try some supportive options that didn't work well (back and seat cushions) and I finally caved after months of my family trying to convince me and bought this chair. It's amazing. I should've ordered it sooner. My chair came in yesterday. I put it together in maybe an hour or so, by myself (It may be easier with help). It was easy to assemble. The directions are just pictures but it is super simple and easy to figure out. The tools and hardware are included and labeled.It's comfy. It looks pretty stiff but it's somehow still comfortable and it's supportive. The back support is adjustable (whether you want the cushion(s) higher or lower or not at all) and great for my back pain. The foot rest is perfect for when I get tired. The chair reclines as needed and it's amazing!!!I highly recommend it. I'm not a gamer but I sit in a chair for long hours studying. We now have 3 in the house.

Old son and he was so excited when we opened this box. He had a much cheaper gaming chair for the last 2 years and it was falling apart. When we went to break down the old chair for trash, we found a thin layer of recycled pieces of foam on top of a piece of plywood, and it literally had shoe strings tied to the metal sides holding stuff together. It was like the material held everything together. We were blown away what was inside of it. Be careful what you buy. The Respawn chair on the other hand has a very this firm but comfortable cushion that actually feels like a solid piece as they show in there pictures. The arm rests padded and connected to the chair on sides and go back. They will not get wobbly like most chairs. Great support on the back and beck as well. We are so pleased with this chair. My son has the coolest chair out of all his friends. My husband suggested to a co worker, who could not think of anything to get his son for his birthday, one of these chairs. He immediately got on amazon and purchased. His son loved it too. Now my husband wants one. Lol","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1588291200000}

Finally, after the chair was complete I was excited to try it out to find absolute zero comfort. The bottom just feels like your sitting on a cardboard. Ignoring the comfort, I went to start playing GTA and half way through a mission I heard a LARGE pop noise. I was scared to move because I wasn't sure what broke. Looks like the recliner that the manufacturer assembled completed busted AND there was no way to fix it because the rod was in the way to screw it back together.

For anyone out there who needs to go get hardware to fix this problem, you\u2019ll need three 5\/16 bolts with hex head and the matching nut for each.

If they built the base to be tilted back by 6 to 8 degrees, they might be more comfortable.Please don't get this chair if you care about ergonomics.

I did have to get the first chair I ordered replaced because it was missing parts to it.  I was missing wheels, the wheelbase, and one of the arm rests.  That would leave a beanbag more functional than this.  It also had a bag of zip ties for some crazy reason in the box.  Maybe as an alternative to put it together?  Judging from the condition of the box, I'm pretty sure parts fell out during the delivery process.  I had it returned, and they shipped me a replacement quickly.  The box, although still looked rough, was in much better condition and had all the parts.  It was easy to assemble and ready in no time.  Coming from someone with no gaming chair experience, this is an amazing chair.  If you are looking for a chair that is comfortable with decent performance and at a great value, I highly recommend this.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668643200000}

I've had a couple of rockers and smaller desk chairs but nothing like this.The chair came well packaged and there aren't many pieces.  Assembly was easy.  I completed it myself in about 10 min, max (another 5 min find that sweet spot to sit in).The material is stated as faux leather.  You wouldn't know it.  It has a nice smooth feel.  Not that slick feel of pleather but soft decent leather. Like you can fee the texture of the design in the leather.  If that makes sense.  The arm rests are indeed curved and well padded.  My only draw back is the left arm has a little wiggle.  But it clears right up once I recline.  No biggieThe seat is well padded and very comfortable.  The foot rest slides out and flips open.  The cushion there is very good as well.  Many a zoom meeting have caught me with my feet up.This chair reclines back a good amount and the head cushion is very soft as well as the lumbar support.  They attach with thick elastic straps and are adjustable.Simply, it's a pleasure to sit in for the money.  I'm a head hunter by trade so my day is spent on the phone and infront of a screen.  Some rock blues and I'm in this bad boy all da long comfy.And yes I do roll it out to the livingroom to game.

{"reviewTitle":"One year in - still amazing","reviewDescription":"I've had this chair for fourteen months. I cannot recommend it enough for gamers and fellow streamers \/ content creators.All of the photos I've added that were taken on tile are from 6\/7\/18 when the chair arrived and was being put together, the photo taken with it on carpet is from 8\/2\/19 just after wiping the chair down with leather car interior cleaner.Negatives:-- The arm rests eventually got a little wobbly. HOWEVER, this is a bad type of arm rest regardless of the chair quality, the angles make it prone to wobbling. You can tighten the connections as needed to avoid too much movement. Also do not drag it by the arm rests, that encourages the issue, the sides of the shoulder area are great for guiding it.-- After a few months the piston broke, wouldn't rise and stay risen. Support promptly sent me a free replacement and emailed a suggested video guide to help. The piston replacement was challenging but as expected after some research, I had to hit things harder than initially thought, be prepared. I highly suggest a second set of hands for this.Positives:-- Day one through now fourteen months on, the chair is comfortable in a supportive way (this is not a lounger or casual office chair!!) which is ideal for a part time streamer pulling 20+ live hours a week on top of editing and general maintenance. I also have a shoulder injury that has become drastically better since swapping to this chair, the encouragement of proper posture does wonders.-- The material is fairly resistant to sweat and dust, easy to clean. I don't eat in my chair so I can't speak to the effects of food on it.-- The building instructions and tools were simple to put into action. I did have help, it took maybe thirty to forty minutes with extra care for precision. I also suggest a second set of hands for portions of that process.-- The foot\/leg rest (more like a calf rest) is comfortable, fairly sturdy in and out of use, many chairs don't have one or are given poorly designed leg rests.-- It arrived quickly, order on 5\/31\/18, came to the door 6\/7\/18.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1564704000000}

It is a cookie cutter mold of every single gaming chair on the market, which all of them unfortunately seem to have the same issue, because they are all made by the same company, or made in the same style.1. Its not very comfortable. The padding in the back is ok, but the but padding is badly done and ends up wearing down over time. 2. The \" leather\" feels like plastic and is somewhat abrasive during movement.  The worse offender is the armrest. Not only is it not even remotely comfortable to lay your arms on, (by the way after a few months the padding will move around and flatten so much its almost not existent), it has become actually painful to lay my arms on. The mixing of it being the cheap plastic covering and the non existant padding, causing my skin to actually show abrasions after long sessions of game play.3. The arm rest tends to loosen and will require it to be retightened. I have already striped a screw and can't tighten it anymore without replacing the screw.4. Perhaps the silliest problem that I have with the chair is that the legs rest don't seem to fit an adult leg. It has one length setting and can't be adjusted, so if your legs are too long they are just going to hang all the way over the leg rest and its awkward. It also makes the chair dip an an angle when I have my feet on the leg rest and it makes my body slide down in the chair. The base isn't wide enough to give your legs room to spread out either so using it is just not practical.  If you can find something better do so. I just can't recommend this chair.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1609632000000}

If you want longevity, REAL back support & a cushy tushy for life -- buy an office chair**SO, with that being said - one month in & I love this chair. Comfortable, super easy to assemble, great for posture, adjusts to vast height options & inclination. You do, however, have to manually pull the leg rest out any time you want to use it; it\u2019s not an automatic recliner (I don't use it anyway). A complaint I saw about the armrests is generally true; My right armrest DOES wobble slightly even though I believe it's screwed in as much as it can be (manufacturing issue I suppose).This was a replacement chair. Nothing was wrong with the first chair, they just sent it to me without the tool kit to actually put it together (screws & Allen wrench). Amazon made me send the entire order back for a replacement instead of just shipping me a tool kit for it (lol), so make sure EVERYTHINGS\u2019 in the box before attempting to assemble, because trying to fit all the pieces back in the box to send back was an absolute pain. I left the box open & UPS came to pick it up from my house (because I don\u2019t drive). If that's an option you'd like to utilize, I suggest calling customer service to fill them in on the situation first & let them know you need it picked up from your house, otherwise -- it's on you to get it back to your postal service (& it's heavy).**UPDATE: Almost 1 year later, still a great chair.

They didn't even bother putting it in another box to protect it. The guys that handle these boxes obviously throw them around.

The guy carrying it had to hold the bottom so stuff wouldn't fall out....Also it took them like 5 business days to ship it, but it arrived on time.Now that is out of the way, nothing was damaged...It was easy to assemble, Obviously well built. This is the sturdiest feeling computer chair I've probably ever owned. The cushions feel very firm and can't easily be pressed down with your hand.

{"reviewTitle":"High quality. Very impressed.","reviewDescription":"Wow, I am very impressed with the quality of this chair, and I'm very picky so that says a lot. The leather material is very soft and actually FEELS like real leather. I've owned more expensive chairs that felt fake. It even has a fresh almost new car smell which I appreciate. The head and lumbar pillows serve their purpose well. The foot rest is very supportive for your legs and the rubbery wheels roll smoothly on my carpet without the need of a car mat. My only complaint so far is it does feel rather hot while sitting in it for awhile, however this isn't anything wrong with the chair; it's just not perforated leather so fair warning it's going to be hot. Also, if I am to nitpick for a second, I can't rock in it. The lean is either locked in place or free movement and it's very free movement so when I lean back the recoil isn't very conducive to rocking.  It's definitely a set where you like it and lock it kind of situation, but I can live with that. The chair is very comfortable and I'm glad I went with Respawn. It shipped in two days prime, I actually got it a day earlier than expected, and assembly was very straightforward. I literally just built it and have been sitting in it for awhile so these are just my first impressions.3 months update: The chair is still holding up. I use the leg rest a lot more than I initially thought I would and it's still working well. The foam on the end of the arm rests have been permanently sunk in, all the way down to the plastic and I can feel the sharp point of the screw if I put too much weight on my elbows. That's a bit disappointing but not enough to take away any stars. I still really enjoy this chair.

{"reviewTitle":"Buy this chair!  You won't find one like this (at least not in this price range)!","reviewDescription":"I am that breed of human who subscribes to the notion that desk chairs should never cost more than $100-$200.  Unfortunately, due to this belief, my wallet has suffered much, as I've had to repeatedly replace these inferior, \"disposable\" desk chairs that you will only find in this price range.That said, I've just received my Respawn 110, and so far, I simply love it!  I was really worried about the seat cushion not having the density to support my weight (male, 200 lbs, 5'10\"), as experience has taught me that this is the feature where manufacturers tend to cut the greatest corners with.  When it comes to desk chairs, nothing is more disheartening, for me, than when your butt starts to press up against the plywood base\/metal support beams due to low quality cushioning, causing your tailbone to get really sore.  However, I have not experienced this with my Respawn.  The seat cushion is actually quite dense and almost feels like memory foam.Unless you want to pay $400 for a Secret Lab chair, you're not going to find a chair of this quality in this price range.Lastly, after doing my research, I decided on this chair because this is the only company I found that offers a 2-year warranty.  No chair manufacturer in this price range will stand behind their product like this one, so that gave me confidence to go ahead with the purchase, and so far I am really happy!  We will have to see what comes of the dreaded \"loose armrest\" issue, but I will update this review if that issue should arise.EDIT:  It's been one month and the seat cushion has already become flattened, and the arm rests are starting to wobble.  I don't see these as that big of a deal, because I can always buy a seat cushion, and I can periodically tighten the armrest screws.  In the end, I still think this chair is worth the price and I would be it again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1588809600000}
{"reviewTitle":"1 month in and it's still good","reviewDescription":"For the price, you can't beat this.  That being said, I do have some grievances I'd like to address here.Firstly the pillows.  They're too thick.  I constantly find myself taking off and putting back on the lumbar support pillow because it's too thick, so my back starts to hurt, then without the support, my back starts to hurt.  They arrive much thicker, but will compress down some with a little use, but even then are still too thick for me.The seat cushion was fantastic for the fist couple of days, but once given time to contour to my body, I can feel my pelvis resting on the wood base of the seat.  Now, keep in mind that I am an averagely large guy, weighing in just shy of 200 pounds.  If you weigh probably under 170, this probably shouldn't be an issue, but if they were even a quarter inch thicker or maybe a touch more dense, the seat cushions would have been perfect for anyone up to my weight.The tolerances in this product are good but not great.  The seat wobbles a decent bit, which has me worried about the longevity of the chair.  The arms also wiggle a little and I worry that leaning against them too hard will eventually break them.The reclining feature is 10\/10.  Great mechanic for reclining, great angles.  It reclines further forward than you'll ever want and further back as well.The height adjust leaves some to be wanted.  It doesn't go too low, but it goes decently high enough.Some people have been complaining about defects and smells, but I didn't find any of those.  It smells just fine, and was packaged SUPER nice.  There was a little damaging on the packaging, but the product itself was more than safe.Overall I really couldn't be happier with the product for the price.  It's sleek, it works really well, and it was super competitively priced.  I love the look and it's great for sessions of like 4 hours of sitting.  Not a whole lot more than that at a time, though after sitting still for 4 hours, you should probably get up and stretch out anyways.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1536019200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Comfort at a comfortable price...","reviewDescription":"Took around 35 minutes to put together, all screws in my kit screwed in like butter, didn't take much force, and most importantly didn't strip. Every chair part was in pristine condition, it had a strong pleather smell for several days (which was my only negative experience, it is pleather, so it's expected) the pleather quality is actually nice doesn't feel too thin, felt tough but I'd still be cautious not to get too rough with it. The stitching was nice with no defects. It's a really comfortable chair and fits my size perfectly, the seat feels nice and firm, which is good for breaking in- though it would have been better if there was an extra inch of padding in the buttocks area since most of the bodyweight is focused on that area when it gets broken in it might get uncomfortable from the lack of adequate cushion. If taken care of I'm expecting the cushioned areas that support weight would last for a year or more with 4 hours a day use, this depends on how many hours a day you're expected to sit including your weight and how well you take care of it. I'm 6'1\" 215lbs, the lumbar and head pillow support feels great and can be height adjusted or removed with ease. The leg rest is a plus, the chair reclines far back- sleeping in this chair is an option for those who like to take power naps. The armrests can't be adjusted manually, but when the chair is reclined they adjust to the angle. I'll update after a few months of use, with all that said, for now I'd highly recommend this chair, especially at this price point.Update 4\/25\/20: 5 to 4 stars due to the seat not providing enough cushion for the buttocks during mediocre sitting periods, 2-5 hrs. The padding may have already \"settled\" and is not maintaining its seat comfort.

{"reviewTitle":"How to fix the noise and more","reviewDescription":"I'll address the negatives first.1. The NOISE this thing makes that everyone experiences when leaning back. It's a loud pop. It's ANNOYING!!! EVERY time you lean back. BANG.Now...here is the explanation and the fix. All that noise is, is the locking washers moving under your weight. The mechanism used to lock the position is a series of washers clamped together. The rod they are located on, is slightly smaller, so when you lean back, the washers shift against that rod, making the noise.THE FIX. Take the seat off. Add some lithium grease to the lock washers, and push the back up and down a dozen or so times. Then, adjust the lock nut on the lock mechanism so that it is JUST tight enough to allow the back to move when the handle is unlocked. Done.2. The footrest is a little less robust than I would want. Time will tell if it snaps off.3. It's a bit warm. The material doesn't breathe, at all.Now for the rest of the review. I am 5'10, 220. It's comfy, fits me well, and so far is great at my desk whether typing a silly review, or holding my controller shooting zombies. The footrest is a nice feature. Not perfect, but definitely nice. I get why some people might be upset about loose armrests and such but...well...locktite. Haven't had a problem. The wheels are SUPER quiet, so that's a plus. It raises high enough for the arms to be level with the desk for typing, and lowers enough to push under.Is it a perfect chair, certainly not. There are far better. For the price, and for the short time I have had it, I like it. The key will be longevity.

Initially I was told it would be here between June 1st 2018 and June 5th 2018. Low and behold, Amazon cited me at May 30th 2018 ONLY for it to arrive May 25th 2018. I am not sure what happened AT ALL, but I am extremely happy that it only took two days for it to arrive. Great job!Now, receiving it was a slightly different experience. The box was left on my porch looking as if it had already been opened and taped back together. I'm not that easily upset though, so with a head tilt picked it up and took it inside to open it. Everything was present, wrapped in bubble wrap, and undamaged. Great. The instructions were bad to say the least, but the chair assembly was fairly easy and quick though. Just a note to those who wish to make this purchase. I purchased the Black\/Blue to match my computer and peripherals color scheme and absolutely love it. Everything about the chair works as intended. It raises\/lowers and reclines\/lifts up without any issues or weird clicking noises, etc. As of right now, it is sturdy and comfortable!

It is high enough to work with my gaming desk.  The leather feels good and soft and I love the leg rest.  There's two things that keeps this from being five stars, and that's the wobbly arms and loose leg rest.The leg rest slides under the seat of the chair, but has nothing to secure it, so it moves around under the seat a bit.  If you tuck your legs up under you seat a bit while you are sitting normally, you will constantly hit it and make it move, or if you move the chair too hard you hear it rattle.  It's not a big deal, more of an annoyance you get used to and learn to ignore.I read about the arms for this chair being loose\/wobbly from some other reviews, but I know from experience these self assemble chairs usually have a tiny bit of wobble in the arms, so I was not really moved by that.  Now sitting in the chair even more than anticipated due to the whole social distancing\/quarantine situation, these arms have quite a bit of play in them.  No matter how much you tighten the bolts, they move around a lot.  I believe it's because the mechanism inside the seat that the arms are attached to are loose, not the arms themselves.  I cant tighten them anymore.  I've only had the chair approximately 3-4 weeks and the prospect of taking it apart and trying to send this monstrosity back doesnt appeal to me in the least.

Out of the box I was impressed by the weight of the parts. This is no flimsy, lightweight chair.I was able to put this together (no tools required - all needed tools\/parts included) in about 45 minutes with diagram-based instructions that were minimalist, but sufficient. People unfamiliar with putting stuff together might take longer, but you have what you need and it's not difficult. Because the parts are on the heavy side, if you're smaller, you might want some help on a couple of steps, but it's nothing major. All the needed parts were there, but the manufacturer thoughtfully included a sealed \"pod\" of extra parts just in case.Once assembled, the chair feels sturdy, and the connections seem firm and the parts work right (chair elevation and recline levers work well). I've had chairs with more padding in the seat, but it's at least decent, and I do like the adjustable lumbar support and neck\/head rest pads.I can't comment on the durability of the chair, having only assembled it yesterday. Others have complained about armrests becoming loose. Frankly, I can see where that might happen given that the very two bolts that secure them in place are also what are going to be weight bearing and torque bearing as you use the chair, so my suggestion is to minimize the use of the armrests to push off of when you stand up from or sit down in the chair. I'd point out that they needed to make the armrests this way because they have a hinge that flexes to allow the chair to recline, but it does seem like a potential weak point.I'll update this review after I've used the chair for a while.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1583884800000}

(NOTE that I use clothing with soft textiles, so it is possible that rougher textiles such as denim may damage it faster over time)- The cushioning isn't all that thick so after about 4 hours on it, I have to stand up and take a short break.

(This does have the positive side of forcing me to take breaks so it isn't strictly a negative for me)- The chair basically has 2 reclining positions, straight up and almost laying down (roughly 160 degrees). There is no resistance in the reclining so you are either laying down or locked in the straight up position.- Due to the reclining positions, the leg rest is basically just a gimmick as no one will realistically want to be fully reclined in the chair to use them, and they are downright uncomfortable to use in the straight position.- The arm rests are flimsy but not to the point that other reviewers have decribed.Overall, I would recommend this chair to someone on a budget who values the looks over the ergonomics.

It is completely unacceptable to sell a product without provision to attach these two pieces.  The instructions and product list did not include  nuts, yet they are essential to assembly.2.  The arms do not attach smoothly to the body of the chair.  It was not possible to securely attach the arm bolts to the body without additional leverage of a pair or pliers.  Using the pliers to turn the wrench provided, though, it was possible to get the arms closer to the body of the chair, which will hopefully eliminate the wiggle and weakness others have found with this design.3.  The neck pillow lacks adjustment.  There is no adjustment in the web attachment for the location of the pillow.In general, this is a comfortable chair, and I like the tilt mechanism and foot rest. But the assembly issues are a serious issue. Will post again after a longer period of use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1589414400000}

After a couple of weeks I either got adjusted to it or it started forming to the shape of my bum.As the pandemic has gone on I've been working from home full time and at the end of an 8 hour day I feel as I've been spanked with a wooden board the whole time.

You know those cast kits that you can buy for new born babies to make imprints of their hands? Well the seat cushion can do that with your bum. There are no tears in the seat or arms or back so that's good. The chair doesn't squeak and the wheels don't still function fine. The recline feature doesn't really lock but it only moves if you put a decent amount pressure.Overall, if you need a chair you can game in and doesn't break the bank, this one's fine.

The assembly was easy and only took about 30 minutes to build. I've been using it for a little over a week and everything is still tight and it feels very secure. As others have said, the leg rest does not feel very strong, flexing when weight is applied to it, though I have not broken it yet. The back cushion is very comfy and I like the included pillows. My only complaint with this chair is the bottom cushion. It feels flat and gives very little support. I cannot sit in this chair for more than an hour without getting sore and having to walk around. This may not be an issue for lighter weight people or those with more built in padding in the hind region but for me it's nearly a deal breaker.

{"reviewTitle":"should be half the price","reviewDescription":"Overall, covering material is cheap and thin, dont expect it to last long.the base, because of how far back the post mounts in the seat base, has an awkward forward lean, requiring you to put a bit too much pressure on your feet and have the height set perfectly to sit still for any period of time. I use this chair in a hunting blind, sitting still, comfortably for a long time is a must.reclining function only tilts the seat back portion of the chair back, the base stays at the aforementioned awkward forward angle, and when you recline you just feel like you are sliding forward off the chair.The lumbar pillow is way too big in my opinion, but im a big guy and my back fills the seat back shape pretty well on its own, may be better for others. it gets in the way if you do try to recline the chair.The neck pillow actually fits nicely for my height in its spot. It cant really be adjusted up or down though.The footrest portion is really a joke. Its noisy, clunky and has nothing to really retain it in the tucked away position. When using it, it sags and feels like something is just bound to snap off. It hits me just below the knees on the upper calf so your legs are cantilevered out pretty far if youre tall (I'm 6'1 250lb). I suppose in an emergency where you HAD to sleep in a chair you could sleep in this thing, but otherwise, the footrest might as well not exist for me.The casters are low to middling in quality, they have stupid hub cap looking things to make them look fancy, but they are just cheap plastic casters with no real bearing or beef to them. They will fail in no time. plan to buy nicer bigger wheels if you want this thing to roll reliably and quietly (again, i use this chair in a hunting blind)the arm rests as many other reviewers mention, are wobbly side to side, and the nuts inserted in the chair body look like they wont last very long, poor design.overall, I would be happy with the chair if i paid 60-70 bucks for it, but for the money, theres got to be better options than this one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1638403200000}

Not many redeeming qualities as a commercial product.","reviewDescription":"I'm very sorry to have to rant like this, but I've grown to require a certain standard of quality in the chairs that I buy, even in a midrange priced chair like the Respawn. I'm about 220lbs at 5'7\" at the time of this writing, and this chair just did not meet my needs.Pros: It is relatively easy to assemble, but the holes aren't always precise. You may end up with a weird tilt or off-center pan for your seat. It's a reasonably attractive chair - it looks nice. And, it reclines. And it has a \"footrest\".Cons: The armrests that fold as you recline the chair are flimsy, and as they're only attached to the frame of the chair in two points, they wobble outwards and inwards quite a bit. If you lift yourself up using your chair arms sometimes, be careful. They bend. It just screams mediocrity.The chair is narrow. I tend to sit crosslegged in my chairs - I was not able to do that with this one. If you're wide, or sit crosslegged, this chair isn't for you.The \"sliding footrest\" is flimsy, and doesn't so much \"slide\" as it does \"wobble\" out of the bottom with great coercion. It looks good, but that's it. Another example of sub mediocre building. If you need a solid footrest, this chair isn't for you.One last complaint: Returning this thing is a total pain. There are certain things that don't come back apart without... manipulation. The gas cylinder will not come back out of the legs, and the lever mechanisms won't come off of the top of the cylinder. There's no way I'm going to use a rubber mallet on this thing to take it apart, so I think the return package will just have to be a little... bulgy.Despite my misgivings, I hope that everyone who likes theirs enjoys it. :-)Caveat Emptor.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1655424000000}

There is specifically no seat tilt-adjustment available for this model. The seat position is fine in some settings - it sits usually at 90\u00b0, perpendicular to the ground - but there are so many times we'd rather have it tilted back or tilted forward that I'm having pretty big buyer's remorse. I didn't know I needed to keep an eye out for this, but I sure wish I did, maybe that's just a me problem. To be fair, it doesn't say it does. I did just assume it did - the description mentions height, back, and rotation adjustment. It does mention 4D adjustability though, which I find disingenuous. Additionally, I've purchased big-box store office chairs at half the price that have the big dial at the bottom you rotate to adjust pitch.Besides this, the chair is pretty great. Nice look, comfortably padded, back and leg rest make napping in this chair pleasant for the most part, and gaming in the chair is good for up to a few hours. Construction is a little on the flimsy side - the plastic of the arms and leg rest parts are quite light and wiggly, also with no metal core in the armrest, legrest, or roller base structure - but with the affordable price and number of extra features, I had expected this build quality.Would be an 8-9 out of 10 product for this price if it could just tilt out of the box. As it stands, I'm just procrastinating maybe spending another 50 on some kind of hacky mod to get tilt into this chair? Or just swallowing it and dropping another 150 to 200 on different chair, and giving this away to my kid nephews or something.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1654905600000}

So getting proper lower back support is vital. On top of that, I currently work full-time from home, so the chair I use a key part of my day.I'm not a huge person by any means of the word, I'm a 5'8\" male, weighing around 130lbs\/59kg.The first issue a noticed first was how noisy the chair was. I figured it may just need some time to get \"broken in\". After almost two weeks, anytime I adjust my body or the chairs placement, it makes very loud sounds. I normally tone it out using headphones while working. My home office is also my gaming center, which is located in my bedroom. The chair has on several occasions waken my wife up and she is not a light sleeper.The second issue is the provided lower back and headrest pillows. The headrest pillow either has to sit too high on the neck of the chair which just hits my head or too low placing through the provided holes which places it at the back of my shoulders. The lower back support takes a bit to adjust, seems like it holds the position alright for now but is just uncomfortable and caused a lot more pain than any type of relief sadly.The provided legs rest seems adequate, not too strong but alright if you don't have big legs.The cushion for the butt region which I was hoping would be a step up from the $70 chair I had before is also a disappointment. After not too long of a period, it already feels like I'm sitting on cardboard.With all that said, the chair does have nice looking aesthetics and was also easy to put together.Remember this was just my experience with the chair and I may have been unlucky and just received a bad one! Either way, if I could easily return it or exchange it for a new one I would but can't pay out of pocket to mail this bad boy.

For me, this is very 1-2 hours that I notice discomfort against my hips and spine.When you are sitting within this chair and want to rest your arms onto the chair, the arm rests are smaller than what you expect.  This could lead into several issues when sitting within this chair along with being at your desk as you would either have to rest your arms fully on the arm rests to be comfortable, or to have your arms floating above the arm rests.The wheels that this chair are cheaply made too, which you'll have to put in more effort to roll yourself away from your desk if you chose to get up for a moment or to roll towards your desk.If you need a chair that has proper ergonomic support for your back and can actually be used for long hours of sitting, this chair isn't it.  Stay away from \"gaming\" chairs as quality of these chairs varies from brand to brand, resulting in either perfect back support, but no proper cushioning or vice versa on any other issues one may encounter.

However, wanted something more than just a regular desk chair. This looked comfortable, like having the head and lumbar attachments, use both, make the chair even more comfortable. I have seen the other reviews for the chair about how the chair is uncomfortable if using for long periods of time and the foam doesn't hold up after time. I will update after six months of usage to inform the overall durability. So far so good! Only using the chair for about a week.UPDATE: August 9, 2019. I'm taking the five-star rating away and leaving with two due to the chair's looks. I like the way the chair looks, unfortunately, looks don't provide comfort in the end (pardon the pun).  I don't have to wait six months to update on the chair's cushion and comfortability. I am very disappointed within a very short period of time as the chair has become very uncomfortable.

I am now looking to buy a seat cushion to use while sitting on the chair due to my left leg falling asleep within 15 minutes of sitting on the chair because of having no support and feeling directly on cheekbones while sitting. All of those cushions are above $50.00. If I wanted to buy a chair to purchase a cushion to use on it afterward, would have purchased a cheaper chair, to begin with. I can't believe how quickly the comfort of the chair declined. Apparently, the manufacturer used very cheap foam for the seat making the overall experience for the users comfort annoying as hell. The last chair I purchased for the computer was an office chair and the foam and comfort didn't wear out until using for over five years.

I took pictures and sent a request to Respawn for a refund or replacement, with a copy of the original order on Amazon.  (I could not get to their website or e-mail through Amazon, so had to find them on the Web myself).  They responded, saying they could not read my attachments (JPEG and PDF Files) so I cut and pasted them into a Word document to see if they could open that, but no answer two weeks later.  NOT ACCEPTABLE!  Just sent another inquiry and ended up having to buy another chair after two weeks in a folding lawn chair, so now I want a refund, not another chair.  They can keep dragging their feet, but I am not going away...  You, however, should stay away and buy something else :)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1584403200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Comfortable but not breathable","reviewDescription":"So it's a comfortable chair and one that was very easy to put together. It may look like a lot but it goes together pretty quick and remains tight. I've had it for almost a month now and I really have no complaints save for one big thing for me. The bonded leather simply doesn't breathe. Dumb thing to say right. It's leather, of course it won't breathe. But I didn't expect to be sweating and having the top of my ass going numb after long hours of sitting here. I've had to resort to sitting on a pillow which is unfortunate for what I think is a good chair.The only other minor problem can be the lumbar support pillow. It can fall between the back and the seat and 'get stuck' in a way. Easy to fix but it slides back down eventually and is related to causing my ass to go numb. If you can get past the leather being hot and causing you to sweat (it does for me at least), then it's a good chair. But I think after a couple more months I may regret it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1591228800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Easy to Assemble - not enough support and not as comfortable.","reviewDescription":"I was very excited when purchasing this chair. I used a $50 office chair from IKEA and figured this would be a nice upgrade now that I am working from home. The chair arrived packaged in a nice sturdy box. Opening the box, everything seemed to be boxed appropriately and the pieces were not damaged. The assembly was pretty straightforward and the hardware was nicely packaged and labeled. The feeling of the chair feels like soft leather. The chair reclines almost all the way back.THE BAD: This chair seat is NOT comfortable, it is very padded around the sides but where the butt sits, it is as if though Respawn forgot to add cushion to the seat. It leaves a lot to be desired as this should be the #1 thing for a chair of this level. Another issue is the armrest feels loose and dangles a bit no matter how hard you tighten the screws or how you position the armrest during the installation of the armrests. This is very annoying.Overall, for the price, RESPAWN should do better. I use a memory foam cushion to help with this.

{"reviewTitle":"It Gets the Job Done","reviewDescription":"This chair it a good one for the price it's going for, but it does have some minor flaws. At least minor in my opinion.First, the good stuff. The chair is very comfortable. The materials of the fabrics are really soft and easy to clean. The armrests are padded enough and the backrest pillow is definitely helpful. The footrest is very welcoming after some time sitting up in the chair. The chair is very stylish and rolls very freely on my carpeted floor. Assembly was fairly easy for a chair this size. Also a good fit for racing simulators.Now the bad. The footrest is a bit short and, not really flimsy, but not as sturdy as I would have hoped. Sometimes you have to wiggle it around a bit to get it to retract or extend. The headrest pillow doesn't sit as low as I would have liked it to, but I'm shorter than average anyway (5'4). I've seen that some people had some pretty crazy defects in their chairs, like armrests not being symmetrical or legs breaking off. Mine has none of these issues, but that is something to take note of.Overall, this is a good chair for a good price.

{"reviewTitle":"Chair review","reviewDescription":"Chair was pretty easy to build. Took me roughly 40 minutes, but I can't differentiate a hammer from a screwdriver. Most people could probably build this in 20-30 mins. In terms of comfort, the lumber support is great and it comes with a nifty head pillow. Napping in a reclined position is pretty comfortable. The foot rest is a cool addition and is comfortable enough, but it does slightly bend. What can be improved however is the seat cushion and how hot it gets. For me the chair is not as nicely padded as it should be. Sitting down I can feel the hard part of the chair with my bottom, however I've never bought a computer chair before and may be expecting too much for this price range. The chairs at work that I am used to are all over 500 bucks. The seat also gets hot pretty quick.Overall I'm pretty happy with the purchase. I would highly recommend this to a person who gets back pains or is looking to just sit back and relax and read a book in a slightly reclined position.

Took about 15-20 minutes to assemble as I kept getting interrupted. No bad odor as others have stated. would have liked to have given 5 stars but due to the foot rest being slightly angled when fully extended the quality control on that part of the chair I'd give a B grade as it can still be utilized,just a personal choice I guess as I doubt I will ever use the foot rest,but if I do decide to utilize it's function it will work as intended,just the slight angle bothers me but it's really a none issue for me. I would highly recommend this chair to anyone I know wanting a gaming chair and not wanting to pay an arm and a leg for a chair. The one thing I would recommend to anyone buying it is upgrade to a better set of casters,the ones that come with it look sufficient but in the past the wheels are what has always gone first on previous chairs I've had,so pay a little extra and don't worry about that being an issue.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1560211200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Decent\/Average chair","reviewDescription":"Sit tight because this is gonna be a long one.I was once sitting down on my office chair and realized I wanted a gaming chair. As any average human would do, I hopped onto amazon and searched \"gaming chair\". Everything looked the same to me. no padding on the arms and thin bottoms. This one looked different. Very different. The first thing I noticed was the very padded bottom for my big butt. Also, I noticed the arm rest was very well padded (I like this because I'm a controller player who likes leaning his elbows to his side). As I ordered this eagerly waiting day by day, minute by minute, it finally came in, in a big ass box waiting for me patiently outside of my doorsteps. On the porch it sat for a few hours until I decided it was time. I brought it inside with the help of my friend (my room is in the basement). I took each piece part by part and assembled it in like 30 minutes. I sat on this chair and the first thing that I noticed was that the chair was very unbreathable. The chair did not breathe whatsoever. Although I have a lot of meat in my butt for supported padding, it felt very stiff and uncomfortable I don't know why. I looked through other reviews (I should have done this before buying this chair) and realized that other people were having the same problem as I was. I am 5'11 205 pounds with a good muscular build. After about 2 months I noticed the bottom part of the chair was becoming concave. The leather started to become wrinkled on the sides. I usually sit on my chair shirtless (in my boxers) and my back was sticking to the leather and I was getting very sweaty because of the unbreathable chair. I would rate this chair a 5\/10, reason being that the leather itself starts to stick on the skin of your back (only if you're shirtless). Also, the chair isn't very durable. The handles start to wiggle not matter how tight you screw the bolt in on the side. This happens after a while when you lay the back part of the chair down.Thank you for reading my honest review hopefully this review helps you buy the chair that you want!

I'm not one to abuse my gear, but this thing has now worn out it's welcome. Things I've noted over the last 18 months:- The footrest was useless. I'm 5'11\" and under 180lbs. Not only was it too short (it supported my calves slightly below my knees), it also broke after only using a handful of times. When you first get it, it's really easy to notice that it's not very robust, so I figured it would break at some point.- The armrests aren't adjustable. Not a deal breaker, but for me, they were too low while doing office work at my desk. They were ok if I was leaning back and relaxing though. Would have been nice to have some adjustment.- Lumbar support pillow seemed hokey at first, but was actually quite nice to have in the end.- The fake leather covering has held up for daily use, despite low expectations.- The padding in the seat on the other hand... it's basically gone. Particularly at the front. I'm sitting on plywood at this point.- On top of the front cushioning being gone, the seat chair also started to lean forward slightly, making for a much less comfortable sitting position. And there is no way to adjust it or repair it. Best I can tell, the joint between the chair stem and the seat is wearing out. This is the primary reason I'm replacing it after less than 2 years.Not a terrible chair out of the box, but has slowly become much, much worse over a short time. For the price, I expected to make some concessions (no spring back, no adjustable arm rests, low quality \"leather\"), but I did expect more than 18 months of use from it for this price. I know engineers who have had the same office chairs for decades that are in better shape than this one is after 18 months.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1641945600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not the best. But good enough for a budget.","reviewDescription":"I got this chair to use at home for work, and for gaming.I read reviews beforehand and noted some common complaints. After having the chair for a few weeks, here are the things I can confirm:Cons:* The arm rests are loose in general (can be wiggled left\/right). They seem to get more loose overtime.** This is likely a byproduct of the arms being able to move when the chair leans back, which is cool. But it's too bad this wasn't achieved while still keeping the arms feeling sturdy.* Foot rest does not feel sturdy.* Sometimes there are some \"knocking\" noises when sitting down in the chair and applying pressure on the back. I think this is due to the tension mechanism.* It's not real leather. Over time, the chair is going to peel and is pretty susceptible to things like scratches, tears, etc.* It is difficult to raise the back up after laying down. This is due to two things:** The lumbar pillow can fall down in the crack when you lean back, creating a jam between the seat and back.** The \"tension\" of the lean is not very high.* (Biggest Gripe) The positional lock is an actual lock, not a \"stop\", and the tension of the lean is low and not adjustable.** You can lean back and then lock it, but the chair will stay there and not return upright.** This means you have to decide between:*** Locking the chair back in a position with good back support, but not being able to lean back.*** Locking the chair in a leaned position for comfort, but not having the chair follow you when you sit back up.*** Not locking the chair so that it will provide some back support when sitting up, and allow you to lean back. However, due to the low tension and extreme angle possible, this feels very awkward.Pros:* The seat cushion is pretty padded and comfortable.* The chair looks nice. I like the colors and design.* You can literally lay down in the chair and take a nap.* The chair can be affordable, especially when on sale.Final Opinion: If you like the design and are on a budget, it's not a bad choice. If good support is important to you, you might want to do more research than I did and find a chair with adjustable tension, and more options for locking the lean positioning (like setting a \"stop\" position for the max lean).Good luck!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1591056000000}

Sitting for more than a couple hours makes my legs and butt go numb.Additionally, the arms of the chair feel a little wobbly, and the leg rest feels very unstable.  I pulled it out once to try it out, and felt like I was going to snap it right of, so I pushed it back under and haven't pulled it out again.  However, the leg rest does tend to creep out from under the chair on its own, causing me to have to push it back under.Lastly, the set of this chair feels like it has a slight decline to it, making it feel as if you're going to slide out of it.Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a chair that they will be sitting in for a more than an hour or so, as there ARE more comfortable chairs out there.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661731200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not good for small people","reviewDescription":"First, this important info: I am 5'6\" ~150lbsI've had this chair for 17 months now and just replaced it so I came to write a review about why. It's actually been bothering me the entire time I've owned it, but I spent the money, so I really wanted it to work. It also took me a long time to figure out exactly what was wrong.The seams on the seat are coming apart. I suppose that's expected over time, but it started happening after a pretty short time. I haven't had the issue other people described about the armrests being wobbly or falling apart.The biggest problem....this chair is too big. I didn't make the connection until somewhat recently, but for the entire time I've had this chair I've had neck pain and headaches and have been seeing doctors about it. I was extremely busy outdoors\/away from home over the summer and decided to try completely staying off the computer to see if it helped my headaches and neck pain. It did basically 100%. I thought it was the monitor or just the fact that I was sitting. Nope, it was the chair! The issue is, since I am too short for the chair, the top part that curves in (where a tall person could rest their head) actually caused me to have to lean my head forward too much, screwing up my neck. I did not use the pillow, but for reference, if I put the pillow on, the bottom of it touched the top of my head. I saw other reviews saying the pillow hit the back of their neck. I feel like that's the correct height person for this chair.What I will say is the seat is comfortable and the padded armrests are comfortable. Again, due to my height, I had the chair raised up where I needed it. But, that caused the arm rests to not fit under my desk. So since I have an L shaped desk, I could only turn so far, and I couldn't move my chair close enough to the desk. Now that I have a smaller chair, I've figured out that's related to the chair being too large for me.  Using the respawn chair I am unable to sit properly at a standard sized desk. I am a pretty average size, so I can't even imagine how bad this would be for a smaller person!Then my last complaint....the chair doesn't rock\/tilt.
