{"reviewTitle":"GREAT Surge Protection, USB ports, outlet spacing and price! Standard (not fast speed) USB C charge","reviewDescription":"So, this surge protector and power strip has a lot of protection when it comes to surge protection!  At the top end of what you will find for general electronics, this one has 1680 joules of protection before it gets fried to save everything thats plugged into it. If you have any high end gaming computers, REALLY expensive electronics, you would purchase an expensive\/entire next level surge protector having over 2000 (2K) joules of protection.  So this surge protector packs a punch for all regular electronics, regular computer equipment.The lit up center green button shows that the surge protection is still working and has not been fried by a lightening hit or something. If it does one day get fried, this whole unit will still work as a power strip but would no longer provide the surge protection for the devices plugged into it.I mounted this charger and plugged in some \"hard to plug in\" electrical cords and this thing held sturdy!  I was impressed at how sturdy it was when I had to really give an extra push or pull to some of my plugs going into or pulling out of it.Each of the three USB A (same as saying USB) port is 12 Watts. This matches the highest capacity of most USB A cords, so this is good. It also is great that EACH USB A port has this capacity, so plugging in multiple devices into these ports will not create a slow down on the others, which is great!The one USB C port is 15 Watts but not a fast charging port.  So it may take 56 minutes to charge the same as what a fast charger would take 34 minutes, as an accurate example. I am fine with that.. But good to be aware that this will not charge as fast as a \"fast charger\" if you have one of those elsewhere in the house.  And if you do, you could always plug that fast charger into one of the traditional outlets on this power strip and achieve your fast charging effect that way!The traditional electrical ports are well spaced and VERY handy.The price is GREAT!  A GREAT bargain!This purchase is an excellent one!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"30 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702512000000}

In looking at the outlet extender options out there, this one is relatively attractive in comparison, very inexpensive, and adds so much functionality to a frequently used part of our home.

{"reviewTitle":"Great Design!  Just note that USB-C does not have fast charge capability","reviewDescription":"I have been looking for a charger like this for a long time.  One that doesn't crowd the plug-in ports because so many plugs today have the big head, or the cord that hangs down so it's impossible to use it on a strip without losing 1 or 2 neighboring outlet ports.  That crowding also makes it difficult to use the USB ports when they are located in the middle between 2 other plug-ins.  This is well thought out in that respect. Also with an indented back to allow it to sit flush against the wall even if you don't remove the face plate on existing socket.  I didn't think about the USB-C wattage required to properly charge my iPhone, but that was my own ignorance as it is mentioned in the details.  I have a work around for that though, so not a big deal, just thought I should mention in case someone else is ignorant as I was!  ;-).  Nice that it comes in either black or white, I got one of each and when my husband saw them he proclaimed that he needed a couple as well!

{"reviewTitle":"Multi tasking plug","reviewDescription":"I bought two of these plugs for the bedroom night stands. We have our lights, alarm clocks, phone chargers and watch chargers all plugged into one place. No extension cords needed. I don't think I would use these for multiple high load appliances, like microwaves and hair dryers, but I think they do a good job for what I am using them for. The housing seems to be well made and the plugs are solid and the plugs are not loose. I think future models will probably need more of the USB-C outlets, as that seems to be the new standard. Fortunately, I haven't had to test the surge protection, but hope that it works as advertised.

There are better units if you want a LED or even a light-sensing nightlight... or even a shelf for holding a gadget while charging with the USB units.  Also, the charging isn't a Power Delivery 3.0 or 3.1 protocol.  You won't get anything but 5v out of these ports... they're only good for small low-powered devices.

I had a decor outlet in that location (see my photo to learn what a decor outlet is) and the Qinlianf HR-519D did not fit well over the decor outlet. I tried it both with the trim plate on the decor outlet, as well as the trim plate off. It did not fit well either way -- the blades on the back of the Qinlianf HR-519D did not insert fully into the decor receptacle. The first couple times I tried it, the Qinlianf HR-519D worked its way loose and the devices I had plugged into it lost power.To make the Qinlianf HR-519D work reliably, I had to replace the decor outlet with a standard outlet. That way, I could use the long screw that comes with the Qinlianf HR-519D to hold it into the outlet firmly. Now that there is no possibility of the Qinlianf HR-519D pulling out of the socket, it works really well. I like having all the standard AC sockets, as well as the USB ports.I got the Qinlianf HR-519D for a great price, and I like having the convenience of multiple AC receptacles and USB ports in a handy location.

{"reviewTitle":"It's actually pretty awesome BUT...","reviewDescription":"So I do love it but it has one flaw. It's not very secure. It keeps falling out the wall but that's potentially a problem unique to certain people. It has a screw that will secure it but it's in the center so if your outlet is screwed in elsewhere it will definitely fall out.. a lot. So that's pretty much my only gripe. As long as you have a center screw 5 stars easy if not 4 or less depending how tolerate you are of it. It can be avoided by holding it in whenever you plug or unplug. It's annoying but manageable I guess.TLDR: If your outlet has a screw in the center get it. It's great. If not I don't recommend as it will fall out a lot.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711238400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Bulky but Useful","reviewDescription":"I bought a number of these units to provide extra outlets in a number of the rooms in my house and to add the convenience of device charging in those locations as well. They do both of those things quite well and offer a small degree of surge suppression as well.I only have two issues. This device is very bulky in size. The attached photos show that quite well and I'm sure that they could have been made thinner by a quarter or even a third easily. So, not meant for tight spaces. Second (And this is an issue with a number of other wall-mounted surge suppressors I have seen as well.), there is a LOT of light bleeding out from the USB ports and that's in addition to the LED indicator showing that surge suppression is active. See attached photo. If you put these in a bedroom, you're going to have a very bright room at night when you're trying to sleep.

Phones, cameras, tablets... you name it. After a weekend away, nearly every convenient outlet in our house plays host to at least one rechargeable device.This wall charger helps simplify matters. Since most devices don't draw much current, we can plug almost everything that needs charging into one outlet. With the added reassurance it's also a surge protector.It simplifies getting all our devices recharged after a weekend away. And the surge protector offers a degree of confidence our frequent lightning storms (We live in southern Florida.) won't fry our devices. It's easy and quick to install... though the instructions leave something to be desired.As far as traveling goes, don't bother. This is a household device, and isn't appropriate for travel use.But, if you have a half-dozen rechargeable devices and struggle to get everything charged in a timely manner, this could be the solution you seek.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689638400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Dumb design will not fit most outlets.","reviewDescription":"Poorly designed - the center screw will not work with most modern outlets. Similar products use screws above and below the outlets to be universally compatible with any outlet.Granted, had I looked more closely before ordering, I might've noticed that. But it's just plain dumb to design it in this way. I made sure it'll stay put with some double sided tape and called it a day.The outlets are an extremely tight fit - a lot of force and wiggling is required to insert or remove a plug. They loosen up some with use, but it definitely doesn't feel like any \"normal\" outlet. Makes plugging stuff in and out a bit of a hassle, but on the plus side, there is absolutely zero chance things will get unplugged accidentally.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1648166400000}

{"reviewTitle":"A couple bad design decisions","reviewDescription":"I like the number and variety of plugs, but the way it is designed makes it wiggle a lot when you plug it into the wall (even after removing the outlet cover screwing in the USB charger screw). The first bad design decision was to only have one 3 prong plug that plugs into the wall. This thing is big and having two plugs would have made it significantly more stable. They should have a least made a second \"dummy\" plastic plug so that it plugged into both wall receptacles. The second bad design is that the back is not recessed. Even when you remove the cover on the wall outlet, the actual outlet still protrudes past the drywall about an 1\/8th of an inch (or more). Without the back being recessed, the USB Wall Charger will not sit flush with the wall, which makes it even more unstable. I wound up trimming the wall plug box some to allow the plug to sit further into it. But even with the USB charger flush with the wall, it still wiggled around a bit because it has only one plug to secure it to the wall outlet. Now that the 1\/8th inch gap wall closed between the charger and the wall, I was able to put double sided tape at all four corners to eliminate the wiggle. It's really amazing that products get manufactured and shipped with such obvious issues. Did no one plug this thing in before giving the green light on the final design?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636934400000}

Of course, as noted in its descriptive data, it cannot EASILY be used with a GDCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet, such as those found in kitchens counter areas and bathrooms, as those outlets DO NOT have a center screw.  The charger has a lower plastic insert for the \"standard\" lower ground slot on the standard outlet, and the insert is ever-so-slightly lower in the GDCI outlet.  Thus, in order to use the wall charger with a GDCI outlet you will need to remove the lower plastic insert, AND, you may find the outlet slightly looser when mounted to the outlet (because it is only plugged into it).  Nonetheless, IT WILL WORK, and I like mine.

{"reviewTitle":"NO 'fail-to-close' safety feature. Poor clamping voltage. NOT UL listed.","reviewDescription":"You want a surge suppressor to have a 'fail-to-close' safety feature \u2026 \"to stop power to your devices once surge protection expires.\" (Alternate related terms for this feature include 'fail-to-safe' or 'fail-to-shutdown' or 'automatic shutdown technology.') Most suppressors DO have it. There is NO mention of this product having any 'fail-to-close' safety feature (1) on this webpage, (2) on the back of the product or (3) in the User's Manual that comes with it. So you can safely assume it does NOT have it.Oversimplified, a suppressor doesn't 'kick in' until the voltage exceeds its 'clamping voltage\/specification.' (Alternative related terms include 'UL1449 let-through' and 'voltage protection rating.') So you would want that number to be lower (to be better). Relying on various online sources, it appears safe to say that 330 volts is common on better suppressors, 400 volts is considered merely adequate, 500 volts is considered to be borderline inadequate. The seller now claims the clamping voltage\/specification for THIS device is 600 volts. Further, there is NO mention of the clamping voltage\/specification for this product (1) on the back of the product or (2) in the User's Manual that comes with it.[ I submitted a question \u2013 twice \u2013 to the seller asking for the 'clamping voltage\/specification.' Twice the question was ignored by the seller. Meanwhile I saw the seller DID post an answer to three other questions the same day I first inquired. Apparently the seller did not want to discuss the matter of clamping voltage at all. After about a week the seller posted in Q&A, after someone else asked, that the clamping voltage is 600V. ]This product is NOT UL listed. This product does NOT have a UL hologram sticker on it. To get such a listing and such a sticker, the maker must submit sample units to UL for testing that assures the device meets UL standards. The back of the device states \"Conforms to UL Standard 498A.\" THAT is a standard for a wall tap, not a surge suppressor. It is a general safety standard (such as 'designed without sharp edges,' 'designed without parts that children might ingest,' and so forth). IT IS UL 1449 (3RD EDITION) that is the standard to which SUPPRESSORS are commonly held by UL. The maker may claim that the device conforms to some kind of UL standard, but without a UL hologram sticker and listing, the device has not actually been found by UL to conform.I bought this gizmo for an outlet I do not use at all \u2026 so I will have a convenient place to OCCASIONALLY recharge cell phone battery chargers, my GPS device and so on via this device's USB ports. I suppose I can trust it to do that from time to time.However, given the opaque nature of the device's actual specifications and ability, as described above, you should NOT assume it fully functions as a true full-featured surge suppressor should. Or trust valuable electronic devices to be fully protected by it as if it does.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"189 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1623110400000}

{"reviewTitle":"This will not stay connected to the outlet","reviewDescription":"After about 7 times of putting it back on, and in different outlets, I came to the conclusion that this just won't stay out no matter what outlet you put it, it would be different if it was kinda coming out of the wall but still powder stuff, but it's very annoying having to check if I stall have power because the thing came out of the wall again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689033600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Slow charge and you need to screw it secure","reviewDescription":"It only has one plug instead of two plugs to go into an outlet. This issue causes the apparatus to slowly charge phones, smart watches, and other devices. It requires the user to screw the object into the actual outlet as well and some newer outlets don't have screws anymore. This plug in also has a bright green LED light that can't be turned off. It is bothersome at night. One last thing,  it makes this terrible high pitched sound when charging some devices. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1677974400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Do not recommend","reviewDescription":"If I could give less than 1 star I definitely would. NONE of the USB ports worked from day 1. The outlets worked but we mainly purchased for the extra USB ports and the surge protection, so I have to question if the surge protection even works. A total waste of money.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691971200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Right out of the box, all 4 USBs don't work.","reviewDescription":"This wall charger looks sharp. But the one I received is a lemon. The AC connections work fine. But none of the USB connectors work. I tried charging several USB charged devices. None of the devices showed a \"charging\" status in the USB ports. They worked just fine in the normal AC ports, when I added an AC adapter.  However, the whole reason for this purchase was to be able to charge directly into USB and avoid needing AC adapters. So I am returning this wall charger.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"39 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672704000000}

{"reviewTitle":"I Must Be Inept and Clumsy","reviewDescription":"I bought 15 of these outlets to install all over our home. Something tells me that they are really good. I\u2019m still waiting to find out for sure. I\u2019ve had them for several months now and have not been able to install just ONE successfully. I spend at least two hours on each installation attempt. Still no dice. With the original plate in place I have been unable to successfully align the screw and the receptacle hole on the base plate.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705017600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not the perfect fit","reviewDescription":"It looked good out of the box, but once I tried to install it I noticed it was smaller than my outlet covers and basically sat on top of the outlet cover and not snug to the wall. This doesn't allow the prongs to be fully inserted all the way into the outlet and may create an arc hazard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704585600000}
