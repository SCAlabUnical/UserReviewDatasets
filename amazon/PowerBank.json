{"reviewTitle":"Stopped working after a year","reviewDescription":"I truly love Anker power banks, I\u2019ve had one since 2019 that still works great, although it\u2019s now taking longer to charge. I purchased this one in January 2023 for an upcoming trip and it worked fantastic. Charged well, was able to recharge my iPhone 2.5 times before having to recharge the bank. It never overheated. It was a little heavy, but the usefulness was primary over the size and weight. I had used it regularly, once or twice a month since to charge my phone. Unfortunately the power bank will no longer recharge.While I'm glad it worked when I needed it, I\u2019m sad that it\u2019s basically dead after 14 months. Hopefully the next one will last longer.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1712534400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Changed the Model","reviewDescription":"We bought one two years ago and loved it. It took a long time to charge up, but held the charge for a very long time. Very happy with that one. We could charge two iPhones from below 20% quickly and it would have between 50-75% battery left.We just bought two more and the quality has definitely decreased. They don\u2019t hold nearly as much charge as the older models. Now if we charge one iPhone that\u2019s below 20% it takes the same amount of battery as charging two used to.I don\u2019t like paying the same price for something that has dipped in quality. With that being said I still think it\u2019s a decent power bank. Just not as good as it used to be and we will explore other options in the future to try to find the original quality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1721347200000}

{"reviewTitle":"A powerbank","reviewDescription":"I just bought this powerbank and it really shows it got some juice inside since its weight is heavier than the other powerbanks I used such as the Incipio Cell Phone power bank.The only problem I have is when charging the powerbank, I have to lift it to see how many dots it has since when you look at it from the side, you can't see it nor glance at it. You have to grab it yourself or get in a right angle to check how many dots it has charged.Will update in about a year or two on how this beast would serve me.UPDATE 3\/31\/23 (1 month use)I used the powerbank for about a month now and it charges pretty fast, even with the trickle mode, you could charge your phone up to a 100% granted that you don't use it while charging.If you charge it without using the trickle mode, it still charges and boy it does charge for a long time, it took about 5 days before it reached to 3 dots on the button which is great if you're traveling somewhere that does not have any outlet.The cons that I experienced besides the viewing of the dot thingy is the lack of other options of using a usb. You have to use a usb-a, you can't use usb-c since that part is only charging the powerbank itself. Search for another product if you want an almost universal charging port or charging your mac even.Overall, its pretty good for use while traveling to charge your phone while having a lot of juice so you don't have to worry about charging your powerbank for a while.will update in a year this time.UPDATE 3\/22\/24With the advent of USB-C, I would look for other power banks other than this. It's a good backup power bank but there are better alternatives out there. You can hand carry this power bank with other power banks such as the anker powercore+ on airports. I wouldn't return this power bank if you bought it already since again this can be a good backup power bank when your good ones run out of power since 20k is alot.Otherwise return it or look for a better one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675209600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Causes Phone to Glitch","reviewDescription":"I bought this to replace a Ravpower charger I had used for many years but would no longer charge. Initially it didn\u2019t seem to be charging my phone (it would disconnect) but I realized it was that my charging cable was broken so I bought a new one. This also revealed to me that while it does have a USB C port, it can only be used to charge the battery but can\u2019t be used to charge your phone from the battery, which seems extremely stupid to me, since I would prefer to use USB C to charge since it charges faster that way. I didn\u2019t have another USB cable so I had to buy a new one. Another thing is that this battery cost $60 which I thought was pretty pricey. The Ravpower one I had previously was not as powerful since it was 16750 mAh and this is 20,000 but I spent $32 on it back in 2017 so spending $60 on a 20,000 mAh battery in 2021 seems very overpriced. In fact I only bought this one becasue I tried to order from Ravpower and they took 2 weeks to just cancel my order. So I figured whatever, Anker is supposed to be a good brand so hopefully it will be worth the extra money (almost double the price.) But the biggest issue is that when using this battery to charge my phone, it becomes very difficult to use my phone. I was trying to take photos and videos in Instagram at an event and I had this plugged in to make sure my phone didn\u2019t die, and I literally couldn\u2019t use my phone. It causes the phone to glitch and freeze and there will be long (10-20 seconds or even more) delays between clicking on something and the phone responding. My phone doesn\u2019t do this when not using this charger. I\u2019ve noticed it comes and goes, and sometimes my phone is fine while plugged in, and other times it slows down and glitches but it\u2019s happened enough times that I am sure it is this charger\/battery that is causing this. For such an expensive item I\u2019m pretty upset at it\u2019s performance. I wish I had stuck with Ravpower which is cheaper and hasn\u2019t let me down in the past. What I will say is that it does hold a lot of charge and recharges my phone relatively quickly, which is nice but it\u2019s what I expected.

I used nothing more than an Anker branded desktop charger that I purchased from Walmart to charge this device on my nightstand next to my bed as well as Anker branded cables and the lithium ion battery inside the charger has swelled so bad that it cracked the case completely and is not usable.  The case is made of cheap plastic so you might not want to not get the higher capacity chargers and get the 13,000 ma one.I reached out to anker warrnty support for a replacement and they won't honor it as they only give an 18 month warranty even though it is a defective unit.

{"reviewTitle":"Barely made it a week.","reviewDescription":"Idk if this review will be posted or not because they don't want people knowing the real issues. But I bought this portable charger for my mother in law that lives in a care home. We thought that this would be easier for her since she can't do a lot of walking or reaching. Her phone\/ tablet dies fast so we thought this would be easier for her. She got it on the 23 of April and it stopped working 4 days ago and only used it 3 times in that.My mother in law just had surgery 2 wks ago and has been moved to Cali for a few months for physical therapy. When the nursing home aides packed her stuff for her trip to Calif. they didn't pack the portable charger because it didn't work.We contacted Amazon and they told us to contact Anker so I did I received and message where they wanted me to send them a bunch of information which I did that including the temp address when my mother-in-law is staying until the middle of Aug. So I just got a message back where they want to send more information and then at the bottom of the email they tell me that I could have my mother in law send them a picture of the charger and that they have to get the defective item back before they can give her a replacement charger. They completely disregarded everything I had written them in the first place. They didn\u2019t even pay attention to the fact that I had told them my mother in law was out of state and didn\u2019t have it with her. It\u2019s sad that they do this kind of thing to people and refuse to help them when their product fails. We only wanted a replacement product not a refund but now we will be contacting amazon again in hopes that we can get this settled.We mainly only purchased ANKER  products in our home but now we will be finding a new brand to support.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"65 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620000000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Incredible, incredible design flaw!","reviewDescription":"This expensive product suffers from an incomprehensible design flaw: unlike all USB power banks I\u2019ve been using in the past ten years, this power bank turns the outputs off when itself plugged to a charger. This is incredibly stupid as it means the product is useless as a pass-through power device that sits in between an intermittent power source and a consuming device that must be kept running. A case in point is a camera that can be connected to one of the output ports while the input port is connected to a car\u2019s cigarette lighter powered USB power source. When the car\u2019s power is on, the power bank should charge itself while still powering the outputs. When the vehicle is off, the camera keeps working, as it is now powered from the power bank only. When the car power turns back on, the power bank tops itself up, and the camera that is connected keeps being powered, undisturbed. This is how all the power banks I\u2019ve owned so far work, but this Anker product turns the outputs off as soon as its input power is turned on, as a result the camera is no longer being powered and completely depletes it\u2019s own battery. You have to unplug the power bank from it\u2019s charger in order to turn the outputs back on. This is an example of an extremely short-sighted design decision that makes the product completely useless for some scenarios that are\/were perfectly covered by existing, older and often less expensive products that don\u2019t try to be too clever and allows charging and consumption at the same time. Using-while-charging is an extremely common scenario: every phone can do that, every tablet, every camera, and every USB power banks I know except this one can do that. I wonder what the Anker engineers were thinking when they though it was OK to turn the power off when the bank gets charged. The output power should never be interrupted for as long as there is power in the internal battery. If the charging current is less than the consumer current then the bank\u2019s will of course get depleted, but at a slower rate. I\u2019d give minus TEN stars for this shortcoming. I\u2019m now left with an expensive $50 brick.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"69 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1596585600000}

However, at 25 months of ownership, I one day saw the battery was bulging and it was definitely no longer safe to charge and keep using. In my time owning it, I never dropped it or pierced it with anything, so this was disappointing. I purchased a different battery bank and have owned it for almost three years with minimal power loss and no physical damage occurring.

How did I lose 75% charge from just sitting on my desk not in use??  I charged again when power was restored, checked the charge status 4 days later, and once again it was at 50% capacity despite being unused.What good is a power bank that discharges itself even when not in use?? Since I'm now past my return window, I'm now stuck with a rechargeable brick.  \ud83d\ude15","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1575676800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Anker Portable Charger","reviewDescription":"I found this charger by trying to look for the more expensive option since it\u2019s a charger and didn\u2019t want to cheap out. I am happy I went that route!! I\u2019ve been amazed with the quality of it, it\u2019s heavy and not cheap which is good because that means it will be resistant to drops and stuff. It is about as big as my phone. It is simple to use and works amazing. The battery life on it is great and I like how it doesn\u2019t use battery if you have nothing on the other end of it so I can leave my usb in and as long as it\u2019s not plugged into anything it won\u2019t waste battery I think that is good for keeping my usb with it. My only concern at first is that my usb wouldn\u2019t fit in all the way but I realized it was just right because it was new and I pushed it in harder and it fit. Which is a good thing because that means your usb will not fall out and it will stay in there and not keep falling out and being annoying. It uses usb 3 and it says \u201cIQ\u201d technology on it and it must be way better than a normal charger because this thing charges fast and has amazing battery life at the same time. I also like that it has 2 inputs (how you charge the battery itself) it has usb micro and usb C inputs which is cool. My only complaint is that it doesn\u2019t have usb outputs espcially since the newer iPhones come with that type of charger. I\u2019m so happy I picked the Anker charger and didn\u2019t cheap out!!!

{"reviewTitle":"HUGE battery capacity","reviewDescription":"I've bought 2 of these power banks now: 1 as a gift and the other for myself. This is the perfect power bank for traveling since it is able to charge my phone multiple times before it needs to be charged back up. It's a bit on the heavy side, but I'm also able to walk around with it in my back pocket as needed if I'm charging my phone on the move. It does not have quick charge, so my phone won't get back to 100% as fast as my wall charger, but it's nice to not have to be tethered to a wall as well.I have tried using this power bank to charge up my Macbook Pro and didn't have great success charging and using it at the same time. It might do just fine if the computer is sleeping, and will need to test that at some point.As someone who doesn't do a ton of traveling, I still use this power bank quite often even around the house. Moving my phone from room to room with the power bank is much more convenient than having to remain close to a wall outlet. It's really an impressive battery for its size and I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to keep multiple devices charged or who does a lot of traveling.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704931200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Best charger on the market!","reviewDescription":"The Anker PowerCore 10000 is a compact and lightweight portable charger that offers excellent performance and value for money. It features a 10000mAh battery, which can provide up to two full charges for most smartphones or one full charge for most tablets. It also supports Power Delivery, which means that it can charge your devices at up to 18W, which is significantly faster than traditional portable chargers.  While specs promise 2 full charges it seems like I will often get 5 or 6.In my testing, the charger was able to fully charge my iPhone 13 Pro in just over an hour. It also charged my iPad Air 4 in about two hours. I was also impressed with the charger's efficiency. It was able to charge my devices for a longer period of time than other portable chargers of the same capacity.I primarily use the charger to keep my smartphone charged as I am streaming my daughter's softball games.  It can stream a 2-day tournament with out even worrying about the cell phone running out of juice.In addition to its excellent performance, the Anker PowerCore is very well-built. It has a durable plastic casing and a cross-hatch texture that makes it easy to grip. The charger also comes with a USB-C cable and a travel pouch, so you can easily take it with you on the go. Strangely enough the pouch is extremely handy and one of the best features of the charger.Overall, the Anker PowerCore 10000 PD Redux is an excellent portable charger that offers excellent performance, value for money, and build quality. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and portable way to charge their devices.Pros:Compact and lightweightSupports Power Delivery for up to 18W chargingFast charging performanceEfficient battery lifeDurable constructionTravel pouchCons:None that I can think ofOverall rating: 5\/5 starsRecommendation: I highly recommend the Anker PowerCore 10000 PD Redux to anyone looking for an excellent portable charger.

However, today it suddenly lost the ability to recharge itself. I thought it was the cable so I switched out to a new one. When this did not work, I tried a new usb plug. This did not work. I then tried a new cable and plug on a different wall outlet, which also failed to correct the issue. Perplexed, I tried a different device and it was able to charge. After this I realized it was the anker. I then tried the usb type c input port on the device, thinking the micro USB port that I had been using to recharge the device had failed. The usb type c port would not work either. So, it appears that something internal had failed rather than the input port (otherwise the notion of both ports failing simultaneously seemed too coincidental). This is an unacceptably short life span for a device that has remained stationary on a counter and been properly cared for. Anker needs to work on their products to address this issue, because I am not alone in my experience with their products.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1627862400000}

{"reviewTitle":"UPDATED July 6, 2020: The jury's no longer out","reviewDescription":"REVIEW AS OF JULY 6, 2020:If you read my older review, below, you'll see I was not really convinced this was the charger for me, nor was I pleased it had, in my opinion, no \"operating instructions,\"  and having read other reviews that indicated it took forever to charge up, etc.  After I wrote that review, the seller contacted me via email to offer any support, but I had already formed my judgment (not a good thing) and blew it off and never contacted them (okay, okay, I get it; judgmental and stubborn - working on it). HOWEVER, I decided to plug the USB in to just let it charge until I saw the 4 blue steady dots, assuming the unit was then fully charged. And then I took it to our camp in the Maine woods, off logging roads where extended network roaming is the norm and electricity is had only when the generator runs, usually maybe once a day. This Anker unit kept my phone charged (Galaxy S8), my daughter's iPhone charged (and she's on it a lot more than I am), and it charged up our Bluetooth speaker unit so we could take it out on the lake and listen to tunes while boating. To say the least, I was more than pleasantly surprised; I was amazed. I now keep this Anker unit with me and make sure it's ready to go when we head out ~ which with all the COVID crap going on, is as often as we possibly can head to the woods! I keep its charging cable right in the little case it comes in so that when the generator is going, I am able to recharge it in an appropriate AC plug.LONG STORY SHORT: I highly recommend this unit, and I'm sorry I was quick to judge it so harshly previously.OLDER REVIEW BELOW:Okay, full disclosure. I'm not really much of a techie, I just want to buy something that works for me and then plug and go, as it were. So, once I got this, I tried to read the \"instructions,\" but found just a few pictures and most of what was written was in other languages. The pictures really didn't tell me what I needed to know. Do I plug it in to charge it before I use it? Is it already charged (it does have a couple of blue lights but never seems to get to the third one or higher)? The cord that comes with it is apparently for charging it, which is great, but, again, I have to either purchase a charging cord\/connector for my Galaxy S8 or use one I've already got stashed for other places (like my car, my bedroom, etc.). I bought this because we have a camp that's off grid, where we have a generator that we may (or may not) run for a couple of hours a day, and we have a variety of phones between us, iPhone, iPad, Galaxy, etc. I don't really want to wait until I get to camp this summer to find out this isn't going to work for me. I even went to the website and called up the unit (Anker 20000) but still don't feel like I got any better, understandable information. So, I guess we'll see whether it's workable for my situation or not, as soon as I feel sure I'm not gonna blow the thing up because I don't have clear instructions on how to get started.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1585094400000}

The new one is functioning the way I hoped it would - I've charged my phone from 20% to full two times and most of the indicator lights are still lit, reflecting that I should be able to charge my phone at least 2-3 more times before the Anker needs to be recharged.  I'm very happy about that!  Thank you, Anker!ORIGINAL REVIEW: In 2015 I bought an Anker\u00ae 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAhthat I used ALL THE TIME.  The only reason I replaced it was because I gave mine to my daughter and bought myself a new one.  She uses it and despite being five years old it faithfully is able to charge up her phone 2-3 times before it needs to be charged itself (when I first got it I could charge my phone 6-7 times in between charging the charger, which was outstanding).Back in April 2020 when I purchased this charger, I imagined that buying a higher-powered, brand-new charger would enable me to once again charge my phone at LEAST 5-6 times before needing to be charged itself.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  I have a Galaxy S9 and if I'm able to get 3 charges out of this new battery, I'd be surprised.But that's not all.  My daughter can fully charge the charger in 4-5 hours, and I'm stuck having to charge mine overnight because it takes twice as long.The new charger is frustrating - it actually performs THE EXACT SAME as the 5-year-old Anker that I gave to my daughter, despite being a better and brand new charger.

Once this was fully charged, I was able to charge my Samsung S22 four times from a single charge.  It claims to have fast-charging capabilities, and that appears to be true.The 'charged status' indicator is a bit vague:  there are only indicator lights, each equal to about 25% of battery.  That's how you know how much charge is in it, by the number of lights lit up.  Something with numbers in maybe 10% increments might be more useful, but... it's not a deal breaker.  I just know if my phone is down to about 15% and I recharge using this, one indicator light on this will not be lit, so it uses about 25%.The weight feels slightly heavier than my Samsung S22 in its case, and probably twice as heavy as a Samsung Galaxy S7 that is NOT in a case.  Not something I would carry in my purse but definitely would carry well in a backpack.  The size is about the same as my Galaxy S22 in its case.I have charged my phone and a Samsung tablet with this satisfactorily but not simultaneously.  It has two output connections for charging two devices simultaneously and has two different input charge options (micro USB and USB-C).Overall satisfied.

{"reviewTitle":"A bit slow when charging devices, but very sturdy and reliable.","reviewDescription":"It's a bit hard for me to review the product because I stupidly bought it used. Don't do what I did, you'll end up with a significantly lower capacity power bank. Mine only holds about 13,900 mAh when it should hold 18,000 to 20,000. Entirely my fault. But it works very well. I feel like it takes ~6 hours to charge with a 20 watt USB charger (all power banks take a long time to charge).I've run two phones off it simultaneously and it kept them running just fine. It's physically sturdy and it has never gotten even warm when charging it or discharging from it.My only complaint is it doesn't charge devices very quickly. For both my phone (Google Pixel 4a) and tablet (Amazon Fire HD 10) this power bank can only keep up with power usage of the devices when they are on and active (e.g. you're actively using them while charging). Neither device battery gains power in that situation, but they don't lose it either. When your devices are idle, it's pretty decent. Closer to wireless charging speed (this doesn't have wireless charging capability, that's just a comparison).If you want a power bank that charges your device as fast as your wall charger does, look elsewhere. This isn't that expensive of a power bank. If a somewhat slower charge time doesn't bother you then this is a decent power bank for the money.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"29 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1685404800000}

Anker is the best brand you'll find out there. Any of the products they sell are worth the money. This one's great because it can trickle charge for those using BT Earbuds and can fast charge a phone like as if you plugged it into a wall outlet. It has four notches like most battery banks and just casually using it barely puts a dent into the battery.I've tried cheap-o brand battery banks, and durable ones like Halo but couldn't find one that was slim enough to keep in a back or front pocket to charge on the go. My friends and I play Pokemon GO during big events at local parks and such; and anyone who has played it know how draining it is on a mobile battery. If you're at a long event you'll be stopping to charge up or have one or two battery banks on you at all times. With this? I barely put a dent into what it has for 3-4 hour events. For the longer 12 hour events? I still had one notch left with it running the entire time. I even shared it with a friend during one of our 30 minute breaks too.

I can find nothing wrong with it except that it does not have an \"always on\" feature.  This, if you plug-in a device such as a cellphone, it will charge the phone.  Then, the power bank senses the phone is fully charged and it will turn itself off.In my case, I need the power bank to be on all the time as the phone is simply used as a Bluetooth device in my car and needs to be plugged in 24\/7.  Unfortunately, the phone would charge, the power bank would then shut off, and the phone eventually would discharge completely.  Despite being plugged into the power bank, the power bank won't auto-start again to recharge the phone.Thus, while this is a very good unit and I recommend it to others, it will not work for the application I have in mind.  Also, BTW, there is no \"press the button 3 times\" thing, as often is mentioned online.  I have tried everything, including emailing Anker (who were very helpful, BTW) and they confirmed what my testing revealed.And, yes, I could build a circuit and all that, but instead, I found another unit that advertises that it is always-on.I returned this item to Amazon.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"29 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670803200000}

One charging port was defective, but when the defect was discovered (90 days after shipment) seller would not take it back and Anker made it impossible to use their warranty process.  it was crazy.  Won't go into detail, but I just gave up after dealing with them couple of times without any luck.  I expected more from Anker, frankly - Lesson learned - buy only low dollar Anker items, check them immediately, don't gift them, and definitely not buy anything with just a 90 day seller return policy.

The truth is that you must manually push the button on the Anchor begin a new charge cycle. Not practical for the purpose of leaving connected as a power supply.

Which could negate the need for having it in the first place for some ppl idk.... also may occasionally need to Use the same chords to plug into its input and output simultaneously for roughly 5 seconds to reboot it so if it doesn't work right away don't panic.I love the device personally I believe it's well worth the price. I may buy two to counter the long charge time due to the fact I sometimes forget to charge devices not because I need too.If the device is damaged look to see if amazon packaged it in non bubble wrapped envelope.

{"reviewTitle":"Buyer Be Careful **Potentially A Hazard","reviewDescription":"I have been a fan of Anker products (I have bought many charging banks and cables) since 2014. However, the quality of the products has dropped significantly. Ankers products used to have much longer life expectancy's, better builds and I was more likely to have one stolen (lol) than it becoming dangerous to use.-This particular one has become \"bloated\" \/ \"swollen\" and has a long crack in the back (see picture). As a result, I no longer think its safe to charge. To be fair I bought the product March 2020 and now its Janaury 2023 so it being inoperable is understandable however, being hazardous is unacceptable!-In addition one of the USB ports stopped working 6 or 7 months in. Another observation I have noticed is this model and many others USB-C port never works for whatever reason. Lastly, am I the only long time Anker buyer that's observing a slower charge rate in the newer products? I am more than likely going to look into another brand at this point.

It does take Approx 18 to get a full charge on the Anker once it\u2019s dead but it charges my devices multiple times before I have to charge it again. Great customer service. I will definitely recommend this charger !Original post : Super disappointed in this powercore but I\u2019m assuming I just received a defect item. I received this In the mail yesterday and it took approximately 18 to get a full charge. As soon it was it was fully charged, I wanted to test it out and charge my daughters iPad And see how it works before we leave on our family Disney trip( which is why I bought this). Are use the power cord that they sent me and the iPhone adapter square thing for the plug. It took about 4 1\/2 hours to charge the iPad And it drained the battery on the anchor to 50%!!! Based on all of the other reviews I expected it to charge it quicker than that and to barely Use any of the battery up. Super disappointing as I had hoped it would charge multiple devices if we need it at the Disney parks.  I then plugged it into my phone (Which was at 75%) Just to see how much it would drain the battery on the Anker. While my phone was hooked to it it stopped charging multiple times and I had to keep turning it back on. I definitely think I received a defective device based on all of the rave reviews. I immediately emailed the company & put in for a replacement. I will mail this one back, Fingers crossed the next when I receive will works efficiently.

I would have given it a 5 star if I didn't have to find something else to make this whole thing work.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1616716800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Heavy, doesn't hold a charge (updated)","reviewDescription":"(update). Ankers customer service is second to none.  They contacted me and quickly addressed the issue.  Changed from 1 star to 4 stars.I've had this for a year but haven't used it too much.  The battery itself is as heavy as a brick, and it performs like one.  Runs out of power after about 2 iPhone charges.  Super disappointing.  Anker usually makes great products, but this isn't one of them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1647734400000}
{"reviewTitle":"iPhone 13 USB-C issue","reviewDescription":"The product is great according to battery life. I use it all the time for my usb charger cords on the road. The charge lasts long and it\u2019s also fast when I use it. I just recently upgraded to iPhone 13, and unfortunately, the type C connection doesn\u2019t work. New cord, new phone etc. Maybe double check before purchasing. Not sure if this happens with newer devices..","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669939200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Keeps my electronics running!","reviewDescription":"I bought this to use while camping. My phone and watch lost power the last time I went camping and all I had to charge them with was my car. That wasn't a horrible option, but the problem was I have to keep the car on to charge. No thank you. So a friend of mine told me about these so I decided to check it out.I wound up having to charge my phone twice during a three day camping trip. It constantly checking for a wifi signal (forgot to turn that off after the first charge) drained the battery quickly a second time. I also had to charge my watch once. This little charger was only drained of one of four blue battery indicator lights. I'm impressed. I figured three charges would have cost it at least two. This thing would keep me going for awhile and is for sure becoming part of my regular camping gear.Note: it does take awhile to charge the unit itself. But if you keep it charged, or plan accordingly, it isn't really a big deal.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657411200000}

{"reviewTitle":"The best","reviewDescription":"I have had this charger for about a week and so far I am REALLY impressed!!!  I charged it fully when I got it.  Since then I have inflated a 12 inch tall twin sized air mattress and topped it off a few times, as I have broken the mattress in and needed to add more air.  I also charged my Galaxy Note 9 to a full charge once.  The charger still has 4 lights on, which is the max and I have not needed to charge it a 2nd time.Inflating the air mattress was the most impressive, because the directions mentioned that if the charger was not powerful enough, it would not inflate.  Not only did it inflate all the way, but it did it in a matter of minutes, with plenty of charge to spare.It is a little heavier than my last charger, but I feel it is really worth it given how powerful it is and how long it holds a charge.I highly recommend it!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657670400000}
