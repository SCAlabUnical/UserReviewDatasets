{"reviewTitle":"Reliable and Affordable Microphone for Karaoke and More","reviewDescription":"**Singing Machine Wired Microphone for Karaoke (Black)****Reliable and Affordable Microphone for Karaoke and More**I recently used the Singing Machine Wired Microphone in black for a karaoke night, and it proved to be a solid performer that met all my expectations. This unidirectional dynamic vocal microphone is a great option for anyone looking for a straightforward, no-fuss microphone for singing, public speaking, or parties.**What I Liked:**- **Clear Sound Quality**: The microphone delivers clear and crisp audio, making it ideal for karaoke sessions. The unidirectional design helps focus on the vocals while minimizing background noise, which is especially useful in a lively party environment. Whether used with a karaoke machine, amplifier, or speaker, the sound quality was consistently good.- **Durable Build**: The microphone feels sturdy and well-made, with a durable plastic and metal construction that can handle the wear and tear of regular use. Despite its affordable price, it doesn\u2019t feel flimsy, and I\u2019m confident it will last through many karaoke nights and events.- **Plug-and-Play Simplicity**: The microphone is incredibly easy to use\u2014just plug it into the compatible device, and you\u2019re ready to go. There\u2019s no need for complicated setups or additional software, making it perfect for quick and spontaneous use. This simplicity is a huge plus, especially for those who want to get started right away without any technical hurdles.- **Comfortable Grip**: The microphone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, even during extended use. The design is ergonomic, so it feels natural in hand, which is important when performing or speaking for long periods. It\u2019s easy to pass around at a party without worrying about anyone dropping it or finding it uncomfortable.- **Versatile Usage**: While I primarily used it for karaoke, this microphone is also great for public speaking, announcements, and other events where clear audio is essential. Its versatility makes it a useful tool to have on hand for a variety of occasions.**What I Didn\u2019t Like:**- **Basic Features**: The microphone is very straightforward, with no additional features like an on\/off switch or volume control. While this simplicity makes it easy to use, some might miss having these controls, especially in a louder environment where you might want to quickly adjust settings without touching the connected equipment.- **Standard Length Cable**: The included cable is of standard length, which worked fine for most of my uses, but it could be limiting if you need more mobility or are performing on a larger stage. If you need more range, you might need to invest in an extension cable.- **No Shock Mount or Stand**: The microphone doesn\u2019t come with a shock mount or stand, which would have been nice additions for those who want to reduce handling noise or set the mic on a stand for more professional use. However, for casual use, this isn\u2019t a major drawback.**Bottom Line:**The Singing Machine Wired Microphone in black is a reliable and affordable choice for anyone in need of a microphone for karaoke, public speaking, or parties. Its clear sound quality, durable build, and plug-and-play simplicity make it an excellent option for casual users and those looking to add a dependable microphone to their setup. While it lacks some advanced features and accessories, these are minor considerations compared to the overall value and performance. If you\u2019re looking for a straightforward, no-nonsense microphone that gets the job done, this one is definitely worth considering. It added a lot of fun to our karaoke night, and I\u2019m very happy with its performance!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723680000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good microphone for the kids.","reviewDescription":"Update 5-24-14:  I wanted to add an additional update here, I found out that the system has enough microphone gain if the signal sources are configured properly.  The best way to use the machine and get enough loudness out of the microphones is to turn down the music source (iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc.) and then turn up the overall system gain.  This makes the microphones louder relative to the music and it works perfectly.  I changed to 5 stars for the review as well.I bought this microphone as an accessory to the Memorex Karaoke station so that both of the kids would have one to sing into.  The build quality is stable and it sounds good, easy to use.  I am not sure how well it will do over the longer term if it gets dropped a few times but works well to start.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1400803200000}

Also between songs we wipe down the mic with a fresh wet wipe and use the same one to cover mic while singing before disposing of it when switching to new person. These parties involve drunk and rowdy people signing their heart out, and guess what? The mic holds up. Even after being wiped with chemicals and getting some sand in it. I also sing a lot at home with the same speaker and mic set up. I'm always taking the jack in and out.

I was happy that the microphone arrived on time, and the packaging was fine (so this is where one extra star comes from).However, I was extremely disappointed in the product itself.  I sing and play multiple instruments, so I wanted to make clearer recordings than my laptop itself would allow; I am also taking a class next school semester that requires voice recordings (just speaking).  I plugged the microphone into 4 different laptops, a karaoke machine, a piano keyboard, amplifier, etc. (basically anything that the adaptor and the microphone w\/out the adaptor could be plugged into), but the microphone didn't work at all.  I did go through the steps of fixing\/changing the settings on the laptops to test the sound of the microphone; the only time there was any indication of sound going through the microphone was when I hit the microphone, and I had to hit it on the top with a lot of force.  This was not worth my time or money.The one extra star also comes from the refund that I got immediately after sending my complaint in about the product.  Thankfully, service was good and, better yet, I did not have to return the microphone, which saved me from having to pay extra shipping fees.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1420588800000}

Second issue is the battery. It lasted about 6 hours before I needed to replace the reciever. The third issue is the build. It feels very cheap because its made out of plastic. Last issue is the value. There are other mics on Amazon that are rechargeable, last longer, have better build, and have multiple channels. I recommend the wireless usb-c rechargeable Lekato mic.

{"reviewTitle":"Economy microphone","reviewDescription":"This is the second one of these microphones that I've bought. I picked up one (same brand\/model) last month at one of the local big box stores and it worked well enough that we wanted another one. We're not using them with a Singing Machine karaoke system, but rather a Pyle Home PT270AIU 300-Watt Stereo Receiver, which has two microphone inputs and allows you to sing\/talk over whatever is playing. The two mics work reasonably well - given the system we're using them with. And considering these microphones themselves are pretty budget priced compared to professional grade equipment. Still, they are more than adequate since we're just playing around at home.I like that the cords are ten feet long, that means we don't have to use extension cords. One thing that I might note, these mics are unidirectional, but you really need to hold the microphone close to your mouth and (this is important) sing\/talk directly into the top of the microphone. The design of the mic inside the head is such that sounds coming into the sides doesn't reach the microphone (I unscrewed the head off one and discovered that).All-in-all, these are decent enough given what they are selling for. I'm happy with my purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1489190400000}

{"reviewTitle":"A Satisfactory Karaoke Mic","reviewDescription":"I decided to rig up a karaoke system using some karaoke software and an old pc, but of course i needed microphones. Most importantly, these look right- this is what you want to be holding when you are singing. They sound good enough for karaoke use, but only when i ran them through a USB mic adapter. When i was running them through a mic\/line in port, the volume was very low and it was very hard to balance it with the music. That's why I'm docking them one star. On the other hand, most computers would only have 1 mic port anyway, so if you want to sing with a partner you're better off getting a pair of cheap, identical, usb to mic adapters. The build quality was pretty decent and very important, they come with a 3.5mm adapter so you can connect them to most computer equipment as it uses that TRS size (its native 1\/4 inch or 6.5mm). So if you want to sing karaoke at home, buy a pair of these and if you're looking to hook them up to a PC don't forget 2 cheap usb sound adapters. They're definitely worth the investment.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"95 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1343865600000}

The internal wire is broken at where it connects into the microphone and resulted in high amounts of popping and static when flexing the wire just one inch from the microphone.  The wire has to be bent just the right way (which is difficult when holding on to the microphone) to permit it to conduct the signal.  The build of the microphone is sold, with a large sliding on\/off button.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the broken wire ruined the experience.  The microphone's packaging caused the wire to be bent at an 80 degree angle, which probably contributed to the weakened wire and ultimate failure of the entire microphone.I would expect this kind of failure after regular usage, but not right out of the clam-shell packaging.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1359504000000}

It was too late to return the item, so we bought another one thinking it was just a fluke.
