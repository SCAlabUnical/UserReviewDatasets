{"reviewTitle":"Cools a small room, but too loud.","reviewDescription":"Earlier this summer, I realized  that our home's A\/C was just not keeping up on really hot days. I also worried that cranking the A\/C all day was going to burn out the unit. Our solution was to choose one room (media room) that is enclosed and buy a portable A\/C to cool it. We hang out there until the temps go down.This model is compact, very easy to use and install (1 hour max), and cools the air efficiently.  Our room is 12' x 12' feet and, for this space, it works well. It looks nice in the room, however, it does not fit against the wall snuggly as some photos show. You need about 18\" of clearance, from the wall, for the hose to vent properly. I like that the unit is on casters for easy movement, because it is heavy.I wish that the levers on top, that direct the air, had more flexibility. The air mainly flows upward. I placed a regular floor fan in front of it to help circulate the air. Also, in a small room, the motor is a little loud. However, in a bigger room you may not notice it.With so many hot days in the forecast, this Black and Decker A\/C unit is well worth our investment.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722643200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Ice cold air, but does not work well for a 600 sqft room","reviewDescription":"We have an add-on to our house with no HVAC. I eventually would like to install a mini-split into this room, but I'm considering on buying a large enough unit to potentially cover other rooms of the house and I haven't decided what route I want to go yet. So I bought this unit as a temporary, cheaper solution.It's a portable AC, so it's loud (we have to crank the TV when it kicks on) and the hose that connects to the window is hot, leeching hot air back into the room. But, it does pump out ice cold air which is what we were after.I think my biggest complaint about this particular product (and this is my fault for not being better educated), but the 14,000 BTU ASHRAE rating does _not_ work for a 600 sqft room. The 7,700 BTU DOE rating is more accurate which means this unit is severly underpowered (I need like 12,000 BTU). As the 95+ degree days of summer hit, this unit was running all day long and wasn't cycling; it wasn't keeping up with the demand and the room was noticeably warmer than the rest of the house that is connected to HVAC. It does do fine for 80 to 90 degree days, however.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723161600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Powerful Keeps Bedroom Cool at Night","reviewDescription":"I really want to give this 4.5 stars but there is no option for half stars.I live in South Florida where temperatures in the summer can get to 96+ and often stay in the high 80's at night. My home is about 2,700 sq ft and my master bedroom is the furthest room from the A\/C unit and thermostat. Even with the A\/C set to 72 at night our master bedroom stays at a warm 78-79 degrees. This. year I decided to remedy that with a portable A\/C. My master bedroom is approx 250 sq ft not counting the bathroom and small vanity area.I have been using this portable A\/C for 3 weeks. I wanted to give it some time before I wrote my review. I also wanted to note that I have never had a portable A\/C unit before so I do not have anything to compare this to. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The price point was very good for the benefit I am receiving as these can get pretty pricey.Installation:It was pretty easy to install. I did have to cut the window piece to fit the window. My window is 24 inches wide. The reason it has to be cut is due to it being longer than 20 inches but not longer than 30 inches. There is one piece with the hole for the vent, and then a second and third piece you can slide back and forth to make it longer to fit your window. However, I only needed an additional 4 inches so the sliding piece covered half of the hole. Therefore, I had to cut some length off of the second piece so that it wouldn't cover the hole. It was very easy to cut with just a box cutter to create the line and then I was able to snap it in two.I did use the foam pieces provided with the unit for insulation but based on other reviews I plan to replace it with a more heavy-duty weathering strip. I didn't want to spend the money until I knew I was going to keep the A\/C unit.Cooling:I won't go into the different features I use the \"auto\" feature only which is to have the A\/C unit speed up or down, turn on or off to keep the room at the desired temperature. It took only a couple of hours for this portable A\/C unit to cool my room from 79 to 75, I was very impressed. I keep the unit on 24\/7. I keep it at a temp of 76 during the day and I turn it to 73 when I come home in the evening so it is nice and cool when we go to bed. There is no doubt when it comes to cooling it cools the room, there is definitely a noticeable difference in our room now.Noise:As I stated I have nothing to compare this to but I will admit it is not silent. That said no A\/C unit is silent. It did take us some time to get used to the noise as it does kick on and off or speed up and down in the middle of the night to keep the temperature at 73. I tried the sleep mode which seemed to be a more consistent noise but woke up that morning and my room was bordering on 77 degrees.  If there is a portable A\/C unit that is whisper quiet I would love to know, I can only assume it would cost a fortune.Cleaning:It says to clean the filters every week. I did not realize this but on week three I took out the filters and they were not dirty at all. I also checked to see if there was any water to drain and there was nothing. Maintenance so far has been super easy.It's a Keeper:Based on the fact that over time we have been able to get used to the noise the benefits of a cool room at night are well worth it!Pros:**Works quick and fast to cool room**Can say it easily cools a 250 sq ft room**Easy to use**Remote included to use from afar if needed**Easy to clean filter and drain optionsCons:**It is a little noisy but not more than any other A\/C I assume**No real scheduler to turn the unit on and off at specific timesThere is a \"timer\" on the remote control but I am looking for something I can set to say at 7:00 am turn the temp to xx and at 6:00 pm turn it to xx. I would LOVE to see an app of some sort incorporated with this so if you were away on vacation and forgot to turn it off you could do so.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723852800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Set it and forget it type of unit, rather cool","reviewDescription":"To start things off, I'm not usually a real big B+D fan.  I know well enough to know that, like most GIANT name brands, the name doesn't actually necessarily indicate who built the unit, but rather who's marketing and supporting it.  For all I know, this has 90% of the same guts as an LG unit.  (LG is regarded as the leader in portable\/window AC units, as well as Frigidaire).The product arrived in the retail box, which looks to be able to serve double duty as a shipping container because it is very sturdy, and it's assembled in such a way that it would just about collapse if it were shipped any way other than \"this side up\", and it's clearly marked as such on the box in many spots so you shouldn't run into the issue some reviewers talking about where they need to let it stand vertical for 24 hours prior to plugging it in and letting the pump go to work.I'm not exactly stupid, but there's a few things about this product that don't make a whole lot of sense, or are done in a needlessly complicated (cost saving) way.  To be fair though, this is my first time dealing with a portable AC unit so maybe they're all like this to one degree or another (get it?!)First, the window vent blocking plate situation... I'm in an older house with small windows, so I had to cut one of the panels so that it would give me the correct length.  This is some pretty heavy plastic, and I don't think it's reasonable to expect the typical consumer to even have the means to be able to cut one of these pieces of plastic.  A hacksaw worked fine.  Then you need to secure each of the telescoping panels (just shallow \"C\" channels, essentially) into eachother with screws so it becomes one unit.... this is supposed to be a PORTABLE AC unit.  If I really did buy this with the intent of moving it from one room to another, I'd be screwed since it's doubtful that each window is exactly the same size, and changing the size of the plate is not exactly a breeze.  I expected to see a more well thought out design for the window plate.  Luckily, this thing is staying upstairs in my attic-bedroom that easily reaches very warm temps on even a slightly warm day, and the central AC cannot keep up with it.Another gripe is the remote, and overall interface of operating the machine.  The top\/face of the machine has the love-em-or-hate-em capacitive touch buttons that provide no tactility, but instead a beep.  Whatever, it works.  Doing anything beyond turning it on and off and up and down requires the remote, which seems to send discreet commands for each incremental increase or decrease in temp, so that the temp displayed on the remote is never \"out of sync\" with the unit, as long as you change the temp at least once with the remote.  It's just an infrared send-only type of signal.  The real confusion comes in setting the sleep\/wake timer.  I read the directions and I can't figure it out.  I just operate it manually when I wake up and before I go to bed, which leads me to another gripeThe thing is loud!  I understand that in order for an AC unit to work, it has to move air, but even with the fan on low (which is useless because it does not push the cool air far enough towards me) the unit makes too much noise to sleep with running.  I could probably get around this by moving it to the other side of the room, but I don't want to (just yet) so I just put up with it.Most of the marketing graphics\/information on this product's Amazon listing are either glossed over, or just plain incorrect.  The picture that shows the exhaust vent is wrong, since it gets connected to an ovular shaped thing, and then goes out the window, and the filter does not slide out, you snap the holder out of the back, and snap the filter out of the holder.  Another instance of Marketing Gone Wild.But, it blasts out pretty cool air pretty quickly, and it's working to keep a somewhat large, low-ceiling attic bedroom at a comfortable 74 degrees even when it's hovering around 100 outside, so I have to give it some credit.  The \"AirSwing\" feature is nice- you can position the unit at an angle (in my case, the only way to get it closer to the wall and deal with the unwieldy hot-air hose coming out the back) and pitch the vents so it's still blowing as if it were positioned straight ahead.  I suppose in a more open space, it would be helpful to share some of the cool air with your visitors or other house dwellers.So, why buy this instead of a window unit?  I can yank out the plate and roll it into a closet at the end of our 2 month summer and let it sit for the other 10 months or so, instead of futzing with big drippy, rusty rectangles and angle brackets or 2x4s screwed into the stucco.We'll see how well the atomization of water goes as far as its ability to dehumidify.  The manual promises that emptying moisture from the unit only needs to be done at the end of the season, once, but it also says the sleep timer works.UPDATEAfter living with this unit for a couple VERY hot weeks, one season after another, I've learned a few things* It's pretty likely that the built in water tank will fill up, causing the unit to stop producing cold air.  I remedied this by keeping the included clear plastic tube attached to the back\/bottom and elevating the unit onto a sturdy little platform with the casters removed.  Now it's free to drip-drop the water it collects down the tube into a sawed off orange juice container, which needs to be emptied every couple days (!!!) Best to put that inside a small trash can just in case you forget to check it and it overflows all over your floor, not that that could ever happen...* Rather than having it vent out a window, it's now venting out of a hole in the wall that was once for the exhaust port of a heater that was mounted to the wall. This enabled me to get it very close to the wall and even cut the collapsible hose down to 1\/3 the size... the hose radiates heat, and now there's less of it. Also it's easier for it to discharge warm air since the path is shorter.* Periodically it will apparently draw a large spike of power and trip the breaker.  Granted my old home has some pretty skuzzy wiring.  It's not done it while I'm there to watch it, only while I'm away, so I come back to an 85 degree, muggy bedroom.  The built in GFCI has not yet tripped.* The fact that these single hose units actively discharge cooled air and create negative pressure bothers me and I'm trying to find a not-entirely-inelegant way to provide this thing with a source of fresh outside air, effectively converting it to a dual hose unit... more to come on thatBut, still running strong after several heaves and hoes into and out of the closet and sitting unused for months and months at a time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"1,054 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1527724800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Decent 14K BTU portable AC with caveats","reviewDescription":"I have a 10-15 year old portable AC unit that was handed down to me and it still works for the most part however it is extremely loud, smells musty even though I have sprayed lots of Armor All AC vent\/duct odor neutalizer, almost twice the size of the Black and Decker, and it is not super cold anymore.So I looked to buy a new portable AC unit for my master bedroom and settled on this Black and Decker. I really wanted to get an LG or Asian brand just for reliability but all of them are at least a few hundred more than this Black and Decker. So after doing a lot of research and reading review sites online as well as Amazon, I settled on this one because it was the cheapest I could find for 14K BTU.Pros:- Affordable for one room comfort instead of paying $25K for whole house AC.- Ice cold. Cools down my 365 square foot master bedroom from 80 degrees F to low 70's after about an hour. My upstairs gets warm and collects all the heat in the summer.- Very easy set up. After removing from the box I put together the window contraption(without the foam insulation for the window edges) and in about 10 minutes I was enjoying cold air.- It's much more quiet compared to my old unit that I replaced(my old unit is 10X as loud lol). However the Black and Decker compressor makes a high pitched whining sound that others have mentioned which is annoying at first but I guess I tune it out because like I said it's still 10X quieter than my old one.- It's a lot smaller than my previous AC unit(my other unit is twice the size.- Supposedly it will tell you when you need to drain the condensation tank which is great because my previous unit gave zero indication.- Comes with remote which will come in handy when I need to use it while I sleep.- Draining the tank should be easy because it has handles on the side to grab when picking it up. In comparison, my old unit was twice as big and had no handles to grab onto. This unit comes with a tube that you can use with a drain pan if you like.- Good price compared to other 14K BTU units, all the others are like $650 to $900.Cons:- It seems outdated, maybe this is an old model but for 2024 you would think it would be more high tech. Like with an LCD\/LED screen on the actual unit with more intuitive controls, etc. You have to use the cheap remote if you want to have access to more functions ie. Changing the direction of air from left to right, plus there is a function on the remote called MAX function for cooling which is the fastest way to cool your room. I have no idea why they couldn't include both of these functions on the top panel of the AC unit?? It's only accessible using the remote for some reason.- When the compressor is on it makes a really high pitched vibration noise. It was the very first thing I noticed the first time I turned it on. It's not a deal breaker for me because like I said, my previous old AC unit is 10X as loud.- The 2 blue lines for standby mode cannot be turned off. So at night the blue lines illuminate your room and are very annoying. I have to put a book or magazine over it at night.In summary, if you are on a budget and need a portable AC unit that can cool down a 365 square foot room easily then this could be for you. If money is no problem, then you should spend on a better brand like LG or Midea.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"117 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717113600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Powers completely down several times a week...","reviewDescription":"I had another unit just like this one only looked different. That unit lasted 4 years. It was amazing. Never had a problem with it until it ran out of freon and you can't recharge these units. It made my bedroom almost freezing which I love when I am sleeping. The previous unit would not turn off when the room reached temperature. Just the compressor turned off and the fan kept running. This unit does turn off when it reaches temperature which is ok. But it powers completely down several times a week. Not every night. Like someone has hit the power button. It does not power back up. I am woke up by the sound of the beep when the buttons are pressed. And I have to get the remote and power it back on. Weird thing though is it's a 2 beep sound instead of the 1 beep that it normally does. If I don't wake up to the beep then I will wake up sweating because the room has gone back to the normal temp of the house and I am under 2 layers of blankets. Is it a defect or is it a ghost?

{"reviewTitle":"Works great, my only complaint is the hose...","reviewDescription":"I bought this AC for my 2 car garage.  Insulating it against the heat and cold, only slows how hot\/cold it gets, so I needed something to help with summer temps and working on projects in the garage.In terms of cooling, this is great.  It makes it bearable inside without having to have my door wide open for bugs, lookie-loos, and rodents to intrude.This is made for window venting, but I cut a hole into my garage side door and installed an external vent to attach the hose to.Now to my one complaint: the hose itself is certainly not 5\", it's closer to 6\".  It is not insulated, so all the waste heat that doesn't make it out of the door vent, radiates around the hose itself and back into the garage.  Lastly, it's not exactly a standard size hose, so simply buying an insulated 5 or 6\" hose simply doesn't fit the attachment points.  The only other option is to use some plastic adapters and hose clamps to make things fit.  That...may be my next option, but this setup works well enough, for now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722729600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Works very well but beware of the BTU rating","reviewDescription":"I should have read and researched more carefully. The 14,000 BTU is the old ASHRAE rating. The new DOE rating is 8,550 BTU. You can research the difference.Being that the last several weeks have been in the high 90s, I am glad that I purchased this. Installation and set up are easy as long as you follow the instructions.The unit has cooled well in the few weeks that I have been using it almost 24 hours a day. It is not particularly noisy. I am cooling a 700 square foot room. One feature that I like is that the intake air is drawn from inside the room, not from outside. The air is recirculated, so it is not trying to cool 90 degree air but whatever the inside air temperature is. This also has the benefit of keeping the high pollen levels put of the house.Only twice, when the heat indices were over 100 did I have to turn on my old unit to help.Overall, I would recommend this, especially if you are on the quandary that l am in.I have a 12,000 BTU A\/C in a sleeve unit that is mounted 7 feet off the floor. It is a Frigidaire that was built by GM in the 1960s. It still works but I have been looking to replace it for years now. The problem I have is that while I may be able to purchase a sleeve unit at a big box store, no one offers installation. I can't lift 88 pounds twice, so I needed to look for a back up plan. This unit fit the bill.I was skeptical at first. Now I have the thermostat set at 79 degrees and the room stays cool. I was always a warm person and I would keep the temperature at 72-74. No more.The only concern now, is how long the unit will last. Durable goods no longer last for 10-20 years.

{"reviewTitle":"Powerful, but maybe noisy","reviewDescription":"To me, this is an emergency unit to plug to a generator after total power loss, when the house HVAC is not available.This was set in a 500sqft room, outside temperature during the day was in the mid-90s, so the room and the walls were hot. The AC did cool the room to 74 degrees, and kept it at that temperature throughout the night, but it also had to stay on the whole time, even with doors closed to avoid loss of cold. Advantage of this however is that as the unit is noisy, the fact that it stayed on all the time meant that the noise was constant and became a simple white noise you get used to. Also, due to the high humidity, the unit filled up with water and could not process it as intended. When I moved it back to storage, water spilled. Next time I will install the drain hose which was supposedly not necessary.Otherwise, installation was simple and straightforward. Unit is somewhat heavy, but rolls beautifully on hard floors, and can be carried with a light dolly on carpets.For the price, it is quite convenient.

{"reviewTitle":"Many users find AC gets stuck on MAX after a while","reviewDescription":"This AC unit can really cool down a room!My issue with it is that like any portable AC unit, it can be pretty loud.  A lot of that sound though is dependent on what speed the blower is running on.  Like many users I've seen online, I'm running into a problem where the blower is adjustable in fan mode, but when on AC, it only runs on max level no matter what the fan level indicates.The issue for this is that it cools quickly in short bursts, then turns off, and back on.  The sound difference between it off and on max level and the sound of the compressor kicking in is enough to wake me up from sleep.  I would have preferred a system that was more constantly running at a lower rate with noise that I could get more used to.Also, you cannot turn off or dim the lights on top of the unit.

{"reviewTitle":"It's... Fine","reviewDescription":"I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, this AC is simply fine. It doesn't excel at its job, nor does it really even meet my expectations, but it's also not disappointing enough to me to ask for a return \/ replacement.For starters, this thing is LOUD. There is no way I can sleep with it on (I have it in my bedroom), as it sounds like someone is running lawn equipment next to me. I have no way to measure the actual decibels, but it's too much. Also mine kind of grumbles a little bit? Like it has a motor inside that already trying to die, but only sometimes.I do like the look and size. It's unassuming, and despite being heavy it is relatively compact (at least, compared to ones with similar cooling ratings - more on that later). And setup was fairly easy - all I had to do was plug in the unit and go. I also appreciate the packaging - assuming your courier delivered it upright, the box slides right off and you're close to being done.I generally like the remote as well - most stuff is relatively intuitive, but I did have to consult the manual for a few buttons. However, it feels like most of the functions of this unit and remote don't actually do anything... For example, on the product page it lists \"Auto Air Swing\". I have toggled that on and off, and there is no distinguishable difference in where the air is blowing. Fan speed? Nope, moving through these does nothing on my device. The one saving grace is that On\/Off works and the timer does as well.One of the big reasons I purchased this unit was both the manufacturer and the BTU rating. Black+Decker is a brand that I'm familiar with, and while they have been moving towards the \"everything is junk and replaceable\" model that so many brands are flirting with, I haven't had issues with them... yet. I hope this unit will be reliable, but I'm not impressed so far. The hose accompanying this unit is not well attached to the plastic connector collars, so when the unit is on it blows hot air backwards from the collar back into my room (I wrapped the area in tape, since - and I'm not an expert - hot air is the opposite of cold air, which is what I DO want blowing out of my AC into the room). On top of that, all their advertising uses the outdated and generally inaccurate ASHRAE system, since in that one it's easier to \"get bigger number, is good\". When you find the more updated DOE rating (8,400 vs 14,000), it falls short of some of the competition at the same price. In fact now that I write it out, I do wish that I had gotten the one from a certain wholesale store for the same price...If you don't have local options, this will do, but it's not a great deal for what you're getting.

{"reviewTitle":"Extremely loud buzzing noise and loud beeping when buttons are pressed. Cools well though","reviewDescription":"This ac cools very well. I love everything about it, except for the noise. It\u2019s almost unbearable.I bought another ac unit before this Black and Decker model that was defective (another brand). The first ac unit shut off after it cooled and never turned back on. So I bought this Black and Decker model since a friend recommended it.I\u2019ll start by saying it cools my room VERY quickly. Like within 2 minutes my room can go from 78 to 75. It\u2019s insane how quickly it works. That exceeded my expectations. I bought this unit because I overheat when I sleep and the person I live with doesn\u2019t want me setting the house ac too low. I prefer 72-74 degrees, so that I don\u2019t wake up drenched in sweat. I like that it comes with the remote.My grievance with this unit is the noise. The unit\u2019s fan noise is good. It\u2019s a moderate whooshing sound comparable to a typical standup fan. That\u2019s great white noise.  However, when the compressor kicks on and the ac is actively cooling, the noise is unbelievably loud. It makes an incredibly loud, disruptive buzzing and vibrational sound. Imagine your neighbor standing outside your window with their lawn mower. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like.Another annoying noise is the beeping. Every button you press on the remote or the machine makes a loud beep. There\u2019s no way to disable that. There\u2019s no \u201csilent mode\u201d. That\u2019s stupid product design if you ask me. It wouldn\u2019t have been that hard to make a silence beep button on it.The instructions manual said it\u2019s it makes noise, it\u2019s on uneven ground. This is not true in my case. It\u2019s on hard flooring and it\u2019s level. The weird part is, if I prop the unit on an angle like the Leaning Tower of Piza, it runs slightly quieter. Another weird thing about this unit is that the lower I set the temperature, the quieter the buzzing noise is. I don\u2019t understand why! So I have to run the unit colder than I would like (69-71 degrees). If I set it any warmer than that, the buzzing sounds like a lawnmower. I speculate it\u2019s running at 60-70 decibels when it\u2019s SUPPOSED to run at less than 55DB.I am no stranger to portable ac units. Yes, they all make some kind of noise. Of course they do. They are ac units after all. But this is the loudest one I\u2019ve ever been around.It\u2019s so noisy, it\u2019s hard to fall asleep with it on. I have to shove my earplugs deeeeeep into my ears and sleep with a pillow over my head. Even then, I still sometimes have trouble.I don\u2019t know how y\u2019all other reviewers are saying this is a quiet unit. I think maybe the one I have is defective. Maybe there\u2019s a loose or broken component inside it. I don\u2019t know.On the plus side, the loudness of it prevents any other noises from waking me up. My family\u2019s noises NEVER wake me, and that used to be a problem before. Neighbors don\u2019t wake me up, knocking, or doorbells. So I guess being loud has some benefit.To wrap up, I don\u2019t think I would recommend this unit unless noise doesn\u2019t bother you and you sleep with earplugs. The buzzing is enough to drive me crazy. Then again, maybe my product is faulty. Even if that\u2019s the case, not a good look for Black and Decker. I thought they had quality products, but I won\u2019t be buying from this brand again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723161600000}

Followed up and CC'd original distro in which they confirmed again they are not the correct group to help. I was hoping someone internally at the company could help direct my request. No resolution or response yet.UPDATE 05\/29\/2024: Still...NO....response! Does this company support their product at all after sale?

Submitted ticket with requested model\/serial number information and attached copy of purchase receipt.  Received email confirmation of ticket being filed and was notified it could be 2-4 days before a response is received.UPDATE 06\/08\/2024:  Warranty support representative emailed requesting a picture of the serial number sticker from the unit as well as pictures of the unit and\/or any damage to it.  There was no damage to the unit so sent picture of the practically new undamaged unit.UPDATE 06\/10\/2024:  Warranty support representative responded back stating that the unit was out of warranty.  I responded again with copy of the purchase invoice as well as copies of all communication with B&D customer support which began prior to the warranty period ending.  They concluded that since the warranty period had just ended that they would help correct the situation by sending a replacement unit, however, that replacement unit will NOT come with a warranty period.  I agreed to these terms.  They submitted instructions to cut off power cord and remove the serial number sticker and then mail those to a specified address (vs having to ship entire unit back).  Once those are received they would process the claim to ship a new unit.**Changed star rating from 1-star to 2-star at this point due to B&D supporting their product.  Issue still not resolved though**UPDATE 06\/12\/2024:  Shipped requested items to specified address and emailed the confirmed tracking number to the warranty support representative.UPDATE 06\/14\/2024:  Representative confirmed receipt of tracking number and they have processed replacement unit shipment to me.  Should be received within 5-7 business days.UPDATE 06\/22\/2024:  No unit or confirmed tracking received yet.  Contacted warranty support for update but not response.UPDATE 06\/25\/2024:  Received email from warrant support that they have just NOW shipped the replacement unit and emailed a tracking number to confirm.  Estimated delivery 06\/28\/2024 per UPS tracking.UPDATE 06\/28\/2024:  UPS notification stating they could NOT delivery the replacement unit because when B&D shipped the unit it was missing the apt number.  Submitted address correction to UPS and delivery was rescheduled for 06\/29\/2024.UPDATE 06\/29\/2024:  FINALLY received the replacement AC unit.  It works and the compressor is pumping out cool air!  Although B&D needs to work on their customer service response times, in the end they did stand behind their product to make things right.***Updating review from 2-star to 3-star due to issue resolution and I am satisfied.

{"reviewTitle":"Helps a little for 500~ sqft","reviewDescription":"I'd like to start by saying that I've ordered this a little over 1.5 months ago. So LONG term is yet to be determined. I'd say that it is definitely decent but don't think it's going to ice over your room. We have a small living room and kitchen that are somewhat adjoining. It's taken our house from 85 or so down to 75 or so on hot days. I would approximate the space to about 500sqft due to our entire house being 980. It has developed a slight rattle. I'm not sure how or why it's been stationary in the corner not moved since I installed it. It is pretty large compared to the other one we have to cool off our upstairs space. It definitely does a better cooling job than that one. The vent im not a fan of. It will point straight up or at a slight angle forward. Not down or straight out. Overall I'd say that I'm pleased but concerned about the rattling noise as far as the overall longevity of the unit. Something worth mentioning is that our unit did not come with the plastic insert for the window. I planed on making a permanent hole in our wall anyways so didn't affect me. But I looked into getting one and I either had to return the unit and hoped I got one with the next one that came OR contact black and decker and go through their customer service. Either way if I had planned on hooking it up through the window I would have had to get pretty creative for the mean time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723248000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great until a clicking noise started","reviewDescription":"I bought this air conditioner in April 2022 because it was rated very highly on a couple of websites. I couldn\u2019t use one of the more efficient dual hose A\/Cs because of a small space and I liked that it was white (why are so many A\/Cs black?) because it blends with the walls.For two years, I was pretty happy with it. It\u2019s not as good as the dual hose unit I have in another room, but it served its purpose within my constraints. And then it started making an intermittent, but increasingly more frequent clicking noise. It sounds a little bit like someone tapping artificial finger nails. I think it\u2019s because the little vents have loosened with time. I might try to superglue them in place to see if that works.Unfortunately, warranties for everything are short these days and this is no exception. I think that this is probably about how long they hoped it would last.Three stars because it technically works at cooling the room and at driving me crazy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1725062400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Works decent but not cold","reviewDescription":"I am used to having window air conditioners that are $50 out of Walmart. They make a room ice cold by the morning. Unfortunately this particular model really just kind of takes the humidity out of the air, I have it on the highest level all night long. Sometimes an hour before I even get to my room. When I wake up in the morning. It's just pleasantly cool, not cold and if it's a super hot and humid day outside, it doesn't really get cool in the room. Just takes out the humidity in general. The draining on this is intense.You need at least a gallon and a half sized bucket for it to drain into continually, there are days where I know it's super humid so I had to get up in the middle of the night to empty the bucket out or it spills all over the floor. Lately I live Northeast and it's been very hot and humid, it's gone through  2 gallon size bucket One and a half times a night at least. Not overly impressed with it. I wish it was much stronger in the sense that it was colder. If I had the choice, I'd take the $50 Walmart window sized air conditioner.

It works well enough. It cools if it\u2019s below 90 degrees but once outside temps reach 95 or above there are some issues with keeping cold.HELPFUL TIPS FOR USUNG ( this does require a weekly upkeep)1. Don\u2019t let it run for hours on end the tube will heat up and generate heat within the room.2. Dust and vacuum out the filters weekly so nothing gets clogged3. Drain the water at least once bi weekly if not weekly to prevent mod growth and use the fan cycle for about 30 min after.Step 3 is only needed if you live in very humid climates but they do require to drain at least once a month.The first time I got the ac it lasted a total of 4 months and customer service couldn\u2019t help. Let\u2019s hope the new model lasts longer.The three stars is due to the absolutely horrid customer service. You will never get anyone than a snarky man who can care less about the unit malfunctioning or not working. Asking to be transferred to a higher rep or the US office is impossible because they hang up on you. They will not give you a new model to send it just take it as you\u2019ll never get that 400$ back and you\u2019ll have to buy a new unit.Working in customer service if this is who black and decker have to represent them then this company won\u2019t last much longer they use to be a respected brand with great quality products and what they have now is laughable.If your short on cash and need something simple to cool your room then make the most of it for however long it lasts.

{"reviewTitle":"Low air output and no directional control for air","reviewDescription":"Thank GOD i bought these units for my bedrooms for this past summer! Me and the fur babies really suffered through the heat wave the year prior even with a swamp cooler and double fans on at all times. So down the rabbit hole i went looking for portable A\/C units.With the unit on the highest speed and coldest setting, it\u2019s not that loud. I have standing fans that are louder than both my units combined. I can easily watch tv in my room on the low sound setting I normally use  (without the unit on) with the unit on high.My biggest complaint is you can\u2019t really adjust the air direction (up or down, left or right). Also there isn\u2019t a lot of a\/c air output.  When I needed the cold air to be pushed around the room, I ended up placing an oscillating tower or standing fan in front of it to get the air to move throughout the room.Also when purchasing these i would recommend going up one more level than the recommended one.  One of the units I purchased was for a larger room and it worked so much better, then the second unit that I purchased based on the seller\u2019s recommendation for the square footage. The temperature difference was really felt when it was time to sleep. One room\u2019s temp (the higher powered unit) was cool enough to need a blanket and I used the sleep mode frequently so I didn\u2019t freeze all night versus the room (with the recommended unit size) that just barely cooled off the room. And even some nights, the unit was set at 62 WITH a standing fan pointed right at the bed and it was still hot and uncomfortable.If you\u2019re going to spend the money on something like this, it\u2019s better to spend a little bit more, go with the unit for a larger room.  It\u2019s worth the money when you can enjoy the benefits of a cool room after dealing with the heat all day.The units are easy to wheel around and set up wasn\u2019t that difficult. But I also didn\u2019t completely seal up my windows because I still use them during summer. I also was able to get the window adapter adjusted for easy removal and to put back in place.I\u2019m not opposed to purchasing this brand again however I will be looking for something with a stronger air output and with the capacity to shift the air direction. I most likely will be purchasing a couple more units for next summer. This unit isn\u2019t a complete \u201cno\u201d  on buying again but for the price,  i will definitely be looking (again, heavy sigh) at other brands to see if I can find an A\/C unit with better air output and directional control.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700179200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Deceiving Performance Specifications","reviewDescription":"I bought this unit for a 500 square foot apartment. The unit cannot cool even drop the living room temperature below 74 degrees on a 88 degree day in a 12 foot x 12 foot with 8 foot ceiling while trying to cool the rest of the apartment. I was using box fans to draw air to other areas. After 8 hours I gave up and opened the windows since it cooled off already. The specification 8400 BTU DOE (14000 BTU ASHRAE 128) 700 square feet is not true. The true rating of this product is 8400 BTU. The 14000 BTU ASHRAE 128 rating is marketing to deceive customers and should not be used which is the reason for 3 stars. A good example is audio amplifier ratings such as: 300 watts maximum per channel x 2 \/ 100 watts RMS per channel x 2. The RMS rating is the true measure of performance in this scenario or example. In hindsight I wish I researched the specification differences of ASHRAE 128 vs DOE\/SACC. I went by the square foot rating of 700. I would have picked a different item based on the actual output, but I now have to buy more units to make up for this. I will eat the sandwich I made. They do need to however get rid of the ASHRAE 128 rating since it is not a real-world rating. The good? The unit is pretty quiet actually and the remote is decent and can make everything function from the remote. The fan blows pretty hard, enough to get slight movement of my chandelier. A nice feature is the internal vent swing that you can turn on or off, moves air side to side continuously to get better air distribution. The touch controls are nice. The install required me to use a jig saw to cut some off a section of the second part of the plastic window mounting hardware. (the part that holds the tube in the window) They give you three of these parts. I have narrow windows so I needed a extra 6 inch piece to attach to the main part that holds the tube. This good as it is flexible for installation needs or for odd size windows down to nine or ten inches wide. The foam is cheap and the sun will destroy it to dust. I used the self adhesive rolls from the hardware store. (much better) Ultimately this unit is nice but, would be good for a closed off room or as a supplement assisting another AC unit for larger spaces. It will not do a 700 square foot space in the real world.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714694400000}

We eagerly purchased this promise of wearing clothing without pit stains and worked hard to wait for it to arrive (remember when prime was 2 days?). Anywho, it arrives and I am struck full of hope and possibilities. As I unwrapped the box, I see the instructional manual. I read her, I reread her. I even glance at the Spanish section just to make sure I\u2019ve understood. I begin the process. First step? The hose is supposed to come preassembled, attached to the two demonic pieces of plastic that had my sweat mixing with frustrated tears as I desperately tried all things to get them to go together. Mine was not preassembled. It took over an hour, many words not appropriate for an Amazon review, and, in the end, duct tape to make this happen. With that being said, as it blasts beautiful air, I can feel my tears and sweat drying. I hope your hose comes preassembled, or that you are a professional wrestler, or hey, both.

I also appreciate its portability, allowing me to move it as needed. The setup and instructions were clear and simple to follow. The remote control is decent, with a good set of features that make it easy to adjust settings.

It is a little loud, but not too bad. I sit right next to it and I don't mind. It cools well, it's easy to use, it blows the air around and you can adjust it to blow the air in a few different directions. It does what it sets out to do, and that's the important thing. I can cool a room down to 72 even in the summer. I've tried blowing the cool air to other parts of the house, but that just doesn't work. It's basically just going to cool one room, whatever room its in.Keep in mind, I bought the largest version you can get so your milage may vary.It does a really bad job at sealing the window where it vents, but it still works to cool down the room, so I guess I can't complain about that too much. Still I'd recommend getting some tape to try to form a better seal, either that or just giving up and accepting a low quality seal around the window.It is a little bit of a pain to take out of the packaging and get it set up for the first time, but once you do that it's really simple. You have to let it sit upright for 24+ hours after you get it, so keep that in mind. Don't ignore that step, that's actually critical and can't be skipped. I recommend 48 hours, actually. I know, it sucks to wait, but trust me it's better that way.Overall, it does what it claims to do. It works, it cools down a room to 72 even in the summer, I have no real complaints. It also looks nice and although it's slightly large, it doesn't take up too much space overall.

One room is our granddaughter's when she visits and the other a cozy TV\/computer area. After limited use so far, I am pleased with the portable air conditioner.INSTALL... in my situation with double-hung replacement windows, the slider\/exhaust outlet was an easy install with one cut of a slider panel. The exhaust hose connects easily to the unit and outlet. It is flexible and expandable but keeping it as short as possible is desirable. Installation in odd sized windows or thru a wall would be more complicated.PORTABLE... yes, as you could easily move it from room to room to provide cool air and\/or dehumidification as needed if you have similarity sized windows on the same floor. It does have casters and rolls easily. It is a bit heavy to move up and down stairs. If you have different windows adjustments may need to be made.CONTROLS... I haven't used the remote (batteries not included) but it looks intuitive. The controls on the unit are also intuitive and easy to set. It has cool, dehumidify, and fan-only settings. Three fan speeds plus auto. Also a 24 hour timer for delayed startup or shutdown.MAINTENANCE... other than cleaning the evaporator filter (easy) and perhaps draining water occasionally (instructions indicate there is \"auto water evaporation\" so in cool mode it doesn't need to be drained except in very high humidity). The unit will shut down if the reservoir is full.COOLING... puts out cool air as expected. It is slightly under powered for my situation but along with a fan to help move the cooled air to another room it will make these rooms more livable in the hot months.

Oh boy did it struggle! Perhaps the unit wasn't up to the task or perhaps the space \u2013 with its high ceilings and open entryways \u2013 was beyond its capabilities. We returned it and then upgraded to this 14,000 BTU B&D beast. So far we've run it twice during high 80s \/ low 90s days, and the thing has done an incredibly excellent job! I'm sure the higher BTUs help, but I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing an insulated cover (as pictured) for the exhaust hose. Although the unit is designed to push out all that hot air through the exhaust hose, the host itself still gets REALLY HOT and that heat will emanate back into the room which will negate the efforts that the A\/C is putting forth. (It boggles me that those hoses aren't designed to be insulated, so buying and putting one of those suckers on will make a world of a difference!)The unit can get a wee bit noisy but \u2013 unless you have the condenser outside \u2013 what A\/C unit isn't noisy?  However, the one thing that could be fixed is this: the hose too easily becomes detached from the unit adapter. It was annoying, and we had to prop it up with a vase so it wouldn't pop out (as pictured). The adapter could be designed to be more secure.From what I've researched so far, portable A\/Cs, in general, don't seem to be too reliable. Fingers crossed that this thing lasts and lasts for seasons to come!

The central AC works fine for the bathroom. Even with a new heat pump for upstairs, it still doesn't cool or heat our main bedroom.Firstly, I wasn\u2019t playing around when ordering a new unit. I did my research. CONSUMER REPORTS, READ OVER 1,000 REVIEWS, and a recommendation from a TRUSTED STRAMFITTER (HVAC) guy. With the reviews, I noticed several things: most of the negative reviews were from frustrated people who, had they taken care of the device correctly, it would still be working. ALL portable AC units need DIY maintenance. Clean the filter and drain the unit at least once every 30 days in high humidity or every 90 days in low humidity. Even though it says EVAPORATION, it still needs to be drained. Another issue is that people ignore what they are ordering and then blame it on the companies when it is their lack of attention. Complaining and writing a review about a product they never used seems pointless. Remember, this is an investment; if something is missing when you open it, return it within 30 days and get a replacement. It\u2019s that easy.I have 2in the room. I placed one furthest from the unit and one on the unit. This way, I always know the temp & humidity in the room.THE SOUND: (WATCH VIDEO)The sound is EXACTLY as it is supposed to be. Those who stated it was too loud have never used an indoor portable AC unit. It\u2019s not the same as a window unit.  Window units have the motor and fans OUTSIDE the window, so the sound is different. If you stand outside next to a window unit when it is on, it is LOUD. Basically, the portable AC is quieter as a whole.THE WINDOW KIT: (See Pictures)This could be a little better. It almost didn\u2019t fit my STANDARD window. I never use the FOAM that comes with the unit. I purchasedinstead. The foam they provide will get dried out and become dust.THE REMOTE:Very easy to use. Follow the manual.THE DISPLAY:Easy to understand & operate. Follow the manual.THE HEAT:Heats our room perfectly. We only keep it set at 68\u00b0 because there isn\u2019t a need for any warmer.THE A\/C:Our bedroom is 425 sq ft, over a garage, and the sun beats in 2 of the four windows so badly that we had to black them out with. This unit cools the room rapidly and keeps it comfortable.I like that once the room reaches my chosen temperature, it shuts down but comes back on when it warms up by 1.0\u00b0. My other units ran non-stop. This functions more like an AC\/HEAT PUMP.I\u2019m impressed so far, and if anything changes, I will update this review to let others interested in purchasing this device know.This portable AC is exactly as advertised, well-made, and works well. The PRICE is in the usual range.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"632 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711497600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing Unit!  Then why would I return it?","reviewDescription":"After doing quite a bit of research, I decided to purchase the Black & Decker 14,000 BUT Portable AC.  This unit is fantastic.  I bought it for use in my 12' x 14' office.  The office has two persons (my wife and I) and many computer systems (7 large servers, a couple of desktop systems, numerous battery backup units, numerous monitors, etc).  To make matters worse, the office unfortunately gets full sun for more than 5 hours throughout the day.  Though we have a central AC, the thermostat is in the family room ... so either the office is comfortable and the rest of the house if 68 degrees ... or the house is comfortable and the office is 86 degrees.  Moreover, cost goes way up if we keep the office cool ... even if we were OK with the rest of the house cold like the north pole.Before this unit------------------Before we received this unit, the office would run anywhere from 82 - 86 degrees many times higher during summer.  With this unit, we were able to keep the office easily at 72 degrees (much colder if we wanted).Shipping & Packaging-------------------------Shipping was great.  The unit arrived in perfect packaging and was free from any scratches, dents or any other marks.  Unpacking was very straight forward.  As a reminder, the unit needs to be upright.  Per the documentation, they suggest the unit be left upright for at least 6 hours before use ... preferably 24 hours.  I decided to wait the 24 hours since I did not know how the unit was handled during the shipping process.Operation------------The unit pushes some seriously cold air.  Like all AC units, when it starts-up, cold air does not come out immediately.  But within 30 seconds of starting, it was blowing freezing cold air.  Within 5 minutes the room cooled down and during the day, it maintained the temperature with ease (we set it for 72 degrees).  In fact, we did set it down to 65 degrees and it would run until the room reached that temperature ... that was just simply too cold for us.Quiet-------This unit was much quieter than we expected.  Even when on video conference calls using speaker-phone, there was no issue.  Others on the call could not tell the unit was running.  I am not saying the unit is stealth quiet, but the noise level was surprisingly low ... on-par with the fans from my computer servers.Why Returning?--------------If the unit was so great, they why would I return it?  Well there were two issues with the unit I did not like: 1) Placement and 2) SecurityPlacement----------------Based on the layout of our office along with the servers, desks, multiple monitors, etc ... there was no real convenient location to put the unit.  So how did we know the unit works well?  I temporarily moved desks \/ computers out of the way so I could mount the hose and pass-through to the window.  Originally, I had planned on drilling a hole in the wall (this is a 6\" diameter hose!!!) and putting a one-way flange & baffle with a fine screen mesh to ensure no outside critters could get in.  I bought this with the intent of installing it somewhat permanently.  Even with this in mind, where I could place the unit would not be close enough to the flange for the exhaust hose.  I could buy additional hose extensions but because of the diameter of the exhaust hose, I just could not easily run the hose behind desks, etc.  Keep in mind the hose does not make 'right-angle' turns either.  Also, the exhaust hose is rather sturdy - which is actually a good thing.Security----------The window mounting assembly is actually quite easy and seemed to work well for the intended purpose.  As a reminder, I only ran the unit for a few days so not sure what the long-term durability of the hose and mounting assembly would be like.  In any event, I am very security conscious.  I did not feel the window mounting option allowed me to secure the window effectively enough to prevent someone from pushing the baffles in and then getting inside the office and our home.Who is this unit for ?------------------------This unit works exceptionally well especially for someone that needs to cool down a reasonably large room quickly and quietly.  This probably would work great for 2nd floor (or higher floors) homes where outside access to the window would be limited or non-existent.I have decided to order a Mini Split AC instead.  It will allow me the flexibility of placement and will enable me to maintain the security aspect.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"91 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1721174400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great AC unit!","reviewDescription":"Edit: Reviewed June 21st, it is now August 14th and it is still working AMAZINGLY. I found that since it is so humid in the summer in MN that the water accumulation needed to be drained constantly so we have ended up just keeping the drainage hose in the unit and having it empty continuously into a large container that we just dump out daily and sometimes twice daily. I think it could probably break the machine to have too much water accumulate in it, I\u2019m not sure what would happen if it was full and was worried that would happen and it could leak into other parts of the machine so for now in these humid months we are just letting it drain 24\/7. This is a great ac unit and dehumidifier, you definitely need it. It is very powerful and has literally saved my spouse and I from having to move in with my mom during the super hot weeks because we can\u2019t afford $5000 for a new ac unit. It is amazing that on 100 degree days my living room is actually COLD!This is a really good AC unit, it works perfectly. I got it for our downstairs (we live in a smallish townhouse) living room\/kitchen area. Not sure how many square feet our downstairs area is but I would guess less than 700. We got the 14,000 BTU unit that covers up to 700 sq ft. It runs constantly and yes is loud but I really don't care as long as it works, and it does. We have been keeping it set at 68 degrees and it basically just runs for a while then shuts off for a while and runs again, continuously throughout the day and night to keep it at that temperature. The only window we have in the downstairs of our townhouse is a sliding door, so we had to get a kit for the hose to run out of and for the whole height of the door opening to be covered. It is soooo hot and humid outside, but inside our house it is crisp and cool. We had to get this because our regular AC unit is completely broken and unfixable, its just too old and it quit on us. I bought this on 6\/7 and it's now 6\/21, I know that's not a super long time to know if it's going to keep working but I absolutely will edit my review if it stops working for any reason or becomes less effective. The remote is nice, I like having that option to change it, but I really don't have to use it much. From 6\/7 to 6\/21 with it running nonstop, we checked the water drainage compartment and it only had a small amount of water, like basically 1 or 2 shot glasses worth. Not sure how the nonstop use of the unit has effected our energy bill, will have to update on that when I get the bill.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718928000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great little unit for what it does.","reviewDescription":"I work from home. My home office, with all its computer equipment, heats up considerably. The office is always 15-20\u00b0 warmer than the outdoor temp. In the summer, 90\u00b0 outside can easily mean the office is 100-110\u00b0. Ouch. Not only is 100\u00b0 an uncomfortable work environment, but it's dangerously hot for any computer equipment.Small 12x12 former bedroom -- I originally tried a Honeywell 8,000BTU unit. I gave up on that after a month or so and gave that unit away. It could not cool the room, due to the computer equipment, despite the unit running pretty much constantly.I then upgraded and for the past several years I've been running a Wynter 14,000 BTU portable AC. It was loud, but it did the job of cooling the room. The condenser burnt out about 6 months ago, but it would still blow cooler air and suck the hot air out of the room. So I continued to use it until I found a replacement. It never really got \"cold\" without the condenser functioning (and no one wanted to repair it) but would easily cool the room to a more livable temp - around 80\u00b0. However, it ran almost constantly in summer months. So my electric bills easily climbed by $100+ each month.Naturally, I decided to replace the old unit, which was breaking down, and decided on this Black&Decker 14,000BTU unit. The B&D unit EASILY cools the room in a few minutes and keeps it cool all day (cooling, then shutting off, then kicking back on several minutes later). Overall the B&D unit is much quieter than previous units I've owned. Of course there's the sound of the fan\/rushing air when it's running, and there's a loud \"ca-chunk\" when it starts up the condenser (as expected). But, unlike previous units, I can still talk on the phone 5 feet away without having to first shut the unit off.In addition, the hose attachment on the back of the unit is LIGHT YEARS better than any previous unit I've seen. I do not want to have to install dual hoses for venting. So I will only look at\/use one hose units.I always had trouble with hoses staying connected to the units. The \"unit-to-hose connectors\" other manufactures proved were a COMPLETE joke with no actual \"locking\" ability.. it was like resting a tissue on an outdoor picnic table and not expecting it to blow off. The hose would fall off then the unit would simply be blow hot air into the room rather than venting it out - actually heating the room as opposed to cooling it. I previously had to wrap the vent hose with a considerable amount of duct tape in order to keep it actually attached to the unit.The hose connection on the back of the B&D unit is SO MUCH BETTER and fool-proof. It essentially locks in place and stays put. No more worries about the host falling off. I like this feature a great deal, even though it's such a minor thing.My ONLY real complaint is the remote control. Not in its functionality, but in its design. The LCD screen REALLY needs some sort of illumination. Forget about reading the remote screen in a dimly lit room. I really dislike how dark the screen on the remote control is. But, it's not like I need to read the remote screen repeatedly or even frequently. I can live with it. But if they wanted to improve anything, it would be the illumination of the remote screen.I can't yet speak about longevity of the unit. I tend to use a portable AC every day, 14-16hrs, from about April through to about October.. and I got this B&D unit in Aug of this year. I would expect it to last at least 5 years, if not much longer. My last 14,000BTU unit lasted a decade before it started breaking down. If I factor in the cost over a 10 year lifespan, it's well worth it when considering at a per-year breakdown.I also can't directly speak about electric costs, as I've not had the B&D unit long enough to make an adequate comparison. However, since the B&D unit shuts off for several minutes after cooling, rather than continuously running, I would anticipate energy costs to be much lower than I've previously experienced. But I do consider any energy costs to be a necessary evil to both keep computer equipment at healthy temperatures and to not have to work in a 90\u00b0 office.Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. I was strongly looking at this unit for a few weeks weeks, researching, then it hit some sort of sale at Amazon and I purchased it for much a lower price through Amazon than I could have from ANY other retailer. I did shop around several online retailers for this same model and Amazon had the lowest price by literally hundreds of dollars at the time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"306 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693785600000}
{"reviewTitle":"It cools a small area nicely.","reviewDescription":"Just got this a few hours ago.  We bought this as a temporary solution while waiting a week in hot weather for our central A\/C to be replaced.  Outside temperature was in the 90's.  There was a fair amount of sun shining on our west wall in the afternoons, heating up the bedroom upstairs to more than 90 F.  I set up this unit in the kitchen window downstairs due to compromises on how to mount it to a window and because I was concerned about dealing with condensate water.  I'd read reviews saying people needed to empty the water tank every couple of hours, but I think that was on the dehumidification mode, which we are not using.  So far, I've not seen any water come out of the condensate drain.  I have the tube attached an it goes straight into the kitchen sink.  Maybe tomorrow I'll try it upstairs.  The air coming right out of the vent is at 64\u00b0F as advertised.  That's the lowest temperature setting.  In the kitchen, the air temperature is about 78\u00b0F.  In the living room, which is open to the kitchen, it's about 87\u00b0F.  This is more comfortable than it's been the past couple of days.  We had been going to the local library to escape the heat.  Today has been tolerable at home. We are running the central AC fan, which still works, to help mix the somewhat cooler downstairs air with the hotter air upstairs.  It's about 90\u00b0F up there.  Currently about 6:30 PM and the sun will be down beyond the neighbors soon, so it will get better.Overall, this unit has made it more tolerable for us.  Don't misunderstand.  We never expected it to cool the entire two-story house.  But it has helped the entire house be a little cooler and it has kept the downstairs tolerably cool so we are not suffering so much.  This is a nice little unit.

This unit has made a noticeable difference.  However, the current draw is quite high and kept tripping the circuit breaker, using the same receptacle, where the older unit did not. I tried using a heavy duty 15 AMP extension chord, to another circuit which solved the circuit breaker problem, but I noticed the chord was abnormally warm.  Another symptom of high current draw.  Not wanting to risk a fire, I finally used a 30 AMP extension chord (HD with 110v plug adapters)  and the system has been working eighteen hours a day without issue. Good news it the 30AMP chord will be an upgrade to our portable generator. We'll probably add a separate circuit at a later time (probably 20 AMP), since the current wiring will probably not support a 20 AMP draw.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1722470400000}

I couldnt bring myself to give it a 2 cause it works, but a 3 is just too kind.Lets get the good out of the way.1.  Its better than NOT having an air-conditioner.  We've had some really hot days lately and knowing we can retreat to the bedroom where its cooler (not cold) is a godsend.  Also makes sleeping at night easier.2. Once you've set it up once, its a breeze to take down and put up again (in that same area).  And the rolling wheels make the heavy unit someone easy to push around.3. Go out the back and feel the hot air coming out, its like a hair dryer set to medium.So now after using this for 1 year I have A LOT of design issues with this.1.  You can't set it to just ON, full blast.  It'll cycle periodically on\/off which creates a large clunking noise, and since its in our bedroom wakes us up.2.  Jesus Christ the blue lights on the display illuminate the whole bedroom at night with a bright blue glow.  And yet somehow  if you walk up to the display at night you cant see any of the buttons to change settings.You will end up covering the display with something its just too bright at night3. The water drain is 1-inch from the ground.  So water doesn't drain unless your using a McDonald's tray to catch water.  Raise the unit up you say? well its on wheels and will easily fall and crush you.So to empty the water you periodically will to a 80 pound deadlift and wait for the water to drain.  Brilliant.4.  The lowest temperature setting is 64F ?!?!  Thats like 17C, thats not cold ! that's just below ambient temperature.  I want icicles coming off my unit or its not cold enough especially when advertised as 14000 BTU.5.  I think its added about 150$ \/ month to my electricity bill on heavily used months...thats a lot for slightly cooling down one room only.I know these stand alone units aren't great and have many design flaws and physical limitations.

{"reviewTitle":"Sold a used unit at the new unit price.","reviewDescription":"Knocked down to 3 stars because I paid for a new unit but received one that was clearly used - an entire side of the box was cut off and \"repaired\" with packaging tape, the unit didn't have the shipping tape applied to its loose parts that I saw in unboxing review videos, and there was pet hair in the intake filter.  Due to the condition of the box it shipped in I don't really think I'll be able to return it for a replacement, and it works fine as-is, but I'm pretty disappointed in my purchase as a result of this and will not be giving this seller my business again in the future, nor can I recommend that others buy it from here.I bought this unit to cool off a ~300 square foot bedroom that my central air system doesn't adequately cover in the warmer months, it's perfect for that application.  Installation is very easy, you just need a standard size window that slides open (casement windows won't work with the provided equipment) - you might need a screwdriver and a pair of scissors.  The power chord isn't very long (probably around 3 feet or so) and it explicitly says not to use it with extension cords or power strips in the manual so make sure you've got a properly-wired and grounded power outlet within a few feet of the window you intend to use for the exhaust.  The noise level isn't bad, roughly about the same level as a box fan when it's working hard, lowest setting when it's just blowing the fan.  There is a noticeable increase when the chiller kicks on which might wake you up unless you sleep with earplugs.  I've only had the unit for a day and due to the used condition, I received mine in I'm not really sure how long it's been used for so I can't really speak to whether I think it's going to be something that lasts long-term.

Much louder than the typical AC window unit.My only big criticism is that the window kit for venting the unit seems like it was engineered by someone who has never actually set it up and used it. The vent slats are too wide for a typical window -- I had to saw one side of the slat down to size. And it's very unstable and leaky. I needed to prop it up by the vent hose and tape the seams to seal leaks and prevent it from falling out of the window.What's wrong with the old fashioned accordion-style window kits?

{"reviewTitle":"So far so good - but placement and window kit are key","reviewDescription":"I did read through a LOT about the Pros and Cons of a portable airconditioner. Unfortunately, I had no choice for basement cooling - even though the windows are new vertical sliders, the size of the casements only allow for a 10\" vertical opening, 3\" short of even the smallest window AC unit I could find on the market.First off - if you're NOT one to read the manual, please at least take the time to read the One Page Insert that fell out of the styro tray holding all the loose parts and accessories to this AC. Because it reads to the effect that \"You must WAIT TWENTY FOUR (24) HOURS after this unit has been delivered to you, in order for the refrigerant liquid to settle after transport.\" Otherwise, immediately starting the unit will result in inadequate cooling performance.The window kit and placement are key. You need this unit to be unobstructed all around as the backside is pulling in the hot or warm air in your room, passing it over the coils and blasting cold air out the vents while expelling the heat through the exhaust hose.As expected, the window kit as delivered would need to be cut down. A hacksaw does the job on the plastic insert, but be sure to measure twice before cutting! I couldn't get the holes at the top to align (it comes with a dodgy looking plastic screw to keep it in place at the right length), so I just taped it down. The exhaust hose is very finicky even when you've screwed it into the connectors all the way to the stops (i.e., the last turn on the inside of the connector), and the connector on the back of the unit itself is slightly offset - there are stand-off flanges on the opposite clock sides of the quick disconnect tabs - but the one outboard is bigger than the one inboard - they weren't snapped off, so I'm assuming this is deliberate. As a result I spent a few more minutes trying to figure out why it wasn't a positive right angle attachment. The hose itself is relatively short - get this unit as close as possible to the window. Speaking of hoses, see next paragraph.Be aware that in the Product Page here on Amazon, they recommend a bundle where you can buy a longer hose made by KraftEx.The description reads: Air Conditioner Hose. Portable Exhaust Vent with 5.9\" Diameter, Anti-Clockwise Thread & Length up to 80\". Great for LG, Delonghi and Many More Portable Air Conditionersand the link is: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kraftex-Conditioner-Portable-Exhaust-Diameter\/dp\/B07KQDGFZH\/ref=pd_bxgy_2\/146-3160298-3225369?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07KQDGFZH&pd_rd_r=44d543e6-1ab1-4d1d-811c-7bbc1ecb2cb0&pd_rd_w=m1KFx&pd_rd_wg=MPI1D&pf_rd_p=ce6c479b-ef53-49a6-845b-bbbf35c28dd3&pf_rd_r=N56XTS9VN6RNQV3TR79G&psc=1&refRID=N56XTS9VN6RNQV3TR79GBe aware that recommended bundle hose is the WRONG diameter size. It's too big as a 5.9.\" You need a 5\" I believe. I bought it because I had done some rule-of-thumb measuring before buying this unit and wanted the comfort of having a few more inches of play with a third-party accessory hose. Nope, that one's going back.So far so good - the cooling isn't arctic air, but it does cut down the temperature. I kept a small box fan running between my desk and where the unit is to help along the airflow.

{"reviewTitle":"Great AC, as long as it's not a Friday model!","reviewDescription":"I purchased this new portable Black and Decker air conditioner for my children after their old portable GE one had died after 12 years. Had actually gone through 7 exchanges with the GE model, that we decided when it died, we would try any other brand that hopefully would be out, and B&D was a HUGE welcome change!  When we saw the sale, Was shocked that the 14,000 btu AC was at the 8,000 btu price.It was not just the price that my family decided to give B&D a try. It was the fact our household has many of their products that the quality is so great, many of the tools purchased as far back as the 1980s still work and in perfect condition. Drills, saws, portable ovens, just to name a few. Once went to buy a non B&D radial saw and returned it 20 minutes later after the blade fell out due to the spindle not being welded correctly. That could have caused seriouse injury had not been caught.Anyway, went to use the AC for the first tine today in my children's room, and was shocked to see it was much better than the 18,000 btu AC we have in our bedroom window.The touch panel itself is extremely sensitive. None of that pressing hard like with other ACs where you know the keypad will wear out fast. The keypad is like those esd type light switches, or can even be compared to swipeing an icon on a smart phone. The only annoying part when discovering this was the buffer that stored every keypress that was touched. Imagine trying to set the AC up to the mode you want, but at the same time both children just happen to run their fingers over the keypad as they walked by because heck, thats what kids do. Took a few moments for the buffer to catch up, and was able to set the unit up temporarly until I got the remote unpacked, which was what blew my mind after using the remote to activate Max, which is also called Turbo on different machines. Way the house is made, during heat waves it gets almost as hot as inside a car and whats worse, the ACs that we already own work so hard, they dont cool and just keep the rooms tolerable. 10x10 and 10x20 rooms, and even with air conditioner models made for bigger rooms we hear overworking because the heat is just to much. Amazing, this Black and Decker model proved itself today by not just keeping my kids 10x20 room cool, with the doors left open, the other ACs were able to now keep up. As long as the price stays at $319, Im going to buy 3 more to replace the other window units. Looking at the meter I could barely see a difference, but once I get the electric bill, ill update the review questioner I couldnt answer today.The Pros of the AC are quick cooling, even in the worst of heatwaves.Easy to set up, though wrestling with the exhaust tube to screw on the heads on each end is a pain. No reason B&D not have this done unless it effects price drastically.The power cord is decent length.Remote and instructions easy to read and understand.Ac came with an installation package that has every part to make it easy to install into just about every normal type of window, including those tall windows which cant fit a normal AC in.The plastic adjustable tabs that came with unit were very heavy duty. From another review I read that said it was flimsy, the items included were very durable. Either B&D made changes since that review, or they got a return with wrong parts.Not sure why Amazon shows a seperate exhaust kit to be purchased as a recommendation, as the one included with the AC is definately good enough.Cons:Despite all the good mentioned above, I am forced to have to return this unit. The one shipped me has an issue with the fan inside on the left side. This wasn't due to damage during shipment. This was because someone failed to test the fan before allowing it to be installed into the AC.Ever buy a fan, or window fan and due to warped plastic, the fan hits against its own casing? Thats whats wrong with this AC. The fan is hitting its own caseing. Thats why I called it a Friday model. Had the unit been tested properly during assembly, it would never have left the door, which is very unlike B&D. Normally big items like this get tested before being shipped. Most likely, a tech left after failing the unit, but production manager saw to them what looked like a completed unit and most likely sent it off to be shipped. Seen this happen myself over the years.This is not due to shipping packaging being left inside which is also another issue I seen over the years, where instructions arent read, and items being returned as broken due to shipping foam and plastic being left inside.Sadly, a bad fan was used. Otherwise, this would have been perfect.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"97 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1558742400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Returned it - too loud & inefficient due to single hose design.","reviewDescription":"If you have a drafty house and you don't care about energy efficiently, or phone app control ,this unit could work for you.The room I aimed to heat and cool is exceptionally well-sealed. I applied caulk to all cracks which could allow any amount of air in (or out).I attempted to use this on a room with an extra tall ceiling and about 200sqft, which is smaller than the recommended size.The fan on this unit is incredibly powerful, and when turned on low, it creates so much negative air pressure that it forcefully pulls the seals back on the door and it caused a whistling noise (too loud to talk on the phone). Around the door, I could easily feel the outside air being sucked in.In addition to the disturbing noise of the door seals, when I opened the door, there was so much negative pressure created I had to be cautious to prevent the door from slamming into my face!This example demonstrates why single hose AC units are impractical!! They only work in drafty rooms (without the above problems) and are inefficient due to all the air they extract from the room, leading to outside air and humidity entering through cracks in the building structure.I replaced it with a Hisense dual-hose 10k BTU unit (with heat), and the noise is low (enabling phone conversations), and also the door seal did not whistle (thanks to the dual-hose design - completley eliminating room negative pressure).For the price of this B&D unit, I would have expected it to include WiFi control. I chose Hisense for its 2 individual hoses because I run the hoses to basically 2 dryer vents. If I hadn't needed to use dryer vents for exhausting the heat, I might have chosen the Midea since it offers WiFi and heat and effectively a dual hose design... but they have a single tube (tube-in-a-tube design) that wouldn't easily adapt to my existing 2 dryer vents.The B&D remote is infrared, so you have to aim directly at the unit (surprisingly outdated for 2024; why not control via a phone app?).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711929600000}

Has a remote and a couple functions.3. Basically ready to go out of the box (after the recommended settling period of 6-24hrs to avoid damage after shipping).4. Sturdy telescoping window fin. Easy enough to install with two little screws.Cons:1.  It\u2019s pretty loud as others have mentioned. I expect this from an AC unit so not a big deal to me, but for anyone who wants something quiet\u2026 a portable ac probably isn\u2019t for you.2. The hose doesn\u2019t snap or thread into the couplers provided (eg. You can just pull on the hose and dislodge it from the window or from the unit itself). I didn\u2019t move the unit around  but it came loose and was blowing hot air into the room for hours.3. The air is just cool not icy cold. This is my biggest issue with this machine. I\u2019ve owned many ac units both window and portable and I\u2019ve never had one that lacked seriously cold air. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the air is cool, but it\u2019s not COLD and it\u2019s certainly not cold enough to moderate any temperatures above 80. Perhaps my unit is just faulty but to send back this lug of a unit and package it back up is likely a far bigger hassle than it\u2019s worth.4. Doesn\u2019t switch to fan mode anymore once desired temperature is reached. When I first tested the unit a couple nights in a row, I didn\u2019t really need the ac on, I just wanted to get an idea of how well it worked and if it functioned properly. The first couple nights ( between 60-65 degrees outdoors) I turned on my unit and set it at 70. Even though the outside was pleasant, our bedroom is upstairs so it is always stuffy and an ac is nice to moderate temperature. On these two test occasions, the unit worked as intended. In other words, when it reached 70 degrees, it switched to fan mode and would go back to AC to keep the 70 degree temperature when necessary. (This is a noisy function). Beyond those two nights, however, it now doesn\u2019t switch to fan. (I\u2019ve had this for less than 3 weeks). In the recent few days, I understand it not switching to fan mode however, as it didn\u2019t cool the room at all. As soon as the outside temperatures reached 80, the ac is no longer able to cool the room because the air coming out isn\u2019t cold enough to compete with 80 plus degrees outside. I\u2019m not asking for a 60 degree bedroom but I should be able to achieve at least 75. Totally unacceptable.5. In order to move the cool air around, you will need a fan. When the room is just stuffy, you still need a fan to push the cool air around. Without it, the ac air seems to just disappear.- yes, I selected the correct size unit for my room. Yes, I understand the difference between doe and ashrae.Again, it may be a faulty unit but I\u2019m super disappointed to have wasted a few hundred dollars on something that doesn\u2019t work as designed.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1624838400000}

I did end up having to saw the panels to make them fit, so using this in another room will require another $50 purchase, but c'est la vie.Did want to share some general thoughts about portable air conditioners you might not have considered:- A portable air conditioner is generally significantly more expensive than a window unit, and this unit is more expensive than the lowest end. Roughly $100 more for the category of unit, and another $100 for the brand name.- It is generally louder than a window unit, although this one has a 'night mode' that quiets it a bit.- It is less energy efficient (meaning more expensive for your electricity bill).- It is heavier, so harder to move from one floor to the next, or from your car to the house.- It takes up more floor\/storage space.- It still needs a window to operate (the heat it absorbs has to go somewhere that isn't the same room it was already in).The only real advantage of a portable unit are that you can make it work with more window shapes and sizes. The other small one is that you only need one person to install it, but that's what friends are for. You can theoretically move it from room to room as well, but you might need to buy another set of panels if you cut the original too small.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717718400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Blows cold air but the window panel are cheap.","reviewDescription":"I had a need last year for a portable AC unit because my central air had went out. I live in Texas so heat is a daily thing. I had a friend that let me use one like this. Decided to purchase my own. My friend's was older so it had some issues but it worked.Fast forward.. I purchased this one and used it for the first time today. The air is very cold which is great. Will test the heat function on tomorrow to see if it works well. But the window panel is very cheap and was broken on one side. It was cracked at the end as well. Put in a call to customer service to request a new one. Will let you know how that goes. I used some of the packing tape that came on the unit to tape up the cracks and placed it in the window. Still has a little gap in the window panel but I fear any pressure will crack the plastic piece more. I'm giving this a four star for right now. It may change based on the response from customer service. It hasn't leaked yet but I plan on doing a continuous drip going forward. Didn't do it today.  Well.. It just went off by itself. Don't know why. Will get back to you soon.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1718409600000}

{"reviewTitle":"It's Been a Lifesaver","reviewDescription":"I bought this last summer when my AC conked out and I didn't want to immediately shell out the $5K+ it would take to replace it.  But it's very hot and humid in my area so some relief was necessary.  My brother lives in a house without central AC and uses a combination of window units (which aren't allowed where I live) and a portable unit similar to this one.  I looked at number of different models and read a lot of reviews before settling on this one.  (And I definitely wanted to order from Amazon because of the fast, free delivery right to my door, and also because of price.)I have to say that I was taken somewhat aback when it arrived in such a big, heavy box.  Thank goodness the delivery person got it up the stairs to my door because I had a hard time just dragging it inside.  I then let it sit there for a couple of days* while I got my nerve up to unpack it.  I shouldn't have worried because the container was designed so the unit could be very easily removed.  (But I then had to drag\/roll it into the other room.  Yes, I'm apparently a weakling.)*My delay was probably a good thing because there was a notation on the box that the unit shouldn't be turned on right away if the box had been turned on its side (the same as with fridges).  I had no way to know if it had been turned on its side during shipping, but it was safest to assume it had been.Once in the right location, it was pretty easy to install.  Again, I had been expecting something more complicated, but was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't need any special tools or jury-rigging.  It was literally a matter of minutes to get the vent set up in my window.So, how does it cool?  Pretty well.  It would probably be great in an enclosed room, but I have it set up in a more open area.  It gets the immediate area pretty cool, but, of course, I can feel the temperature rise the further away from it that I walk.  I can't fault the unit for that.  It cools enough and reduces the humidity to make several small adjacent rooms comfortable\/bearable.I left the unit set up in place all all thru the winter--didn't bother to take the vent out of the window--and it was fine even in the cold weather.I've never needed to empty the drip tray, despite the humidity.I don't use the remote since I mostly just set the temp and let it run, so I can't speak to how well it works.  (But, eh, a remote's a remote.)When it's getting a workout, it does sometimes shut off because it ices over (there's a warning light that tells you what's happened).  No action is required, tho; I just have to wait a few minutes and it restarts on its own when it's ready.It is a bit loud--louder than central AC, but about the same as a window unit.  To be honest, I got used to it pretty quickly and don't even notice it anymore.  It certainly doesn't bother me when I sleep or anything.I'm very pleased with this unit.  It's done a great job, got me out of a bind, and saved me a bundle.  It works well enough that I've been in no rush to replace the central AC (although I'll get around to it eventually).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"48 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1528156800000}

(Temps are in Fahrenheit)The unit itself is nicely built easy to use, not overly complicated. the wheels work pretty good doesnt roll around on carpet very well but neither does my chair. my only observations while its running is this: yes its pretty noisy possibly enough to drown out conversations however i play online alot and my headset is fairly sensitive to noise but nobody i play with ever complains about the noise it makes in the background so not an issue there however not all headsets are created equal moving along. i like alot of noise when i sleep. i hate absolute silence it totally drives me insane to the point i cant sleep. so the noise this thing makes while running doesnt bother me at all. that brings me to the noise levels. while just the fan is running its really not overly loud, when the compressor kicks on is when it really gets noisy. just like any a\/c compressor ive ever heard they all make that unique \"buzzing\" sound while running and the hissing when it kicks off. also the extra fan that kicks on to vent the hot air out the rear tube makes a lot of noise too.but im not complaining just stating the obvious points of interest. but after living with this thing for a month i dont really notice anything more than just a fan running now. and it really didnt add much to the electric bill maybe only $20 $30 or so vs the $60 to $100 the house one does. on the other side it blows pretty cold (then again i have the 14k BTU unit) and even with my electronics to fight against it still keeps this room cold. even freezing if you want.the window kit is about the only thing i didn't like and felt it could have been designed WAY BETTER. the window kit comes with a 5\" dryer hose that kind of can support itself or hold a shape. a rectangle with 1.5\" radius-ed edges on either side its about 8.5\" long x 3\" tall and connects to the sliding kit that fits in the window. the sliders are about 2' long each and you get the piece with the vent hole and 2 extensions. any shorter than that 2' and you have to cut it down with a saw or something. the part that connects to the unit is the part im about to complain about. i really do not like the locking action on it. you fit 2 notches in the hose piece onto 2 pegs on the unit's inside and turn to lock it in place. and because of that if you don't set the unit just right the hot air blower tends to just blow the hose completely off or leak air really bad ( which also translates to even more noise and a TON of heat.) i alleviated that issue by pushing the unit against the wall to help hold it in place. which works but that hose can get really hot and the intake on the unit can pull that hot air off the hose and pass over the temp sensor causing it to run all the time.it came with the remote not much to say there, quite a bit of the foam window seal stuff, the window vent kit with 2 extensions and the main one with the hole in it, a connector for the slides and the unit, a really nice 5\" dryer hose that can hold its shape, slide lock screw and a few other things.it may seem as though i complained a lot but i really like this unit and i couldn't be happier with it. i sleep better because i cant hear myself think at night and also cant hear the train roll by my house at 3am ( yes there is train tracks less than 50 ft away from my house). also wake up and can breath because it helps to filter the room out because i live next to a dirt road with dump trucks running back and forth all day throwing up waves of dust at the house. and keeping the room nice and cool while gaming or sleeping.

I live in an old, not-very well-insulated small 2 BR farm house with NO central air in the U.P. of Michigan two hours north of Green Bay, WI.  Summers here, though relatively short, can be hot, humid and miserable \u2013 winters here go without saying (cold as h***).  This ONE unit, with the help of a few strategically placed fans, has done a decent job of keeping the house cool in the summer, cutting down on the humidity inside and keeping my propane furnace from kicking over as often in the winter when heat mode is on.  My thoughts:PROS:\u2022 Since 2020, absolutely NO mechanical issues whatsoever \u2013 cools & heats quickly and efficiently.\u2022 Unit is on castors \u2013 it\u2019s easily moveable and not too heavy if you need to lift it over stairs.\u2022 Not overly loud when running \u2013 it\u2019s no worse than most small window A\/C\u2019s I\u2019ve used in the past (i.e., it doesn\u2019t wake me up at night or startle me when it kicks over).CONS:\u2022 The venting kit isn\u2019t the best \u2013 I had to modify the one that came with it to get a decent seal on the window I use for venting (CRTICIAL if you intend to use the unit in heat mode during winter).\u2022 The vent hose that attaches to the back of the unit can pop off easily if you move it around a lot (duct tape can help here though).\u2022 Isn't the easiest to drain the drip pan depending on where you have the unit set up (think keeping your carpet or hardwood floor dry here - draining is best done in an area that can be easily mopped up).NUTREAL:\u2022 Unit comes with a remote which has a programable timer.  I\u2019ve not used it much since I have mine on a smart plug that I can turn on or off through Alexa (or another smart plug app).\u2022 The thermostat on the unit disagrees with my home thermostat display \u2013 I\u2019ve learned through trial and error what number to set it on to keep my house temperature level throughout.\u2022 The protective plastic film that covers the control panel has started to wear after three years of use, but isn\u2019t unsightly or the end of the world (I could probably remove it, but why?)\u2026Overall, I\u2019ve been very impressed with this unit and just purchased another one (the 14,000 BTU AC w\/ Heat this time) to better manage the climate and cooling\/heating turnaround time in my home.  These units are nice because they are transportable \u2013 truly HVAC multitaskers if you live up north without central air.  Folks down south may not need the heat mode option, but having lived in Florida for a number of years, it\u2019s a nice option to have available for those cooler nights in winter for a few extra bucks.  Just my 2.3 cents here...I give this unit 4.5 stars out of five simply because of the vent kit and the hose attachment on the back \u2013 nothing that a little creative engineering can\u2019t solve though\u2026  Solid device!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"204 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684540800000}

Works GREAT to make a secure fit between the window and panel.Living in Florida, we had previously discussed getting a portable AC to have handy during Hurricane season that would work with our generator.  When the motor went out on our central TRANE system for our home, the part had to be ordered. Dealing with the heat was not an option.  So the opportunity was there.  We ordered the Black+Decker 14,000 BTU. At night we would have the AC in our bedroom and relocate in the morning. Wheels on it make it an easy task to move around the home.  The window kit that came with it worked great for our bedroom window and only required us to use two of the pieces. During the day, I bought a sliding door kit for our large windows in our sunroom. If you need something like this recommend you look for the kits that have the screws in the middle and not the sides. Reason, you can\u2019t get a good seal with the screws on the side, leaves gaps. Some reviews indicated unit leaking, we did NOT experience this. However, we did drained the water out every morning, as it is not difficult to reach the drain plug on the back. So all I can assume is the others did not drain it often enough.  I slide a small baking tray with a lip under unit and drain. Unit is a little on the noisy side, but a small price to be cool and not sweat in your home. NOTE:  When opening the box, do not try to remove\/lift out. The weight listed for the unit is wrong, it weighs about 70 lbs. The AC is packaged so it allows the top and sides to lift off of the bottom tray that the AC is sitting on.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"24 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716249600000}

Unit is under warranty, but the part is back ordered (no ship date given yet), and in order to maintain the remaining 7 yrs. of the 10 yr. warranty term I cannot use a non-Carrier part so am stuck waiting for availability. The outdoor air temperature Wed. and Thursday was 94, 96 on Friday and 97 on Saturday.  Feel like temps those 4 days were 104-108 when factoring in humidity. Kept shades closed, most lights off, no turning on the oven, no big screen TV, no running the washer\/dryer and ran ceiling fan on high, but by Thursday the indoor temp. in the living room was 87 degrees with humidity near 80%.  Truly miserable. Did some reading and ordered this unit.  Got it on Saturday afternoon and set it up immediately.  The unit is intended to cool a space that is 700 sq. ft. so I didn't really expect too much -  I have it in an open floor plan living\/dining\/kitchen area that is approx. 1240 sq. ft., so a full 60% larger, but was hoping for the best.  It has been running constantly since we set it up 2 days ago.  Outside temp. today is 90, feels like 95, but the temp. inside at 6PM (after a full day of sun) is a VERY bearable 79 degrees with humidity at 60%. I normally keep central A\/C set at 76, so this unit is doing an exceptional job. When I came out this morning, temp. was 75!  This unit has absolutely exceeded my expectations and I now know that if the Carrier part takes 2 weeks to come in we can survive comfortably while we wait. I see some reviewers complained about the noise level, but I find it to be not much louder than the dehumidifier that I run in the master bedroom 24\/7, and most certainly the constant hum is preferable to crazy heat inside my house.  I wish that Carrier could deliver the part and I hadn't had to spend $450 on a portable A\/C unit, but absolutely thankful that it was available and thrilled that it is working so well!!

First, like may reviewers said and I didn't listen, the hose pops off way too easily. The slightest movement like barely turning the unit to blow a little in any direction, it pops off at the machine. The window side is pretty secure but the one on the unit is not. Even bumping it a little walking by causes it to pop off. Second complaint, there is no timer function on the unit itself. Supposedly you can set a timer (ie turn off after 2 hours) with the remote but I have yet to figure out how. Finally, I don't really like how where the air comes out is not very adjustable and mostly shoots straight up. You can't really get it to blow towards you. I had reservations about this when ordering because you can see that the louvers sit high on the unit, I just didn't realize how much that would annoy me. My fault for not going with my gut.

{"reviewTitle":"It's quirky but it does the job","reviewDescription":"I've had about 4 other portable air conditioners before this one. They were all made by Haier. This one acts a little different than they all did. Examples , the fan is under the grill and it throws more air to the right side than what comes directly out the front.  This air conditioner shuts off from time to time for about 10 seconds to about 2 minutes then comes back on again.  I don't know why it does this but the book says it will shut off when ice accumulates and turn back on when it melts , so I guess it's that. The compressor noise reminds me of an air raid siren in a WW2 movie but it's not really annoying.  When you shut the air conditioner off  , if the compressor is running it counts down from 20 seconds and then shuts off. This is probably a good thing as it would allow the refrigerant to collect back in the compressor , I suppose.  It doesn't come on immediately when you push the on button either.  None if these things are bad they are just different than the norm. What's really important though is that it does cool the room and it does it well. It's just a bit quirky in how it does it.Bottom line  , the positive reviews are correct  , it does well.

{"reviewTitle":"It's kind of OK, should have bought a true window unit","reviewDescription":"Assembly:It was a bit annoying to get the exhaust hoses screwed into the fittings, and I'm not real thrilled with the oval shaped connector to the window plate - after a few months of sun & summer heat the plastic deformed a bit and it doesn't stay \"clipped\" together. Easy fix with some foil tape, but still noteworthy.Usage:I bought this unit to cool my kitchen & living room of a raised ranch until I can get my central air fixed, as I didn't want a window unit hanging out of the front of my house.I calculated I needed roughly 13.5k BTU to do the job, so this unit should be capable of doing the job. Unfortunately, it isn't. I knew going in that these \"portable\" style units are not as effective or efficient as their window-mounted brethren, but the difference is more pronounced than I thought it would be. I have a 12K BTU window unit (made by a popular, 2 letter brand name that doesn't start with an L, that was slightly cheaper than this unit - I paid $334 for this in May 2018, currently listed for $449, and the one with heat is $409. Go figure - from a certain orange themed home improvement store...) and it quite literally blows this thing away. Here's why:- Air movement: the fan of this unit does move a decent amount of air, but it's a rather narrow stream. It doesn't \"diffuse\" as well as I'd like and the window unit I have seems to move MUCH more air. I may be able to enhance this unit with some clever modification, but I shouldn't have to. It does have an \"air swing\" mode, however, as best I can tell, it is either broken in the unit I received, or does absolutely nothing. In my situation, this is not enough of an issue to warrant trying to find out.- Cooling: The air coming out of the unit is cool, and I'll give it this, cooler than a lot of this style unit I've had experience with (though they were also years older, lower BTU, and of various brands). That said, it's definitely no where near as cold as my window unit, and because of that, it does seem to take this unit quite a long time to make temperature.- Dehumidifier mode: I have not tried this so I have no comment. A drain pump would be a nice feature to see, but if you were considering this unit primarily for that purpose, buy a true dehumidifier instead.- Fan mode: Seems to work decently, even on high the fan isn't overly loud.- Noise: If you're sitting right next to the unit it may be a little annoying, but it isn't terribly loud, even in the open room I have it in.Would I buy it again:Maybe. I wouldn't have bought it to do what I am currently asking it to do? No. But it should handle it's eventual, more permanent job (which is cooling the room under my kitchen \/ living room as I have no way to run ducting down there) without much issue.Features that would change my opinion:- A better programmable mode - at least it does have one, but I'm not impressed by it. Admittedly, I also didn't mess with it very much, just enough to realize I didn't care for it's schedule options. Either give me better control, or you may as well not give any- An \"Eco\" mode - the fan in this will run 24\/7 if it's on, regardless of the current temperature vs. the set temperature. Not necessarily a deal breaker, but if you're more than 15 degrees below the set temp, the fan isn't as necessary- A better grill design - The unit blows air up and down in line with itself just fine, but there is zero control over left or right air direction- Price - As I mentioned above, the unit I purchased (14K BTU, no heat) is currently being sold for $449. I paid $334 in May of 2018. At $334, it's not a terrible deal, but at anything beyond $350 - I wouldn't recommend it. Also I find it interesting that Amazon doesn't seem to carry any of the brands the local big box stores do, but that's a rant for another day","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1533686400000}

It also stops just as suddenly as it starts, which can also jolt you awake. I would honestly probably return it if I could, but I tossed all the packaging, unfortunately. If I can't find a way to deal with it, it might go on craigslist. There is a \"night mode\" that's \/supposed\/ to cycle gently through the cycles, but that doesn't seem to do much more than dim the LED (Which is still crazy bright - I have to put a scarf over it so it doesn't light up the room like Christmas.)

{"reviewTitle":"Single hose model means inefficient cooling. It's OKAY.","reviewDescription":"I let the unit sit for 24 hours before turning it on to let the coolant settle. It is pushing out cold air. But, its still the same temperature inside as it is outside. After researching, I think there are two design flaws in this unit that prevents this unit from cooling our living area.#1. The exhaust from the AC unit is extremely warm. My instant read thermometer read 102 degrees when placed against the exhaust hose. The exhaust hose puts out so much heat, that its warming up the room. I've got the hose as short as I can while maintaining the advised 12 inches distance from the wall, but it looks like I may need to insulate the tubing because its warming up the house.#2. The single vent hose rather than a dual vent hose is a huge problem. After researching the cause of the same temperature inside the house and outside the house despite the massive amount of cold air coming from the unit, I realized that creating an air deficit inside the house by sucking air in from our living area, and pushing warm air outside via the vent hose, is creating a air vacuum that is causing warm air to be pulled in from the warmer areas of the house. This causes the unit to be far less efficient than a window unit. My window unit is far more efficient than this unit and at many less BTU's.EDIT - UPDATE TO MY REVIEW: After my initial 2 start review and deciding to return the unit, I let it run all day to see what it could do if I left it running for many hours. I also turned on my window AC unit in another part of the house. After running for several hours, this AC unit managed to keep at least a 10 degree cooler temperature inside than it was outside with the help of an additional AC unit in the bedroom.I changed my review to 3 stars. It's OKAY. I feel comfortable and cool, although I wish it could get cooler. Overall, the unit is functioning well enough that I decided not to return it. I am disappointed with its performance, but decided to keep it because its working for now and I prefer the portability over the window units. It's got wheels and a pretty easy setup in the window for the vent that I can take up and down as I wish. Hopefully the decision won't come back to haunt me at a later date.Buyers need to be aware that it won't perform as well as a window unit, and the unit is loud and never shuts down because it will never reach the coolest temps you are reaching for. I estimate its 89 outside, and probably 75-79 inside.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1532822400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Powerful but noisy","reviewDescription":"We originally purchased this portable AC for use in a bedroom. While the machine is pretty quiet when the compressor is off and does a good job at cooling the room, when the compressor kicks on it goes from being very quiet to very loud, which is startling when you are trying to sleep. We have had window ACs in our bedroom windows for years and never had a problem but could not stand having this one in our bedroom. None of the other reviews appeared to mention this when we bought this item.Besides this, there are other parts of the design that are not ideal:1) The unit has a bright blue LED button display on top, which lights up the entire bedroom unless you cover it.2) The plastic window sections for the hose that come with the AC are also a little bit of a pain to set up: They main part (the one with the hole) was too short for our window, so we had to cut the extension part, which, even though we were careful, we cut just a tiny little bit too short. It is hard to judge how short to cut it without the plastic fitting properly into the window. The material is quite sturdy, so we probably should have used an electric saw to cut it. Since we only had a little hack saw, we ended up cutting it in a slightly crooked way. Our windows are standard size, so we wonder why the manufacturer would not make the main part bigger in the first place. For now, it works with some foam in the sides of the window but again not ideal. Also, there is nothing to cover the hole in the plastic when the AC is not running. We are in a basement apartment, so animals aren't stopped from going right into the hose or rain might come in when the machine is off. There is a little plastic that could be used to cover that hole that came with the machine but as far as we understand the instructions, it is supposed to be used to screw the main plastic and the extension part together and this prevents it from sliding. We will need to find something else to close that hole when it rains or tape the two plastic parts together so we can use the slider \u2013 somewhat of a strange design.All in all, this is a powerful machine (it even seems to suck in new air from other rooms of the house through closed doors). We now have it in our living room, which is way larger than the amount of space the machine is supposed to cool. Maybe that's why now the machine doesn't seem to get the temperature down to the setting and practically never shuts off (unless you add 1 degree to the temperature setting). It is quite loud though if it's on like this for a while. We are quite happy with the way it's cooling the place but taking everything into account we would not buy this item again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1559001600000}

No timer or setting on for that, no \"full\" signal, it just keeps doing it randomly -- after 3 hours, after a day, after 6 hours, no idea why ( i even checked if it was too hot) and for a $400 unit, these little things shouldn't be happening.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689465600000}

{"reviewTitle":"An Above Average Experience","reviewDescription":"I've had this AC unit for a couple years now at this point and here are my thoughts on it. My living arrangement doesn't have AC in my room so this AC unit saved my butt. It does do its job and keeps my room cool and fresh. The wireless remote is handy and is just the right size for it to be hard to lose but not big enough to be too cumbersome or space-heavy. It's relatively easy to move around and retract, so storing it for winter times isn't much of a hassle.However, I have noticed that when putting the air conditioning setting to slightly cool room temperature (70-72 degrees), the AC doesn't seem to keep it at that level. I have to bring down the temp a few more degrees to get that perfect cool feel. Maybe it's just me and my over reliance on AC cooling! The remote is handy, but it's also very simple. The screen isn't a light up so it's difficult to see the text at night when needing to do a midnight adjustment. Buttons aren't labeled much and without the manual or doing some testing and tweaking, it can be a tad bit difficult trying to figure out what does what.I can't complain much about this AC unit though. It hasn't broken down at all in the two years I've had it. It has kept out the searing 80 to 90 degree weather and kept my room nice and cool and that's all I could really ask for! If you're looking for a decent air conditioner for your room, this isn't a bad try.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658275200000}

I normally sleep with a fan on so the noise doesn\u2019t bother me one bit. The remote works great for me. I haven\u2019t figured out a way to turn the LED lights off on it but it really doesn\u2019t bother me. If you\u2019re a someone who needs it pitch black to sleep you might not like it.

{"reviewTitle":"14,000 BTU???? A BIG headache!!","reviewDescription":"After weeks of research, we finally took the plunge on our first portable air conditioner.  With coronavirus, having it delivered was our safest option.We live in a very small home, about 1200 square feet.  We decided on the portable air conditioner as my husband and I are getting older and truly did not want to have to lift the high BTU window units, if we had a choice.  We were replacing a LG 12,000 BTU window unit.We received the air conditioner somewhere around the 2nd week of June.  It took me a while to get the hose attached to both the window insert and the air conditioner.  Although I loved the well-made panel that fits in the window, the hose attachment did not provide a secure fit and easily came loose.  BUT, with years of using window units, I have found that there has never been an \"ideal\" situation when it comes to any of the extensions.The first time we used the air conditioner, my first impression was that it was taking quite a long time to cool off our tiny space of about 250 square feet.  I kept asking my family, as I REALLY wanted it to work.  It did produce cold air, but I remember looking at the thermometer and wondering why the temperature wasn't going down.So, we didn't need to use it for about a week or so due to nicer weather. When we tried it again I actually took notice to how long I had it on and checked our thermometer often.  What I found was that it only lowered the temperature in the room by 2 degrees in 2 hours.  So, to make sure I wasn't losing my mind, we took one of our 5,000 BTU bedroom window units, placed it in another window in the same room and ran it for the same amount of time.  It reduced the temperature by the same amount in the same period of time.  So very disappointed.  At this point, the air conditioner was barely used and looked brand new.Within the 30 day return window that Amazon offers, we called up Amazon customer service and explained the situation.  Customer service was kind, courteous and agreed that it needed to be returned.  Although difficult to return, we decided it was worth the extra effort and returned the barely used, in brand new pristine condition air conditioner.One of the reasons we all love shopping through Amazon is their return policy.  We know that if an item isn't working as it should, they have our back.  But, a month later,  within days of the item finally being received by Amazon, I received an email stating \"We noticed that you have requested multiple returns in the last few months, and some of the items returned by you were not received in original condition.\"  The only other returns I had made over the past 6 months were 2 bathing suits that stated free return shipping.  They did not fit, I returned them and ended up purchasing and keeping a larger size that fit.  I tried talking to 2 customer service reps, and there was absolutely no info or details as to why I received this email.  The second rep told me that this was a warning, insinuating that I could be banned from Amazon.  I tried emailing the \"account specialist\" who sent this email to me and received a generic response without any details.My only thought is that in the 3 weeks that it was in transit to Amazon, it may have gotten damaged and Amazon took a huge loss with a $400 air conditioner.  The reason I question the shipping carrier is due to the fact that I have had deliveries left on the side of the road, under my mailbox and boxes that literally look as they they were in a boxing match over the past several months.At this point, after 15 years of being a loyal customer, and having been complemented by Amazon customer service in the past, I am frustrated.  And, although this air conditioner seems to be one of the best for the price, I can't recommend it.  Maybe it was just a lemon, but it turned out to be one, big headache and left me with a tasteless, vague email from Amazon.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"213 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1596326400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Scientifically proven to disappoint","reviewDescription":"TL;DR \u2014 Get a dual hose portable AC. You\u2019ll be much more satisfied with its performance.Although this AC does pump cold air, the second I turn it off the room I have it in instantly heats back up. I looked into this issue and found out that the laws of thermodynamics explain why this happens. In short, single hose ACs pull air from the room and pump it outside. That causes an air imbalance which is naturally equalized by pulling in hot air from other places (other rooms in my home, outside, etc.). Thus, the second I turn off this single hose AC, the room immediately heats back up again.I also own a dual hose AC and the room I have that one in stays cool even after I turn it off. This is because the dual hose doesn\u2019t create the air imbalance (the outdoor and indoor streams of air stay separated).After owning this Black+Decker single hose portable AC, I am convinced that they should be outlawed as a consumer protection measure because they are miserably inefficient and so disappointing to the user. Buying a portable AC is a big purchase and most people don\u2019t do it all that often. The high prevalence of singe hose ACs on the market plus the way in which reputable review website tend to gloss over this issue can make one think that there really isn\u2019t that much of a difference in performance in the two design types. Well, based on my experience, the performance between the two types of portable ACs could not be more different: one can cool a room for long periods of time and the other will only blow cold air on you while it is on and destroying your energy bill.I would be so much happier with this AC if I could easily convert it to a dual hose model like what GE offers (I haven\u2019t tried any GE models, just found them online while feeling buyer\u2019s remorse about this Black+Decker AC). I am never buying another single hose portable AC ever again.

It is advertised to cool 700. It was really bad. I live in Florida and not only it didn\u2019t cool past 79 degrees. It didn\u2019t allow us to sleep. The amount of water that unit was pulling was ridiculous. Every 2 hours you needed to empty a FULL bucket of water. I had to make choice between sleeping and emptying buckets of water. I swear I feel traumatized between loosing my sanity to heat and emptying buckets of water from that unit. You don\u2019t have a container in your home that is big enough to sleep through the night living in high humidity.From what I see it isn\u2019t made right:  It has plastic hose that transfers heat.There is only one hose so it pulls moisture from outside.You can\u2019t really point the direction the cool air blows. It just moves 2 directions and just not more than 2 inches. CcI wasn\u2019t going to write anything here. But I thought that I bought that unit relying on other people\u2019s reviews. And I thought it was good based on reviews. And am sitting here weeks later and the memory of those 2 days of no sleep just bothers me so much that I have to tell you not to buy it. It won\u2019t cool and in high humidity you will need a bath tub to sleep through the night. It only blows cool air but somehow it doesn\u2019t cool anything and I have hurricane windows that filter out UV light.

The air conditioner was missing the window kit, but due to a having family and personal emergencies such as getting my mother who suffers from dementia in a nursing home, having an eviction case, and looking for a new apartment I instead used a second air conditioner that was purchased.On May 16, 2022 I opened a case for the missing window kit:0000 new ticket numberCase 0000.

They are pretty easy to set up and for the first few weeks I was really happy with the product despite the fact that it makes way too much noise at night.  I figured I could live with that. But just two weeks into having this AC unit, it just started not working as well.  I would set the temp for 70 at night and my thermometer by my bed would read 73-74 degrees when I would get up in the morning.  Meaning that with this machine 4-5 feet away from me going full blast for 8-9 hours, it still couldn't reach the target temperature.  That's really disappointing. As others have said here, the customer support that Black & Decker offers for their products leaves a lot to be desired. I've gone through their main site and waiting for a long time to talk to someone only to be told that I have to call another number.  You call that number and they don't even try and help you.  They take your information so you can go through the hassle of boxing the old one up, sending it out and exchanging it for a new one. The hoops they make you jump through to spend it back is ridiculous and that doesn't count all the time in the summer months during fire season in California that I will be without a much needed AC unit. All this with your fingers crossed that the new one will work. So my advise for anyone who's thinking about buying this model is don't really.  I thought $400 would ensure that I would have gotten a quality brand & model AC unit, but that hasn't been the case at all.  At this point I would have gladly spent more money in order to buy something that didn't break down in a few weeks and buy from a company that sincerely cares about how their customers are treated and the experience they have with their products.Update: I finally reach someone at Black & Decker and was able to get the malfunctioning AC unit back to them. That was roughly 4 months ago. I know they got the broken AC unit 3 months ago since I kept my UPS tracking number and checked on it. But every time I call, I just get another excuse as to why a new unit hasn't been sent back to me. I have literally called 3 or 4 times to try to follow up and each time I talk to the same person, explain the same story, and get a new excuse as to why I haven't gotten a replacement unit.  And at this point I am just giving up since I don't have the time to keep calling and arguing with people about it. And even if they did send it out, it's about to be October and so how would I reliably test this unit out?So do yourself a favor and stay away from this item, I am not the only one here that has had this experience.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"46 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1660780800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Bad Product. No Biscuit.","reviewDescription":"Bought this item about 15 days ago. Moved into place, let set for 24 hours, then turned it on.  The unit operated just fine to keep the 98\u00b0F ambient temperature down to 85\u00b0F...for about 7 days. It's Texas; it's hot. I get it. But a brand-new unit should not simply kill its compressor for no apparent reason without giving at least SOME warning (compressor getting hot, alarm noises, indicator lights, blown fuse...something). If anything about the environment the unit was in could have caused the compressor problems, the obvious answer would be to put some sort of protective measure in to shut down the compressor and alert the user. This did not happen. Instead, this high-priced unit simply crapped out and kept blowing its fan like nothing happened.  The only indicator that was obvious (because the unit WOULD downcycle the compressor when the room reached 85\u00b0F) was that it stopped producing any condensate water.Never even removed the remote control from its bag since that thing is a pointless exercise in either laziness (when used) or insanity (when misplaced) and the manual controls on the unit made operation simple enough as it was.Black & Decker claimed this unit could cool up to 700 square feet of living space. I put it in a 350 square-foot room that was very well-insulated, gave it a short and direct outlet run for its hot air output to minimize backpressure, and carefully insulated the window adapter so there would be no warm air blowing back into the room. There was even a separate fan blowing to eliminate temperature differences in there and circulate air over the compressor so it WOULDN'T overheat!This was a defective product. Defects happen. It failed early in its life cycle, a so-called \"infant failure\". These are EXACTLY the sort of failures the customer should NEVER see! If proper quality assurance practices were in place, this product would probably never have even been shipped.  It is therefore a BAD PRODUCT. Like a bad dog, it deserves no biscuit.

I understand not everything can be included, but it might have been nice to get a heads up that I would need one. This was my first time using a portable air conditioner, and it was an emergency purchase, so I wasn\u2019t familiar with the ins and outs of using one.And now for the fun part. Per the instructions for intermittent draining, \u201cwater drainage will generally only be required at the end of the season\u201d. There is a caveat that this may not be the case in high humidity. It\u2019s been humid here, so it\u2019s understandable that I would have to drain it more often, say every 4-6 weeks. Actually, it would be understandable if it was once a week. It would even be understandable if it was once a day. What is not understandable or acceptable is that it needs to be drained EVERY 45 MINUTES.So you might suggest continuous draining. Well, I would love to do that, except the drain hose won\u2019t consistently stay attached. And when it does attach, there\u2019s no way for the water to go. I was able to use a small baking sheet to gather the water, but it was after considerable finagling to get the hose in a position for the water to move. But if there is even a slight raise in the hose, you can forget about it draining. Should I possibly get the water to flow for an extended period of time, I still have to drain the air conditioner after two hours.But yeah, I easily assembled it.

{"reviewTitle":"Not as easy of a set up as it claims, but it cools my room well enough","reviewDescription":"I bought this unit because I'm a nightshift RN that sleeps during the day. I initially wanted to get a window unit, but felt that it would allow too much light to come in. I was excited when I found this unit because it looked to block out light super well. But it actually doesn't. Light shines through the plastic panels so I had to duct tape them (not the most ideal situation as it looks awful). Then, light also comes into the hose, essentially making it a nightlight for your room. Got a hose cover so this problem is now fixed. The plastic slide part is also frequently falling out of the window well because the hose weights it down. As far as set up goes, it was not as easy to put together as it claims. The hose does not connect very well into the slide part that goes in the window. I thought I was going to break it when I was trying to get it in there. The hose does not maneuver well at all so when you go to attach the hose to either the unit or the window panel, the opposite end usually disconnects. But the unit does cool my room well enough so I'm pleased with it on that front. It just looks awful. Overall, I wish I had just gone with the window unit.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684886400000}

Didn't notice leaking at first, maybe due to not getting heavy use, but eventually after nearly an all-day AC session the leaking issue was very pronounced.I drained the water pan and yet still water leaking onto the floor was an issue.The unit also began spitting water from where the cold air comes out and water would condensate on the very top of the unit.Once a cool day came I uninstalled the unit and checked it over for damage this is where I noticed damage to the water drain, although it seemed minor. Since I discovered a little damage I decided to check the bottom of the machine as I would often find water pooled by the front left caster. That's when I spotted massive damage to bottom that holds the water.This damage is likely common due to the insufficient shipping packaging on the bottom of the shipping box.It was difficult to return this item even though I only had the item for 2 weeks, Amazon support questioned why I was \"late\" reporting the issue and initially only offered a partial refund. Once I was able to get support on the phone I was able to get the matter resolved and will be getting a full refund.Aside from the damage I enjoyed this unit and I am sad I am unable to replace it (out of stock) so I am buying a different model from Black + Decker but still a portable A\/C.

{"reviewTitle":"Wish I had known","reviewDescription":"For someone considering one of these portable a\/c units I think there is something very important to know about how they work (this presumably applies to all of these not just this B+D model).  Because the compressor is inside the unit (which is inside your room) it has to vent to the outside to vent out the heat generated from the cooling mechanism.  This means that it is taking significant amounts of air and blowing it out through the vent pipe which is presumably installed in a window.  Well keep in mind that all that air that is removed from your room has to be \"made up\".  This generally will occur under or around your door with hot air from outside the room.  You can put draft blockers but if your room is 100% sealed then this unit will theoretically not work because it needs to vent the hot air and that air has to be made up.  So in short-  I'm ditching this for a window unit that has the heat dissipated out the back of the unit which is outside your room.  Wish I had known or thought all this through.This unit will cool a small room but because it is constantly drawing in hot air from outside the room it is always playing catch up and is a very inefficient means for cooling a room.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689724800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Fairly effective, but a little unreliable","reviewDescription":"I got this unit toward the end of last summer (2017) in the PacNW.  The last 4 summers have been brutally hot for the area, both in number of truly hot days and max temps we reach.  There is no built in A\/C in any but the newest apartments, as historically we don't need it up here - you can get through the week or two max of 90+ temps in one summer.  I already had a smaller unit for my bedroom, but unfortunately after seeing we were about to go through a week of well over 100 temps, I got this larger unit for my living room\/kitchen open area.  It did quite well.  Cut to 2018, a summer where by August we've already had nearly 30 days of 90+ temps with plenty more on the horizon, and I'm getting the \"LT\" error quite a bit.  The machine stops cooling for 5ish minutes (sounds like it goes into fan mode) and then kicks on again.  I do see that the error indicates it needs to defrost itself, but I'm not sure why as the room is plenty warm and I didn't have this issue last summer while running it pretty much non-stop.  I did proper maintenance at the end of the summer and it was stored inside my home, no transport or anything that could have damaged it.  I'm just concerned this means it won't have good longevity, even though it's not being used constantly like it would in some areas of the country.  The area it's being used in is basically \"the rest of the house\" aside from the bedroom - the living room\/kitchen\/hallway are all open to one another.  It is likely to exceed the square footage that it is recommended for, but I think it does a fine job keeping things reasonably cool in the 90+ temps.  It's just this issue with the error message that is causing me concern about its functionality.EDIT: I realized one important thing about the unit and the remote control.  If you turn the unit on with the remote, and then turn it off on the console (ie not with the remote) it confuses the machine.  You really need to turn it both on and off at the same location - either the console or the remote.  It needs to go \"full circle\" with the same source.  I believe I had turned it off with the remote last summer and then not having batteries, turned it on this summer via the main console on the unit itself.  For a couple of days after I turned it off and then on again with the remote, it *seemed* like it was doing much better...not \"LT\" errors and it sounded like it was running smoother.  However after those couple of days, we are back to the rough sound (not the \"gurgling\" that is normal, but a \"whooshing\" air gust sound) and the LT errors.  I am not sure what is going on.  It still has 90% efficacy but going off so frequently with the error does impact its ability to keep the room cool over the course of the day.  Still a powerful unit and <knock on wood> doing a decent job.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1534118400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good Portable A\/C for First Timers","reviewDescription":"I've been an Window Air Conditioner user for the last 10 years or so. This year I decided to move away from hanging the A\/C outside my bedroom window and move towards the Portable A\/C. This has been tagged as one of the best Portable A\/Cs you can get this year, so I went for it.Nothing out of the ordinary after getting it started up. There's a few things to note on my experience so far. First, I noticed that the description here on Amazon shows that according to my room which is about 350-60 square ft. requires the the 14,000 BTU model. When doing research on a few websites, an 8,000 BTU is more than plenty to cool the room down in the square footage I have. I feel that it's just a marketing ploy for them to make you buy the higher BTU count. So definitely measure your room if you can and purchase the appropriate model.The second thing was the packaging. The plastic pin (that should have been metal based on the manual) was taped with masking tape on the window adapter. I am not sure why they didn't put that in a packaging. That could have easily been lost. The adhesive tape for the foam was not long enough for my window. I didn't see it mentioned in the description on Amazon, but I had to make do with what I have. The unit comes with two adhesive tapes which I felt wasn't enough for the base and upper part of my double hung window (little over 3 feet wide).I've seen some people comment that this Portable A\/C is quiet. It's not. The unit is just as loud as any other Window Air Conditioner that I had in the past. It's not exactly a problem as I'm used to the sound, but it could cause an annoyance for some if they're looking for something relatively quiet. I took a video of it which you can see\/hear, but the audio has compressed the noise a bit, so it's hard to fully determine the level of loudness from that.Lastly, the remote control. It's small for my big hands, which I don't mind at all actually. The only gripe that I have with it is getting used to the timer settings. You'll have to press it twice (I think) during the process to set the settings of the timer. This is for when setting the timer to turn off the unit. You can also program the remote to turn on the unit in advance, which is a neat feature.All in all, it's a good portable A\/C for first time users of this air conditioning method. The price I paid wasn't exactly cheap, so definitely do some research before you dive in. I also recommend getting a warranty as you just never know what can happen. Be aware that by purchasing the warranty, the initial limited warranty by the Manufacturer doesn't get tacked onto the years you buy. The 3rd party warranty ASURION overwrites the limited 1 year warranty. In the first year, they will make claims on your behalf and then the remaining 2 or 3 years (depending on what you choose) will be handled directly through them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"105 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1590278400000}

I was quite happy with it at the price point and btu output.  Because of this, when my parents wanted new air conditioners, I ordered 3 more for them just last month, in May of 2024.  The price had increased a bit as expected but, I still bought the same model.  All three I previously ordered are great so far.  I then took my personal air conditioner, that I purchased 2 years ago, out of storage to use, only to discover it no longer pumps out cold air, likely because of a slow leak in the refigerant.  After much research, I determined that this seems to be an issue with every manufacturer having the occasional faulty model that stop working after some time.  So, I purchased the same model again (5th unit I have bought.)  Well this new one is a slightly different model and has a different style window kit that no longer fits correctly.  I have included pictures of the old model kit and the new model kit to show why, which is pretty self explanatory.  I even tried using the old kit with the new air conditioner but, the new hose is bigger than the old one so, it does not fit.  I contacted Amazon customer service and their only option for me is to return it.  To return the unit is far too much effort and a waist in shipping services.  I asked for a free window kit replacement or a partial refund\/discount to cover the cost if a new window kit but apparently that is not an option despite the seller being the actual Black and Decker store (the manufacturer of the air conditioner.)

I recommend also purchasing vent duct tape to wrap up the hose because both ends leak high speed hot air, directly back into your living space. Lovely..Further, it seems to work best if you just cycle thru to A\/C mode with FAN solely on LOW speed, then never try to adjust the settings ever again--besides turning it on and off. Now don't get me started about their customer service; nobody answers the phone number or gets back to your voicemails, so you better go straight to the WARRANTY CLAIM form online to get any sort of reasonable help. Funny enough, every number you call tends to lead you to various different companies unrelated to Black & Decker, then the people at that number send you to some other 3rd party company that doesn't really care about the GARBAGE products that Black and Decker sells. Black and Decker also owns Stanley tools. NEVER touch their products, they produce Chinese GARBAGE that is best sent to the local landfill. And I guarantee it will end up in the local landfill within a year or two.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723075200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Strictly MANUAL functionality","reviewDescription":"The good:1. Unit arrived 1 day earlier than expected. I left it sitting upright overnight to allow the coolant to settle.2. Unboxing & setting it up was a snap, although I had to elevate it 3 ft on a stable platform so the exhaust hose could reach the usually high sliding window situated 5 ft from the floor. Then I glued 4 strips of molding around wheel base to keep it from sliding off (if the casters were removable, this would not have been necessary.)3. Turned it on from the front panel and confirmed it was coolingThe really bad:1. Unit keeps running even after the average room temperature, as sampled from multiple spots using an infrared temperature gun, reached the target setting of 77 degrees F. It doesn't automatically shut off like my other portable A\/C unit  (Tosot) does.2. Neither TIMED START nor TIMED STOP worked after carefully following the instructions ... either from front panel or from the remote. Pressing all the buttons in the sequence as instructed produces beeps as explained but the final \"confirmation\" step LED  shows that the timed mode had NOT been set ... and indeed it fails to come on or off after the time I \"thought\" I had set. Since it won't shut off with temperature, and it won't shut off (or on) with timers, this thing has very limited utility. Strictly manual operations.3. Operation using the REMOTE produces different display results compared to the front panel, at least while trying to setup TIMED events. For example, the display starts out at 0.5 hrs when TIMER is pressed from the panel, but 6 when pressed on the remote. The UP\/DOWN arrows increase or decrease the time on the panel but do nothing on the remote (fresh batteries, standing a foot away in front)I'm giving it 2 stars because, at least for now, it appears to be cooling.  But if I hadn't gone to the trouble of setting it up, and if I hadn't already discarded the box, I'd send this turkey back and replace it with another Tosot.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1715904000000}

It's nice in front of unit but when you step away it's hot. I have tube running to external tub that has to be emptied every couple of hours. This is not even on the dehumidifier setting. I can't leave unit running while away because of this ( bucket has filled up and over flowed. I've had it happen twice already). I have to have a stand fan placed right in front of unit blowing the air to other parts of room. The exhaust tube gets super hot and jist adds to the warmth in room. I currently have a towel wrapped around exhaust tube to cut down on warmth. My window ac was cumbersome to carry, a little laouder and ugly in the window,  but I will be going back to that next year (I might just dig it out this year to finish off summer).

One I could not confirm because I bought this for my elderly parents. Making a constant loud noise after 30min or an hour of A\/C operation. The second is the FT (full Tank) would come on. Since this is for my elderly parents, I didn't want them to have to deal with the reservoir, so this unit was installed on a level platform with a condensate pump below. ran Great the first month, but when the noise started FT started. to eliminate the FT I had to lean the unit backwards 10 degrees. Called customer service, took three times to explain how the unit is set up and then they finally issue a return label. Now I wait for the \"New unit\" or refurbish to get here so my folks can have heat. I will try to remember to update post.Controller, hard for my parents to understand due to it is pictures. the designers used a \"SUN\" for representation of heat instead of a \"FLAME\". Installation instruction is pictures, little words.UPDATE: After calling the warranty department 9 weeks later they issue a new unit to be sent. I received the new unit in two weeks. The new unit has been updated from the old. some features I like, others where okay.The Old unit had air filters for the condenser which I liked; my parents' house is very dusty. The bad is you have to disassemble the case a little to remove that filter. I only did this twice before sending the unit back due to the issues stated. the new unit did away with that filter. so now I am less impress, wish they made removeable filters for that. The new unit as screw caps with lines to the plugs for the condensate. However, directions are confusing on which one to use so. I am used to them both are tied together, and it doesn't say that. the new has a Velcro cord holder, NICE! the pieces for the exhaust air are stronger and the tube is better sealed. Sorry for the ones that want to lengthen it. Lastly, the FT code has been replaced with E4 and E2 for both revisors if needed to be drain. This unit was designed to not needing to be drain, it has a little misting pump in the exhaust, but excess humidity will overwhelm the pump.Cannot wait to get this set up and I will be reinforcing the window-vent holder when I install it.%#@%^&Well, went to set up unit. had it all install, went to turn on the heat.......

The replacement was of a different model altogether, was refurbished, arrived damaged and didn't produce any cold air. So I called their warrenty again and they offered to send me another unit, but this time it took like 2 months to get it. It was the same model as the original unit and had the same issues as the original model, so I think my issues are by design.

It came damaged with stains and chipped away paint on the exterior of the unit, which causes me worry for the interior.2. It's not even cool. If the temperature outside is more than 80 degrees, I still feel hot even when I'm only about seven feet away from it.3. The advertising is misleading. It's listed as 14,000 BTU, but if you read the full description of the product, you'll see that the Department of Energy listed it as 7500 BTU in 2017.4. It randomly won't turn on for no discernible reason, which makes me think it's going to die early. Unplugging it and plugging it back in does the trick sometimes, but not always. Other times it turns on with no issue.5. It's very noisy - you can always hear it going. You will want to turn the volume up on your TV considerably higher than you usually do.6. It's not very portable. There's only one window slider, so moving it from one room to the next is a pain. It's also very heavy, so if you're trying to move it up and down the stairs you will struggle with it. At 83 pounds, this is one of the heavier portable air conditioners you can get. And this is probably the biggest problem overall, because returning it is a pain. If you decide to get this unit anyway, at least keep the box so you have something to return it in, because finding a big enough box to fit it in will be difficult.It looks like a beefy machine with a lot of different options on it, but I can assure you that your money is better spent on something that will actually keep you cool. $400 is way too much for something that fails at its very function, and has other issues on top of that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"94 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1530835200000}

I checked the power cord, which was almost too hot to touch and melted where it plugging into the wall.  I contacted B&D and they punted me over to a third party manufacturer, which I've been unable to establish communication with.  I'm trying to get a refund, but not hold out hope.  BUYER BEWAREFor starters, the title and description of this product were changed right after I bought it.  I should have done more research to avoid getting RIPPED OFF but I was hot, dang it!When I bought it, it was simply listed as a 14,000 BTU unit.  I opened the box to find that it was a 14,000 ASHRAE unit but only a 7,700 DOE unit.  HUGE difference.  I should have returned it right then and there, but the thought of repackaging and shipping an 80lb machine, and doing so in this heat persuaded me to keep it.  Plus, I felt like a turd for not realizing I was spending $150 more than I would for a comparable unit.I bought this to replace a 7,500 HISENSE unit I already owned.  Compared to the HISENSE, this machine is loud, heavy, and lacks features.  The window end of the exhaust vent is poorly designed and disconnects with the slightest jostle or bump.  If you try to move it or your kid or pet bumps into it, it will spew hot air into the room.  And again, I paid $150 less for the other unit.Does it cool a medium sized room?  Sure.  But don't plan on watching tv or having a conversation in that room, and prepare for some frustration when it comes to installing this machine and keeping it installed.Overall recommendation:  KEEP SHOPPING.  Probably avoid Black & Decker products and the Black & Decker Amazon store too.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1630108800000}

This is incredibly disappointing, considering the investment I made, both in terms of money and expectations for a product that should last several seasons.I'm left wondering how many others have shared this frustrating experience.

I followed all the instructions to keep the filters (there are three) clean and the water pan empty. I made sure it had appropriate amount of clearance between it and the wall. However, after little more than a month of use, it began to have problems. First the compressor stopped and it started to beep repetitively and showed 90 on the display. I shut it off. Let it sit. Then cleaned all of the filters (again) and emptied the water pan. It worked overnight but stopped again in the morning with the same beeping. I called the hotline and they told me that it just overheated. I let it sit again. Started it back up as they told me to. Had it set on a warmer setting 80 instead of 78. About 1.5 hours later, it had stuttering noses from the compressor and turned off again. I again called the same repair line guy who said that it\u2019s the compressor and it has to be replaced. It would take 48 hours for them to call me back to arrange replacement. And then it would take a week for it to be shipped. So potentially up to two weeks to get a new unit. That might not work, like this one.I previously had a LG unit that never gave me any problems. I used it too cool a same sized room as this. Used it off of a generator during Irma too. It got bumped around transporting it to and from different homes during that time. Never had an issue.

{"reviewTitle":"It's leaking a sweet smell almost like laundry detergent on AC MODE","reviewDescription":"Update July 2023 after 2 years of use: unit just started leaking a sweet smell. Seems like it is a refridgerant leak which is unfortunate and toxic, especially if you have such a unit in your bedroom while asleep. Looking to see if B&D will stand behind the product with repairs or a replacement due to the very limited warranty.---------------------JUNE 2021Its been very hot and arid in the mountain west this season and my swamp cooler needs servicing. Got this portable A\/C in the meantime due to the positive ratings and ease of use since my windows are not easy to put a window unit in. This type of unit is inherently flawed due to it's single hose system where it draws warm air into the room you are trying to cool from other parts of the house, this is known as negative air pressure. Essentially it sucks warms air out of the room to vent cool air but the air displaced is replaced with nearby warm air. Physics. It does cool, as long as it's on. The second you turn it off the room will feel warm\/hot again rather than staying cool due to the hot air it brought in replacing the cold air at the same time. With regular window ac it should stay cool at least 30 min to an hour but not these single hose portables. As others have mentioned it's very loud but that means it's working. The compressor and cooling CFCs are doing their thing. I am not sure about the energy efficiency it seems like it draws alot of power though from the wattage listed. There are fins that look motorized but the button on the remote that looks like it's supposed to automate movement doesn't do anything when you press it. Other than that the remote is standard and convenient. You can manually adjust direction fins. The fan mode is pretty useless unless you like warm room temp air blowing on you. The build is pretty solid itself and the casters help to move it around since it's pretty heavy to lift. All in all, it's a good temporary solution to the apocalypse known as summer. In the long run get a window unit or a swamp cooler if your area permits or just go with a dual hose. Still contemplating whether I want to return it due to the flaws but it will be a pain unless the shipping company can come pick it up.

Freon is a toxic substance that can lead to death if you breathe it in or touch it. I called the Black & Decker customer service number on the instruction manual and the support technician who answered the phone had to go onto the Internet to look up the difference between water and Freon, finally telling me that the substance spilled was probably Freon instead of water. You are supposed to call an AC technician immediately to clean up a Freon spill, but Black & Decker does not offer any type of support at all for freon spills or repairing the unit in any way, and they were not able to give me any information about how I could find a Black & Decker service center or any kind of technician to clean up this toxic spill out of my house. I've called three AC techs in my area and none of them work on portable units. I'm having to clean up a Freon spill on my own, which means throwing out my kitchen carpet, which will be hundreds of dollars to replace, all the while hoping that I don't have to go to the hospital for Freon poisoning.

The new one worked as it should and continues, making it longer than the previous one, so there's that plus. Downside is though, it doesn't really cool the space like it says. I moved it from the larger living room, where it would make it comfortable, but not cold (set at 74\u00b0, never reached it), to the bedroom, which is about a 10 x 8 room. I set it on max for 4 hours before bed and while the room was cooler, it wasn't even 76\u00b0, it also makes such a racket and the lights are super bright. So after covering the light panel and turning the unit onto fan only, I pointed it at the bed and went to \"sleep\". It works for that, but I think I'll just end up selling this one on Facebook at a loss.I bought this on June 6th and it arrived in good shape, I waited to hook it up because it had become unseasonably cool out. I finally unboxed it and placed the hose in the window, kicked it on and felt the cold air right away. The room its in is smaller than 350 sq ft, roughly 300, but I noticed that it wouldn't cool the whole room, no matter how long it ran for with it set on 72. After the first two days of running the AC, the temperatures outside dropped into the 60s again, so I shut off the AC feature and turned on the regular fan.After the second week of low temps, it went back up and so I kicked it back over to AC mode on 70. I hear the compressor kick on, but the air coming out is not cold, its not even cool. It feels as though it doesn't actually function. I then tried to put it into the MAX setting, and still nothing changes. I thought \"hmm, maybe it just needs to run for a while\" So I let it run for roughly 36 hours on 72, and...nothing changed. I've tried unplugging and letting the power drain off in an effort that maybe a stuck electrical switch, but no, that was not the case. I tried cycling through the different modes, even turned the heat on, and nothing.So here I sit, sweaty and pissed off, I can't get it to work, its not hot and humid, I can't get this \"great\" machine from a semi reputable producer and there's nothing I can do but tell you do not buy this unit, don't waste your time, money, effort, or anything with this.

The old central A\/C finally died after many years of service, limping along with repeated maintenance over the final two years.  The landlord relunctantly replaced the central A\/C -- with a used unit that doesn't do the job.  88 degrees F outside, set the central A\/C to 72, the house stays around 77-79. Hot.I bought two of these B+D units to make up the difference. One for the living room, one for the back bedroom.After a month, not only are we comfortably cool, but our power bill has dropped as well. Yes, it has.***********The units arrived in the standard heavy shipping packages that many other reviewers have mentioned.  Fortunately the instructions indicating that the unit needed to be kept in an upright position for 24 hours before being turned on were clearly visible. In spite of what some other reviewers indicate: you can't take it on faith that the shipping company kept the unit carefully upright for you during transit. The unit needs to sit for 24 hours before you try it out.This old house has crank windows.  The included window mounting unit is useless for old crank windows. I went to the local Lowe's in one case, Home Depot in another and bought \"plastic cardboard\" to fill the window. I cut the plastic to size to replace the window screens, then traced out and cut a hole in the plastic to the exact size of the oval connecter that comes with the unit. I replaced the window screen(s) with the plastic, and connected the hose, using weather tape around the plastic and around the oval hose connecter.  For support on the hose connecter I added a stack of old books to help with the weight of the connecter.  We have ledge windows. The books worked perfectly. The entire arrangement is covered by curtains anyway, so it doesn't show. It does the job. And does it well.Then we turned the unit(s) on.  The air is ice cold.  The rooms are as cold as we want them to be.  Plus the units serve to cool other parts of the house as well, not just the rooms they are in.Noise levels are no problem for us -- we use white noise to drown outside noise anyway.  I've always slept with a fan. I liked sitting under window A\/C units when I was a kid in the 1960s. The noise doesn't bother me -- it's a reminder of comfort and relaxation.  I'd compare the noise level to the average motel room A\/C unit.  Which I like also.Outside of a central A\/C unit, show me a unit -- window or portable -- that is truly silent.  I've never seen or heard of one that doesn't make noise.The remote works: does what it is supposed to do. I'd prefer the remote's controller screen be backlit for visibility in the dark. That's my only criticism.We'll see if these units stand the test of time.  So far: excellent.  Five stars. I have no complaints.Frankly I don't understand the negative reviews. Perhaps they didn't take the \"leave the unit standing for 24 hours\" instruction seriously. Perhaps they thought they were buying a magic unit that doesn't require a heat exhaust pipe. Or that someone had invented a portable A\/C unit in this price range that runs in total silence. Here's a hint: there is no such thing. It doesn't exist.In the meantime, this unit is GREAT. It does precisely what it is advertised as doing.  Will it last? I think that it will.  Time will tell.

{"reviewTitle":"I am so thankful","reviewDescription":"We bought the unit back in June 2020. Our other portable, a DeLonghi, was getting to be a little older......AND at that time I had been wondering about the whole Pandemic and what it could mean. I am NOT sorry about buying this when we were NOT in the market for one. We were able to take advantage of the Amazon no cost monthly payments so that made it a LOT EASIER than making the purchase all at once. In the 2 years since buying, the price has risen by about 30%. So there's that, too. The DeLonghi lasted until the very end of the season last year...luckily we'd already bought this and were able to just switch the unit and hook this one up to the already installed hose from the old one. Took about two minutes. This thing has been a blessing! I love the fact that there is NO BUCKET to empty. Honestly that was a feature that I have gotten used to because the old one had it too. So I wouldn't buy an air conditioner if it didn't have that feature.  I love the dehumidifier function, too. It's a function that can be used at a time when you don't really need \"air conditioning\" but having the windows open is not an option either. It actually cools the air really quickly when in that mode, too. Overall, I am glad that we were able to buy this unit. It's not overly loud, sort of white noise took an Energy boost! It's effective in doing its job really well. I have not seen any evidence of this being an energy hog, no more than the one it replaced, possibly even a little less usage costs considering it seems to run quite a bit cooler. The remote is simple-that's another option I wasn't going to be without. One feature that I can say that I originally thought was USELESS but have since changed my mind about it, is the \"Air Swing\". I love it! I don't use it all the time but it's come in handy on those really hot days and I want to spread the cool air out more evenly. Our house is older and not the most insulated house on the block. Sometimes there are \"hot spots\" and the air swing feature will help move the cooler air around. I am impressed with it. No Central air Conditioning in the house means we've got to be creative with what we have on hand as far as fans and air Conditioning. I like the \"Auto Fan\" feature too. So instead of having the fan speed set on High and forgetting it, using the Auto Fan will adjust the speed, like the name implies, automatically. It's a little more efficient I think. All I know is that I am blessed to be able to buy this, money is difficult to come by anymore, and I don't want to have to go without air Conditioning in the heat we've been experiencing the past few weeks......and it's not even officially Summer yet. If you're in the market for a reliable, effective, and efficient air Conditioning unit, you could do a lot worse than this one! I really appreciate mine. I know that for sure.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1655424000000}

The unit does get very noisy so I would recommend wearing headphones if you are working.

{"reviewTitle":"Great Cooling Capability, Little Noisy, No Screen Lighting on Remote","reviewDescription":"When it comes to staying cool during those rough summer months, the Portable AC unit I purchased has really impressed me. It's been a game-changer in keeping my bedroom and a significant portion of my 800 sqft apartment comfortably cool. Here's what you need to know:Benefits -Powerful Cooling: Despite not having the unit in the best spot in my fairly narrow apartment, it does a fantastic job of quickly cooling the space. If I had it more centrally located, I'm sure it would work even better.Cons:Noise Level: Okay, here's the deal. When the AC is cranked up to the highest fan setting, it can get pretty loud. I'm cool with a bit of white noise while I sleep, but that setting might be pushing it. I usually keep it on low or medium during bedtime.Remote Control: Now, this is something I found a bit surprising. Considering the price tag, the remote control doesn't have a simple backlight for nighttime operation. So, unless you want to flip on the lights, adjusting anything beyond the temperature or power becomes a guessing game.Vibration: Living on the second floor, I noticed the unit tends to vibrate quite a bit when placed directly on the carpet. It's not a deal breaker, though. I grabbed a vibration dampening pad to lessen the impact on my downstairs neighbors.Installation Insights:Alright, let's talk about the installation process. My sliding window posed a challenge. Since it's an older building, the window seal wasn't great, so I did some improvising. Following the instructions, I used the sticky insulating foam on both sides of the window insert and secured it with tape. It created a decent seal, but getting the window insert to fit perfectly was a bit tricky. To fix that, I had to add some extra material at the top and bottom to make it snug. And hey, don't forget, both the connection from the hose to the AC unit and the hose to the exhaust outlet leaked quite a bit of heat. So, I sealed those off with some trusty tape to boost efficiency.Oh, and one more thing I didn't consider\u2014my blinds. The exhaust vent made my blinds sit at a diagonal at the bottom, which messed with the curtain situation. It's a bit challenging to make it work around the hose while keeping the light out. The hose can get pretty hot too, reaching temperatures of up to 110 degrees, so watch out for that.To wrap it up, this Portable AC unit delivers efficient cooling performance. Sure, the installation had its quirks, but with a little improvisation and some tape magic, I got it sorted out.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"98 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686182400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Negative five stars","reviewDescription":"I purchased the 12,000 BTU unit for a space that was 192 square feet. For the first three days, cold air was blowing, yet the room temperature never dropped. (To be fair, I had this unit in a new 12x16 shed in Texas). I followed all instructions, set the panel in the window, the unit \u201cseemed\u201d to work great! But it didn\u2019t make a dent in changing the air temperature. (My shed does not have heavy insulation in the walls, only light installation. No cracks in the doors or around the window. Brand new, professionally built Tuff Shed. Radiant barrier on the ceiling.) By Day 3, I went out to check on the a\/c (I was checking the remote timer to ensure the system cut off when scheduled.) I had the unit set to 64 degrees; it was blowing only hot air. Day 3. Also, are the outer seems of the unit supposed to be covered in clear packing tape, or did someone send me a compromised system? Is it normal for the seams to be taped? And I was surprised that AAA batteries did not accompany the remote. For the price I paid, you couldn\u2019t include two AAA batteries? (The $8 digital thermometer I bought came with a courtesy battery\u2026) Again, if this was a unit already returned and then resultantly sold to me, maybe they kept the batteries. (Last two complaints are very minor compared to the unit blowing only hot air. But if I\u2019m giving a review, might as well mention all of it.) I was so excited for this system, the reviews were great, it had all the features, I even went higher in BTUs so that I wouldn\u2019t have to worry if it was enough. So very disappointed. (Granted, maybe there is not a unit that exists that would survive in a shed in Texas in August\u2026 Maybe I need to better insulate the shed? But the reviews included folks in Texas and Florida that purchased this same unit for their sheds with success.) Disappointed. Negative five stars is my official rating.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1660176000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Don't accept beat up boxes","reviewDescription":"As an Amazon Employee I always find it concerning when I order something from my employer and manage to get the most messed up box their warehouse employees can find. I've been working for this company for almost five years now, and I know that if the box is damaged, they'll still ship the product if the contents of said box are fine, and that's fine by me as long as the item in question works. Unfortunately this item didn't work. The theme of my experience with this product was: \"Well... As long as it works I guess it's fine.\" Not only because that is what I said when I got the box, but because every step of the way I had a reason to say that. Battered box aside, I opened the box, which was taped every which way. That was fine, as long as it worked. I looked at the window frames, which were partially damaged. That was fine, as long as the main unit worked. I should have probably started re-packing it there. I assembled the unit rather quickly, this isn't my first 14,000 BTU Portable AC, I had bought one from target last month to combat the heat in my bedroom (this particulat unit was supposed to cool up my living room).When I turned it on it shot cool fresh air like I'd only felt when I lived in my grandparents house, NAY, that was the kind of refreshing coolness that one feels when they step into a department store. I sat on the couch with quite the grunt to celebrate the beginning of this new level of comfort and just said: \" I'm glad it worked.\"10 minutes later the unit turned off and would not shoot off cool-air upon re:start. I figured maybe the damn deliverers or warehouse peeps did not store it upwards. So I gave it one more benefit of the doubt and left it on its 4 legs for one whole day, undisturbed.Next day I tried to turn it on again, same result.Next day after that I tried it one more time, it shut off after shooting cool air off for 15 mins, making a weird noise, and then shutting off the power in my whole home. Nope'd pretty fast and boxed it all up. Had to tape up everything inside the box because everything was in pieces (mostly the styrofoam). I'll pay the extra hundred dollars and pick it up from target or best buy so I don't get some crappy refurbished item left in my doorstep again.I wouldn't think there is a problem with the power in my home since I have a similar unit, and the other one uses a little more power. I never had both on at the same time, so there has to be something wrong with that unit. That was unfortunate, the wave of cool air cooled my living room up in just a few minutes.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1566000000000}

It does have casters and it does roll but has to be lifted up by its side handles to be placed on a rug. It is very bulky, very heavy and very unwieldy.The idea of taking it upstairs is not a happy one.This has a 3-part plastic window slider that fits into a window. The exhaust hose for hot air fits into a hole in that slider. The window slides open from side-to-side so that window slider needs to be extended vertically almost to its maximum (tall window) and then secured by what the instructions call, \"metal locking screw.\"1. It ships with one plastic screw that is held in place by a piece of tape. It is not metal and there is only one. The 3-part slider needs at least 4 if not more to keep it extended securely.2. There is no metal locking screw in the box.3. I used the product support option and filled out the form for B&D.

I have been using a 14,000 BTU LG portable air conditioner for several years in my master bedroom. It\u2019s not quiet by any means but I\u2019ve grown to deal with it as I am a child of air conditioning. I recently started working from a home office and felt like rather than cooling the entire house via central air, I\u2019ll just do the same and throw another portable air conditioner in the home office. Since that room isn\u2019t as big (about 200 sq ft), I figured I\u2019d go with a small portable air conditioner. Less weight, less noise, less output, etc. I spent weeks researching about 20 different options and begrudgingly settled on this unit with the impression that the aforementioned items would be the case.Well, this unit is quite heavy for the lack of output but I can get over that. Once it\u2019s in place, it\u2019s in place. I wouldn\u2019t plan on moving it much. Maybe it should referred to as \u201cnon-window\u201d or \u201csemi-portable.\u201d I digress.It\u2019s deafening noisy even on the lowest setting (as compared to my 14,000 BTU mentioned above). If the fan is the only thing running, it\u2019s a respectable noise level. However, if you turn on the A\/C + fan on low, the compressor kicks on and registers 66 dB at 4ft away (70dB next to it). I don\u2019t look forward to phone conversations when this is on. It\u2019s almost a balancing act of timing it so the room is cool before I have to start making calls. Please note that this dB rating does not take in to account the actual air movement. If it did, the dB jumps to about 95.The remote is overly simplistic and quite large. It feels like it\u2019s made for a toddler. Don\u2019t plan on using it in the dark.Aesthetically speaking, the box was pretty beaten up when it arrived. The extension plate also looks like it\u2019s been sitting on the factory floor for awhile, stains, tape, etc.I would put the window fitting on par with the other I\u2019ve used. Not great, not terrible. The hose is a bit shorter than I feel it should be. Don\u2019t plan on having it be next to a wall or window if you\u2019re not allowed to bend the hose at that short length.A note about the window plate. I find that I needed to double up on the foam to put it on the other side of the window that the screw is not. In other words, one side of the window plate is technically taller than the other side, resulting in a thin gap between the window sash and the small of the wall plates.There only real positive is that it does cool down the 200 sq ft room relatively fast on low (which it had better for that amount of compressor noise).Summary: Perhaps these things would be \u201cto be expected\u201d in the $250 price point but not for $400.

Based on reviews and price I picked this unit. The unit is pleasing to the eye because it is all while and blended in my room very well. Getting it all hooked up was fairly easy and we were up and running in 15 minutes.  Our bedroom is over the garage and the sun also sets on that side of the house. The master bedroom can get up to 85 degrees which is unbearable to try to sleep in. I was disappointed right off the bat in that the temperature setting only went down to 64 degrees, The Everstar went down to 62 but that was my fault for not doing my research. The unit was surprisingly quiet. Much quieter than my original unit. Reviews and the manual stated there isn't a need for emptying the bottom tray because the unit takes care of it for you.  BUT as soon as we started using this in October so it wasn't even that hot or humid we had to drain the bottom tray yet nothing came out the middle of the unit where you are given a tube for that water release. Once spring hit and we started using it again. The unit did not release water in a consistent manner. Sometimes just water came out the tube sometimes just the tray and other times both. There was no ryhmm or reason. Because of this issue my husband built a stand to place the unit on because water came out of the tray so often. Then June and July hit in Ohio when it was both hot and humid and this unit just could not keep up and we would have to drain the HUGE bucket daily. I would set it at 64 and the bedroom would not cool below 70 degrees. Our bedroom is 12*14 with high ceilings. We replaced the unit last week with a Commercial Cool unit that looked was the same style as my original unit. Hardly any water comes out of either hose and the room cools to 65-66 every day. Big disappointment with the money spent on this unit for 9 months. Would not recommend unless you have a tiny space to cool down or don't require cooler temps like we do.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"53 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1501891200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Was perfect.....it does not cool anymore","reviewDescription":"I bought this unit and 2022 and I gotta say I was very impressed with it's cooling for my small bedroom that I needed this for at night. I only use it at night and only May through end of August. It worked great until a few days ago when I woke up to my room being 78 degrees and growing hotter by the minute! It was blowing hot air and NO it is not a combo cool\/heat unit. This is a cooling only unit. Sadly I have now given it a 2 rating for several reasons. It still runs but the compressor does not kick in no matter how low I put the thermostat. I have done all the testing, the thing is clean as I maintain it religiously so that I would not have any problems with it. I did resets, cleaned again, checked to make sure there was no overflow of water and on and on for the last several days. That being said I started making phone calls and was put on hold at one point for 1 hour and finally hung up. Left messages for call backs, only to be then sent to another department and put on hold. This has gone on for 2 days now, with multiple holds on the phones, no phone calls or emails returned. This is not the Black & Decker I remember. Finally I have removed the unit from my bedroom for the time being and will store it back in the closet until I can get some kind of word as to what is going on from Black & Decker. To look at it someone would think it was brand new as that is how I have maintained it. At 71 years old and on a fixed income, high priced items I guess I expect a little better performance from the item and customer service that what I have gotten at this point.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1653091200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not happy, too hot","reviewDescription":"I bought this for my garage, but when our whole house AC broke in the middle of probably the worst heat wave I can remember, I thought I was very lucky to have it. THOUGHT.To set the scene I\u2019ll tell you that last night it was 86degrees  here at almost 3am, my bedroom window faces west and is in direct sunlight from 11:30am until sundown. Basically, it\u2019s gets HOT in this room. So I hooked this portable ac unit up, made sure it was plugged directly into the outlet, and had the appropriate amount of clearance from the wall.****The installation instructions say to put the adhesive insulation foam onto the window sash- DO NOT do this unless you want black sticky goo all over your window. Stick directly to the window vent kit instead, or you\u2019ll be like me and have to pick a bunch of black sticky stuff off your window (my window is white so it looks extra crappy).So I finally get the damn thing hooked up and turn it on, and finally some relief!!! Ahhhh, I lay on my bed and relax and think how nice the cold air felt finally, and that I would be able to get some decent sleep (it was 3AM the time)... and then all of a sudden ... everything in my room completely powered off because the ac unit tripped the breaker. Went around and made sure that There was nothing unnecessary was plugged in into any of the plugs on that same breaker (I left one nightlight plugged in but it was off). Guess what. Power out again in this part of the house.The breaker in question normally handles two bedrooms, one bathroom, and a hallway\u2019s electrical load. If this machine really uses this much electricity or whatever the hell the issue is I\u2019m not sure how anybody would possibly  be able to use it. Maybe in a tiny studio apartment. Or a closet.Also you\u2019re gonna want to get something to insulate the exhaust hose because that thing gets really really hot and it\u2019s gross and you don\u2019t want something that hot and that size to be sitting in a room you\u2019re trying to cool.I will be returning the item if I\u2019m not going to get totally screwed on the cost of shipping.HUGE DISSAPPOINTMENT!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1599350400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Had a home AC emergency, worried for my kitties, did my research, bought this unit, and I've never been happier!","reviewDescription":"We got this when we experienced a nightmare with our home AC unit. Being renters has it's perks, but also it's drawbacks too. Having to wait six days for the AC to be repaired, only to have it blow cold air for barely two days to turn right around and stop blowing cold again, we had to wait seven more days!  Due to the problem apparently being wiring, we're not holding our breath that it'll last. Living is SWFL this can be a problem during the Summer (luckily this time it WASN'T). We weren't so bothered by it, however we have a few cats that we really began to get concerned for, especially since one is a senior cat. So we looked around for a \"portable AC unit\" that wasn't a window unit, since we're renters and those are INSANELY priced to begin with!We found this unit and let me tell you it's a blessing!  We got it to be used for emergencies such as mentioned above, as well as me and my roommate both working the 3rd shift it's miserable trying to sleep in SWFL heat during the day!We actually purchased a used one but in a \"Like New\" condition and the only problem with it was the prongs to the power plug were bent, but I blame the USPS for that because I saw the box lying on it's side in the bed of their truck, never mind all the cautions on the box about NOT lying it on it's side. So after bending the prongs back into place and waiting the 24 hrs to test it, it works like a dream! It's shocking actually at how cold this little machine blows and will be perfect if another emergency occurs! The noise level even at it's highest fan setting is really no louder than a large box fan, makes the perfect white noise. As for the drainage, we've only tested it so I'm not sure about how well it drains yet but I'm sure it works just as great as everything else on this machine. Controls are really easy and set up is too, I only had to fight with connecting the exhaust hose to the piece that attaches to the back of the machine, but a little strength got it right on! Those complaining about the noise, I'm not sure what they were really expecting from a \"portable AC\", but even when the exhaust kicks in it's not too bad. Window units are louder than this little thing.  And the wheels on it make moving it around easy.Only other thing I have to say is about the few \"bad\" reviews about this product's heat function not working; I'm not even sure they paid attention and purchased the correct model... This unit comes in many different models, all of which seem to have a heater function EXCEPT for the BPACT08WT 8,000 BTU. No where on this particular model's page does it say ANYTHING about having a heater option and the instruction manual even states that some models have Heater functions included, but that this one does not have that. If you're looking for one with both AC and Heater functions, please review the entire product, do some research and when in doubt, ask a question. Because it's not fair to rate a product so poorly with a nasty review that does IT'S FUNCTIONS perfectly fine just because you were too impatient to read up fully on the item in question or even ask the seller a quick \"Hey, does this one have a heater too?\"Plus the ones with the heating function tend to SAY Heater in the item's title, and run a little bit more expensive. ;)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1521072000000}

I purchased this Black & Decker 14,000 BTU portable A\/C unit with remote.  I also purchased a Delonghi EX portable A\/C unit for the other half of the house.  The first problem I had with the Black & Decker was with the \"sleep\" option on the remote.  The unit was supposed to raise one degree every hour for two hours then stay that temp for 6 more hours.  My unit simply ran at the current temp for 2 hours then shutoff.  This made for a hot room in the middle of the night.  The second issue was that the unit would have a puddle under it after a few hours.  (I had placed each unit in a 22 inch plastic water heater tray as a precaution and I'm glad I did with this one).  I removed the drain plug, and very little water would come out, even if tilted.  When I would tilt it more than 30 degrees, water would poor out of the vents by the compressor.  I contacted B & D with a warranty claim and they took my info, model #, serial number etc.  They said I would get an email in 3 days on how to exchange it.  After a week, I received an email that said to box up the unit and they would send a UPS return label in 2-3 business days.  After another week, and no label, I called them again.  This time I was told I did not receive a label because they have been waiting for me to send them a copy of the invoice from Amazon, news to me.  The email also said that there is a 10 day service period when receiving products and a new unit could take 3 or more weeks to be processed and shipped.  Considering that I was now about 3 weeks into my 6 week wait, I decided to just return it for a refund.  I used the money to buy another DeLonghi unit.  The B & D unit had some features that I thought were superior, like the sleep mode on the remote had it worked.  It also had a wire screen on the widow exit portion of the hose to prevent birds or other critters from going in.  The exit vent was also oblong shaped instead of circular, this allowed the window mount to be smaller which means your window doesn't have to be open as far.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"43 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658534400000}

No, my orders were exactly the same. The units, as you can see from the pictures, are NOT. The first two pictures are the first unit which, as I said, we love and it is great for what it does. The second one is a nightmare. I didn't realize my son was right that it was smaller until I pulled it fully out of the styrofoam and started setup. Unfortunately, if we want cool air that gets us through the day tomorrow, I had no choice but to set it up. It's smaller, really loud, the fan never shuts off even when all it's doing is pushing out (very very loudly and forcefully) room temp air. The fan runs constantly. I have it set on cooling only and it makes the lights flicker when it kicks into cooling. The other unit most certainly did not do that. No help from Amazon, they just left me on hold. I don't know why we got a different one the second time, but it's AWFUL and Amazon is not doing anything about it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691712000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Faulty Unit - Horrible Customer Service by Amazon and Black & Decker","reviewDescription":"Usually don't have to leave reviews with most products I buy here on Amazon but I purchased 4 in 1 portable air conditioner from black and decker in early September of 2023. Unit was not working properly for the heating portion and I filed claim with black and decker. Initially I wanted to make the claim with Amazon but they stated it was a warranty issue and to work with Black and Decker directly instead as they could not determine if the issue was part of warranty based on description of issue. Upon discussing the issue with the black and decker rep, they noted this was common problem with the unit and they would either repair or send a new version of the model. They picked up the unit on Sept 26, 2023. I emailed the warranty thread and heard nothing back for two weeks on a status. I called on Oct 24th to say where is my replacement and the rep said to just check back within a week if i did not receive an email saying they shipped out the replacement. I said this seems odd cause it's been over a month but they assured me. It's Oct 31st and I received no email or item from the company. I called today on Oct 31st and the representative stated \"oh I'll expedite it and you should get an email confirmation by the end of the week, contact us if you don't hear back\". I said this is unacceptable as this is what I was told last time and nothing happened. I asked to speak with a manager and she insisted there was no one else that could assist me. To not have any sort of confirmation that a unit has been sent out almost 5-6 weeks after it was picked up is extremely unethical business practices. The temperature in Chicago has dropped and I needed the unit for the heat this time of year. I would stay away from this product as it did not work properly from the moment I got it. Shame on Amazon service and black and decker. I have made a claim to the better business bureau as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698710400000}

I'm in Arizona and it's 110 out and I'm trying cool this room off. But it never did.

I put a smart thermometer right on the vent and that proved it, the compressor only turned on like 2 minutes every 40 minutes. My guess is there is a safety switch on the compressor to keep it from over heating and Arizona heat won that battle? It doesn't even cool off at night in the middle of summer. Read the manual, read the online help, tried calling the support line and after 30 minutes of being on hold the person hung up without saying anything, so I sent them a help ticket with details and they said there would be any human response in 24 hours, 36 hours later, nothing.

{"reviewTitle":"Meh","reviewDescription":"I've had this for a few years.  It never managed to get my living room COLD.  It wasn't able to handle the 90\u00b0 heat.  This year, I upgraded to a Midea DUO 14k.  There was a significant difference.  The Midea was able to keep my room comfortable at 100\u00b0.  Here are the issues I had with the Black Decker.(Single) hose and humidity: The efficiency of this unit is only 8k DoE, I believe.  The reason is because it's a single hose unit.  It keeps drawing in air, which inadvertently brings hot(and humid) air from the outside in.  The hose adapter itself is #$%^.  It's rotated to fit into 2 clips on each side, but the top or bottom WILL tilt to allow a lot of exhaust to leak out.  The adapter to duct connection itself is not super tight.  As a result of the humid air, I had to open up the drain, and it dripped multiple buckets of water a day.Drain: the drainage design itself is #$%^.  My unit managed to clog or otherwise fail to drain from the drain hole(with hose attached) and would start to overflow and come out of the unit.  I had to elevate the front side by ~20\u00b0 so that it would manage to drain while not coming out the back.  Obviously, this also left some in the unit at all times.  The drainage problem also caused the interior to rust.Filters: the filters are filmsy and can warp, but the filter keeps its form, and the spaces are too wide.  I feel like it doesn't filter well, and I had to clean the coils this year as well.  The bottom, compressor compartment filters actually can't be accessed without unscrewing the cover.  I just left it unscrewed.Front Blower: Since the first year, my front grille fins were dirty, but they're all the way inside the unit, so it's impossible to clean.  I actually opened up the unit(from the control panel), and it is actually a vent duct with the fins being controlled by a mini motor attached to the back.  The duct and grille themselves are very, very difficult to remove, and you'll probably break some insulation if you tried.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690243200000}

The unit I received flat out did not work.Upon delivery I checked the box as it was a little scuffed but not in bad shape, I let it sit upright for 48 hours before setup. Needed for the coolant to fix itself frequently as in shipping you never really know what position it was in. Anyway, made sure everything was connected snug, no leaks in the line (exhaust ect). Let it try to cool a room for 6 hours. All that it was, was an extremely noisy fan.  First day was Max cold mode. That did nothing.  Read through the manual it was worded so that in \"MAX\" mode if you want to call it that its supposed to cool the room X amount every so many mins.  Truly odd as most AC units just work on cold all the time.  Does that mean its setup to modulate its temp somehow?I tried manual cold setting to the coldest the next day. Same thing, no cooling in the room what so ever *sigh*.  So read through the manual again just for giggles. Only other thing of note for no cooling is if there are \"heat sources in the room\". Now I will assume that this is for heavy sources like say an Oven.  Because if it can't keep up with Monitors and an couple of PC's (while they put out a bit of heat) there is something wrong with design.In the end I think I just had a bad unit and there is a possibility of poor design choice with the whole cooling modulation if that is how it works.

I had to use tape to seal the edges both on the window and on the back of the unit where it connect because it was just blowing the hot air back into the room- the window portion is also not necessarily airtight either and you can hear everything outside loud and clear (when the unit isn\u2019t humming of course). I had to tape around the window as well to stop the airflow because the foam did not help at all.- it\u2019s SO LOUD even on the \u201csleep\u201d setting. It\u2019s not bad once it has been running for a minute because it becomes white noise but WOW when it cuts on again, it\u2019s enough to think a car started in the bedroom.

{"reviewTitle":"Great solution to keep you cool without breaking walls.","reviewDescription":"This product is a great solution for cooling individual rooms and does not require breaking walls.PROS:- Mobile: The unit comes with wheels so moving it around is very easy. It is heavy though so I'd not recommend moving up and down stairs frequently. Unless you are a bodybuilder.  :-)-  It does a very good job at cooling even large rooms.- The remote control is simple and effective. Very intuitive.- Assembly is very easy. The assembly is limited to the hose and window panel attachments. This is done in 5 minutes.- Given the easy moving and assembly of the exhaust hose on windows, you can easily move the unit quickly from one room to another, if so desired.- Filter is reusable and easy to clean\/wash. Follow the manufacturer instructions to keep the unit in top shape and you will not have problems.- No need to break walls or install brackets.- Fits different size and type of windows (vertical or horizontal opening mechanism). Even if your window is larger than the total dimension of the provided sliding window panels, you can easily make extra pieces at home with plastic sheets or wood to ensure the best fitting. I recommend not to get discourage if your window is larger than the window panel dimensions stated on the product description.- Great solution if you do not want or need a central AC unit. Much more economic.- The unit has timer and keep-temperature features.CONS:- The noise level comes from the large amount of air pushed out of the unit (powerful). The unit itself is very silent (no mechanical or electronic noise). I do not recommend sitting too closely to the unit for long periods.- Given the weight of the unit, moving it up-down stairs is not recommended (my opinion).- I do not perceive a difference in the fan speed when I switch from low, med, high fan speeds. I see the light indicator moving from each setting but the noise level and volume of air pushed out seems unaltered.I am happy with my purchase and impressed with the unit. I recommend the product for the convenience, energy economy, easy of use and assembly. I do wish we could regulate the force of the air pushed out to reduce level noise though but this is me being picky.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1595289600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Super effective, but also very loud","reviewDescription":"I want to start by saying this AC unit will cool down a small 15' x 20' x 8' room in just a couple minutes of cutting it on. It moves some super cold air around the room really effectively. Installation was pretty easy other than having to shave off a few inches on the window adapter with a dremel tool (all I had).Now the bad... It's annoyingly loud! This unit senses the room temp and will cut itself to fan, then all the way off if it thinks the room is cold enough. This means as your sleeping the loud unit will get quieter and then silent for about 5-10 mins before it ROARS to life. It kicks on the compressor with the fan and will wake me up fairly often. Also there is a noise when the AC is on that almost sounds like quickly spraying a pressure washer at metal? I think it's the evaporator coil getting rid of condensation (no leaks yet so it must work well) but it's also quite loud and can cut through the loud compressor to make a uniquely annoying sound.The remote control is nice and works anywhere that can see the front of the unit, I wish it had a back-lit screen to see at night but it works so it's fine.If you have a large room that this can sit far enough away to mitigate noise, then this AC could work wonders for you. If your in a small room (especially one you sleep in) you might wanna look for something quieter.

{"reviewTitle":"Keeps me cool in Texas heat!","reviewDescription":"I bought this back in February and stored it until April, unopened. My old portable AC died last summer after two years, but it was a used one.I\u2019ve been relatively happy with this one. I spent many a summer without A\/C for reasons too complicated to explain at the moment, and let me tell you, Texas summers without A\/C is flat out torture so I\u2019m willing to do just about anything to have it.Portable A\/C\u2019s such as these require a fair amount of maintenance on a regular basis, so if you\u2019re a first time buyer, keep that in mind. As long as you take good care of it, it\u2019s worth the money.This model cools well as long as the filters are kept clean. There are three in this model. The two on the lower part are accessible by unscrewing two screws on the exterior, which is a pain but like I said, I\u2019ll put up with what ever to have A\/C.If you\u2019ve never owned a portable air conditioning unit like this, you have to manually drain it, through a small valve. While I\u2019ve never had it shut off because of a full tank, I have drained it at least twice since April and a fair amount of water comes out when I do, which is odd because I live in a very dry area with little to no humidity at all.If you want to keep it running efficiently, make sure the room it is in is sealed off totally so that no warm air can come in. These are not meant to cool down a whole house or a large area, so keeping the area you want to keep cool sealed is key.The remote is handy, but it doesn\u2019t always stay synced with the unit, if that makes sense. But this is easily remedied by turning the ac off with the remote and turning it back on with the remote and setting the temp to where I want it with the remote.Some of the parts are a pain to put back on, for instance,  I struggle with the back plate thingie that holds in the filter on the top. It doesn\u2019t like to go in easy for whatever reason. Also the back exhaust vent is a pain to reattach. It takes me a bit to get it back on so that it doesn\u2019t pop off every time I slightly bump it.I am also not sure what the air swing function is supposed to do. There is no notable difference in the way the air moves when I turn it on. Perhaps it is a defective part or I\u2019m just not understanding what it\u2019s supposed to do exactly.In conclusion, I\u2019m pretty satisfied with it despite some issues, none of which are unmanageable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1563321600000}

Didn't want to run the Central AC unit for the 2,200 sq ft house just for one room at night, so made sense to purchase this unit.Good:+ Cools the room fast!+ Looks great+ Doesn't need to have the water emptied so often. Maybe once or twice during a hot season.+ Easy to install and set up.+ Not as noisy as I thought. The fan is quiet and when the compressor kicks in you turns up the decibels, but doesn't bother me. Sounds like the AC units in the Las Vegas rooms.+Exhaust hose and components seem to do a great job of not letting heat back into the house. Make sure the space between the unit and your window is fairly short.What can be improved:- Bright blue display lights will illuminate your entire room. I have to cover it with a magazine at night to keep it dark.- The weather strips and seals that come with it are cheap and tear easily. Make sure you get them on right the first time. Otherwise, prepare a trip to your local hardware store.- The 3 piece section that is put into your window isn't even and gives for small spaces which allow hot air to enter. Easily solved by using some duct tape to seal it.PS 1. Remember to let it stand for 24 hours before operating.PS 2. This unit pulls 10.8 amps. Make sure that the AC plug you are using doesn't strain your fuse box and cause it to trip. I used it where there were other lights, TVs and a Playstation running and it tripped my fuse box that was rated for 15 amps.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"905 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1502668800000}

If it was in the livingroom I wouldn't care, but it's in my bedroom. It basically moves into a low motor mode shortly before it kicks the cooling back on, and in that moment, it gets quiet and then you hear the sudden clunk as the motor engages turns up the cooling in a way that will wake up light sleepers.Sad that it really does wake me up in the middle of the night, but at least my room is cool.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689292800000}

I'm not sure which is better- to the kit makes more sense but why would B&D recommend an ineffective method?  2) Step 4- \"Close the window against the slider kit\" (easy enough).  Step 5- \"Secure the window slider kit to the window sash.\" But how? nothing in the box or in the instructions suggest how.  3) Step 3- attach the seal on top of the window. Top? Pretty sure they mean bottom.  Disclosure: the B&D is replacing a similar old unit of a different brand. A major fault was that the slider kit and hose fell loose inside and outside the window- the hose kept it from hitting the carpet or the ground. What prevents this unit from doing the same thing? My guess from most tutorials and the lack of instructions on how to \"secure\" it, is the assumption that the weight of the window would just magically secure it. My history is that it won't. Before I start drilling holes and coming up with external braces, I'm wondering if anyone has insights.  I called customer support and the robot said they will call back after two business days.

It is rated for double the BTU of the window unit I previously used to cool that space.  It does not cool the room.  AT ALL.  Part of the reason is that the vent tube is not insulated, so the unit is pulling hot air back in because of heat radiating from the vent tube.  This could possible be mitigated by purchasing additional insulation for the vent tube.  The other reason the portable unit does not work as well as a window unit is that it is too low to the ground.  But one of the main reasons i do not like this product is that when the unit does manage to cool the room to the set temperature, the compressor shuts off, but the fan does NOT.  So you are paying for the fan to run constantly regardless of whether the room needs to be cooled.  What a bloody awful design.  Because this thing is so bulky and heavy, returning it will be a gargantuan pain. I should have just gone with a window unit or looked for a better brand of portable.

The reviews were great and it was on a list of one of the best AC units out there. With the insane NYC heat this summer I decided to splurge a bit and get this unit. When it came time to finally use it I noticed right away how much it did NOT cool down my bedroom. I decided to give it some time figuring it was just warming up. Well the next morning I woke up sweating. It was so hot in my bedroom and the unit seemed to only cool off the immediate area around it. If I were to walk to the other side of the room it felt like I had no AC running at all.After about a month of waking up resenting this unit I had enough and decided to return it. I contacted Amazon and explained to them the situation. The allowed me to return the unit but unfortunately I wasn't provided with a full refund since it was past their 30 day return policy. However, they worked with me and advised I contact the manufacturer since it was a possibility I received a defective unit. Amazon also provided me with an additional credit to make up for the bad experience I had. I e-mailed the manufacturer with a detailed story of what I had gone through trying to use their product. I received a confirmation from their automated system that they received my e-mailed and that they would get back to me soon. A little over a month later and nothing.I never got to try the heating system and the dehumidifier  option was a complete joke and waste of electricity. Overall I lost about $120 but gained the knowledge of never buying a Black and Decker unit ever again. I now have two separate AC units placed in both my living room and bedroom which for a bit more money cools down my whole apartment including my living room which is twice as big as my bedroom!I'll link my current AC unit which is amazing if you're looking for something that actually works!Amana 8,000 BTU 115V... https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B071HX7WCC?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1566086400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Fried cord under warranty--Horrible timing with customer service","reviewDescription":"We bought this unit just over a year ago. It worked well enough, but after 11 months (only used for maybe 4-5 months of those), the cord fried. It was still under warranty, and after submitting a claim, Black and Decker was quick in getting back to me how to send them our ac unit back so they could replace it. But, it took them forever + many emails and phone calls for them to send the tracking slip, which someone just ended up email to me eventually. I got my broken AC unit sent back to them, and I thought the headache was over. Boy was I wrong.They told me, in email, that once they received the return, I needed to give them 2 weeks to process it and send me a replacement. At 2 weeks I called them and asked where my replacement was (I was told I'd get an email with tracking information). They were now saying that they had 3 weeks to process and ship, so they were still fine. Though annoyed, I waited another week and called again. I was told they would \"expedite\" my claim. Well, it has been 6 weeks now since they've had my AC without sending me a replacement. I have called weekly, asked for a refund, and each time I simply get told they are \"expediting\" it. I've also emailed the equity service group to ask for updates, and they haven't responded to me since they received my unit.So, all that has happened since I opened the claim over 11 WEEKS AGO is that they took my AC unit, and I've got nothing in return. It has been absolutely ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend at all.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1695427200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Misrepresented BTU's, broke during heat wave, poor customer service","reviewDescription":"Update June 2021:AC broke during a heat wave and now just short cycles with only the fan on. It also turns out that Black & Decker intentionally misrepresented the BTU's. It was just listed as 14,000 when I bought it. Turns out that B&D was using the ASHRAE number, which is known to be highly inaccurate to portable AC's for years and as a result completely irrelevant. Now it's updated to 7,500 BTU's. Called to get service and they're referring me to a 3rd party, B&D doesn't handle it themselves.This is a poorly designed, poor quality, fraudulently misrepresented item.Cooling ability: I moved into my house last year during a heatwave and due to local backorders had to find an AC unit online. It was nice to be able to purchase this and have it just a few days later. Maybe i'm unrealistic, but from its size and price I expected it to work a little bit better. The loft my bedroom is in took days to get cooled down despite being on the \"max\" setting, and that was after letting the unit \"sit\" for 24 hours which the directions said was required to prevent it from damaging itself (Other online sources say that 24 hours is significantly overkill - B&D should figure out what the actual time is). The air coming out of it just never really felt that cold and even on non-heatwave days I need to make sure to keep it running all day to be able to sleep that night. I used a window unit in college that you could stand in front of and the air felt very crisply cold coming out. This air does not but will eventually cool over time.Sound: It's pretty loud. If it's continuously running it's not a huge deal and blends in like white noise. However if it stops running and kicks on again, it sounds like freight train starting up in the middle of the night and will wake you up repeatedly. It also makes the lights in my room slightly dim when it kicks on making me think that this thing is drawing an awful lot of power.LED Lights: I took off a star for this alone. This is going into people's bedrooms at night. Who was the genius that put BLINDING BRIGHT BLUE lights on the display that can't be dimmed or turned off? I had to put electrical tape over the display to sleep, which also means I can't read the temperature on it.It does the job and made it so I could sleep more comfortably. Maybe the first two complaints just aren't possible for the price point, but it just feels like this could be better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1616025600000}

However, it was missing the remote, so I had to purchase that separately.I bought this unit specifically to cool down my bedroom while I sleep, rather than running the HVAC to cool the entire house. It does the job of cooling the room to the desired temperature as expected.Installation was a bit tricky, as the manual wasn't very helpful, but some online searching helped me figure it out. One thing to note is that moving the unit isn't as easy as I anticipated, as you have to remove the window setup and reinstall it in another window. It's essential to ensure the room where it's installed has a window that OPENS.The noise level is noticeable, and it might take some time to get used to.

{"reviewTitle":"Defective or Wrong Unit?","reviewDescription":"I originally ordered the 8,000 unit for my home office since I work from home in 3D animation, and also game in my free time; my house HVAC cannot keep up with the heat my computer outputs on load. After a few years, the unit stopped cooling as effectively, and I blame that on my lack of maintenance. So, swearing I'd upkeep a new unit properly (cleaning the filter once a month and doing a deep clean twice a year), I ordered the same exact unit.Right away I noticed it was different- the exhaust hose and window install was different, and so was the remote. I figure B+D upgraded the unit with some changes and didn't think much of it. That was yesterday. After running it for several hours, this unit seems uncapable of cooling down the room more than two degrees. I don't have a large home office; it's a cosy 12x10 room, and yes, I did make sure the exhaust hose didn't have any extreme bends, and it is set far away enough from the walls. The air is just slightly cold when I put my hand out to feel it, instead of the freezing you'd expect from a brand new unit.I suspect I was sent a re-furbished 10,000 BTU unit, as the remote seems to match the pictures of that model. Also the bottom of the box was cut out before I even touched it, furthering my refurbished hypothesis. I'm immunocompromised so I can't risk my life lugging a heavy unit to the UPS store to send it back, so I suppose I'm out $300 for faulty aircon. I've questioned my sanity and wondered if the original unit did any cooling at all, but I distinctly recall being impressed how cold my room was after running it for an hour, but the more I think about it, the more I'm sure I was sent a used 10,000 BTU model.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663286400000}

It is never not loud. And I'm not talking about white noise in the background where you might be able to ignore it or, \"maybe when I turn it on it's loud because it has to work hard at first to cool the room off?\" No, it is ALWAYS loud. Perhaps it will be less loud once it reaches the temperature you set it to? Nope. Give that dream right up. Just imagine having a running car in your room -- that's how loud it is. It is so loud that when I watch TV, my usual volume is at 20, but with this thing in my room, the TV has to be at 60 with closed captions if I want to try and follow along. And forget about sleeping with it on. Because why? Because it is SO DISTRACTINGLY LOUD. I don't know how the manufacturer thought the noise level was acceptable.OK, so by now I've hopefully established for you that it's loud. But now let's delve into, does it work? Does it make your room significantly cooler such that you could overlook the horrible volume because you're comfortable in your room? Nope. IF, and this is a big IF, it helps the temperature, it helps by only a degree or two.Oh - here's something good: The remote works so you can turn it off after you've (almost) gone deaf and are frustrated at yourself for having spent hundreds of dollars on this jalopy.I will say I only used this thing only a few times since I bought it and I should have returned it.

But because I'm now 68yo and have back problems, we decided to go with this unit to stop me from carrying the window one up and down the stairs. Well, let me tell you that it usually takes me about 15-20 minutes to put in the window unit. Took over an hour to put this one in mostly because none of the parts really snapped into place.  It did not come with a gravity drain hose as indicated in the Amazon description. When trying to put the outlet piece in the window piece, it kept snapping out. And if you're windows are less that 20.5 \" wide, hope you've got a hacksaw ready.

The height of my window from the floor, where the exhaust spout has to insert into the window-fitting attachment piece, is 4 and a half feet. My unit stands just to the right of the window, on the floor. My exhaust pipe had to stretch 4 feet 3 inches, with a distinct curve at the top and bottom to reach up to the window. It hardly fit, and I expected that the force of fitting it in was going to defeat the strength of the window-fitting attachment piece (to which the plastic peg holding it had broken and the screws included for it didn't fit the holes, so I had to find some little loose fitting screws in the house to temporarily hold it up). Another difficulty was that the exhaust pipe is extremely difficult to screw into both of the fittings for it; at the back of the unit on one end, and into the exhaust spout on the other.

I called Black and Decker to get a new window kit thinking that would be an easier solution. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!! Multiple calls to customer service led to anger and frustration on my part. Not only was it difficult to understand the service reps,  I was given a dead-end phone number to someone's voice mail by four different reps. After a week of leaving messages with no reponse I finally convinced a rep that it was a bogus number. Eventually I was given a phone number to reach a live person in warranty parts who took down the info, gave me a ticket number and promised me a confirmation email in 2 days.  When I had received no confirmation and no parts a week later, I called back. Apparently the ticket number was useless because they found no record of the interaction from a week ago. After wasting two weeks I ultimately returned the unit to Amazon. Black and Decker customer service is a joke!!UPDATE: I reordered the AC.  Obviously didn't think that through!  One week later the new AC arrived in worse condition than the first. The outer box was caved in and torn in several places and all three pieces of the window kit had been smashed. Can't blame that on Black and Decker (?Amazon ?UPS) I called B&D warranty parts and talked to a real person immediately. I requested a replacement window kit (again). The rep told me I would receive the parts in 2-3 weeks but suggested I return the item instead due to heavy damage to the box. Thumbs up to B&D, thumbs down to Amazon\/UPS. Still waiting for the first return to be processed so I'm out $900 and still don't have an AC that works!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1655424000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Showed up 2 weeks late. Hose is worthless.","reviewDescription":"I would love to leave a glowing review for this. I'd love to tell you how cool it is, how big of a difference it's made, the neat settings, etc. Unfortunately I cannot as the hose they included is straight. Garbage. You have to take 5-10 minutes simultaneously jamming the attachments and then trying to thread the hose through inner grooves on them on both sides of the hose, only for it to immediately pop off when you try to get the hose into the equally frustrating ac unit itself or the wall slot. You also either need an extension cord or for the outlet to be pretty much RIGHT under the window, which shouldn't be an issue anyway because the hose is barely even long enough to make it from the unit to the window with the unit as close to it as possible. Keep in mind when you are getting the attachments on btw the hose is made out of paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 or something I swear. It already came with one end bent up but the thing is basically destroyed just following the instructions the manual gave me.Even if this turns out to be amazing, having such a worthless hose that I actually feel obligated to buy a whole separate one just to avoid these issues prevents it from being anything more than a 2 for me. The 2 us assuming that it heats and cools as advertised and as many of the other reviews indicate. Idk when I'll be able to find out- was hoping to almost a month ago when I ordered the damn thing. Now, in 80 degree heat with high humidity I'm staring at the thing that can potentially bring me relief with seething rage because of the incompetence of the people who thought shipping something like this out with a borderline broken hose was A-okay. My one silver lining is that it showed up so late and they thought they may have even lost the package that I got a full refund so I didn't even have to pay for this piece of trash but I'm sorry to everyone who did and had to deal with it. Happy for you if it wasn't a huge problem or if you were able to overcome it and get the thing to work.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657584000000}

The remote control doesn't have the ability to set the fan to auto mode (only slow\/medium\/fast). The unit doesn't have a button to turn off the LEDs (only the remote does). The remote keeps track of what it thinks the settings are on the unit, and anytime you use the remote it resets everything on the unit, so if you want to set the fan to auto mode AND turn off the LEDs, you can't, because the remote changes the fan speed to slow when you try to turn off the LEDs.It does make cold air.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723939200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Extremely poor customer service from company","reviewDescription":"After receiving our 14,000 btu A\/C unit from Black and Decker the unit worked really well for about 30 days. It then began to leak a small amount of water. I drained the unit as instructed. It began to leak again after about 5 days, this time more water was leaked onto our floor. I attempted to drain the unit again and it had a very small amount of water in it.  In order to protect our hardwood floor I bought a drip pan to go under the unit. This made an excellent way to not only protect the floor but also see where the leak was coming from. It was leaking from the intake area NOT the drain plug. When I called Black and Decker to get the warranty process started the person was very helpful and professional. When she started to explain the return process is where the problems began.  I was told that I would get a return label from them in 3-5 business days. At that point I was instructed to box up the unit and return it to their New York office location. After they had received the unit, after approximately 10 days a new unit would be sent to us. This process will leave us without air-conditioning for approximately 15 to 20 days during the hottest part of the year.  I have returned things in the past where the process was \"we will send you a new unit and then you can send us our unit back\". If this is considered to be \"world class customer service\" as they say on their site  then Black and Decker  should consider changing out the Director who came up with this process. This is the worst customer service I have seen in years.Addendum: I  finally got my unit back (new one) the first of December 2022. The only reason this occurred was that I contacted BBB. Approximately 1 week after filing a BBB online complaint I got a call.  Although I asked for a refund, they sent out a new unit but that was much better than previously.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658361600000}

I waited a year on review to let you know I lived it and believe me, it was a Nightmare!!!!You would think that 14KBTU's should be able to handle humidity in a 266sq. ft family room in Louisville, Ky.  But, by end of summer the coils were freezing up. When winter came (2018), the condenser never shifted to produce heat! I've had another brand that did do heat and air really good but was not enough BTU's for the family room and eventually after years went out.  But, this Black & Decker wasn't worth 2 quarters rubbed together... maybe that's why they're selling on Amazon. Currently, in a few weeks will be 1 year old, - it is 85 degs out, no humidity yet (4\/29\/19) and it's blowing, but it's not cool air...  Can't find a repairer near me either...Had one of those wall splitters estimated @ $3K (I'm talking real loud now), but as you can imagine I can buy a couple more portable air units (which I vented through the wall) buy a few more times before reaching $3K (man I can\u2019t win), either way I'm stuck! And for some reason don't know why, noo warranty offered at time, I always buy a warranty from Amazon and nothing - that's on me, must've been rushing... Why me Lord?!!Also, this thing has the worst venting tube that takes a whole roll of duct tape to make it stick to the back of the machine... Never experienced the dog'on vent tube unable to stay attached!!!  Hell after that I started adding more tape and any tape that would stick (electrical, painters tape 2day 4\/29\/19\u2026 pix will show this effort Lol)  And Yes, I cleaned the vents every Friday (which you had to in order to get the cool air you did get), I drained it properly and everything (through the wall to outside), but for the coils to start freezing up and cutting off and waiting for it to unfreeze - it was a sufferable experience (I don't know how I survived, I'm telling you it's suffocating hot in Ky.....)  I really have to get a jump on this to replace before the real heat comes in, bc in Louisville we don't play with the humidity...

{"reviewTitle":"Works like a charm with the exhaust through the dryer vent","reviewDescription":"I've seen lots of other people posting around online asking how this can be done, so this review is also meant to help anyone trying to set a portable A\/C up like this.I knew when I bought this unit that I wouldn't want the exhaust feeding out the window. Not only would it look weird there due to the layout of my apartment, but I didn't want even more noise from the street to make its way into my room while I was sleeping. So, since I'm next to my laundry room, I figured the dryer vent would be the perfect solution to get the A\/C exhaust out of the building.Since my (and most) dryer vents are 4\" and the A\/C exhaust is 5\", I went to Lowe's and bought a 5\"-4\" reducer and mounted that on a wall mountable back-draft damper. When the A\/C isn't being used, it looks natural on the wall and helps to prevent any dryer dust from coming through. From there, the 4\" ducting goes through the drywall into my laundry room and behind the dryer. I attached it to a 4\" wye connecter with one end attached to the dryer vent and the other end to a 4\" 200 CFM duct fan (see below for a link). Not only is this required since portable A\/C units don't push exhaust out with enough power, but clothes dry way faster now too.To turn the duct fan on and off, I used a temperature controller (link below) with a probe inside the wye that is set to turn on when the temperature reaches 90 degrees. When just the A\/C is running, the temperature gets up to 130, and when just the dryer is running it hovers around 100. The only downside of this system is that I can't use the dryer and the A\/C at the same time, but that isn't a big deal to me at all.All in all, I'm really satisfied with the way this is setup. Not only does it look natural, but I can keep using my window on nice days without having to move the A\/C unit.As for this unit itself, I couldn't be happier. I have a feeling a lot of these bad reviews are either units that were damaged during shipping or installed improperly, but I've always liked Black and Decker so I thought I'd give it a shot.Pros:- Cools an entire room in no time. I keep my room at about 70-73 during the day, but I can't sleep unless it's a lot colder, like 65-68. As soon as I'm ready for bed, I turn this puppy on and the room gets down to that temperature easily. I'll honestly never be able to sleep without one again. Plus, the white noise is a really positive side effect of having it on.- Easy to use remote and control panel. There's really nothing to it, just turn it on and set the temperature and it's off to the races.- The fan mode is great for circulating air. I hate stale air, and it keeps everything feeling fresh, even with the A\/C off.- I've tried the heating mode once, and it really works. It sounds like it just flips an internal valve or something, but instead of removing heat from the room and exhausting that heat, it does the exact opposite. So I'd assume the air coming out is around 130 (mentioned above), but it definitely isn't dangerous and doesn't feel hot to the touch.- I've been using this for a few months now and haven't had to drain any moisture once.Cons:- Since I use this when I sleep, I always have to cover the LEDs with a drink coaster and my wallet before I get in bed. Even when the unit is in sleep mode, those LEDs are pretty bright.- Speaking of \"sleep mode,\" I understand the idea behind it, but I like the temperature to stay constant all night so I don't use it (sleep mode will raise the temperature by two degrees over the course of 6 hours, then it'll turn off).- This is just me being picky wishing for pretty crazy features, but I really wish this was \"smart\" enough to be controlled by an Echo\/Google Home. It'd be great to be able to turn it on and off with my nightly and morning routines. \"Alexa, good night\" already turns the lights off, but I'd love to hear this A\/C kick into high gear at the same time.- Duct fan: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B01CTM0H6I\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1- Temperature controller: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B01HXM5UAC\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"168 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1557100800000}
{"reviewTitle":"It works great!","reviewDescription":"I purchased this machine in April (3 months ago) and it's such a lovely addition to my life. I wanted it to cool a room that's about 15x15 in HUMID Florida. I run several computers, lights, and other heat generating objects for podcasting in this room. It's working like a dream and the sound doesn't intrude with my recordings (using a dynamic microphone of course). I read other reviews here that the dehumidifier doesn't work well in Florida. I've actually never tried to use just the dehumidifier option yet (instructions say to attach the hose included and run the water off when running that option). I haven't had a reason too since its so d*mn hot already and the AC dehumidifies. I'll update again in the fall when the temperature drops. Also, the guide says that you'll only need to empty the water at the end of the season. At first, I didn't believe that and kept checking the water level. It still hasn't gotten to the point where I need to empty it. I'll update at the end of the Summer or when the Full Tank indicator lights up. I'm also making a point to clean the filter at the start of each month-easy.  The best advice I can give is to purchase this AC (or any window\/portable AC) during the winter. I've been tracking several of them over the course of 3 years and during the coldest months the price is $200. I sadly missed the price by a week when it increased in early April to $255. Now it's July and the price is apparently around $350. If you're on a budget and need something today, research building a \"swamp cooler\" and hold off until winter and get an amazing deal on a great product. This is probably the best product I've purchased on Amazon. Be careful when you remove it from the box after it arrives.  I did make sure to let it sit upright for 24 hours but when I removed the box I did end up breaking the bottom water drain plug. I was able to reattach using gorilla glue. luckily I knew to do that. I'd suggest to un-box slowly. Cut away the the box piece by piece. I think I was afraid I'd need to keep the packaging intact as much as possible in case I had to ship it back.UPDATE: 3 YEARS, 3 MONTHS LATER (8\/2022): Still working strong. I've never had to empty it but I also never use the dehumidifier. I've never had a reason to empty. I've run it constantly for months on end too, even during Summer months in Florida. It cools a room 15'x15 very well and even beyond down a hallway. Also, as I wrote before, the back knob that you attach the dehumidifier hose broke when I attempted to lift it out of the box and foam.  I replaced it with Gorilla Glue but I've never attempted to use that feature because it worried me that I would break something else if I didn't reattach it correctly. Someone asked me about keeping it from stopping and starting in order to sleep better. That can be disruptive if you're not using another source of white noise to keep you asleep. I can't sleep anywhere unless I run some rainstorm sounds. I have found that turning the temp as low as I can, and turning up the speed to high and turning on the (room) \"max\" button will tend to keep the sound up at least some high hum constant and that helps. I do need to keep a small notebook on top of it to drown out the blue lights, but recently, I've also started using an eye mask to sleep with (you should totally try one if you have trouble sleeping). It's also easy to clean, maybe too easy. I clean the filter about every 3-5 months but I'm sure I should do it monthly. If this machine broke tomorrow (probably because I'm bad at remembering to clean the filter), I'd go back here and try to replace with the exact model. Also, the beeping noise when you adjust it isn't too loud but I wish it wasn't there at all. To avoid each beep, I aim the remote in another direction and change the temperature, speed, then aim it back at the unit and press one more degree (so I only have to hear one of those beeps). Problem solved. At some point, I'll come back and update this again with an update on the difference in my electric bill. I haven't noticed a huge difference yet.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"208 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1562630400000}

While the unit isn't able to cool the whole apartment, it definitely cools the living room and then some with the help of a fan to push the air down the hall. The shipping time was faster than expected gave us the relief we needed quick.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1721692800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Glad I got this unit.","reviewDescription":"Before finally deciding to purchase this AC unit, I was concerned with some of the reviews. I had seen reviews mentioning that the hose from the unit to the window popped off easily, I read that the condensation was so bad that drip pans were filling up everyday. I also heard that it was no effective at cooling down a room. I\u2019m pleased to say that none of this was the case for me.I live in San Antonio, Texas where the heat and mild-moderate humidity make life miserable, especially in a house where my bedroom gets very poor AC ventilation. My 500 sq ft room would often hit 84-87 F during the peak of the day and would float around 78-80 at night (I use a digital thermometer in my room. After the use, my bedroom, it quickly cooled my 86 F bedroom down to a nice 74 (which almost feels cold to me now). At night, my room gets down to the mid 60s. While the 8000 BTU unit doesn\u2019t cool to 64 degrees (which is the coldest setting, which I leave it on when I use it), it\u2019s still a lifesaver for me. Also keep in mind that this part of Texas has been seeing 95-105 F weather daily, and it consistently maintains my room at 30 degrees colder than the outside temperature even with 2 west facing windows that catch the hot afternoon sun. My energy bills did not seen a noticeable increase after the first month (which is the best part for me).The hose has never once popped off, even when i move it around a few inches one way or the other while cleaning. The window kit has worked great and the foam insulation provided also seems to work great.The noise level is a noticeable, but for me, I\u2019ve mentally tuned it out and can still make calls and use zoom without anyone mentioning the noise. It measured at about 53 decibels from the middle of the room. Which, for reference, would be comparable to being outside in light rain. It almost feels like having a relatively quiet white noise machine, or being in a hotel with window units on.As for drainage, or condensation, there is almost none. However, I never use the dehumidifier setting. Every time I pop off the rubber guard for the water outlet, there\u2019s not even a drop of water, even with 50% humidity in my house (measured with the digital thermometer). It could be different for those living in tropical climates like Florida or those who use the dehumidifier setting, but it hasn\u2019t felt necessary for me.Set up took less than 30 minutes, most of which is was spent trying to figure out the window kit installation without using the manual, as well as double checking that I created a good seal with the foam provided.Overall, this AC has been awesome for me, as someone who gets hot and sweaty very easily, I now sometimes get cold in my room during the day. I\u2019m able to leave it off when I go to work or leave the house, and can turn it on when I get home, and it\u2019s able to cool the room by 5-7 degrees within an hour. My room went from being, by far, the hottest in my house, to now being the coldest, by far. I\u2019m completely happy with this AC and would 10\/10 do it again. Hope this helps!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"92 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658016000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good product","reviewDescription":"I live in an RV while building a home. The RV gets VERY hot in the summer. The addition of this portable unit to our bedroom allowed us to rest well during the summer months.The only caveat to buyers is to temper your expectations based on your room size.

{"reviewTitle":"Worked great until it didn't...","reviewDescription":"I have had this unit for just over a year. A year and ONE month to be exact.  We live in Southern Maine and so we don't use this unit 24\/7  like some people do only when the heat\/humidity gets ridiculous in mid July through early August.  We also only tend to use this at night and or when we aren't home because it is ridiculously LOUD that in order for us to watch our TV in the same room we have to have the volume on the TV almost all the way up to a 40 when normally we have it at a 10.Anyway, when we bought it it worked great, super cold air  and cooled our living room\/kitchen area enough to make a difference but not enough to make it comfortable but we just attributed it to being a semi-open concept in the bedroom it worked great and would freeze you out almost.  However, with that said in the bedroom it was a little loud so that when the thermostat was set and it kicked on in the middle of the night often times it would wake us up. We did not use it for the other functions such as the dehumidifier and the heat function, the fan is a lot more quiet but honestly we didn't need the fan part if we weren't using the A\/C because we have ceiling fans.  the other complaint i have is that the exhaust home comes loose and pops off from the window.  Its frustrating especially if you move the unit for instance to sweep and you don't notice it right away and then it starts blowing this EXTREMELY HOT air back into the house.Fast forward to this year... again we don't use the unit a lot, so the beginning of the summer again it was working great.  Yesterday when we came home from being out all day and the humidity was starting to creep back up after a very nice weekend, we decided to go ahead and turn it on to cool it down, I noticed that the A\/C wasn't as cold I looked at the temp and saw it was set at 70 so I figured maybe my kids messed with it so I turned it back down to the 64 like we normally have it set at.  Again, about an hour later I walked by and noticed that  the  air blowing was still warm like it was just using the fan feature.  I went from our bedroom where we have a window unit in and then into the hallway and it was such a noticeable difference, I checked the unit to make sure the function was on the right setting, it was, we went to bed and the next morning still the same, no cold air and the room was so muggy.  Not sure what is going on with it but I'm not happy about it considering we paid so much money and for as much as we use it all together would think i would have gotten more life from it.I would NOT recommend this product, based on the noise level and then it not working properly after only a year of LIGHT use.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1565654400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Worked well for one summer and then decided to break.","reviewDescription":"I purchased the air conditioner last July and it seemed to want to break almost exactly a year later - I think the compressor may have given out because it will try to turn on more than the fan function and then give out after about a minute or so.
