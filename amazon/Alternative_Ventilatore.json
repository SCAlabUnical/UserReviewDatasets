{"reviewTitle":"Super powerful, super sturdy, no annoying lights","reviewDescription":"This is probably the fourth floor fan I've had in as many years. The others have all broken either because either the motor has given out or the plastic legs are so flimsy that they can accidentally be broken by stepping on them or banging into them (I have balance issues so am kind of a klutz).This fan has been amazing. The pedestal base is very hard to break, the fan itself is extremely powerful and puts out a lot of air on the high setting. It can be a little noisy but of course it is, there's no way to make these silent. Best of all is that there are no lights to glow in the dark or anything else other than a fan so I can keep it on all night without it distracting me or waking me up.

{"reviewTitle":"Great fan but not without issues","reviewDescription":"I needed to replace my old fan (15 years old, still works, now in the bedroom as my second fan.  Hot flashes.  IYKYK)  and I've owned Lasko fans in the past and never had any issues.Now, I'm a bit particular about my fans.  I have bad allergies, so it must be easily taken apart for cleaning and this one fits the bill.  It must also have great air flow and the 5 blades make for a noticeable difference in my 20ft long living room with cathedral ceilings.  Even on the lowest setting I can see it ruffling the curtains and blinds.  It was easy to put together (my years of experience taking apart my fan to clean it finally came in handy!) and in no more than 8 or 10 minutes, had it up and running.  If only everything was that easy!But remember when I said it was not without issues?  There are a few small issues, but nothing serious.  The stand is supposed to seat itself securely in the base with a strong push and a few clockwise turns.  Unfortunately, my base doesn't appear to have anything to hold the stand securely and while it is steady when still, if it has to be moved, it comes apart.  Not a deal breaker as I really only move it twice a year - out of the closet in the spring, into the closet in the fall - , but  a little annoying; although now that I think about it, it'll be snap to take it apart for storage as winter comes! Look at that, not an issue after all!Last, the noise -  I read a lot of reviews who said the fan was too noisy for them, so here's my observation. In the video, the fan is set to the lowest setting, and while there is a hum, I don't think it's louder than any other fan I have owned but fans are one of the few sounds my ADHD brain can filter out.  So if you're bothered by a mechanical hum, just be warned.  But if you're not bothered by it and you're just looking for a great oscillating fan to push air around your lonely hovel, this is a good buy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723507200000}

Assembly was very finicky - beware that some parts are counter-threaded, so be careful not to crossthread the nut trying to turn it right to tighten it. Chintzy plastic, so I'm sure it is very easy to unintentionally mess up the threads. Even for this price point, it's super, super loud. The specs say 61 dB...I dunno, man. 61 is like normal conversation levels. I can't find my husband's meter to test right now, but I'm betting it's closer to 70. Not quite there (think vacuum cleaners), but definitely close. And it's not a soothing fan-type hum, either; it's very plastic-y sounding and harsh. We got this for our office since we have an old house with poor circulation, and frankly I don't know that we're going to keep it due to the noise. We definitely have to speak a little more loudly than we'd like with it running. But, like I said, it does move air effectively, and it doesn't click when it oscillates, so that's nice.

While the Lasko fan provides stronger airflow due to its 5-blade design compared to the Honeywell's 3-blade design, I'm disappointed with the noise level. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros: Attractive. Exactly as described in the listing. Strong airflow. Works well as expected.Cons: No \"Sleep Mode\" setting - Loud operation, even at the lowest speed - Noise is in at a pitch that interferes with hearing aid functionality and washes out important soundsModification: I replaced the Lasko blade with the old Honeywell blade and reduced the noise issue for my hearing aids substantially without a noticeable loss of airflow.Overall: This Lasko fan is a functional choice for strong air circulation, but the noise level makes it unsuitable for situations where hearing aids are worn regularly, so you should consider a different model. This is going to be relative to every individual's hearing deficiency.Pictures: The control panel highlights the lack of a \"Sleep Mode\" setting, and both fans' blades for comparison (3 blades flat vs. 5 blades pointy).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1718150400000}

The fan literally came apart while running tonight.  The fragile plastic guard (meant to protect you from the fan blade) will come apart at the slightest touch, and tonight the fan blade came off knocking the front guard loose and scattering parts - someone could have been hurt.  Thank goodness I had used plastic wires ties to keep the guard on front of the unit or someone WOULD likely have been hurt.  I couldn't imagine how the fan blade nut became loose, they are designed to stay on tight, but discovered the cheap plastic nut had stripped allowing the blade to come off while running.

I actually enjoy the white noise when sleeping.The air output is great, far more than the old Galaxy it replaced.  No complaints at all on its ability to move air about.I don't have a lot of experience with this fan so I marked durability as average.

I turned the fan off and thinking I must not have put it together correctly, put the front back into place.  I carefully checked to make sure it was on correctly, and then I used my t-shirt to pull across the guard again and off popped the front.  The guard is made of very pliable and thin plastic and can easy just bend its way free of the snaps that are supposed to hold it.  I have since added wire tires to the guard so that the thing won't come apart and hurt someone.  In the past all large fans I have used either had metal guards or much firmer plastic ones.

{"reviewTitle":"Higher price, cheaper materials.","reviewDescription":"I've used Lasko in the past. The one I had to replace lasted for about 9 years without problems up until the motor died. I right away noticed the downgrade in quality of the parts. After placing the rear grill, I tried putting the nut, it took a few tries before I was able to \"lock\" it, every time you think you're locking it, it actually unlocks and you have to start over. Same thing happens when you are trying to lock the cap in place. Then for the front grill, you need to be careful when attaching it to the rear grill, since the new way they decided for it to lock in place can pinch your fingers. When I turned on the motor in the lowest setting, I noticed that it doesn't make a constant noise. It feels like it is not pulling power at a constant rate, more like there's a strong power pull and then in fades, and then there's a strong power pull again, and then it fades again. It does this constantly. After  30 minutes of use, in the lowest setting, the blade and cap just fell apart. Luckily, I still had my old Lasko fan and it so happens that the old parts fit. So basically, I just kept the new motor and mounted all of the old parts to it. All of the new parts went into the recycling bin. I'm highly dissapointed with this purchase, specially when my past experience with Lasko products has been great. They basically jacked up the price and switched to lower quality materials.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1599609600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Dangerous Design","reviewDescription":"TLDR: CHEAP FAN, SAFETY HAZARD - ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL CHILDRENPurchased this fan and was initially pleased with it despite some of the cheap plastic components not fitting well during assembly. I turned it on and felt that it had good utility at a relatively cheap price.First annoyance took place during night one of using the fan when the cheap plastic began to make a rattling noise. The fan is already pretty noisy, so this added an element of noise that made it tough to sleep.A few days later is when the major disappointment took place, which prompted me to write this review. When I loosened the tightening mechanism to lower the fan\u2019s height, the upper half of the fan crashed down and put an inch-long cut on my finger. Less than a second elapsed between when I loosened the knob and when the heavy weight of the fan\u2019s upper half crashed down on the hand I had loosened it with. I even contemplated stitches as the cut was quite deep, bleeding for more than 30 minutes.I realize this event could have been prevented had I known to hold\/support the upper half of the fan as I loosened the support mechanism. My concern is not over my personal cut but over the fact that if a child were to loosen the same knob that I did (it\u2019s about 1 foot off of the ground), it\u2019s plausible that they could possibly lose a finger from this event. The fan is poorly made with a hazardous design.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"63 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1565395200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Dangerous, do not buy!!!","reviewDescription":"Do NOT buy this fan. It is dangerous and loud! Minimal effort was put into the engineering of this fan. It has two fatal flaws, one dangerous and one annoying.The first fatal flaw is the design of the front safety guard. It simply snaps into place without screws. It can easily come apart leaving the rotating blades exposed. And the mesh size of the plastic guard is too large allowing my 2 and 4 year-old grandkids to easily put their fingers into the cage and touch the blades. Not good.The second design flaw is the with the large plastic base. It is shaped like a saucer\/cymbal and perfectly amplifies the vibration from the fan motor at a very loud resonance. The entire upstairs of my house hums and vibrates due to this fan. It is unbelievably annoying and there is nothing you can do to mitigate it. Again, not good.I am a degreed design engineer and this is easily the worst engineered product I've ever bought on Amazon.

{"reviewTitle":"Powerful, noisy, cheaply made","reviewDescription":"Executive summary: In this review I compare 3 fans, including this one.With the prospect of the coming summer and living in an apartment not suitable for window A\/C units and a deficient central A\/C which the landlord refuses to fix, I geared up by buying an array of fans. In the following paragraphs I compare them in terms of power usage, perceived noise, perceived air circulation and overall functionality. All of them were tested on a 150sq ft living room on a 30c\/85f degree day.Overall:Lasko 1827 -  pedestal with 18 in blades: This is a big and powerful fan. The swivel function does a great job at circulating air from the only window in the apartment. The burst of air, even at the lowest setting are noticeable from a 5m\/15ft distance and we could feel \"air circulation\" throughout the whole room. Unfortunately it feels cheaply made and is very noisy, unable to sleep.Vornado 683 - pedestal with 11 in blades: This fan is well built and surprisingly powerful for its size. Even though, you could feel  good breeze if you stood in front of it, we could not replicate the claim of \"whole room air circulation\". Since it doesn't swivel, if you were outside of the range of direct air, we couldn't feel any air. Additionally, it was a little shorter than anticipated and would not fit well in front of the window. The worst part was that it was really noisy and we couldn't keep it on overnight.Honeywell HT-900 - floor with 9 in blades: This wan was a very pleasant surprise. Very cheap but feels well built and despite not being as powerful as the other two, since it draws less energy and makes virtually no noise, we opted to fill the room with 3 of these which we keep at around 3m\/9ft blowing air directly at the lowest setting. Best setup for sleeping.Details (the 3 numbers for each fan and metric correspond to the 3 power settings).Power drawn (beasured using a TP-link HS110 smart plug):Lakso: 85\/73\/63wVornado: 60\/45\/40wHonwywell: 25\/23\/21wNoise (measured with an unreliable phone app, from behing the fan)Lakso: 60\/55\/50dbVornado: 45\/40\/35dbHoneywell: 40\/36\/34dbFinal veredict: We returned the Vornado and for the same price we have the Lakso which we setup in front of the window before goingto bed and the 4 small Honeywel for \"whole room air circulation\",1-3 of which we keep overnight or on timer (with the TP-link smart plug)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1497916800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Loud AF","reviewDescription":"I was so excited to finally have a new fan when I got this yesterday as the fan I've been using for the past 7 years has become a nuisance with the funky sounds it makes now. I've always used a fan for the white noise and gentle breeze when I go to sleep. My 7 y\/o fan had a gentle breeze, like a soft meadow wind and was quiet as a church mouse (if that mouse were a fan) as it pushed the air around the room. This new fan is nothing like that. It's like a hurricane and an earthquake at the same time. The lowest setting is higher than the highest setting on my previous fan and shakes the hollow pole. The vibrations reverberate throughout it and make a very annoying sound. You can feel the fan shaking the floor a foot away from it. As the blades spin, the air smacks on the front grate and makes a sound similar to when someone blows on a small computer fan as it spins. There is nothing quiet about this fan. When I finally got into bed at 1am and realized how loud it was, all I wanted was to smash it to pieces. I used tape all around the front grate where the air smacked on it and it mostly fixed that issue, but then the vibrations were more prominent. This was all on the lowest setting-- the highest probably registers on the Richter Scale. In the end I used my old fan. Although it's annoying, it's nowhere near as bad. I have no idea why the product page says this is a quiet fan. It's a powerful, nice looking, stable fan. It should not be used for white noise when trying to sleep, but to cool down your entire home in the middle of summer in the middle of the day when you don't care how much noise it makes. There is something else you should take into consideration: the chord is extremely short. I haven't measure it, but it's probably around 4-5 feet. This can be remedied by an extension chord, but who wants to deal with that? As far as my review goes, I'd have given this one star last night in my rage, but it deserves more credit than that. If it weren't for the loudness, this would be great.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1452643200000}

I wish the stand was possibly a bit smaller base, but its not the end of the world. Given all these, for the price I would have given it 5 stars.The second fan however was scuffed in multiple areas and the biggest issue is that the front grill of the fan does not snap or attach into the back grill at all unlike the first one. The first one was a tight fit and snapped in almost ideally. The second has a gap when you snap all the sides except the last one. The grill will stay on, but I think one solid smack or bump might knock it off. I am keeping it because there is no issue with the airflow from it, but when you compare the first to the second one, there's a noticeable difference in quality.

Neither fan holds the pedestal in the base, I can just lift it out, and they both wobble some because of this.  And the height adjusters on both don't hold tight and the fan ends up lowering itself as it oscillates.  The 2 star fan has now developed a vibrating noise as it oscillates to one side.  I've taken it apart and tightened everything (parts holding fan itself together do loosen also) and that didn't help.  I just hope it lasts the summer and then I'll trash it and buy another brand.  I would recommend buying a different product to start with.Original Review:  Ordered two fans, both delivered same day.  One in perfect box, the other box obviously had been opened and retaped.  Put the one in the previously opened box together and pieces weren't repacked right and motor wouldn't work.  Amazon should not have shipped that.  Got a replacement without a problem though.  The fans aren't that hard to put together, however the front screens on the fans should fit more precisely and you do have to wiggle the piece around to get the latches to fit together correctly.  One fan, the pole doesn't fit tightly in the base and will lift out and the top part of the fan will slide down so the fan isn't as tall.  Can't tighten the connection any tighter so that doesn't happen.  They are a little noisy, but as far as output, they really blow.  Not sorry I bought them, but may look for another brand if I need more fans.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1569715200000}

We'll see how well that works out in the long run).After assembly, I turned it on and was amazed at how much air this fan moves. And with the perfect amount of noise! On the highest setting, you almost need goggles when lying in front of it.Awesome fan!

{"reviewTitle":"Quite possibly the worst fan I have ever owned","reviewDescription":"The first thing I noticed when unboxing is how unbelievably cheap all of the materials felt. A fan so light as a feather? I really didn\u2019t expect it to be plastic as I expect more from Lasco, although I confess I did not read the product details carefully.Following that I began the assembly instructions, which were very simple. As simple as they were, the pieces didn\u2019t fit together easily because either the threading on the nuts was tricky or uneven, or the pieces you had to screw into each other would easily slip and slide while accomplishing that task. Cheap plastic will do that.Worst part is the footprint of the base. I cannot imagine anything less than 30 feet tall needing to be supported by that base!! It is enough to want to throw it out the window as I have no room for that base in my apartment. Perhaps I\u2019ll get rid of my bed or charge it rent.Yeah, it blows. It blows kinda hard. But I got it to replace a fan that broke yesterday and it doesn\u2019t blow any harder than that very old dirty fan constructed of metal and much sturdier material.Finally, the pole is a piece of junk. It slides up and down very easily, and the head is so heavy that the top portion of the pole will not support its weight. The nut that you are supposed to use to keep the fan poles tall and upright is cheap. This results in the fan continuing to gradually lower in height toward the nut onto a pole that doesn\u2019t even secure to the base. This is absolutely the cheapest piece of crap I\u2019ve ever seen.My fan broke yesterday. My senior dog is in kidney failure, and heart failure. She is dying and she is hot. The fan is blowing at her directly and will not be returned because that is the only damn thing that matters. \ud83d\udc3e\ud83c\udf39","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723852800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Buyers beware of your fingers","reviewDescription":"Buyers beware of your fingers, for if you buy this product you may be without one or two.My husband and I have been using a very ancient Lasko fan since we met five years ago. This thing is incredible and is perfect for us while we are sleeping, especially during the sweaty summers in Michigan. The problem was, though, we couldn\u2019t find another fan that was as good as that one so that we each could have one blowing on both of us at the same time.After years of searching Meijers and WalMarts and Targets and spending probably hundreds of dollars on sub par fans, we thought that we would go for the good stuff and get a twin to the tried and true fan that we know and love.We got it today and my husband was so excited that he put it together before going to work. I raced home from my job to try it out, so excited to finally have a mini-whirlwind on my side of the bed to stave off the humidity in the armpit of summer. But when I switched it on\u2026Listen, the air power isn\u2019t the problem. It is pretty comparable to the Old Faithful, what IS the problem, though, is the fact that the back fan guard that keeps people from sticking their fingers in the blades from the back keeps coming off. When that happens, the entire fan goes WILD and it stops the blades.Well. I like to think of myself as a person who can reasonably put a plastic fan guard back onto the fan and have it work just fine. Boy, was I wrong. First, you have to shove it on and use a considerable amount of force to do so (and it will still come off within 5 minutes of turning the fan on). Then, you have to finagle the guard to fit into the proper slot on the base of the fan and make sure you are properly securing all sides.So, naturally, as I was putting my considerable 200 lbs of body weight (don\u2019t judge me) behind putting a stupid fan guard back on so I can have my dream of sleeping with the wind gently caressing my sleeping face come true, my finger slipped and was pinched by the DUMB FAN GUARD! (I have a bandaid on it now, but it is swollen and really hurts, thanks for asking)So, while I consider myself to be a reasonable person, and I understand that this fan is not entirely to blame for my now throbbing finger, I am a wee bit salty about the whole thing and I wanted to complain. Please, Lasko, just fix the rear fan guard and stop it from slipping off every 2 minutes. Otherwise, this fan would be a dream come true, but currently, we cannot use it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1660953600000}

Poorly Packaged with unsecured and poorly wrapped motor, poles and plastic parts flopping around freely inside a single shipping carton. Received one incomplete page of instruction (marked as pages 1 -2, 7-8). It was difficult to find the full instruction manual on the Lasko Amazon Seller Website to discover the only complete assembly instruction for the fan is a tiny single image without text, situated in the center of page 3. After I realized the blades have a specific placement (not mentioned in the assembly instructions) I was finally able to correctly assemble the fan. The pole is supposed to lock at the desired height, it does but it doesn't support the weight of the fan -so it keeps sliding down, becoming lower to the floor. I have purchased Lasko versions of this fan several times in the past and am aware that it will cease to function in a few months, even with little use. I will be purchasing higher-end products from higher-end manufacturers in the future.

{"reviewTitle":"Super fan, but perhaps not for everyone","reviewDescription":"This fan was a great buy. It's nearly perfect for my own needs, but I'll list its qualities just in case some of them might not work so well for you.It wasn't difficult to assemble. The hardest part was getting the front cage to snap on properly, but even that only took a few tries. And since the cage just hooks together rather than needing screws, popping it off to clean the blade will be a breeze. (Although, there's not much of a hook to those hooks, so I don't plan to pop the cage off any more than I absolutely have to. If those hooks wear down or break, then that's that.) Also, all you need to put it together is your own two hands. No tools needed.It's very powerful. It moves a great deal of air, even on low (I haven't gone past medium yet; I'm afraid it might blow the cat across the room on high!), which is a relief. For two weeks when my A\/C was out, I needed a fan that could cool me off even though the air it was moving was hot and humid. This fan blows with such force that even warm air movement is refreshing. And its force means you can set it at a fair distance and still feel it, but it's also strong enough to blow papers and stuff around if they're in the fan's path, even when they aren't particularly close to it.The oscillator has a wide swing to it, about 90 degrees, which I suppose could either be a negative or a positive. If you want it to swing but still stay relatively contained at a small angle, you may not care for this. On the other hand, it's perfect when you have a small area of cool air (like a new portable a\/c with a fairly puny blower) and want to distribute it far and wide.The cord is fairly short\u2014rather shorter than I would've liked, honestly. I didn't measure it, but I'd guess it to be maybe 6 feet. That could be a problem if you want to use it in a place without an outlet handy, but a cheap extension cord solved that problem for me. (Incidentally, there is no grounding prong on the plug, so you can use a 2-hole extension cord if necessary.)The pole has a decent amount of extension to it; I'd say you can adjust the height by about a foot and a half. At its tallest, from base to motor is (again, this is an estimate) probably 4-1\/2 feet. This makes it pretty versatile; you can stand it on the floor or shorten it and put it on a (large) table. At full length, though, that also makes it a bit top-heavy. It's fine if you leave it alone, but the cat knocked it over when I first put it together and now he's scared of it.It's loud. Even on low it's pretty loud, compared to what I remember my last box fan sounding like. It doesn't bother me at all, but if you're someone looking for a fan for your bedroom, and you need quiet to sleep, you probably won't like this.Seriously, I have a hard time imagining a fan with this small a footprint with as much power as this one has. I wish the cord were a bit longer, like I said, but that's really my only complaint.

I was curious if I was sent insufficient parts, so I looked up the model on their website, which didn't offer much more than this page does. Something with the fan provides a link to an assembly video which showcased parts to keep the fan held together, but the fan in the video was clearly a completely different model. This was especially apparent given the frame assembled differently in the video from this fan (Unsure if I'm missing something, but it stays in place when I squeeze the front frame inwards to force it into the rear frame) I personally would advise looking elsewhere for your fan needs, as even if the only flaw was missing parts, you're on Amazon; there's no lack of other options.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686787200000}

I've needed a fan on to sleep since I was a child, and I've only ever bought this style Lasko fans (because I'm one of those weirdos that believes in product\/brand loyalty). They used to be perfect: inexpensive, easy-to-build, relatively durable, and produced just the right amount of white noise. Before this past year, I only had to buy 2 fans (3 if you count a gift for someone), which lasted 10 years and 4 years, with semi-annual deep cleaning (take apart, clean each piece, canned-air the hell out of it). I'm sure the second one would've lasted longer, but it was broken in a move. This past year, however, I've gone through 3 of these in both white and black (1 from Home Depot, 1 from Walmart, and this here). This one lasted a total of 13 days. Not even 2 full weeks!I found that the problem is that these new motors are garbage. They heat up well beyond acceptable levels, enough that they will melt the plastic parts. For the previous fan I had, the motor overheated, causing the spinning pin to heat up enough to melt and warp the propeller. This one heated up enough that the cover began to melt. Now it just overheats within 3 minutes and slows down to a stop withing 1 more minute. If that's not enough, now they're getting MORE expensive?! What kind of asinine BS is that? Lasko is going to cut the quality of its product, but jack up the price? The past two were both in the $20 range in stores. This one was $30ish.

This high pitched sound wouldn't be so bad if it was consistent, but it is more akin to a haunting breeze.  The high pitched sound isn't always there but it comes and goes.  It is rather distracting when trying to relax and sleep as you hear the whooshing of the fan, and then the high pitched sound comes in for a few seconds then goes away.  It is very distracting for me personally and has kept me from sleep.I would recommend not getting this fan.  I wonder if the reason they are on sale now is because many people are returning them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1596499200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good but could be a lot better...","reviewDescription":"Good but the motor vibrates and hums loud.Very annoying if you trying to relax or sleep at night and the fan is on low. I expect to hear  a lot of noise  due to the amount of air it's putting out and no other uncessary noises. Two the height adjustment nut is cheaply made of some kind of hard hardplastic instead of metal like the rest of the pole. I crack mines by accident .

Overall it's a really nice fan just be careful when handling the parts they are very fragile and can easily break or get damaged if  they are not handle carefully.

{"reviewTitle":"Loud, but surprisingly effective","reviewDescription":"So let me just preface everything by saying for the price, this is not a bad fan. It's ability to move air, in my opinion, more than makes up for the noise. When I first got it and set it up, I was impressed with just how much air this thing could move. It wasn't until the following morning when I went to go turn it off that I realized it was only on it's lowest setting.Pros:AIR FLOWAs mentioned above, this fan moves air and it's effective in doing so. Even the lowest setting is stronger than the high settings on many fans I've owned. If you need strong air circulation in a small room, this fan will accomplish that.LIGHTWEIGHTSince the materials on the fan are aluminum and light-weight plastic, the entire fan is very light and easy to move around. It has a pretty wide base (20\") to keep it from blowing itself over.ADJUSTABLE HEIGHTThe height can be adjusted using a twisting lock on the pole. Since the fan is so light, you shouldn't need to worry about the fan slipping down over time.EASY TO ASSEMBLE\/CLEANThe whole fan arrives in pieces, so you do need to put it all together. The fan comes with an instruction manual and takes about maybe 5 minutes max to assemble. No screws, bolts, hex keys, etc. required. Also makes it really easy to clean this fan if it starts to collect dust, pet hair, etc.Cons:NOISEWhile not as loud as a metallic industrial fan, this model definitely makes some noise. The lowest setting isn't too bad, but the highest setting can be pretty loud. Easily one of the loudest fans I've ever owned. If you work at home or are using this in any area where you're making calls, I would not recommend having this blowing in your general direction.QUALITYThe quality of the plastic in the build is somewhat mid. The guards on the front and back of the fan are made of a thin and flexible plastic which can easily be knocked out of alignment and \"unsnap\" which could become an issue if the fan is on. Don't expect this thing to be able to take hits.LIMITED VERTICAL RANGE OF MOTIONFor a standing fan, it lacks the ability to be angled downwards. It can point at an upward angle, but if you need the fan to point anywhere below it's default setting, you'll need to lower the height of the pole.SHORT POWER CORDThe power cord is pretty short, so unless you have an extension cord available, this fan will need to live fairly close to the outlet.Overall:It's a powerful fan and it won't break the bank. If you just need a decent fan that's going to circulate a lot of air in a room very quickly without spending $80+ on a higher end model, this is a good option.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"116 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688860800000}

The pipe that supports the fan to the base wasn't assembled properly so we had to figure out how to take it apart and fix that before the fan could be mounted to the pipe. If the top of the skinny part of the pipe is flared, then you know it was assembled backwards or essentially upside down (the fan motor cannot attach to this flared end).Fixing the situation is simple, with the pipe detached from the base, loosen the nut until the small pipe comes free from the nut and the larger pipe, then you take the small pipe and shove it up the larger pipe with the flared end of the small pipe facing down. Once the small pipe emerges from the grip that the nut usually covers, you tighten the nut back onto the pipe and then you attach the base and the fan\/motor as instructed.

First one I got I noticed blemishes all over the exterior as I unpackaged, discoloration, scratches, etc, but I had been without a fan for weeks so I decided I could live with it. As I was assembling it I had difficulty locking the back shroud in place, the locking piece would tighten and then slip out of the threads, but I got it to a point where it seemed somewhat secure and moved on. Then as I was putting on the front shroud I realized I could snap in 3\/4 of the shroud but 1\/4 was insecure and if I tried to secure it fully it would fall off, so I decided I'd live with it being 3\/4 secure and hope for the best. What I couldn't live with was the loud hum from the motor. The fan is loud, I love that because I use it to sleep, but the hum is overbearing, and didn't exist in the older fan. Disappointed, I turned it off and ordered a replacement hoping for the best. Received the replacement yesterday, opened the smushed and shoddily taped together box (not a good omen) to find the same blemishes, scratches, etc. Didn't even bother assembling it.

{"reviewTitle":"Would not buy again.","reviewDescription":"First off, the box arrived with no attempt at closing the box. It was the product box with a label stuck on it. The UPS woman was struggling to keep the bulky box closed as she carried it to my door. Luckily, nothing seemed to be missing but everything was covered in dust.Putting the fan together was a test in patience and I love building things.Pros: It has excellent wind speed. I do love that about it. It is fairly quiet.Cons: CHEAP quality. I have always loved this brand but if this is what they have reduced themselves to, I may never buy from them again.The trial of patience came in when trying to get the pole to stay up. First, I could not get the stand to stay in place, it kept tilting. After quite a bit of grunting, pushing, and fussing, I did something magical and it slipped into place, but is still wobbly. Ok...let's put the fan head on. Again with the wobbly. Not good, keep going. The pole would not stay up. I had about reached the conclusion that I was going to have to use Gorilla glue to cement the pieces together. Finally was able to get it to accept that I wanted it to stay tightened. Now, back to the head. I put the motor on, made sure it was going to tilt like it should. So far, so good. I got the fan assembly together with a little pleading as the last clip, snap in place of the front cover did not want to work. Finally!! Success! I worried about turning it on for fear that the vibrations would cause the pole to slide down to the lowest position, again. It has been running for two hours now and so far, so good.

{"reviewTitle":"Cheap construction, loud whine, can't point down, and not worth any price","reviewDescription":"I bought this fan on the strength of reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately, it fails in almost every regard, and even if it means saving ten bucks, this is not a product you want to own.1.) The construction is poor - The base of the unit is not fastened to the shaft in any way, such that every single time you pick up the fan, the shaft will slide right out of the base and leave it lying on the floor. More importantly, when you go to loosen the heightening nut, the entire shaft will rotate with it. So you need one hand to hold the lower shaft in place, one hand to loosen\/tighten the nut, and a third hand to lift the upper shaft into the correct position. Good luck with that.2.) Irritating, high-pitched whine - I assume any fan will make a fairly loud, droning noise. In fact, that is often desirable, as white noise for assistance with sleep. This fan makes that noise; however, it simultaneously makes a louder, high-pitched engine whine. This happens at all three power settings. I have never heard another fan make this noise, and you will likely find it highly irritating to be in the same room while it's running.3.) Can't angle downward - the head of the fan can be tilted to point up toward the ceiling, but it can't be angled downward toward the floor. This might be an uncommon use case, but it means you won't be able to use the fan to dry a wet spot on the carpet or cool you off on the floor working out. Again, I have never purchased another fan that had this limitation.In conclusion, this is a cheap, poorly made product that will be more irritation to you than it will be useful. The only positive is the decent stream power, but I have much smaller fans that are equally intense. I strongly recommend finding another option.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1526947200000}

I liked this fan so much I purchased 3 20 inch models  and 2 18 inch models ( black) . I didn\u2019t get the ones with remotes b\/c I know they\u2019ll get lost in the house. So, over all fantastic fans , not too loud , easy to assemble . My only issue is that after a while or so the pole tends to slide down so I am constantly having to adjust them to the proper height . I had owned one of these fans a few years back ( I still have it) and when this issue popped up after 2 months I thought it was an anomaly. Eventually it got so bad I ended up securing it to the height I wanted by using super glue on the height adjuster .  This go round it did not take months , it took a few weeks  Two  of the 20 inch models are already sliding down  as well as an 18 inch one . I\u2019m about to order some glue just in case it becomes a daily battle .  I like the fan, the breeze is strong and other then the sliding problem it\u2019s well made and well worth the money .

It was the first thing I set up upon arrival, and the last thing I packed when it was time to leave.  The heat index was in the high 90s all weekend.  On high, outside, this fan kept me plenty cool and kept most of the bugs away all weekend.  I moved it in the tent at night and I slept comfortably with it on the low setting.My bedroom is very hot, so I set it up when I got home.  Still great, but noticeably louder indoors than out.

I can see using it to quickly dry after a flooded basement or to quick aerate your home after it being vacant, for example. I would have kept it if the lowest setting was quiet, but even the lowest was too much noise for me. Also, the fan grill is plastic and I prefer metal. The motor seemed heavy duty though, so it\u2019s probably a good quality machine. It\u2019s nice looking too and lightweight enough to easily move. The base is nice and sturdy. To summarize, this is a great fan to keep in wet prone basement for quick dry, quickly aerate musty home or cabin and large homes where you can keep fan farther away so you can\u2019t hear it as much.

{"reviewTitle":"They need to redesign the assembly - but very reliable.","reviewDescription":"It's a fan.  I needed a tall one and this was at the height I needed, almost.  Assembly required.  No worries, I assemble a lot of stuff and am used to tight spaces, tight fits, etc., from working on my cars.Fan works well once assembled - good airflow.  I wish they manufactured this with the extension rod being able to go up maybe 6 inches taller.  I can deal with that, it's the tallest fan I could find.My issue is the assembly - super easy, until you get to placing the in-front of the blade guard.  It's a \"snap in\" piece according to the instructions.  Good luck with that.  Instructions indicate to snap in from the top to the bottom.  That was a RIDICULOUS fiasco.  It took me 40 minutes to finally get the front guard attached - after breaking off one of the snap in tabs.Note to manufacturer.  That is a horrible set up.  Go back to the drawing board on that one.  Rework the mold or whatever.  Include some small phillips screws so you can easily screw in the front fan guard section by section to the back piece.  That way you can screw in one area at a time, have it secured and move on to the next screw.If I ever decided to try to take out the front guard to clean the fan and guards, well I wouldn't do it.  I'd throw out the fan and buy a different brand easier to assemble.  It's too hard to get all the tabs in place at one time with your current set up.If it wasn't for that I'd rate this much higher - though I've only been using this a few hours.  Outside of assembly\/taking fan apart with those plastic tabs, it does what I needed it to do, wish it was a bit taller.2024 Edit.  Despite the assembly issues I'm very happy with this.  The product lasted almost 5 years.  Probably would have gone longer but I messed up and jacked up the cord.  It was used many, many hours.  Basically daily for 8 hours or so straight probably about 270 days a year.  Well worth the money spent.  I'm left debating whether to buy a new one or find a different option without the assembly\/easy cleaning issues.  I may just suffer the assembly again, cleaning hassles and just buy another because I never would have expected thus thing to be so reliable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1567209600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good value for the money, but...","reviewDescription":"This is my second exact fan from Lasko, and to date  both are working well. One is 2 years old at this point, the other is 3 years old. The older one is used nearly every day in the summer in my garage where I work on old cars. It's not exactly the best environment as the air is a bit dirty and on occasion i do bump into it. The other is used at our beach house and doesn't see nearly the use.PROS: Well balanced motor and fan assembly which means quiet operation. Even the oscillating function is smooth and quiet. The amount of air pushed is definitely adequate. The base is large enough to keep the fan upright when you kids bump it or play around it. CONS: The reason for 4 stars is mostly due to the adjusting hardware. The height adjustment is on a telescoping pole where a plastic collar is tightened around the bottom pole to compress the two poles and keep the fan from dropping. The one that gets bumped the most has lost its tension to a degree and it requires height readjustment every few days. After enough of this, the plastic collar cracked and now it's nearly an every day adjustment. Because that particular fan is always used at its highest height setting, i'm simply going to run a sheet metal screw through the interface of the two poles and make the height permanent. The other adjustment is the fan head tilt. It's on a plastic detent\/ratchet gizmo that has no lock down. In other words, you just grab the fan head and lift or drop it as needed. It's fairly solid but if this fan is bumped into a lot, as it is with my two units, it will adjust downwards. No big deal there but much like the height adjustment, it could use a better locking mechanism. Otherwise, If you catch the right price on Amazon, this is a pretty good value for fan.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1626307200000}

It's not quiet, but I don't need it to be. I always have the radio on when I'm in my shop, and the fan noise is of no consequence.  About a week after I got this, I saw a similar (but better) model at Costco for about a dollar more. But of course, if you don't get it then, sale items at Costo are gone the next day.

The motor eventually gave out, so I went in search of a new fan. I liked the old fan, but I just wanted a basic no frills model. I went with the same company, and what a mistake that was.Within a few months the fan got very noisy. It turns out the threads of locking piece which holds the fan blades in place had disintegrated. The fan blades would work themselves towards the front grill, clang against them at high speed, and then return to their original position. This repeated so rapidly, it was just a constant clanging. Luckily, the locking piece can be put in backwards and still screw on - just with half the remaining threads. My parents have the same model, and they have the same problem.This lasted me a little over 2 years, and I've had to buy a new fan.

I could live with that. What I can't live with is the fan blade assembly cover.  The other fans I own have solid covers that are eitehr latched in with plastic latches or screwed in. This one uses plastic snaps as pictured here.  The problem is the snaps don't line up 100%.  You get them all in but one or two are just a little out of alignment. Even when they snap they easily pop out.  At one point while the fan was running, my kid bump it and the front cover just fell off.  Now if I were reading a post like this, my first thought is \"This guy put it together wrong.\"  Yeah I can't rule that out 100%, but I hav put together a ton of things, toys, grills, furniture etc...

I've had it for a year, I quite often leave it on continuously for weeks, and the motor hasn't burnt out, so one point in its favor there.  If, \"It's a fan\" is enough for a five star review, then maybe I've rated it incorrectly.

But the fan itself is pretty heavy so the way the connecting bars go doesn't secure the fan good over 8 times the whole fan bent almost breaking the cheap plastic piece used to tighten both poles together and in the end I had to station it and hope it holds and can clearly tell it's little crooked and probably will fall over completely soon or later. If the price wasn't so cheap and I didn't destroy the box already and could survived with my other smaller  standing fan and the ceiling fan I wouldn't wasted money on another fan especially since I'm buying a indoor A\/C after summer when their cheaper for next summer.

I live in NYC, and use a box fan for white noise during the day, and to drown out all other noises at night.  I was THRILLED about how loud this thing was, until I heard it - the hum.  No matter what speed it was on, whether it was on the hardwood floor or on the rug, this fan emitted an extremely unpleasant, low hum.  I'm not lying when I say I had a visceral reaction to it - I could feel it in the pit of my stomach, it bothered me so much.I took the fan apart and put it back together again, thinking maybe something was loose, but no matter what I did, it still hummed.  So I very sadly returned it, and now have a weak-*ss Honeywell fan that hardly puts out any noise at all.  *sigh*  I've read reviews for several Lasko pedestal fans, and the \"hum\" seems to be a common complaint.

{"reviewTitle":"Much Louder than Expected!","reviewDescription":"Ok, I will fully explane why I only gave this fan a 2 star review.The first thing is, it is really loud for anyyone, who is considering this as a bedroom fan! I have to listen to my TV on excessive volume, even when this fan is on its lowest setting. It's not an annoying loud, it's just loud, and I suspect it's due to its cheap build.The second area would be the living room, but even for the living room, you don't want to have to talk over fan noise. Also in the living room, you do have the ability to place it in an area where it might minimize the need to crank up the volume, just to here the TV. That being said, this is a very economical fan, everything on it is plastic, except for the motor, and for the living room, I want a nicer looking fan, and one that looked to be better put together.When you look at this fan, it just screams low quality, when it actually works very well, and it does move a lot of air, but I can't give you an actual measurement, as I can't find anything regarding its CFM (cubic foot\/per minute). But again what I can say is, it's a hard blower (even in low).For someone without air-conditioning, I would have to say this is a must by, simply due to its combination of high air flow, and it being a oscillating 3 speed fan.The bottom line it the fan works very well, but is not quiet by any means!I'm going to keep mine, but it's not going to go in my bedroom, or living room!I'll be looking for a different brand to put in my bedroom, and living room.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1463011200000}

We tried it out anyway for the first night but I couldn't even sleep with it, it was driving me mad and getting louder.  I returned that for a replacement and the second fan did the same thing.  We wound up keeping that one anyway since it wasn't as loud as the first one.  Still, this one the blades come loose every few months even though I tightened them quite a bit.  The other fan I clean once a year and never had a problem with blades loosening.  Anyway, this is the last Lasko fan we're buying.

The base, grille, blades, motor casing, and attachments are entirely made of plastic. The height adjustment is so flimsy, it barely holds. The front grille is so thin and cheap, it's warped, so it's virtually impossible to fit it on. I finally gave up, and I'm using it without the grille.The pole doesn't bolt into the fan base; it just pushes into a hole, so it constantly turns. Therefore, it's pretty much impossible for one person to adjust the height. You need a second person to hold on to the bottom half of the pole; otherwise, it turns with the height adjuster. The fan motor doesn't bolt to the pole, either; you just shove it on.The fan puts out a decent amount of air, but I don't expect it to last long.My last pedestal fan was a Honeywell. It was not expensive, and it was built like a tank, all metal, and it lasted many years. I cannot believe how cheap stuff is built today--unless you have $200 to spend on a fan.Update: After 15 minutes of fooling around, I finally got the %$&#*&% front grille to snap on. It's never coming off, so dusting the fan blades is not an option. I may try some Gorilla glue to secure the pole into the base and the fan head to the pole. It's absurd that I have to do this stuff to fix the bad engineering on this thing.Update: I used Gorilla Glue to secure the pole to the base.

The plan was to conduct air from the north (cooler) side of our living room toward the south (hotter) windows. They were to work in tandem. Our AC is not functioning and we're not willing to spend the money to fix\/run it.Assembly of the first fan took about 15 minutes. Other than the collar that mounts the back grille to the motor and the piece that holds the blade in place, none of the pieces are threaded. You're basically just stuffing the post into the base, then shoving the motor onto the post.The noise and vibration of the motor on the lowest setting -- not the blades moving through the air -- is ridiculous. Our tri-level house is ~2500 square feet; the noise is outrageous on all three levels. You can practically feel the vibration in your teeth on the floors above and below -- and the fan was placed on carpet.Hoping that it was just that one fan, I assembled the other. The second one was worse.I understand this is an inexpensive unit, but it's appallingly loud on the lowest setting. The highest speed sounds like an air boat cruising through the Everglades. The vibration is even more intolerable. They do move air quite effectively, so if you live next to an interstate highway, these fans might work for you.They were disassembled and back in the box for return about as fast as they were assembled.

They would last several months then get louder and more inefficient and I would replace. Wasteful yes but they are\/were cheap so no distress. However this Xmas I opted to purchase a slightly \"better\" version for my son. More costly in this case was not equivalent to better quality.This fan is NOISY. But worse than that its not made properly. Attaching the front and back grill almost made my brain implode. I could put the other lasko together [having owned about 6 over the last few years] in my sleep.This \"improved\" version (EXACT same instructions) took 3x as long because of cheap construction, poor quality and mismatched plastic grill connectors making the snapping together of the front and back grill harder than surviving the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek.I finally forced it to snap together but after reading the reviews I am not confident of this models safety or quality.Long story short. The cheaper version is easier to work with and you get what you pay for. Don't waste money by upgrading because this model is actually a downgrade.Might be the last time I buy a Lasko if this is what I can anticipate in the future.Cheap cheap cheap","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1611187200000}

The blade is unbalanced and adds a \u201cwhump whump\u201d to the sound, which carries DIRECTLY through the hollow base (which acts like a sound resonating chamber) and directly into your floors.

I want just the sound of the air blowing. I never had that with my old GE fan. All you heard was the air blowing. So when you trying to fall asleep you hear a low humming\/vibrating sound of the motor plus the air blowing. The other thing with this fan it seems to not hold it's RPM's good. It's not a consistent air flow. It fluctuates up and down quiet a bit. One second it's blowing normal then all of a sudden the air speeds up (gets louder) for a bit then it seems to almost go silent then repeats. Again this is just me but it drives me crazy so I'll probably go look for another GE fan.

{"reviewTitle":"Powerful but Noisy","reviewDescription":"PROS: This fan is a fan-tastic size for the price point. It creates strong air movement on and off the oscillation setting. The fan comes completely unassembled and well-packaged in a very sturdy eco-friendly box (about the size of a box fan). The instructions are clear and concise. I was able to put the fan together in under five minutes.CONS: The attached video is on the lowest setting to illustrate just how loud the blades are. If you\u2019re planning on running this fan with a television on, be prepared to raise the volume significantly. If, like me, you enjoy the white noise and humming when you\u2019re falling asleep at night, this is a great selection, again, in the lower price range that\u2019ll arrive quickly. I ordered the black version, which added another day to the shipping time. The only metal components are the pole and fan motor, everything else is plastic which does vibrate when the fan is on and adds to the noise level. The upside to the plastic parts: the grills are easy to remove\/clean. I would recommend some THIN insulating foam edging or weather stripping, in either black or white depending on the fan color,  to run between the front and back grill along the outside edge to buffer\/eliminate the vibration noise. Lastly, there is no remote or smart function (which I acknowledge really is just a champagne problem). My solution was a smart power strip. It doesn\u2019t change the speed of the blades but a simple \u201cHey Google turn on\/off the bedroom fan\u201d works just fine. :)RECAP: Great price. Large Fan. Assembly required. Powerful. Noisy (but not obnoxious). Give it a whirl.FOR THE MANUFACTURER: If you want that fifth star, work on how noisy your fan is because of the parts vibrating against each other. I\u2019m sure it can be done without affecting the price point and it\u2019ll certainly drive more sales.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"75 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687824000000}

The fan shroud is plastic and if you bump it the outer piece pops off;  it does not latch securely.  It is so flimsy that any real contact would break it.  The blade is a soft thermoplastic and some plastic mold flashing not trimmed is the likely cause of some complaints of noise.  The base is plastic and is loose on the pole so that if you grab the pole to move the fan, it just comes out, and the pole wobbles in the hole.  There's no handle to move the base, you must try to get your fingernails under the edge.  The height adjustment collar is a joke which requires two hands since the lower and upper poles aren't secured to base or motor.  So how do you hold the up while tightening the slippery plastic collar?  You take off the motor, and then the pole since they will both lift off freely.  Since the fan motor is loose on the pole, and has very little depth in it's socket, so it can easily fall off the pole too when moving it.It's cheap and does blow air and doesn't fall over once set up.

When it is on its highest setting, you'll have trouble hearing the TV or a phone call, even if you're across the room.My main beef with this fan, though, is that it doesn't really hold together. The kit you get doesn't truly attach the pole to the base, or the fan to the pole; rather, they just kind of slide into a groove and balance in place. This means that if you want to move the fan, you can't simply lift it by its pole. You have to partially dismantle it and then reassemble it once you've moved it. It also wobbles a bit. Plus, because the fan just loosely sits on the pole, the oscillating feature ends up changing the direction of the fan. In the span of thirty minutes, the fan completely turned itself around and was blasting air directly at the wall rather than into the room.Some of the reviews talk about drilling holes and adding screws or glue to keep things together.

{"reviewTitle":"Too flimsy for the price, but seems to work ok","reviewDescription":"A few thoughts:* The color is not white, but more of an off white.* Instructions were not very clear, but lucky there is a video that walks through the steps.* Materials are mostly cheap plastic, so I don't feel the fan was worth the price I paid and I would not purchase again.* In order to raise the height of the fan, you twist and tighten pole, but it doesn't get very tight and will lower very easily* So far, fan works well and it does oscillate, but the nob that stops oscillation requires a few tugs.* Mine arrived with a couple of stains that won't come out.I was very disappointed upon seeing how flimsy this fan is.  With the flimsy-ness of the fan, I hope it doesn't die soon.  I can't really say I would recommend this fan because the price is too high for the materials used.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697846400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not returning this *only* because we\u2019re having a heatwave where I am!","reviewDescription":"I needed a black stand fan that\u2019s big enough to seriously move air in my western exposure living room and, based on reviews, this seemed like it would fit the bill. And it does\u2026 sort of.This fan does move air, no doubt about it. At the highest setting, I can feel air current even 11 feet away. (Not a strong wind at that distance, but air movement.) If I\u2019m sitting within 4 feet of the fan, I can\u2019t put it higher than speed 1 unless I want it to blow my eyebrows right off!Aesthetically, this is nothing to get excited about. The all-plastic blades and cage are pretty cheap looking. The plastic base is enormous, and looks far larger than stated dimensions even though the measurements are correct.Also, if you need precise positioning, this is not the fan for you! Another reviewer mentioned \u201cpole creep\u201d and was not joking. Touching the fan in the slightest will cause it to slooowly slide lower, which is not great for me because I wanted it to stay at a fixed height. Additionally, the fan head has a tendency to list to one side if it is tilted back to any degree. Blowing straight ahead has worked fine except the head doesn't really attach securely to the pole and just rests on it.In terms of noise, the difference between speeds 2 and 3 is really dramatic. I enjoy white noise and speed 2 provides a pleasant, noticeable whirring of air. It doesn\u2019t affect my hearing tv or conversation but is just enough to make sleeping easier. I know because I had an accidental nap on the sofa one day and am \u201cblaming\u201d the fan for lulling me to sleep! ;-) Speed 3 ups the sound to windstorm levels. I find it relaxing but forget about hearing anything above the whoosh. It\u2019s not the sound of the motor or indicative of an imbalance or defect, it\u2019s just the sound of a lot of air being pushed around forcefully.TL;DR? Unless you need a black fan, as I did, buy the Holmes 4 in 1 Stand Fan with Swirl Base HASF1516. I purchased one in July 2014 and it\u2019s going strong! Same price point but much better made with metal construction, no pole creep or head wobble or other structural annoyances. It also moves as much or more air as this Lasko but does it more quietly, looks great and is easier to position around furniture because of the base design. As my review title says, if we weren\u2019t broiling here right now I\u2019d have sent the Lasko back and ordered another Holmes, even though it isn\u2019t the color I wanted.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1436140800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good, but loud :-(","reviewDescription":"So I was in search of a pedestal fan for my room because it is the absolute hottest room in the house. It could be freezing in every other room of the house, but my room turns into a sweat box. Now most pedestal fans that I had seen ran close to, if not more than, $100.00 and I did not want to spend that much money on a simple fan. When on my search I came across this one that seemed to be exactly what I needed at a very decent price. This fan was VERY easy to assemble, it took me about 5 minutes max. Some pedestal fans don't have the option of rotating around the room, but this one does which is a nice feature. It also works very well, I only need to put it on speed 1 of 3 to make it comfortable in my room. Another nice feature is that the height is very easy to adjust. I have not gotten the exact measurements, but I have a rather high bed and it can go low enough to hit me directly with the cool air or high enough to go above my body to circulate around the room.Now the reason I gave it a 3, is even though it was a great price and has some great features, it is by no means a quiet fan. I fall asleep with my television on mostly every night, distracts my mind from thinking about everything I need to get done so that I am able to fall asleep. Now usually, to hear my television perfect from my bed, it stays at a volume of 22. The first night I used the fan, I had to turn the TV up to a 75 volume in order to understand what they were saying on the TV. It is not an option to turn it up that loud as I live in the bottom apartment and the family's 7 year old daughter is right above my room. So now, especially once the summer months hit, I am going to have to purchase a set of wireless speakers to put next to my bed in order to have the fan on and enjoy watching television at night.If you aren't going to have this in your bedroom or in an area where you will be watching TV, then I would highly recommend it. I think it would also be a great fan to have for a classroom if you are a teacher. Just not anywhere that requires you to listen to a TV or if you are looking for a very quiet fan.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1447027200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Cheap, cheap, CHEAPLY made!!!!!","reviewDescription":"As you take the pieces out of the box you're instantly hit with just how cheap they all feel. It doesn't get better as you assemble the pieces. The cheap plastic is meant to give way enough for press fits. The whole flimsy fan cage is held to the motor with a cheesy little plastic ring that's SUPPOSED to thread on to the motor. Good luck.  The hardest part of the assembly is putting the front part of the cage fan on. It is designed to be SO flimsy it can be deformed enough to snap into the rear of the cage.Once it's all assembled and you turn it on, it is pretty loud for the amount of air it moves. On it's lowest setting it's louder than my 20\" Wind Machine on high. I'm not returning it, but I wouldn't but another nor would I recommend you buy one. In fact, I'd recommend a 20\" Wind Machine for $20 more. Yeah, I know. $20, but SO much better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693785600000}

{"reviewTitle":"On high it blows like you\u2019re out on a boat! But\u2026","reviewDescription":"I gave it 3 stars only because it really is cheaply made. It\u2019s all plastic and if tipped over, I know something will break. That said.., it had a pretty wide and heavy base so there is that. I bought 3 black ones recently and a white one last week. out of the three black colored ones, one came broken so I called for a replacement with no issues. Both colors are the same fan just color difference. I use my AC and then put these around the house to circulate the air. Trust me when I say that they 100% move the air on high!I\u2019ve bought other fans in the past and even on the highest setting\u2026 it was like nothing. If you want whisper quiet, this isn\u2019t for you. I personally like the noise of the fan when I sleep. It\u2019s white noise to me.5 stars for air flow.3 stars for the fact that it is cheaply made and I hope it doesn\u2019t get knocked over. So far, I love it.I added a video of it on high. It really does blow the air hard enough that it sounds like you\u2019re outside on a boat or driving with your car windows down on the highway. I\u2019d get another for sure if needed in the future. Lasko so far is the most powerful fan I\u2019ve had.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687996800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Easy assembly, powerful and loud but has an annoying sound","reviewDescription":"It took me no more than 5 minutes to assemble the fan. It has a good standing height and the power it has is great. The fan is very loud which I like but if I put it on the highest setting it is way too loud. I keep it on the medium setting and its perfect especially if you like that fan sound when you go to sleep like me. Only concern was that the wire is a bit short so you can\u2019t really move it more than 6 feet away from the outlet but thats not too big of an issue. My last Lasko fan lasted over 10 years so I hope this one does just as well.Edit - demoted down to 3 stars from the original 4 because I noticed that when I have the fan on the highest setting it makes this really annoying sound like its not strong enough to manage the fan speed. Its this ticking pattern thats woken me up 2 days in a row. I thought I was going crazy but realized the sound would go away if I put the fan onto a lower speed. Still a good fan but could be better","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691366400000}
