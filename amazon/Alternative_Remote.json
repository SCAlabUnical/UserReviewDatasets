Accidentally spilled hot chocolate all over the controller one night and immediately putting it in rice for days did zilch.Downloading an app like Smart Things irked me as to why they need so much access to my personal info. \ud83d\udc4eSearch results offered a bunch of uncertain knockoffs asking an insane $80-$130 for an identical remote that\u2019s made in China. But that working wasn\u2019t even a sure thing? Nope, didn\u2019t appeal to my sensibility.Then comes this baby. Legit reviews convinced me enough to try it. Tada! It was like magic, it worked straight out of the box right after inserting new batts and without pairing. All the buttons like Netflix and Prime Video work nice. Escape road to TV heaven reopened. \ud83e\udd73The controller is a bit thicker due to needing batteries. I\u2019m fine with it not being solar\/usb rechargeable.(Someone mentioned being unable to open the back to insert batteries\u2014 it\u2019s a one piece unibody design so the entire backside has to come off. Maybe they were looking for a small little panel to remove?) \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fHappy.\u2014UPDATE\u2014Docking a star because the circular directional pad started feeling super sticky within a week. Must push down rather hard to get things moving. Sometimes the reaction is delayed a bit so I end up scrolling too far. :( Also the tactile feeling of pressing up, down, left or right isn\u2019t there anymore. Not sure what happened to make it feel this way suddenly, like I spilled hot choco on it again.

The buttons only work about 25% of the time so you have to repeatedly push them to do anything. This is paired with a delayed response time so often you push the button several times and nothing is happening but then it all happens at once. This is especially annoying because it frequently leads to opening the wrong app. The volume and channel buttons are a notch above worthless. You have to fight with it to get it to change the volume and when it finally does budge it frequently gets stuck turning the tv volume all the down or (my favorite) all the way up. This is wonderful during the babies nap time. This remote is better than not having a remote at all but just barely.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1674259200000}

I still have it but it is way to much of a hassle to send it back to amazon, get a refund, and so on, thus I just threw the darn thing out.  I am definitely much more skiddish when it comes to buying electronic products from Amazon.  I do NOT think there is any kind of quality control. I would also imagine that some robot grabs it from a shelf and then takes it somewhere for packaging and distribution.  Amazon is really going down hill fast.  Amazon used to send you paperwork for returning a product hassle free and you could use the box and packaging it came with to send your product back to Amazon with little or no hassle.  However, Amazon is making it more and more of a hassle to return a product.  In other words, they better get it right the first time or your screwed....If the buttons worked properly and it would have been much easier to return the product I probably would have done that.  Heck, your lucky to get a package inventory\/receipt in the box any more.  Come on Amazon, you should not take your customers for granted.

I thought since it said universal I'd be able to add my Samsung receiver.So again if you just need a remote for your TV functions it's a great deal. All the buttons work well even the Netflix and Prime buttons. You will have to point it directly at the TV also which most people are going to do anyway.

The right arrow in the round arrow selector keypad on our old original Samsung remote had failed working, so the search for a new remote was ON! We settled on this one as it looked outwardly 94% identical except for the shortcut buttons to Netflix and Amazon at the bottom row of the keypad.The remote feels solid and the button action is good.Short version: Plug in a pair of AA batteries and you are back up and running instantaneously!

This remote will make you LONG FOR THE RELEASE THAT DEATH WILL BRING before you are able to do these things. Sure, on\/off is easy. But that bar that has a plus at one end and a carrot at the other? Press the plus sign and it MUTES the tv. Press it again and JUST FOR A NANOSECOND the volume control comes onscreen before vanishing. You will never see it again. Press it again and sometimes a bar with 1 through 9 appears on your screen but the numbers are meaningless, they are not related to volume, or for that matter, to anything at all. You will search on the Samsung website for a remote control guide and when you find it, you will read a childish description of how to press a button up or down to make your volume increase or decrease. BUT IT WILL NOT SHOW YOU THE BUTTON IT IS DESCRIBING. You will hunt through user groups for hours before finally learning that the video control button also controls volume IF YOU PRESS IT NORTH OR SOUTH. That's correct. A tiny button that was made to pressed by a Korean child's fingers has to be pressed at the top or the bottom to control volume.I HATE THIS REMOTE SO MUCH IT COURSES THROUGH.

{"reviewTitle":"Many of the buttons do not work+no microphone button!","reviewDescription":"The buttons for Netflix, Amazon, etc and the multi-colored dots that control A\/B\/C\/D for other tv functions for the smart tv do NOT work. And there is NO microphone button.If I had to do it again, I would shell out a few extra dollars for the real brand that is compatible with my smart tv and ALL the buttons work. It\u2019s just ok for channels and volume -  that.is.it. Hence the two star rating. It\u2019s pretty much junk compared with the real remote.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1648771200000}

However, this thing has been bugging me for quite a while. Doesn\u2019t always register the button you have pressed. I press 2-3 times & wave it around A LOT. Had it at least a year & I decided life is too short. Amazon has a genuine remote for my TV so I just ordered it. Isn\u2019t much more than this was.

{"reviewTitle":"Buttons are VERY HARD to click","reviewDescription":"Overall, the remote functions well, but the buttons require substantial force to operate.

{"reviewTitle":"Perfect samsung tv remote replacement","reviewDescription":"UPDATE year later: unfortunately the volume button is weak plastic and sticking at times.  All the buttons are unreliable often pressing a number of times until the channels change or app selections onscreen move.  The aftermarket quality shows its true colors a year later.  I originally had the positive post below.We have a 55\u201d Samsung 4K UHD Flatscreen TV that still works fine since 2016.  The original Samsung remote\u2019s buttons started to act up and either was delayed in raising the volume or turning on\/off.  This was after a couple of new batteries switched out.  So we figured it wasn't the batteries.Anyway long story short, right off the package - this new remote worked as advertised!  Its not a generic model but it responds just as a new Samsung remote.  I also like that you can feel some buttons more since there are rubber surface buttons, unlike the original.  My only CON would be that the up buttons for volume and channel are stiff compared to original.  For example, I have to dig in with my fingers a bit to activate volume up or channel up.  Overall, it does what it supposed to do.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658102400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Works but very difficult","reviewDescription":"I like that it works right out of the box, initially a pretty easy set up\/pairing with the tv. Eventually, every time I power the tv on, something pops up on the screen saying I have to pair the remote by pressing pause\/play & back arrow buttons. Every. Single. Time.Minor issue is the \u201cquick\u201d button at the bottom, rakeu tv, does not work (my original remote had Hulu). If I accidentally press it, tv says that it\u2019s not an app available in my country so not for USA customers.My other majorly frustrating issue is that I have to push some buttons so hard just to get it to function. I did have a similar pairing issue with another non-Samsung remote but not as frequent. Trying another brand remote because I just can\u2019t stand putting up with these frustrations any more!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1683072000000}
