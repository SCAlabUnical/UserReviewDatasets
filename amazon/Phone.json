It's light enough to handle, not heavy. I bought a smaller 1800+ dryer that is twice as powerful. I will keep this one as a spare.

{"reviewTitle":"Functional, but...","reviewDescription":"I've never really disliked a hairdryer before, but this one fails on two points. First, the ergonomics seem off--it is not especially comfortable to hold, especially if you've got arthritic hands. The control buttons are awkwardly placed, so there are a lot of unintentional power changes because it's easy to tap the wrong button while gripping the handle. Second, the cord is very short--if your outlet is not very close to the mirror you're using, the cord length is going to be a problem. This has been one of my go-to hairdryer brands for many years, so I'm disappointed that this model is sort of a diva to work with. The airflow and temperature levels are normal, but the devil is in the details on this one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691366400000}

There\u2019s enough power to dry my long hair quickly but not cook the shine out of it. So perhaps the ceramic does make a difference? It\u2019s lightweight & easy to store. Now my negatives are-  the controls are right where I naturally hold the dryer so I\u2019ve accidentally turned it off or down mid-dry. But I\u2019ll train myself to grasp under the nozzle the way many stylists do. The biggest issue (that I pbly should\u2019ve returned it for) was that cord is ridiculously short! Fire the person who thought a stubby cord was a good idea! Luckily I have a small bathroom with the plug next to the mirror so if I don\u2019t take any steps, I\u2019m ok, but when I bend over to dry the roots & under layer of hair, I have to be very careful or the cord yanks the plug.

{"reviewTitle":"Blows Just Right","reviewDescription":"The power cord is 52\" long between strain relievers.  This shorter-than-usual cord is just right for me, as there's less \"cord dangle\" to snag and get hung up on bathroom cabinetry handles -- an everyday annoyance with my old blow dryer's  6-foot cord. The plug-in end of the Conair cord has a petite ground fault interrupt protector with a polarized plug. There's also a this-has-got-to-go warning label glued to the cord with caution statements about \"do not use this appliance near the bathtub,\" and \"do not remove this tag.\"The rocker switches that control the blower motor and air temperature seem easier to use than slide switches. They're smooth operating, and provide a definitive feel when switching between settings. The dryer is relatively quiet at low-volume air flow. It's louder but not completely obnoxious on the high setting. The temperature control (cool, warm, hot) provides a nice, useful temperature range. Even the cool setting has a little warmth to it, but there's also a blue snowflake button that, when pressed and held, disables the heating coils. Style a curl or wave with a brush or comb, and use this blue button for a few seconds to set the style into your hair.My previous hair dryer (a Sassoon 1875 watt) failed after 20+ years of almost daily use. Although it pained me to give up that old dryer, considering the lifespan of an appliance like this, the cost of ownership is a mere fraction of a cent per day.

I own a Conair 1875 blow dryer for over 20 years and loved the product. So I finally bought one for my teenage daughter for Christmas 2022! At 94 days of purchase the \"Indicator light\" came on, the warning manual says if this light comes on stop use immediately and contact a service center. Being I just purchased this for Christmas 3 months ago I went to Amazon. The warranty says good for 90 days (I was at 94 days, grrr). SO I called Conair. The women that helped me from Conair was WONDERFUL! She spoke perfect English, was helpful and Kind! Didn't question it being over 90 days, and set me up with a replacement right away! I am in the process of receiving that replacement now! I had to cut the cord and sent in photos, but they are sending me a new one!

But it dries impressively well, and my hair doesn't feel like it's getting fried.And after the Jinri, I really appreciate the no-nonsense layout of the rocker switches.  Our last unit required the switches to be \"centered\" in order to turn it off, which was always a nuisance.

My wife likes it, though, so I gave it to her.  I'll spend a little more next time and get something more powerful.

{"reviewTitle":"White paint is flaking off","reviewDescription":"Functionally the hair dryer is excellent.  Unfortunately shortly after purchase, the white paint or coating began to flake off.  I first noticed the flakes sticking to my hand after using the dryer.  I found that I had to wash my hands to remove them.  I tried cleaning and scrubbing the dryer, but to no avail. The more I scrubbed, the more flakes appeared. With the concern of environmental microplastics which can be non-biodegradable, I didn't want to risk exposure.  I simply replaced it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1684886400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not quite good enough","reviewDescription":"I had been using a Conair hair dryer (the orange one) that had worked great for years. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the color, though, so when it finally gave out, I selected another Conair of equal power (1875 watts). This one does the job, but the motor sounds a bit tinny, and the cool down button isn\u2019t really cool air. It\u2019s less warm, but because it\u2019s not cool, it doesn\u2019t \u201cset\u201d the curve or smooth effect I\u2019m trying to achieve. I\u2019ve had the dryer for several months, and I  think I\u2019m finally going to try something else, probably Conair again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712188800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Settings work good","reviewDescription":"I read all the reviews on this before purchasing but wanted this 1875 model as it is similar to previous model which is still working fine. I just needed a concentrator and must have lost it as I never used a concentrator previously. After reading so many reviews of basically all hair dryers shorting out, burning up, etc., decided to go with the cheapest one lol. The finish is a very matte finish yet people complained that it chips off. Not sure if they changed the finish but it is not shiny. We will see. Having said that, had seen a video that shows finish getting scratched and she determined (and showed) how it was the metal prongs on the plug that scratches it. I will be careful in storing it in a way where the plug isn't rubbing on the dryer. I do hope it doesn't start to flake as that would be so annoying. What I like about dryer:- Lightweight.  I find it very light and easy to hold. I have RA so that is important to me.- All control settings seem to work well. The cool setting is actually cool. Cool shot works well also.  For my thin blonde hair, low and warm will work well, with occasionally medium speed blowing.  Not sure why some said it does not get hot. The hot on mine is hot! Too hot for my hair.What I don't like:- I do think they shortened the cord a little although I didn't measure. It still works for me as my outlet is  counter height.- It is not super noisy and is quieter than my previous one.- My hair is smooth after drying with a natural bristled brush.For me the price of $20 was worth it since reviews of all price ranged dryers seemed to have issues. Overall I do think Conair's quality has decreased a bit, as has everything else. At the same time I've used this brand all of my life so safest bet for me. I will update if any real issues arise.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"77 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673136000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Less heat and less air forced through equals quieter","reviewDescription":"I just used this hair dryer for the first time this morning.  The buttons on my old one stopped working so I had to replace it.  I chose this one based on its price.  Bargain priced for sure.  First impressions:1. It has less intense heat than my old one.  I used the highest setting and it didn't feel hot.  Not cold either but you could definitely feel the heat with my old dryer.2. The cord is shorter than my old one.  Not a major problem for me but if you need a long cord, this may not be for you.3. The amount of air forced through for drying didn't seem to be as great as my old one either.That being said, there was NO DIFFERENCE IN DRY TIME BETWEEN old and new dryers.  That was weird.  I thought that with less air, it might take longer, but it didn't.  You should know I have fine hair that dries easily anyway.Furthermore, IT IS MUCH QUIETER than the old one.  This is a BIG DEAL to me.  I had originally searched for the quietest hair dryers out there but they were all quite pricey.  This one is much quieter than expected so I feel like I have a win on my hands here.  I would say the sound is still slightly higher pitched than ideal, but I think I'll disturb the rest of the house less with this one.You will see people comment about the finish and that it will flake off.  Can confirm that it will probably happen.  It happened with my old hair dryer too which had the same matte finish coat.  But I'm the only one who uses it so I don't care too much if the finish eventually flakes.Overall, I would recommend this hair dryer.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"61 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1681171200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Good dryer but needs a re-design","reviewDescription":"I like this dryer very much - dries well, hot enough and fairly lightweight. My only problem is with the design of the switches - they are rocker switches and are placed on the handle exactly where your thumb goes when holding it. I find myself turning it off or lowering the heat without meaning to. I'm trying to train myself to place my thumb on the heat setting set on high to keep in place. Conair - either change these to sliding switches or move them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709164800000}
