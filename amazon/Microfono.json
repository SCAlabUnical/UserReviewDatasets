{"reviewTitle":"Great Price, Great Quality, Little Drawback","reviewDescription":"I record a lot of voice over work for various projects, and I needed a mic that was able to adapt to any situation I had. With the four different settings and easy to alter gain, I found it simple to get high quality recordings with less setup and effort. Although this is a great mic, there are minor drawbacks to it here and there. I will try my best to cover everything informatively.Pros:+ USB Mic+ Gain Knob+ 1-to-1 audio feedback+ Works with common mic stands+ 4 different recording settings+ Heavy metal mount included+ Great Customer SupportCons:+ Mic is a bit heavy+ USB 2.0+ Slightly Awkward lengthFor the most part, theworks like a champ. Able to record quality audio under a multitude of situations. There are a lot of little touches that make it worth the extra bit you pay compared to the. The quality far outweighs the price you pay, especially for a USB mic. I have primarily stuck to using twofor the past few years and upon getting the Yeti have only run into a few specific moments where using the MXL's is a better choice.One of the noticeable parts of this mic is how reliable it looks. The metal cover, the well painted black coat and the firm weight. It is worth mentioning that the mic itself does weigh a little bit heavier than normal mics, though if you have a decent mic stand (or use the one it comes with) you shouldn't have any issues. In terms of audio quality, it is fairly high for the price you pay. I've had my experience with bad USB mics before, but the Yeti is solid. It doesn't pickup any noise from the USB, it is great at picking up high or low voices as well. It will take some trial and error, but once you get the correct gain level set you will find yourself enamored with how well you sound.I purchased aand I highly recommend doing so if you plan to do solo recordings. The yeti is very sensitive and can easily pick up background noises if your gain is too high, but it can also pick up blowing into the mic even better (a problem for those of us who have a lisp). It's not much of a complaint, as almost any mic responds the same in the given situation, just a pro tip.I found that the knobs are really durable and smooth to move. My only complaint is that the knobs on the back for the gain and the input setting are the same type, so I often have to take a second to make sure I am not changing the wrong one. Minute complaint, but wish the mic input knob was the same type as the headphone volume knob. The mute button feels a bit flimsy, but with how rarely you'll likely push it, I doubt it will start falling off anytime soon (unless you brute mash it every time).I included the picture of the box in the review, which outlines the different settings the mic has, but let me explain them a bit more:- Cardioid: Perfect for doing solo recordings, it comes in crisp and clear, with almost little gain necessary.- Bidirectional: Perfect for duo recordings. One person sits on either side of the mic and basically talks face to face.- Omnidirectional: Perfect for conference recordings. It records in every direction, but the quality of the audio is lower significantly to focus on picking up any and every noise possible within a given radius.- Stereo: Perfect for Group Calls. It records in front, left, and right of the mic. It is great when recording multiple people in a skype call as the audio coming from behind the mic isn't getting picked up.When I first got the mic I realized that the majority of my computers have USB 3.0 slots on them, so heading over to their website, I checked to see if the mic would perform well on usb 3.0. At the moment there are instances where the mic will not work properly over USB 3.0, but it is a hit or miss situation. It is a shame that the mic doesn't 100% support USB 3.0, but this problem can usually be rectified with a powered USB 2.0 hub. The website itself also has a great amount of support documents for those with questions regarding the device. Highly recommended for first time microphone users.overall, if you are in the market for a new microphone, I highly recommend checking out the Blue Yeti. It has great quality, for a great price with little drawback.** I also use this Microphone with my PS4 and my Elgato, and it works perfectly fine. I haven't run into any issues with either so far. Again it takes a bit of time to setup the gain properly, but once it is set, you sound better than everyone else! **","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"29 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1438992000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Excellent product & sound, but the included cable isn't great","reviewDescription":"I was nervous about dropping 100 bucks on a mic but I'm (almost) completely satisfied.Compared to my basic mics (lavalier and built-in webcam) there's obviously no comparison lol. I make short videos and the Blue Yeti has really upped my game. The quality is actually better than what I expected at this price range.The ONLY issue I have is with the included cable, which connects from the bottom of the mic to my PC. This cable is not 100% reliable or solid. There are times when I am livestreaming and if I simply nudge the bottom of this cable, the entire sound goes out. It's incredibly annoying.Aside from that, I'm pretty happy. This mic is plug and play. I used it right out of the box.

{"reviewTitle":"Great mic, but expect a small amount of feedback.","reviewDescription":"So, I got my hands on the Blue Yeti Mic a while ago, it's been great for my recording and streaming setup. The audio quality is mostly fantastic (has some slight feedback issues.) Whether I'm recording vocals, streaming games, or podcasting, this microphone delivers amazing sound that makes me feel like a pro.I love the fact that it's so easy to set up and use. It's a simple plug-and-play setup, so I didn't have to mess around with any complicated installations or extra equipment. Just plug it into my computer, and I'm good to go. Plus, the sleek and stylish blackout design adds to my setup.The Blue Yeti offers four different pickup patterns, which is a big plus. It's versatile enough to handle any situation. Whether I want to focus on my own voice, capture the whole room, conduct interviews, or even record in stereo, this microphone has got me covered.Now, there is one small thing worth mentioning. I did experience a bit of a feedback issue when using the microphone at higher volume levels. It's not a deal-breaker for me, but it would have been nice if the microphone handled those levels a bit better. It's something to keep in mind if you tend to crank up the volume.The microphone is a solid choice for anyone looking to up their recording or streaming game. The sound quality is great, and the flexibility of the pickup patterns is a huge plus. Just be mindful of the feedback at higher volume levels. That being said, I highly recommend giving this microphone a try!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"42 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1685577600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great While It Lasts...","reviewDescription":"Hi!I rarely do reviews on Amazon, but I felt this product needed one as after only a year (maybe a little less all-in-all), the mic stopped working. And customer service has not followed through with the replacement they promised.When it still worked, I used my mic for business - Skype calls, Webinars, and gaming. Then one day it just stopped working. There was no red light (below mute) and my computer did not even recognize that the Yeti was plugged in. So, I did some research and here is what I was able to confirm about the mic:- The port is not the issue: I tried several other USB ports on my computer (both in the front and back), all of which worked with other devices, but not the Yeti (I also tried plugging it in to our other two computers, but no success);- The cord is not the issue: I tried four back-ups that I had for other devices, all of which worked with other devices, but not the Yeti; and- There are no external defects with the mic that I can see (it's still as beautiful as the first day I got it!).So, what that leaves is an internal issue with the mic, which is why I touched base with Blue about it, because I like Blue, and had heard their customer service was good. And at first, they were good - they asked for various confirmations that I owned the mic, which of course I gave them. Then I didn't hear back. Hmm, I thought, that's weird.So I forwarded their former email asking for my confirmations, and suddenly they responded, telling me it was covered by warranty and that a replacement would be sent. However, they noted, there was an inventory count and transaction freeze, so they would be unable to ship orders for 3-5 weeks. I said no problem, because like I said, I like Blue. I bet you can guess what happened next.A confirmation email never came (they said one would, but it didn't), so I went ahead and contacted them after allowing an extra couple of weeks because hey, they said there was an inventory count and transaction freeze, and maybe it was taking longer than they anticipated. I am not in manufacturing, so what do I know?They have not returned that contact, which I would like to point out, was very respectful and understanding, as I have been all along, and as I will continue doing, because I have worked in customer service before and I know how difficult it can be. But as I said when I started writing this review - this mic is for business - and I have lost time and revenue because I have had to use a back-up that presented its own host of problems.So, TL;DR - if you want a mic that is great, but may only last for a year or less, then this is the perfect mic for you! If - for a price > $100 - you want a mic that lasts longer than a year, go elsewhere. There are many mics in this price range that are great for business and gaming that I would have rather had (and may be forced to buy soon) if I had known my Yeti would only last a year or less.Hope this helps!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"48 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1570752000000}
{"reviewTitle":"\"USB Device Not Recognized\"","reviewDescription":"I'm pretty sure it was more than a hundred times that I had seen this message pop up on the right-hand corner of my computer screen and it took so much willpower to not put my fist through my monitor. After getting this message so many times, I looked on Youtube for any related issues that I was having with this device. One of them was that the USB cord that came with the microphone was really bad and that it would be best to buy another one at your nearest electronics store. So I go to Best Buy, spend about $5 dollars on a new cord, got home with high hopes that this would resolve this annoying little issue so I could start streaming with my awesome looking microphone. And what's the next thing I see as soon as I plug in the cord to the mic? \"USB device not recognized\". I unplug and re-plug the newly bought cord just to break it in and adjust it to the mic, but nope! I kept getting the same message that Satan himself would've sent if he had been working at Geek Squad!Despite being really pissed up to this point, I decide to look for further solutions and not give up hope. So I go to the main website from where this product was made and I've got to say that it was a lot harder than it should've been to find what I needed, or better to phrase it CLOSE to what I needed. So I finally come across this page where I could download a driver that was compatible with this mic. Despite the fact that this product was clearly supposed to be a \"plug in and play\" where you didn't need to download anything for it, I was pretty desperate at this point so I go ahead and download the file to the driver. Everything is going well at first and my hopes are finally starting to go up again, until I get to a bit where it says that I needed to synch the device so that the driver could read it. So I plug in the mic, get the same \"USB device not recognized\" message again, which at this point was the equivalent of someone giving you the finger for your torment, but I didn't care because things were starting to look up. I hit the \"Next -->\" button and think \"It's going to work this time. Finally!\" And what do you think happens next?In red letters, the file, \"Make sure the device is properly plugged in to continue the download\". It went something like that, I'm not sure what it said word to word because at that point everything started going red through my vision and it took a good amount of pillow punching to finally calm down. I'll say that I was lucky enough to have bought this product during Cyber Monday so I didn't have a lot to worry about of how much money I would've lost, but luckily and thankfully I was able to get a full refund for my troubles. So to save another poor soul from having to go through this experience, I would say stay away! For those of you who have miraculously been blessed with a mic that works as it is advertised, well, I really hope you enjoy your product. I really do.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1481760000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Stay Away From Blue Mics","reviewDescription":"I would give it zero stars, but I had to pick something to leave this review. I am absolutely livid over this product. DO NOT BUY THIS MICROPHONE!!!!!! I had my first Blue Yeti mic for 1.5 months exactly. One day randomly, my Mac stopped recognizing Blue Yeti as Yeti Stereo Microphone and instead started recognizing it as USB Advanced Audio Device instead. There are a ton of posts in the Apple community forums and online about this issue with no resolution from Blue what so ever and no resolutions online period. This difference in recognition severely altered the quality of the mic. I contacted Blue Mics on 1-1-2016. No response. I emailed again on 1-6-2016. No response. I even posted in their Facebook page and they never responded. On 1-10-2016 I called them about my problem to which they offered some troubleshooting tips. On 1-14-2016, 2 weeks after my first attempt at getting someone to talk to me I received an email response with the same troubleshooting tips. According to Blue, the Blue Yeti contains firmware inside the mic so when you plug it into your USB the computer recognizes the firmware and adjusts settings accordingly. That's how you get the quality sound. These specific settings cannot be altered manually. I've have researched independently and wasted more time on this product than I should have with this issue when Blue should have taken care of it. I tried their troubleshooting items, but they did not work. I purchased this item from Amazon and only had until 1-31-2016 to request a replacement so on 1-16-2016 I responded to their email asking what to do next if anything. To this date, 1-25-2016, I still have not gotten a response. I went ahead and returned the mic and received a replacement from Amazon today. Fresh out of the box I plugged it into my Mac and the same exact thing happened!!!!! The recognition happens no matter what computer I plug it into. It simply doesn't recognize the firmware in the mic. I plan to return this item for a full refund. I will be calling Blue tomorrow to hear what excuse they have for not responding to my email. Their website states that they will respond to emails within 48 hours. My first email went 2 weeks before I got a response. My second is going on over a week and still no response. Apparently they don't know what 48 hours is and they need a clock.

Now, let me preface this with the fact that I suspect I received a defective product. There are a couple issues with this however:1) I have troubleshooted the product extensively, and the sheer number of issues that people have had with this product in trying to produce decent quality sound make it difficult to determine if my product is faulty or if I am just experiencing one of the myriad problems it has.2) I have been waiting about 2 weeks for any kind of response on the official Blue website for any kind of help troubleshooting my Yeti. I'm not sure what kind of customer service staff they have available, or how behind they are on requests. At this point though, I am unsure how long of a wait I should expect as there has been zero feedback.Pros:- This is a heavy mic, it really feels like you're pulling a professional recording device.- Comes with a very sturdy desk stand (although it's recommended to mount on an arm or boom stand which is separate).- Seems to have great audio when I've listened to folks recording YouTube videos.- Has an easy to use knob on the back of the mic to adjust the recording angle of the mic.- Another knob on the back to adjust gain on the fly.- Easy to access mute switch on the front of the mic to mute in a flash.Cons:- Not a device you just plug and play (unless you really luck out). There are a lot of tweaks that need to be made to avoid feedback and make sure your sound is crystal clear.- I didn't experience issues with this, but people report often that this picks up excessive sound from their recording space (expected, it's a powerful mic).- Customer service for this product seems non-existent.I hope to eventually replace this device with another Yeti that works so I can write a proper review.

{"reviewTitle":"Great mic until it breaks","reviewDescription":"The mic is great. But after 3 years of very limited use, it started not connecting to the computer when plugged in. I took it to an AV specialist since it was long outside the Amazon return window- and they pointed out where the USB (P\/N) port on the bottom of the mic itself was deformed so the cable was no longer making a secure fit. Given that the mic sits in the same place all the time, I'm not sure why the wear & tear other than a manufacturing defect that just got worse over time.... For over $100 purchasing price - I hope for better quality and something that could last much longer.

{"reviewTitle":"Experienced engineer - Found this mic to be middling, literally and figuratively.","reviewDescription":"I've been doing semi-pro audio recording and building and using mic chains since the early 90s, used a lot of mics--AT, Neumann, etc. My ATR2100 USB I use for Zoom developed a dumb short (design fault probably) pretty early on so I decided to give this mic a shot because it was popular.This mic lacks bass and presence, in comparison. It distorts easier on transients and plosives than the ATR. I am not expecting perfection out of either since USB is probably not an optimal input connection and more importantly because these mics are not connected to dedicated preamps or compressors, but the Yeti sounds about as good as a Shure SM57, probably a little worse.It's not a terrible mic but I did shootouts with both the ATR as well as the Realtek onboard mic on my wife's Razer laptop, and she passed on this mic because it required proximity (due to cardioid pattern) just to even sound as good as the onboard sound on the razer.It's a little \"hotter\" than onboard sound so if you want the ability to be louder by moving closer or messing with the mic pattern, this can help--but the gain volume is not especially good sounding and it distorts on peaks more easily than onboard sound and the ATR.Testing this mic convinced me to stick with Audio Technica for USB mics. It's cool that it has a little monster mascot and what not but IMO it seems like a lot of people are getting caught up in branding instead of talking to audio engineers, or else Amazon still has an astroturfing problem. If Neumann made a USB mic I'd have that because I am a Neumann devotee, but they do not and I am too lazy to figure out a way to adapt my AD converter to USB, just for dayjob audio.I will keep it as a backup since I hate dealing with returns, but I am not super impressed with it and I wish I would have spent the money on the ATR2500 instead. So this review is my pound of flesh for the wasted cash.If you don't believe me, take a look at the response pattern overlay I attached. Having a relatively flat mic response is good for situations where you are expecting to add sheen and bass (essentially loudness) via compression and EQ, but this is a USB mic, not a studio mic, and there is no mic chain phase, so I don't know why a flat mic that sounds like an instrument mic would be a good thing for this application.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1617408000000}

When it finally died, I picked up a Yeti to replace it. Well, there's a HUGE difference between the two. The Snowball was great about not picking up ambient sounds, but he Yeti picks up everything, even with a single direction pickup chosen. Any taps on the desk, the keyboard, a chair squeak, or moderate traffic outdoors...this mic picks it up.The sound quality is great, but it's a real shame that this thing draws in so much outside noise. For gaming it's totally fine, but if you're producing podcasts or video, this is going to cause you serious headaches in editing.

{"reviewTitle":"Gorgeous mic with terrible drivers but decent recording capabilities?","reviewDescription":"Now before I get into details, I want to point out that I've owned this mic twice. Once in 2010, when I was still relatively ignorant in the ways of recording, and now in 2015. I'm able to notice things now that I wasn't able to notice then, and the biggest thing I'd like to point out is that this not the best mic for creating quality music. Sure, it sounds decent, but you shouldn't record music at 16-bit quality (the quality this mic outputs) unless it's live, a demo, or some other semi-professional application. IF you're looking for a place to start however, the Blue Yeti is great.I purchased the mic with basic demo recording and mix practicing in mind. I plan to get a better condensor (probably another Blue) over time.Build quality: It's a solid build, featuring one of the finest designs I've ever seen. It's bulk basically prohibits you from using it in a mobile setup, but it is right at home on a desk workstation or living room table. My only nag is that it doesn't come with a pop filter (easily obtained and cheap) or a shockmount. There are alternative shockmounts out there, with the best one that will fit a Yeti being above 50$. The size makes it hard to find a suitable mount, but there are alternatives to decouple your mic otherwise (possibly with foam?). The Blackout edition is gorgeous, matches my studio setup nicely. 4\/5 STARSInstallation\/Drivers: USB Mics are trouble, no matter what you get. But this is among the worst software troubles I have ever seen. I like to record and mix all at once, but it seems that to get the Yeti to cooperate with ASIO drivers, you're going to be jumping through many hoops. I use Studio One Artist as my main Recording DAW, and I have yet to find a way to properly listen to my recordings through my speakers with no troubles. The woes of a USB mic, I suppose. Don't expect too much from this mic in the way of ease. 2\/5 STARSSound quality: 16 bit quality recording. Great for podcasting, videos, etc. NOT recommended for professional audio recording by any stretch. If you're looking for a good audio recording setup, buy an Audio Interface and Mic separate. For 130$ you cannot beat this as a complete solution, but even a SM58+Scarlett setup is recommended over this (for double the price of course). BUT to reiterate, this makes a great mic for simple podcasts and what not. 4\/5 STARSOverall: I love to look at it, hate to install it, like to record with it. It's not the best mic, nor would you spend 130$ looking for the best mic. But for what it is, you can't beat it. Again, NOT recommended for professional audio recording.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1429920000000}

I was really hoping to be able to plug it in and use it as the mic while I had my wireless headset for audio out.I do also wish that it had some other connection options...

You get a company that makes an absolutely beautiful piece of art for a product, and throw in a trash USB cable that doesn't work. It barely works, has to be wiggled a lot while you keep your fingers crossed it stays in place, and then you have to pray it doesn't cut out in the middle of your recording. I almost returned the microphone because of that (in fact, it was obvious my microphone was opened carefully before me, and probably the person before me returned it). I researched what the issue was and many people online claimed the cable was trash, so I bought a new cable from Amazon (a simple Amazon Basics cable) and now the mic works perfectly without any loss in connection. I took 2 starts off because the cable literally killed the product for me, and I know I'm not the only one.

{"reviewTitle":"Sounds great, but buggy when used with iMac","reviewDescription":"The mic feels very well built, and the sound quality is excellent. (That said, it is VERY sensitive, so it does require careful positioning, gain tuning, and using with background noise suppression software to get the best out of it.)The biggest issues I have is its compatibility with iMac: the mic always stops working after iMac goes to sleep and wakes up. The USB device still shows in the OSX Sounds dialog correctly, but the audio level just won't move. The only way I found to resolve this is to unplug and plug the USB cable. Also, when used with Blue Sherpa app to control its gain and direct monitoring, the settings always get reset to default after the USB cable is unplugged. This means every time I wake up my iMac, I always need to unplug\/plug the USB cable and reset the gain\/direct monitoring to get the mic working properly. It's doable, but definitely an annoyance that can be avoided if Blue pays a bit more care into their OSX driver.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1617235200000}

It sounds the same, if not worse because it is not right up next to my mouth like the headset was.Also, the mute button does not work every time you press it and that is kind of important to me because I use voice-activation on teamspeak so I have to use a hotkey to mute since the mute button has to be pressed 2-3 times for it to actually mute. Also the red light is always on and it blinks when you mute, would be better design to be off all the time and be solid red when muted like most other headsets do that I have had this way it is 100% clear when it is muted.Overall I am not impressed and I do not understand why people use this for streaming\/podcast purposes when any headset mic has the same voice quality.

The microphone stand has a swivel to adjust for various angles that is very solidly built but if the microphone swings in the wrong direction it will hit (and can break) the connector.

I ordered a second one with the yeti caster and I couldn\u2019t even turn the volume knob, so I returned the whole kit (the boom is not very good either, very cheaply made). My original one broke a week ago (only four years old), so I ordered a new blackout one. The mute button is nicer, but the volume and gain knobs are terribly made and drag\/scrape inside the housing when you try to turn them making them harder to turn and an awful noise. How did getting bought by Logitech make these things worse? Looks like I\u2019ll be returning another one and buying something more expensive like a Rode or Shure, unfortunately. These just don\u2019t cut it from a quality perspective. Additionally, the base is poorly designed and basically can\u2019t be used if you\u2019re using a mouse and keyboard, unless you turn the gain way up at which point a feather falling off a bird three miles away will be picked up because condenser mics pick up everything when the gain is high, but it won\u2019t pick you up unless you crank it up and put it behind or beside your keyboard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1643414400000}

{"reviewTitle":"A sensitive, High-Quality Microphone","reviewDescription":"This microphone is good for anyone out there that needs better sound quality when it comes to commentary on a youtube gaming channel or your average talk show. When comparing this to a lot of microphones used in the news or on news stations, this was not that much different.First of all, this is a very sensitive microphone. My last microphone (the blue snowball) was able to get just my voice, but this microphone is so sensitive, it was able to hear someone talking in another room. So, make sure you use this microphone in a very quiet place.Second of all, I absolutely LOVE the construction of this microphone. It has a completely metal construction with a smooth finish. Making it heavy and harder to move around when you put it on a desk keeping it in place. It also came with a long cord that was able to reach my USB port. Which was a plus also. My only complaint about this microphone is that I was not able to get a clamp pop filter on it due to the type of hinges it used to keep the microphone in place.Thirdly, the settings are OK, but they really don't make much of a difference. For instance, omnidirectional and stereo pretty much capture the same range of sound. The only difference is that stereo focuses more a bit of a \"surround sound\" effect while omnidirectional makes everything feel like it is in the center. The cardiac mode is good for talking because you always sound like you are in the center which is nice, and the bi-directional mode is great for interviews when you would rather use a studio quality microphone instead of the lower quality shirt clip microphones.Overall, this is an excellent microphone for the price when it comes to the construction and the sound quality. Although, if you need a surround-sound or 3D surround sound microphone, you might want to look elsewhere.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1453334400000}

But there's dozens of reviews talking about the quality, there's no reason to go into that now.The issue I had was not with the microphone, but with the fulfillment process itself, hence knocking off a star. I ordered the microphone and received it in a couple of days, par for Amazon. However, the microphone I received was *clearly* used. (I did *not* order a used model). The most critical thing was a dent on the metal cage part (don't know the actual term). It was also missing the USB cable to operate the thing, as well as several of the washers to hold it in place on the stand. Not that the washers are super critical, but more evidence that someone else owned the device and sent it back without everything that it needs. The stand itself was very dusty, which again speaks to someone having used this device before, probably the stand sat on a shelf while the microphone was mounted to a boom-style stand.I don't quite know who to blame for this, but I expect it was on Amazon. They replaced the device right away without any fuss and the return process was easy. But the fact that the device got past your team with *physical damage* without a second thought is troubling.I would recommend you skip Amazon's site and purchase directly from Blue's website.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1618358400000}

{"reviewTitle":"I mostly recommend this mic.","reviewDescription":"A great mic that looks and sounds beautiful. I actually purchased this Blackout Edition Yeti to replace my original Yeti for no other reason than that I never liked the look of the standard all-silver version. This one sounds and performs exactly like the original with the exception of the controls: the mic gain and headphone volume knobs on this Blackout Edition mic are much harder to turn than were the ones on my original Yeti, and the mute button, while it operates much more quietly than the one on the original Yeti, does not always perform its function. Sometimes pressing the button mutes or unmutes the mic, and sometimes it doesn't. This is a nuisance and I haven't yet figured out a trick to make it work every time. I might wind up using Amazon's great return policy to exchange this for another mic in hopes the mute button on the new one will function reliably. Of these irksome issues, though, only the mute button bugs me very much, as I tend to find good settings for the mic gain and headphone volume knobs and just leave them there, while I use the mute button every time I use the mic. It's a nuisance to have to return stuff, but Amazon makes it as easy as possible, so I'll probably go that route.In all other respects - looks and sound, namely - the mic is excellent (and my Auphonix 4\" pop filter makes the sound just that much cleaner and more agreeable).Update: I did exchange the defective mic for a non-defective unit. Amazon\u2019s return\/exchange policy is the best in the business.

{"reviewTitle":"Good Mic, only 2 issues","reviewDescription":"I bought this mic to use while playing PS4 so I could record the game and voice audio while also being able to still hear the game in my headset and it works pretty well. It seems very well build and sturdy with quite a bit of weight to it, more so than what I was expecting with a mic but I like it. Quality of the sound that people hear from it is very good, I asked some people when I was playing with them and they said that they could tell a noticeable difference in the quality. That being said I do suggest getting a mudder mic cover or a pop filter just to help tune out some outside noise that you don't want being picked up. However there are some problems I have noticed one of which is minor and seems like a design oversight, the USB port is at the bottom of the mic which is great if you have the mic standing straight up but if you want it to go horizontal the metal frame hits the cord and wont fit through. A way around it is just unplugging it and going over the frame which I don't have a problem with but just seems like I shouldn't have to do that. My second problem which has happened a few times is the mute button, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I go to click it and it just doesn't register or it just unmutes randomly which is really annoying and the main reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1535500800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great microphone while it works.  Support nonexistent.","reviewDescription":"I've used Blue Snowball microphones for years (we have two in our house) and have been very pleased with their sound and overall quality.  When my 12-year-old son wanted to play around with game broadcasting and recording tech reviews, my goto was Blue.  I wanted him to have a Blue Yeti because it would provide more features and its size makes a bold statement.  The Blue Yeti did not disappoint--for the first year.  Around the one year point, he mentioned that it was picking up a high pitched whine.  I hit Blue's website seeking help.  We found their FAQ and followed the diagnostic instructions outlined, including trying with multiple PCs and iPhones in multiple locations.  Also tried several different USB cables.  Nothing resolved the issue.  For good measure, we used one of our Blue Snowballs to test the machine that where the Yeti originally exhibited the problem.  The Snowball worked great.  After all that, I reluctantly concluded it was a bad Yeti mic.  I was shocked because the Snowballs had been so reliable for so many years.I opened a support case with Blue via their support page on Dec 31, 2018.  Their system promptly sent me an email acknowledging the case and said that I should expect to hear something in 24-48 hours.  I chuckled a little, knowing that it would likely be a little longer since the case was opened on New Year's Eve.  I expected it to be at least a couple of days after New Years Day before I got a response.  Well, it's now Jan 19 and I'm still waiting to hear back.  I've pinged the case with a \"hello\" message to try to get it into someone's queue.  I've also pinged Blue's Twitter account.  Nothing.  I'm disappointed.  I thought Blue stood for quality and really expected that to include quality support.  I guess I was naive to believe that Blue was different from the no-name popup companies selling on Amazon.If you are dead set on Blue, I'd stick with the Blue Snowball if it meets your needs.  It has similar sound quality for the more narrow use cases it is designed for.  It's also half the price, so you're not out as much if it dies and you can't get support.I can't predict what my son's broadcasting future will be, but I'm pretty sure he won't be thinking very highly of Blue microphones based on this experience.So, the Blue Yeti is great, while it works.

{"reviewTitle":"Three dead or dying yeti in less than two years","reviewDescription":"The sound quality of the yeti and clarity is the best i've ever had in a microphone.  I've gone through several headset mics and a couple different stand alone ones such as this one.Yeti #1:  It worked for about a week.  The sound quality was great but the mute button seemed to take a few presses for it to turn on and off.  Quite often I would have to hold the yeti with both hands and press the mute firmly for it to work.  Then all of a sudden, It started to give shrill feedback OR buzzing whenever I was broadcasting to people...  I contacted customer support.  They told me it was probably a bad cable after I recorded some audio and sent it to them for a listen.  They offered to send another cable for me to try but since it was still within the RMA period AND the mute button was broken... I just sent it back to Amazon for a replacement.Yeti #2:  has worked now for more than a year.  The mute button is also just as messed up on this one (and has been since day 1) but no sound quality issues... until now.  The mic started to just stop recording randomly after hours in discord and give no output.  The only way to fix it is to unplug it and re plug it in.  Now it has started to give really weird buzzing noises and I have to play with it at least once a week to get it to start working again.  I am still using this mic until I get tired enough to go find a new one.Yeti #3:  Friend really liked the sound of my mic.(6 months ago)  So he bought one.  The mute button flat out just didn't work, out of the box... you can press it and get the blinking light to start (meaning it is muted) but it still broadcasts.  When you press it again and the light is solid (not muted), it broadcasts just the same.  But the sound quality was just fine and after hearing that both of my yeti had broken mute buttons, he just decided to mute in windows.  Fast forward several months.  One random day we jumped into discord and his mic sounded really off to me... none of the knobs on the back changed the audio quality AT ALL, cardiod, omni... and so on.  It all sounded the same.  I can hear everything going on in house... wife in the next room on the phone... his dog barking in the back yard.  I believe it is stuck on the omni sound pattern though who knows...I really liked the sound quality of this mic... when it worked.

I was sorely disappointed. The fact of the matter is, this mic is only slightly better than your run of the mill headset microphone (in fact, my five year old $40 Turtle Beach headset had a better mic than this PoS).Simply put, unless you are recording in a perfectly sound treated room with a 100% silent computer and no A\/C, you cannot use this microphone. Even with the gain on the lowest possible setting, it picks up the crickets outside my window. It picks up my neighbors (who are not connected to me) outside barbecuing. It picks up my computer, which is shocking because it's water cooled. It's incredibly quiet. So, the only time I could record was late at night, and even then I would have to run an EQ and Noise Reduction to get the crickets and PC noise out.Further, this is a condenser microphone, NOT a dynamic microphone. It picks up EVERYTHING about your voice, including heavy plosives and annoying saliva clicks. Even with a pop filter AND while speaking diagonally into the mic, it still could not filter out plosives and saliva clicks. I drank water until I was practically made of it, and I even tried the apple trick to get rid of saliva clicks. Nothing would work. This microphone is simply WAY too sensitive.On top of all that, the sound quality is just garbage. Even when running it through something like VoiceMeeter, it still just does not ever achieve a full sound.This mic is only popular because it looks cool and because it's heavy. That's it. It's complete garbage. Do yourself a favor and just save up about $700 or so over the course of several months and buy a Shure SM7B, a basic one-input interface, and a Cloudlifter.

I think it was about 1 month into having used the product.Long story short, I've all of a sudden started getting EXTREMELY LOW GAIN levels on this microphone.

I actually had to tone all the gains down and what not.On Audacity, I'm getting MAX -24dB when I'm 2 inches close to the microphone with all gains jacked up to 100%. Then it's just all noise and the waveform is super small.When I listen to myself on the Yeti (real-time, plugged into Yeti's own headphone jack) it\u2019s the same.I haven\u2019t dropped the hardware or done any physical damage. I mean it's been sitting on my desk the entire time, even unplugged \/ unpowered when not in use, so that nothing happened to my precious mic.What I'm sick of reading as potential solutions when I'm asking around are \"have you reinstalled the drivers\" and obvious Tech101 stuff like that. Yes, they're well intended, but I've gone as far as sniffing the USB packets sent to identify if there was any interference or if another driver that I may have installed on my Windows 10 machine was hijacking the packets and running a low pass filter or something. So yes, I'm beyond all the \"uninstall reinstall drivers, remove Realtek and try again, use another cable, try another jack, try another PC\" type of stuff. I'll be trying my luck tomorrow at the office with a Windows 7 PC, if I can still find one that's not upgraded to Windows 10..Closest I've gotten to any sort of useful discussion on the potential reason why it's failing is in this thread on the Microsoft forums where people are expressing similar problems with the AT2020, and a few with the Blue Yeti (not the Pro) and Blue Snowball.I'm getting closer to the point where I'll just accept that the product has gone kaput. I may have to ask for a replacement model, which is a pain, since I've ordered it from the US but I'm on the other side of the globe, let alone the replacement window being now gone since I got it at the Holiday Sale 2015.It's really sad.

However, with certain Asian brands making mics that compete with this on sound quality for a small fraction of the price it\u2019s hard to make the argument that the yeti is valuable In that sense.In summary, If I could go back in time and change my decision, I probably would.

If you have an unchanging set up and never take the cord out then it's probably great and will work fine forever. However if you need to be constantly moving cords around and changing things up then DO NOT buy this microphone.

Sound quality isn't better then the newer mic I had previous (which is much cheaper)  but the mic arm broke on me and I'd rather have a mic on a stand like this so it can be moved and isn't stuck where ever I mount it. This thing needs a pop filter as your P's will sound like a cap gun is being shot in range of the microphone. And it gets considerably more echo than my mic previously. However it's very good for YouTube channels that do voice coms and things on those lines,  wouldn't recommend for podcasts or singing \/ instruments because like I said the echo is awful so you really don't want it to be on anything other than then the 1 direction setting","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1482969600000}

It has been extremely helpful especially when doing group gaming with my friends.What I did not like about it though is the weight.

Allows you more control over your microphone such as realtime listening and 4 unique patterns.Cons: Form factor can be a challenge to get used to, especially when compared to other smaller, cheaper microphones like the Blue Snowball.

The microphone is compatible with most recording and streaming software, such as Audacity, OBS, Skype, and more.The microphone has four different pickup patterns: cardioid, omnidirectional, bidirectional, and stereo. You can switch between them by using the knob on the back of the microphone. Each pattern has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on what you want to record or stream. For example, cardioid is good for solo vocals or instruments, omnidirectional is good for capturing sound from all directions, bidirectional is good for interviews or duets, and stereo is good for creating a realistic sound image.The microphone also has onboard audio controls on the front of the microphone. You can adjust the headphone volume, mute the microphone, and change the mic gain by using the buttons and knobs. The microphone also has a 3.5 mm headphone jack that allows you to monitor your sound in real time without any latency.The microphone delivers clear, powerful, and broadcast-quality sound for any application. The microphone has a custom three-capsule array that produces rich and detailed sound with minimal distortion and noise. The microphone also supports Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to craft the perfect vocal sound and entertain your audience with enhanced effects, advanced modulation, and HD audio samples.

{"reviewTitle":"It's alright for content creation and gaming, but perfect for things like ASMR","reviewDescription":"I purchased this Blue Yeti a long time ago to give myself time to try it out, and also because I wanted both a mic for content creation and the possible hopes to start an ASMR channel (but that plan fell through), so here is my honest opinion.I create content online, stream, and game with friends in my free time; a Blue Yeti is super hard to get perfect settings to make sure the mic's sensitivity does not pick up everything like background noise, cars driving past, breathing, sounds from your mouth, etc. I have tried many filters through OBS, a pop filter, and a foam cover and never got it to sound right, but it is probably because my house is not soundproof and has thin walls. If you have a pretty good soundproof room and have good settings to make it sound good, a Blue Yeti is not bad for you, but if you don't; I recommend a condenser mic.But... if you do content like ASMR, a Blue Yeti is what you need. The sensitivity easily picks up whispers, breathing, and all different kinds of sounds. It also gives you the capability to do binaural audio for ear-to-ear action.So overall: the sound quality of a Blue Yeti is not bad, if you have god-tier settings and a good soundproof room, this mic won't pick up everything and can be great for content creation, but if you're looking to do ASMR content, this mic is perfect from how much sound it can pick up.

Most people don't like that and I was in the same camp until I used this.  Since there is no delay when you speak, it sounds natural.  There are two major advantages I find to this, one you can set the volume level to be the same as if you were talking without headphones on.  Second, it lets you know what your voice is doing, very useful if you're attempting to sing, voice act, or any other aspect where you need to know what you sound like.Well worth the cost.This is as good as it gets for a USB consumer mic.  If you need more, you're going to be looking at professional grade equipment.Update removing two stars for consistent popping\/cracking noise that appears while the mic is in use.  The ONLY fix I've found for this issue is a full reboot which only solves the problem for a short time before the noise comes back again.  Audio equipment at this price range should not have these kinds of problems.Update 2,The analog output now creates a 10Khrz noise constantly causing a horrendous headache if you listen to it.

My computer fan, my friends on the other side of the house. Once it even picked up my neighbor's cell phone going off. I set it to the lowest gain possible, changed the setting to cardioid, used a Mic stand, a pop filter and a windscreen. Lastly I went into my closet which you can't stand up in. It still picked everything up.The Technica doesn't pick up any of that, just the vocals. The only reason I upgraded is because of the Yeti's supposed ability to record instrumentals better.  But I can't record without picking up something. When I do record, it sounds cluttered because of the background noise. I can't ask everyone in my apartment to stop what they're doing just for my podcast.If you live alone or in a slight bigger apartment building. I'd say go for it. It feels great and is an amazing microphone from what I can tell. But for people like me who live in populated areas, i'd say save $10-20 and go for the Technica.

The biggest fault for me, that ultimately lead me to leaving this review, was the surprising default of the power input where it left the connection in dodgy condition. At first I thought it was my stock chord that came with the unit, so I even purchased a brand new one, but it was still the same problem. I would need to constantly have to angle the chord in certain positions to get it to work. Often they were not in ones that was optimal for speaking into or setting it up to record with. Such a lousy way to lose a potentially decent mic.

The Blue Yeti is defenitely one of the best USB Mics available, if not the best. I do have a problem though: At first it worked flawlessly, Windows recognized it and installed the drivers, so it was a simple Plug n' Play. About 2 weeks later Windows claimed that a \"Driver\" was incorrect, and tried to fix it on the Device Manager. There was no error at all, but it said there was, and tried to repair. Windows failed and ended up unistalling the drivers, and now the Mic is recognized as a normal Mic, not Blue Yeti, making it impossible to use the Headphone Jack feature that it has to check your own voice. Real bummer. Did not found a Fix, but an entire OS Reinstall should do the job for windows to recognize it as a new device again and install the drivers.Now, do make sure you are using all it has to offer: Some games Built In Voice Chat do not get the true quality the Yeti has. Personally I use Discord, and the Audio Quality there is better, according to my friends.Last thing: Do put it close to your mouth, and set the Audio sensitivity on Windows to 50%, and set the Gain on the Yeti just a little bit after the letter N on the gain.

{"reviewTitle":"Simply amazing","reviewDescription":"This thing has changed my recording life and I haven't even recorded yet. A few voice snippets here and there to test the microphone and see how I sounded via different settings and I can safely say the following:Audibly without this, I hate the sound of my voice. This is because of the way our voices work inside of our skulls. I expected to sound annoyed with my voice as I always do, but it was like hearing someone different almost. And I realized why my wife likes it when I talk. It's not the best, but it's not the worst.The microphone definitely picks up...Everything. If you're in a noisy room or in a room without any sound dampening from sound outside, people are gonna hear it. And you should be wary. The gain knob helps, but this being my first GOOD microphone I have no idea how to do this properly.That said, let's talk aesthetics. The blackout edition is as you expect. it's black. And unlike the pictures here, it's more of a slick matte black. And I'm happy to say that the finish is good on fingerprints (not that you'll touch it much when you get it set up where you want it) and the included stand is both sturdy and works QUITE well. I use this for desktop recording, and my extra large mouse mat is good enough to remove the vibration I hear about when it's just on your desk.Main point: This is a great cheap solution if you're looking to record anything.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1476489600000}

But after using it for almost 1 year, I have figured out how to get GREAT sound from it for my ASMR videos.Put a foam cover on itRecord with gain at 9:00Use the multipressor plugin in GarageBand, set around 10Use the deesser pluginEq the highs to 9:00, lows to around 9:00, and mids along with the mid frequency pretty much all the way downAdjust the equalizer manually tooTHE TRICK AND MOST IMPORTANT THING!! Watch the master volume level meter during playback and make sure it does not go into the red! Do this in GarageBand and iMovie or final cut. If the track volume or master volume are hittin the red the audio will be distorted on export or upload. Took me forever to learn that. You may sometimes need to push the \u201ca\u201d key to open up the automation thing in GarageBand and manually lower spots where the audio is peaking into the red. Same with iMovie or final cut. Once I get into the video editor, I raise the whole audio level as much as possible until it barely hits the yellow in some places. If some places hit the red I will cut around those points and manually lower them. Hope this helps any other ASMRtists trying to get good sound. There IS NOT a good video on YouTube to show you. They all leave out the most important things. Blue Yeti really should include a slip of paper that has some recommendations for different types of recording and how to get the best sound.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1564704000000}

I'm very glad I did as I have not seen the price go anywhere near that low in all of those years since. I used this microphone as my daily microphone while gaming\/working for the better part of 4 years, before switching to my current wireless headset; but I still break it out and use it whenever I'm going to record a video or give a professional presentation in front of a wider audience. This microphone is a true studio-quality microphone, from a well known brand, for less than $100. With that said, it by no means is plug-and-play, it requires lots of tuning, learning, and attention to detail to make it the truly incredible microphone that it is. I personally have had to turn down the microphone input volume in my Windows settings and manually adjust the gain on the microphone to compensate, and I use a noise suppression filter in OBS when recording, as I live on a busy street; but your mileage will vary. I have no idea if there are better options out there, but the Mics I have seen in person that compare to the Yeti Blackout are nowhere near as hefty and sturdy. At the time I purchased this microphone, it was really the only logical option in this price range; and I am incredibly impressed that it has held up all these years later.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1629244800000}

{"reviewTitle":"You Should Geti a Blue Yeti!","reviewDescription":"I absolutely LOVE this microphone. I am using it primarily to record and produce high quality Voiceover work. The mic is substantial and solidly built.  It is quite heavy. If you choose to use it as I do, suspended from above and attached to an Aluminum shock mount, you will have to invest in a higher quality scissor boom arm in order to hold the weight. I went ahead and spent the $100 to get the Rode Scissor boom arm which holds the shock mount, the mic and a pop filter without any drooping or jeopardy.  I love that the mic is a usb mic (meaning the analog to digital conversion circuitry is built into the mic) allowing me to connect it directly into my Mac. The sound quality with voice is outstanding providing a professional level end product. The mic has 4 different settings (which I suppose is nice for different applications) but I use it exclusively in Cardioid mode. The mic has a conveniently placed jack (on the bottom... or top in my configuration) for connecting studio monitor headphones. There is a volume control knob for the headphone volume as well as a mute button on the front of the mic. On the rear is the gain control knob and the recording mode selector knob. The knobs are solid, well placed and easy to use. If you choose to use this on a desktop surface you will appreciate the solidness and height of the included mic stand. The stand raises the mic much higher than most mic stands, putting it at a very reasonable height for speaking directly into the front of the mic while sitting at your desk. The only problem seems to be that there is really no way to mount a shock mount to the Blue Yeti stand. All in all this is an exceptionally built condenser microphone with great features that can produce tremendously professional home studio sound for voiceover work and all for less than $150.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1527811200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Big Shock to Nobody - It's awesome","reviewDescription":"The Yeti is, as most people should know, a great sounding microphone and will get 99% of end users throughout their day without any problems. It's easy to install with no drivers to download and has way more options than the Snowball directly on the mic. The mute button is a great help too, I no longer have to alt tab things to find the mute on whatever chat service I'm using at the time.I still believe most people could get by just fine using a Blue Snowball or Snowflake, especially if you want one that's easier to carry, but if you want something that's \"just extra\" and is great for a huge number of things from music to webcams to conferences to whatever else, it's hard to suggest anything else.The included stand works well and is a million times better than the one that comes with the Snowball, but I wish the large thumb screws on either side could tighten into the microphone a little bit more as I find the Yeti falling onto its back often whenever I'm moving things around my desk. This is solved by getting a sturdy microphone stand and a shock mount so you don't get vibrations, but if you're not too worried about perfectly baritone voices then the included stand does a decent job of softening desk movements and shakes. Nobody I've talked to has heard much background noise and I haven't heard any hisses or crackles during my Audacity recordings. The USB cable is long too, and longer cables is always a good thing. I don't know if it's just my microphone but the USB plug on the Yeti is a little loose and doesn't grip the cable as hard as I'd like. If the cable gets tugged it'll fall out, which is more annoying than anything. Other than that I'm extremely happy with it and will probably use it until it breaks, if it ever does.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1430956800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Sound quality is great but some issues","reviewDescription":"First off let me say the sound quality on this mic is incredible. If you are coming from a builtin mic on a webcam your mind will be blown. I won't talk about this much because all the other reviews mention this and go into detail about it. Seriously this mic is amazing.Having said that, the design of the stand it comes with is horrendous. Adjusting the mic at any angle other than standing straight up bends and breaks the USB cable immediately.  Literally the first 5 seconds of owning the device I plugged it in and adjusted the mic which broke the USB cable. Luckily my headphones were not plugged into it either or it might of broke that as well. It was an easy fix as I had an extra cable sitting around. The photo shows the now broken USB cable.Also, this works on Linux somewhat but you CANNOT hear your own voice as you would with windows. I did not dock an stars for this as it was not advertised to work with Linux. Sound quality on Linux is the same. I have not found a workaround (without using software which causes a delay) but if someone knows of one please let me know!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1545609600000}

Some preliminary tests for Twitch streaming indicate that it is pretty sensitive even in the uni-directional mode and can possibly pick up some background noise\/conversation.HOWEVERThe USB cable that came with it had a short. I first noticed it because the mic did not work. When I went to unplug it the cable was ridiculously hot; the metal was hot enough to burn skin. I unplugged both ends and let it cool. Unfortunately I wasn't smart enough to pitch the cable at that point, so I tried it again! Miraculously it worked! For 0.68 seconds. At which point the mic shut off and Windows 10 started repeated messages that \"A USB Device requires more power than this port can provide\" over and over. All my USB devices stopped working. Unplugging the bad cable had no effect; Windows continued to blare out warnings and USB devices were disabled. I quickly powered down the machine and rebooted. My keyboard still did not work until I unplugged it and plugged it back in. WHEW. For a few horrifying minutes I thought that my motherboard was fried due to a $3 USB cable.TL;DR: Mic good, but the USB cable was crafted by Satan","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1508976000000}

The last one plugged in becomes the active mic and the other goes into nowheres land. The computer is confused as it thinks they are the same thing. I reached out to Blue, who said they could update the mic with a new firmware to give it a new digital serial number. I thought... awesome!!! They said I had to pay for shipping to them and they will pay to ship it back once updated. Great! I did and they did.Only issue is, the mic came back exactly the same. They didn't do anything.

Your audio will contain a lot of noise that is very hard to fix within the audio. Audio patterns make no so much difference, you can barely tell the difference between one pattern or another.If you are going to record your audio in a quite place or a room with sound treatment then this could be the mic for you.

Volume and gain weren't smooth throughout their range, and the pattern knob was very stiff.  No quick way to turn off mic when not in use, options are to mute (flashing red light) or have active (red light).Stuff gamers will care about:- I had hoped that when using headphones, I'd be able to configure the pattern\/gain to prevent the pickup of keyboard (Cherry MX browns) and mouse noise, but this wasn't the case.  Varying the placement\/pattern\/gain didn't make much of a difference, unless I lowered the gain to the point where my voice was too low.  I was surprised it picked up so much more noise than the Zalman, which is omnidirectional.- Steam compresses audio to the point where most of the improvement over the Zalman was erased.- USB means I couldn't run it through my soundcard, which made it less convenient.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1449187200000}

{"reviewTitle":"IN DEPTH REVIEW! Great product! 10\/10!!!","reviewDescription":"First of all the quality and price for performance for this mic is just DEAD on. This thing is absolutely a steal. If you are debating between the snowball and the yeti. GET THE YETI. Spend the extra money and you have yourself a REALLY nice mic for just over 100 bucks. Now when i first plugged it in, it worked RIGHT away. Drivers automatically installed and it was recognized with no issues. (I use Windows 10 so good news for us new windows 10 users :D it works right away with no compatibility issues of any sort) Now the only thing you will have to do is re-set your default headset for sound because the yeti has a headphone pass through that allows you to hear your voice over (for recording music or commentary's etc) So you have to go back into your devices find your headset (mine is a Hyper X Cloud Pro aka Realtek high definition audio is what it will be called on your audio device list) and make sure you set that as your default INPUT SOUND if you use that for gaming or you tube videos or what not for your sound input. The Yeti wont need to be set up or anything you just plug it in and make sure you set your headphones back to your default sound and you are good to go. Just tweak the gain on the back of the yeti mic itself i usually put it halfway and than a little bit less than that (counter clockwise if you are looking at the gain knob) and my friends say that is a perfect sound level when i talk to them in skype and in our games. You also don't have to sit right on top of it for it to pick up. I sit mine right next to my computer monitor (about a foot and a half away) and my friends say they can hear me just fine :D and it doesn't pick up back round noise as much as the snowball did. It is by no means a studio pro 1000+ dollar mic that will sound absolutely perfect but i'll tell ya what for 100 bucks it beats the mics that are on gaming headsets and the quality is by far the best i have ever owned and i am a pretty big gamer. I have owned a ton of standalone mics and headsets and this one EASILY takes the cake and i can now record my guitar covers and play games and talk to friends all with the same mic. It really is a great purchase. 10\/10 i would DEFINITELY recommend this mic to anyone who would like to record music, sing, plays games online, skype chats with friends, etc. It is a great product!

There was a slight water mark in the inside packaging, but nothing on the device. I was happy I could sit back and not have to eat the mic. It seemed fine for others to hear me. Especially compared to my laptop mic. The volume button being slightly loose did not bother me. My assumption is it will be more durable to bumps. Some said the mounting screws might scratch if you take it off the stand. Yet I am careful. So again not a deal breaker. Just remember the sound speakers on Skype default to the headphone jack and you have to select your speakers if you want. Google Hangouts defaults to your speakers.

The customizable gain and sensitivity, as well as the different modes and multiple condensers on it have been a great help depending on what I'm doing with it at the moment. It can be set to pick up just about any sound, or set to only pick up on voices. Depending on what you're using the microphone for, there's probably a way to set it to work perfectly for you! My friends on Discord have told me I sound much clearer on calls with them, and my voice quality on streams has been much easier to manage. It rarely ever peaks unless I set the gain too high, and if it's too quiet, easily fixed as well! Certainly helps with the audio balancing. It's also got a very convenient muting button, so if I'm in a Discord call or something, playing a game in fullscreen, and need to mute, I no longer need to Alt+Tab and mute my microphone via Discord. I can simply press a button on the mic, and boom! Muted! I've utilized this more often than the actual Discord feature lately.

{"reviewTitle":"Great Starter Mic","reviewDescription":"This is a great starter mic for anyone who is looking to get started on YouTube, Streaming Video Games, Podcasting, or even Recording Music.  The mic is a USB mic which means you don't have to purchase the extra peripherals that a condenser mic would need.  This allows for better portability, being able to take your mic wherever you need it as long as you have a USB port to plug into.I've used this mic for a few months now and I have to say, the sound quality is great, no where near professional quality but it will get the job done.  The ability to switch between polar patterns with a turn of a dial allows for extreme versatility.  I really like the headphone jack on the mic that allows you to hear yourself.  The mic also acts as a pass through audio source, so you can plug your headphones into the mic to hear both the audio from your computer.The mic stand itself works if you don't need to have anything directly in front of you like a keyboard, however if you're going to use this mic for streaming video games, or any activity that requires you to be able to move freely in front of you, I would highly suggest picking up a boom scissor arm type stand.  If you do decide to upgrade the stand, be sure to purchase a shock mount as well.  The boom mic will attach directly to the body of the mic which can allow for some mechanically transmitted noise.This mic is definitely on the heavier side, however it does make the mic feel a little more robust and sturdy.  The weight may make it hard to find a mic stand that supports the weight, however this wasn't a deal breaker for me as the pros of this mic definitely outweigh the cons.Overall, this mic is an excellent pickup for the price (I purchased it for 89.99) for all of the features that you get with this mic.Pros:-Ease of Use-Minimal Peripherals Needed-Flexibility with Multiple Polar Patterns-Great Audio Quality-Price-PortabilityCons-Heavy - Not all Mic Stands can support this Mic","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1520812800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Two thumbs up for Yeti!","reviewDescription":"**One problem I ran into was that I plugged the Yeti into a USB 3.0 port** The recording was spotty and I tried several things including rebooting and fiddling with cables, it turned out it could be a conflict with USB3 slot?**I never thought it would be this great. But it is! The microphone is BIG and HEAVY - and makes me feel authoritative when I talk into it due to its monstrous size. As for sound - WOW! I had no idea my voice sounded so good, but then again I've only ever recorded my voice using cheapo $20 mics too. And the fact all I have to do is plug this into a USB port is awesome. No drivers are included because none are needed. My system (Windows 7) immediately knew what it was and within a couple seconds it was ready to record.Cons: The unit itself is rock solid and very well constructed. However, there is one little flaw that could be a BIG problem down the road... The volume control knob on the unit feels like it's made with cheap light plastic and feels like it could wobble a bit and potentially snap off. The other controls and buttons are pretty solid. But after some experimentation I'm of the opinion that after a little tweaking, the volume control will pretty much stay in one position unless I change environments when I record my voice.I love that it also has a built in mute button. When I recorded my voice with sound activation on my software I could click the mute button and it would immediately stop recording on my computer. Very cool. Also, this is a condenser mic - the exact same type of mic that professional recording artists use in the studios except theirs are a lot more expensive, but the fundamental performance and quality of the mic itself is pretty much the same.  I use this to audio overlay training content on presentations for disabled veterans, five stars for price and performance!Two thumbs up, if this review helped, please thumbs up!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1442361600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Holy-Freakin-Smokes...","reviewDescription":"... I love this mic.I bought a cheap $30 USB mic that was well-reviewed on Amazon about a year ago, and it was fine. I thought I was out-foxing the rest of the world by saving money on a mic that is \"comparable to Yeti brands for a fraction of the price.\" LOL wut? Thankfully, my stupid idiot self was feeling like a hot-shot after Christmas with some Amazon gift cards and decided to buy a big-boy microphone just to see what all the hubbub was about.Y'all... there's a reason this mic costs triple figs. The clarity, the tone, the volume, the build quality, the 4 different input settings on the back that customize the mic to your activity, the ease of connecting it to your laptop right out of the box... *Italian Finger Kiss*Sometimes I just turn it on and record nothing. Seriously. I plug in some headphones and press record and just let it record nothing at all. Maybe I'll speak. Maybe I'll sing. Maybe I'll spend hours trying to make that water droplet sound with my mouth like Cameron does in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It doesn't matter what goes in - it all comes out sounding like gold.All it took was one stupid sound test on my laptop and within three seconds of playing it back, I had somehow listed my old mic on Facebook Marketplace complete with pictures and an item description so pure that it would have brought a tear to Zig Zigler's eyes.Look, I'm not a sound scientist or have perfect pitch or have more than three friends to listen to my very targeted fantasy football podcasts - but while I can't regurgitate any specs and have virtually zero experience when it comes to high-end audio recording devices, I can confidently say that I'm very much in love with the Yeti Blue microphone and think you will be too if you are ever blessed enough to have over $100 on you at once and decide to blow it all on this fine *peach emoji* microphone.

{"reviewTitle":"Plug and play","reviewDescription":"I just plugged it into my computer and it worked. This is very important if you want to use it on a work-provided computer where you don't have admin rights and can't install any software. After it finishes self-installing, you will see a new speaker and new input device in your computer's sound settings.This thing is WAY bigger and heavier than I imagined from looking at the picture. Hard to find a place to put it on my desk where it won't block the monitor.The audio output jack works with standard Apple Earpods that have a 3.5mm jack. By default, you hear yourself speaking (UPDDATE: mic monitoring can be turned off in Windows without any special software, but it was not obvious how to do so.) Plus the mike has a convenient mute button.Sound quality is noticeably better than the microphones on a Logitech webcam, but there's no practical audio benefit over using a decent headset. Now, I am sure that in a soundproofed studio this is going to be better (not from practical experience, but because this mic is highly rated, so it must be a pretty good mic), but if you're just using it in a normal room with bad acoustics, don't buy it because you expect to get better sound than just using a decent headset. However, I HATE wearing headsets so... looking forward to using this in Zoom meetings.I probably could have bought a less expensive microphone for my purposes.UPDATE: Since writing the review, I have two major complaints:1. When I reboot my desktop computer (not my work computer), the Yeti stops working until I remove the USB cable and plug it in again. Very annoying.2. The mute light would be a lot more useful if it was green for unmuted and red for muted, instead of red  for unmuted and blinking red for muted. That would make it a lot easier to instantly see if you are on mute.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679443200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Love it! The only USB mic with self-listening option.","reviewDescription":"The exact diameter of the head is 2.55\" = 64 mm.This one is best! It is the only USB mic allowing to hear your own voice while talking. If  you really care how you sound in real time, this is the only option for you. You also hear the other side in skype, hangouts and other conference calls and webinars, but you hear yourself in real time. This is a great feature. THe problem with other USB mics, is that with USB option, there is a 200-400 msec delay which makes it impossible to speak and listen to yourself at the same time. You start to stagger. In this one, the sound doesn't go via USB and computer, it is returned to you directly from the mic, there is a 3.5 mm mother jack on the mic. So there is no delay (it goes via analog path), so you get realtime feedback, which is great.And the second advantage is that it is incredibly sensitive - great dinamic range in lower volume. You don't have to speak loud. You can speak normal voice even a meter away and it will record perfectly.The drawback is that it is very sensitive to knocking on the table. You can not have your elbows on the table and can not type while speaking. So you got to buy a mic stand. For a mic stand, this mic is a bit too heavy, it turns the stand over, because it is heavy. So I attached 3 big coke bottles to the bottom stem of the stand and attached using wide skotch tape. THat made the stand really heavy and now it holds this mic just fine, very stable. So now, I can lean on the table and have a mic near me.The controls are very handy on the mic. The analogue volume dial for listening the feedback is very handy.Overall love it!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1455408000000}

The instructions are very clear and briefly describes the different modes the microphone has. What I really like about it is that it also tells you what the different modes are recommended for. the \"omni-directional\" mode is recommended for instrumental recording, or group singing, etc etc. It is very friendly towards beginners, especially me since this is my first dedicated microphone.Since you now have a dedicated microphone, why need your gaming headset right? The microphone even has a headphone jack so you can throw away that $100 headset and use your apple earbuds or whatever 3.5mm earphone you use. On the front of the microphone there is a dedicated volume knob and a mute button that flashes red, indicating that it is muted. On the back there is the knob for switching between the different modes the microphone can be as well as a knob to turn up or down how loud the microphone projects the sound it records. \"Gains\" is what the knob is labeled.Microphone itself is very well made. Heavy steel (I think its steel?) as a base and a lighter, but still metal body. There are knobs for you to adjust the angle of the microphone, or even unscrew the base so that you can mount on an elevated mount.The quality of the microphone is superb. It pretty much picks up everything. From mechanical keyboard clicks to you swallowing just a bit loudly. Very very excellent.So in all, was the 130ish dollars I spent on the product worth it? Yes. Considering how well the microphone sounds and the fact that I will be using this when I stream on twitch and record commentary for youtube videos, I feel like this is a very good investment this should probably last me for a couple of years.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"235 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1486857600000}

{"reviewTitle":"the Blue Yeti is easily compatible with both systems and doesn't need to install ...","reviewDescription":"As someone with growing history in the radio business, when it came time to look for portable recording microphones (like it or not), the Blue Yeti was the name that just kept coming back up. Whether it was mentioned in reviews for other microphone setups, whispered on the grapevine or just frequently coming up in a Google search, the Blue Yeti seemed to be the X that marked the treasure spot on the journey of USB mics.And as far as expectations go, the Yeti is indeed that treasure (and a mighty affordable gold and glittery gem at that). While I still haven't been able to put it through it's full paces as of yet (since my main use is for voicetracking) I can't speak to the strength of all the microphone settings, but the cardioid setting has been absolutely incredible. I would say quality-wise it surpasses the overhead mounted mics at my workplace in both sheer sound quality as well as tone, and with a simple USB attachment it's a cakewalk to set it up with something as big as a full tower PC or a thin Macbook Pro without breaking much of a sweat. As you might have guessed, the Blue Yeti is easily compatible with both systems and doesn't need to install drivers or cause much interruption for it to get started working.Otherwise, it's pretty easy to lock it into the mount where you want it to be, plus it has a handy mute button on the front should you need it as well as a basic attachment in which to plug in any stock pair of headphones. I personally use noise canceling Beats headphones, which are great because it takes what sound you're feeding into the microphone and feeds it directly to your ears without any kind of delay. It can be a bit of a drawback if you're working on finer production work and don't have another way of externally hearing what you're working on (leading to some vocal\/music balance issues), but it's a great setup for any of your personal recording studio aspirations. You can also mount a pop filter to the back frame behind the mic should you so desire, but it isn't always a perfect fit as it wasn't really designed for that seemingly, so you'd have to fiddle with it a bit.Take it from this voice tracker and radio jack of all trades, you can definitely trust the Blue Yeti USB Microphone for great performance and reliability (and that price tag is still pretty sweet for what you're getting too!). 10\/10!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1459468800000}
{"reviewTitle":"\"What Mic Are You Using?\"","reviewDescription":"Gaming, Voice-Recording, Work Meetings. This is where I use my Blue Yeti USB Mic.Everywhere people are always asking me \"What kind of mic do you have, your voice is so clear\". And I'm like \"Blue Yeti\".  You can hear the envy in their voices as they say \"Oh, that's cool. So you don't have a headset\".  As I hear this response, over and over, I stare blankly into my monitor and wonder what has happened to society. Do people not know that one can own more than 1 microphone, does one not know that you can select in your settings which microphone to use. Am I the only person in the world who wears a headset and talks through a Blue Yeti... Of course not, I've seen people do this on YouTube for years.... So I respond back with \"Yeah, I use a headset but I disable the microphone in it and use the Blue Yeti\" only to hear the inevitable response of \"Oh, why do you have a separate mic\" .... I start pondering life at this point. I want to say \"Ummm because I wanted high quality which you commented on to start this conversation in the first place. I mean, didn't you go \"What mic are you using\" because you were hearing me in crystal clear hd glory?\" but instead I respond with \"Because the sound quality is better on the stand-a-lone mic\" .  Then I always get the same response \"Yeah, but I wouldn't like having to speak into the microphone while I'm gaming. Plus, $99 for a microphone is pretty expensive\" says the dude wearing a $300 headset that has inferior mic quality AND inferior sound quality to my $200 complete setup.Ughhh. You don't have to speak directly into the mic. There are adjustments that can change where the direction of the sound is recorded from. You can change the Gain on the mic itself, which is huge because some apps amplify sounds which is annoying without having the ability to quickly adjust your microphone.If you are looking for a great USB microphone this is my favorite one.

On the yeti the propietary ones are more expensive so it is up to you to decide basically which you like more, the sound is almost the same, they are really alike so it is just about the size and weather that is a problem for you, for me personally, I love them both, but for the size I would choose the AT2020, if the yeti fit in every shock mounts and arms, I would buy the yeti first just because I already used it and liked it a lot, and it is cheaper than the version of the AT2020 that has the same features.(Also, if you were wondering, yes, you can use this mic or any USB mic via OTG cable with android assuming your android has OTG support, tried with my Z2 with an app that records lossless and yes, the quality is the same from the phone or the PC doing this) Why would you want to do this, in my case, my PC after watercooling it, it makes more noise than when it was cooler by air, and the mic picks up that buzzing of the pump, so I power it off whenever I am going to record but since it is USB, I wondered if I could use it with my phone and yes you can so, the more you know the better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1458604800000}

There are slightly better professional quality mics that most people don't need.  Unless you're a professional voice actor, there's not going to be a perceivable difference.The Yet isn't overly complicated, but does have a gain control and selector to determine which mic's in the microphone on the end are active.  So long as you do a little testing to get the distance and desktop placement correct, your audio should be the clear and at an appropriate volume.I have used Yeti's many times in the past, but the one I just purchased has only been out of the box for about an hour.  I bought this one to use for video conferencing in my home office.  I finally got tired of constant bluetooth reliability issues.  It was time to get a wired desktop mic with better quality and significantly better reliability.  After I've been using it for a while, I may think about getting a boom mount if I pick up too much background noise from my typing or a small fan that currently sits on my desk.  I may also look into a foam cover if it \"pops\".After it's been in use for a while, I'll update the review if my opinion changes.  Considering my history using these in my work-life, that's rather unlikely.
