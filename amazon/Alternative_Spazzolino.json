It has a great time to help manage your zones which is very helpful and connects to an app that provides further guidance.  This would be a solid 5 stars if not for the fact that my toothbrush stopped working for the premium payment I made.This model is intended to have 3 brush settings which is one of the main reasons it is a bit more than the model that has 1 brush setting.  It worked as intended for the first couple days and I could flip between the 3 settings.  Not sure if it is the app controlling this but it suddenly stopped offering all 3 settings and now just has 1 setting.  I checked the app to see if I accidentally turned the other 2 off and I did not.  I even told the app to reset the settings on my toothbrush to no luck.  Why pay a premium for this brush if it doesn't work as intended?  Just glad I didn't go for the much more expensive version with 5 settings.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1648339200000}

My daughter's cheaper Minnie Mouse model I know has been dropped a lot and it still runs. I fully expected to replace hers before his.My son loves black and he thinks the brush looks cool. He is 8 and doesn't mind using it. He thinks it takes the work out of having to brush his teeth.  We don't use the Bluetooth at all and that's really why we got this model. It is just not that convenient.  We bought 2 others for adults with the Bluetooth and we don't use it either.

I had a Phillips Sonicare for years that I absolutely loved but it didn't clean my teeth nearly as well as this toothbrush.The Cons:The Oral B is really loud. It sounds like a jackhammer in your mouth. Everyone in your house is going to know you're brushing your teeth.It doesn't have an automatic shut off after 2 minutes (my Sonicare did). You have to scroll through the settings if you want to turn it off. Not a deal-breaker but annoying, nonetheless.The battery lasts a week and takes 12 hours to fully charge. My Sonicare lasted longer and charged faster.The Pros:In a little less than two weeks of 2x a day use, it has removed stains from my teeth. Both on the backs of my teeth and around the gum line. The stains that my dentist usually has to spent time scraping off are almost gone.My teeth are whiter. Not blindingly white, but noticeably whiter (maybe a couple shades). I haven't changed my habits, this is due to the toothbrush. I'm a coffee drinker and a smoker and my teeth are still whiter.I was originally going to return this toothbrush and buy another Sonicare but after seeing the difference in my teeth in a short period of time, I'm keeping the Oral B.

{"reviewTitle":"Excellent toothbrush","reviewDescription":"Here is my entire saga:For many years, I was using a Sonicare battery-operated toothbrush (the Power-Up).  But Sonicare stopped making brush heads specifically for that toothbrush.  So I bought some generic replacement heads on Amazon:https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sonicare-Toothbrush-Powerup-Toothbrush-Phillips-Replacement\/dp\/B01MRQXZF0\/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?crid=5JRHROZDAQ1&keywords=pearl+enterprises+replacement+brush+heads+compatible+with+oral+b&qid=1675732000&sprefix=%22Pearl+Enterprise%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-4The heads felt harsh, and they became detached from the handle.  After I would brush my teeth, I would feel so tired, I had to take a nap.  I decided it was time for a change.  I bought the Oral-B Smart 3000 because it\u2019s their cheapest toothbrush that has a sensitive mode (I have sensitive teeth).  (For those with periodontal disease, I would recommend the Smart 5000. For those with neither condition , the Smart 1000 should suffice.) The Smart 3000 is MUCH GENTLER than my battery-operated toothbrush was.  In addition, on the advice of Oral-B customer service, I bought their softest replacement heads\u2014their Gum Care replacement heads.  In addition, I decided to buy Crest Gum Care mouthwash.  This was definitely the right combination of products for me.  In addition, every time before I brush my teeth, I clean the bristles of the toothbrush with alcohol and liquid Ivory Soap.  My gums immediately felt better, and my teeth were cleaner.  I no longer felt tired after brushing my teeth.  There was only one slight problem\u2014the red indicator light that was supposed to go on if you apply too much pressure wasn\u2019t going on.  Then it was going on at the wrong time\u2014as I was turning off the toothbrush.  The solution was to call Oral-B customer service.  They helped me to reset the toothbrush\u2014then I had to re-pair it with the Oral-B app.  So I did not have to return the toothbrush.

I've owned different models of oral b electric toothbrush's over the years, both rechargable and battery operated. The one I was replacing with this 3000 series was a $14 \"vitality\" model which served me well over the past few years and still works.I thought about upgrading after doing research on higher-oscillating & pulsating toothbrushes and how they did in fact, clean better than lesser-oscillating & pulsating brushes. I decided to upgrade.I'm not going to use the bluetooth feature since #1 I should know by know how to brush and #2 it's a gimmick. The main reason I bought the 3000 were the higher oscillating & pulsating feature along with the pressure sensitive light. The former works fine while the latter is a joke if you consider just how hard one would need to press down on the teeth\/gums to get it to light up. Battery life is what's stated, although if the tray which can be separated from the charging dock is used stand alone, either the length of the entire toothbrush or the stiffness of the power cord 7 times out of 10 knock the whole thing over.The motor is also extremely loud (less so on the lower setting but still obnoxious enough to wake a still sleeping wife\/husband in the adjacent bedroom. In addition, oral b's ubiquitous round brushhead have gotten noticeably bigger from those of yesteryear.All in all I was expecting to be pleasantly surprised but instead got a very solid \"Meh.\"P.S. - The instructions state the unit can be kept on the plugged-in charging dock without worry regarding shorting battery life, but many reviews on here have complained the battery stops working after a few months, so I wouldn't leave it charging all the time.","isVerified":false,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1563408000000}

I haven\u2019t had it long, but so far the battery has held out quite nicely with one charge per week. I gave the brush an overall low rating because of the advertising. I did a lot of research before purchasing this brush because this is one of the more expensive brushes I have bought. I was specifically looking for a brush that would identify brushing errors, but the Bluetooth it connects with only indicates timing and general information. Considering a regular toothbrush can be purchased at the dollar store, and the advances in technology, I feel that the amount of money for a toothbrush of this caliber should include more technology. The advertisement showed that it connected to Bluetooth but was not clear as to how the brushing was supported, and I feel this was somewhat deceptive. Since I find the brush itself works quite well, I will be using it regularly.

Also, the red light lights up each time you press too hard, but you really don't have to press that hard for it to light up. The result is that i have a glaring red light in my eyes most of the time, no way to turn it off. Can't say anything about the bluetooth connection, didn't try to connect it to my phone.My final opinion is that i should have opted for another oral b model.

I used it for 6 months and noticed a difference, I was in and out of that chair in less than 15 minutes (results vary by person).I bought one for my father for his birthday. His next trip to the dentist, equally short and definitely pleasing visit for him and the Dentist and Hygenist who were pleased with his teeth.So I bought a third one for my mother, who has weak teeth. I'm certain, given it's track record with my dad and myself, she'll find it helpful! It won't solve her weak teeth but it will keep them healthier.The only con is the replacement brush heads. They're plastic that will live in a landfill and they're pricey. But for less than 10 minutes of having my teeth scraped on the last two visits, I will make it up to Mother Earth in other ways.And I asked, the brush heads with the flippers on them for \"Flossing Action\" are a waste of time.

{"reviewTitle":"Made me realize I should brush more.","reviewDescription":"This thing is great, battery last a little more than a week. My teeth feel so clean. Like I used to think I brushed long enough, but this vibrates ever 30 seconds to move to the next part. Some nights Ill use my regular brush if I am tired and just want to get to bed, but most I stick with this. Kind of big and tall for travel, and the charging chord is much too long but I get it. Dont know if others do this but I do tend to drip on myself, that my only complaint really.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1598832000000}
