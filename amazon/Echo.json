{"reviewTitle":"Lights wake you up at night, software is annoying for neurodivergent people.","reviewDescription":"Honestly the functionality is fine. The speaker works, basic questions can get answered, alarm function is good, connection to Spotify is pretty good, etc. The clock works just fine, but even though it dims at night, it's still way too bright.The review below this paragraph was written for the Echo Pop, but as the software is the same, it 100% applies to this device as well. I dislike the software of the Pop, but the Dot I truly hate as a whole package. Don't put it in a bedroom if you value your sleep at all. We've been awakened several times by lights. Once a bright yellow light came on and we had no idea why. All of our notifications are turned off. When we tried to ask why it glowed yellow, it said it had no answer for that. Apparently updates can make it go bright blue, and it has a few times. The most annoying is when the power goes out. The light can light up several times as it powers back up, then attempts to reconnect, and attempts to reconnect, and attempts to reconnect... (the WiFi gets knocked out, too, so sometimes it can take a while for everything to get moving again). I finally unplugged the thing one night last week when we were having intermittent power outages and the next day I ordered a new clock for the bedroom. (We've had the Dot since April and it is now December, so we've put up with a lot hoping it would get better.) The voice has only come on once in the night, but the lights seem to have a mind of their own. 100% CANNOT recommend for a bedroom.Our issue is the constant tweaking and changing that occurs in the software itself. It really does appear that Alexa is programmed to constantly figure out new ways to bother you. It reminds me of a loud kid's toy that sounds like it's off and then suddenly yells out, \"DON'T YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH ME?!\" Amazon doesn't seem content with allowing Alexa to be something that sits on your desk and functions the way you want it to function, without bothering you in any way. They haven't made something that can just sit on your desk and function the way you ask it to function.We have every single notification turned off, we've turned on \"brief mode\" which is supposed to make Alexa speak as little as possible. Still, no matter what we do, Amazon seems determined to program Alexa to ask us questions for every question we ask, sometimes completely out of left field. It's like the thing gets more and more desperate to be useful beyond the functions we've designated. At first, when asking for the weather today, it would constantly ask if we wanted the weather for the whole week. No. I said today because I want today's weather. Eventually that stopped, but then it started asking completely random stuff. The most recent one was, after asking the weather, it asked if I want to be updated on new movies as they come out. What? It's ridiculous. If I want the weather, now I just Google it.Setting timers, same thing. You'd think set a timer, how easy it is. No, it asks questions about entertaining you while you wait. Or other random things that have nothing to do with what you just asked. No, please just set a timer. If I don't have one handy and I need a timer now, I just have Google do it.My daughter was really enjoying asking how many days until Christmas and her birthday, and for a long time, Alexa would give the number of days. Now it has switched to months and weeks. I didn't ask how long until this event. We specify \"how many days\" and now no matter how I ask the question, some programming change has made it impossible to get the number of days. My daughter's little morning ritual is gone. She loved asking and hearing the reply, but now I just Google it and she's learning to read the numbers instead. Even with those very simple questions, though, it would ask things like \"would you like to hear a Christmas joke?\" No. I just want to be told the number of days and then have the device go quiet.There are many other little issues here and there. For a while, brief mode seemed to stop all of that, but it's back full force and I can't figure out how to shut it off. Probably many neurotypical people won't understand how stressful it feels, but not knowing if the device will just be silent after I ask my question, and never knowing what it will say or ask makes me never want to use it. My autistic son unplugged his because he couldn't stand it, either. I thought it would be so helpful, and I bought multiples for our house, but honestly there are plenty of other options out there for all of the functionality of this thing when I need it. I was hoping it could be centralized in one thing, but in their desperation to make the Alexa devices oh-so-useful and indispensable, Amazon has made them annoying, especially for anyone with any kind of neurodivergence.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702857600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Tried two of these, both are Echo Duds!","reviewDescription":"Updated: Shortly after writing my review, Amazon reached out to me to better understand what was going on with my Echo. They were very nice, but didn\u2019t have any suggestions on how to fix my issue. Since I had them on the phone, I asked to do another exchange, which they agreed to. I am now on my third one and I still have the exact same issues. I have, however, learned how to get my Echo to play music. I ask as though I\u2019m asking another device to play music on this one. So instead of just asking it to play, I tell it to play (Beethoven) on my Kitchen Echo Dud. As long as I request it by device name then it will play on that device. If I forget then I get the same message that that device is offline.Original: I love my Echo products and have a house full of them - with and without screens. However, this generation of Echo Dot with clock seems to be buggy.I bought this one during the holiday season. Right out of the box, I had problems. Set up went without a hitch, and everything seemed to be working other than using it to play music. No matter what streaming service I used, I'd ask it to play something and it would respond appropriately (ie playing Beethoven on Apple Music.) Then there would be a pause, nothing would happen, and then it would say \"Sorry, that device is offline.\" I could then ask it for my news or anything else that would require an internet connection, and it worked just fine.  I could also go to another Echo device and ask it to play music everywhere or on the Echo Dud, and it would play. I assumed there would be a software update that would fix everything so I didn't worry about it right away, and frankly, I almost completely forgot about that device. Luckily, I remembered that I should follow up on it before my extended holiday return window closed. It still wasn't playing music but everything else worked. I rebooted, I did a factory reset - all with the same results, so I called customer service for answers on how to fix this. He had me do all the same steps, again with the same results, then had me box it up to return and they sent me a replacement.I was disappointed to learn that Amazon didn't send me a brand new Echo, but a refurbished one. I regretted involving customer service then, because I could have just initiated my own exchange and gotten a new one since I was still within the return window. However, the replacement did work as expected, so I swallowed my disappointment.I have now been using this Echo Dud with clock for about four months. I primarily use this one for adding items to my shopping list or setting timers.  Perhaps a couple times a month I ask it to play music too. I'm not sure exactly when that feature stopped working, but once again it says it will play and then says the device is offline. Everything else that requires internet continues to function, and I can initiate music playback by asking another device to play on that one. I've tried to reboot and factory reset with no changes in the results.I don't know what is wrong with this device, but I'd steer clear of this generation!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687996800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Mixed bag, pros and cons, heavy on the cons","reviewDescription":"We wanted to love these and we ordered six during prime day, as part of an effort to ramp up smart home automation. We replaced several older dots.The good: they look nice, they sound good, the visual display is a nice touch.The bad:- the listening ability is wonky on all of them. Sometimes they hear commands, often not. We end up shouting and\/or repeating.- they\u2019re supposed to be able to detect occupancy. This was clutch for us for automations and a big part of why we upgraded. It works well on exactly ONE of the dots we bought. Four are intermittent, and one just didn\u2019t work at all (after all the troubleshooting, sensitivity settings, etc). Which brings me to\u2014- poor customer service. To return the one non-functional one (overlooking the frustration at the intermittent ones), we had to follow a unique process, pack up part of the kit, and the rep I spoke with on the phone sounded exhausted and angry. It was time consuming and confusing, but eventually we got a return authorization. We waited to send back until we got a replacement. Replacement took forever; received yesterday and, surprise!, its occupancy detection is not fully functional (it\u2019s intermittent). I think we are going to give up, keep it, and spend additional money to get motion sensors (requiring another hub).We\u2019re super disappointed in not only these devices but in Amazon. We are also bummed out that we\u2019ve now made a big investment in these and other smart devices based on using Alexa as the backbone for smart home, and that seems like it was a mistake. We were hoping for dots that did what they said they\u2019d do, good support, and easy integrations. The first two are a \u201cno\u201d and the third one is also hit or miss, but in many cases that is down to third party devs and the confusing ecosystem of smart home infrastructures.Giving two stars instead of one because the good characteristics are good.===Updated: changed from a two-star review to a one-star review. More of these did not work as expected (occupancy sensing), and the return experience with Amazon has gone from \"pretty good\" to \"OMG this is insanely bad\". We buy a lot from Amazon and rarely return things, so maybe this has been an issue for a while, and I'm just finding out about it.In any case: if you're planning to use these as speakers, great. If you want to use them to interact with Alexa, they are less-good than the old Gen3 dots. If you want to use them for smart home automation based on sensing, they are absolutely worthless: save your upgrade money and get some standalone motion or occupancy sensors instead.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690156800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Jeff Bezos, your customers deserve better!","reviewDescription":"As far as Alexa devices go, this thing is more Fred flintstone than it is George Jetson. Seriously, how is this an improvement?? I've owned several iterations of Alexa, and this one is by far the worst. It really feels like a huge step backwards. I rarely write bad reviews, but this thing is a heaping pile of trash, so it is well deserved. And now I hear that Amazon is planning to bill us monthly for using Alexa?? Consider me gone if that happens, but I digress\u2026I have several complaints, but the biggest is that it only works about half the time. The rest of the time, when I give it commands, I am met with an extremely annoying response saying, \u201cI'm sorry I didn't get that, the internet isn't reachable\u201d. This is completely false, since all the other devices in my house are working perfectly, including my other, older versions, of Alexa! This is the only version to ever do this to me (along with the countless other poor souls that have also experienced it), and even resetting it and my router (unplugging and plugging back in), doesn\u2019t fix it. It eventually fixes itself after about ten minutes, but not before peak irritation level is achieved.As if this weren\u2019t bad enough, the thing is just ugly. It looks like it should have been the very first demo version of Alexa, the one that existed in the olden times, long before LCD screens existed. And what\u2019s with the big ugly block font it uses? Is it made for a child? Very bizarre design choices.In truth, I'm actually a big supporter of Amazon, and I even admire Mr. Bezos and what he has built, but feelings can change.

Each time has been a failure in the same way.  It listens to a command but doesn't execute the command.  The blue ring keeps circling and then it goes off after a few more seconds and does nothing.  If I repeat the command, it may do the same thing again.  Sometimes it takes 4 or 5 attempts before it will execute the command, when I have the patience for it.The first one I thought it was locking up so I would unplug it, wait for it to boot up and then it would work...that time.  But the alarm the next morning may exhibit the same behavior of not responding.  After a couple months, I replaced it and threw out the defective one.  The next one worked fine for several months but then started doing the same thing.  This time I thought maybe it was my wireless connection that wasn't strong enough in my bedroom, even though this didn't make sense since I had a router just 25 feet away.  But it was an extender and I thought it sometimes disconnected from the main router.  But again, everytime I unplugged the echo, it would work again right after it booted up.  I threw it out and bought another as a black friday deal.This third one I felt good about.  I had just upgraded the house wifi to about the best money can buy.

The display style is terrible for those with visual or sensory processing issues. Also it scrolls the title of every song, audiblebook, etc. And I mean the whole title, chapter, etc. If you want to see the clock, too bad. Worse, it does this every time you do anything. So, if, for example, you back your audiobook up a minute or two, which I do all the time, it starts over again with the long scrolling display. They have got to give people more display setting options to let you turn the stuff off and let people adjust the display more for accessibility issues. Shame on you, Amazon, for making a less accessible device. The sound is better, but the display oddities and lack of settings to make choices about what scrolls makes this \"upgrade\" a poor one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1690934400000}

{"reviewTitle":"A perfect blend of form and function","reviewDescription":"The Cloud Blue Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) has completely changed my daily routine by integrating cutting-edge technology into an elegant form factor. This smart speaker has been an invaluable addition to my home, providing me with the services of Alexa as well as serving as a stylish and practical clock.I was immediately drawn to the Cloud Blue hue of my new Echo Dot with clock because of how softly it injects a burst of energy into any room. The device's compact size makes it suitable for use in any room of the house, from the bedroom to the kitchen. Amazon's commitment to offering products that complement a wide range of aesthetic preferences is reflected in the subtlety of this one.This smart speaker stands out from the crowd because to its built-in LED clock display. This seemingly minor modification has transformed my Echo Dot from a simple alarm clock into a multifunctional wristwatch. The LED display is easy to read from across the room, and its brightness can be adjusted so that it doesn't keep me up at night. Having the ability to switch between a 12-hour and 24-hour clock face as well as adjusting the clock's brightness is a nice touch.The Echo Dot's brilliance lies in its voice-activated functions, which are made possible by Alexa. Setting alarms, checking the weather, listening to music, and controlling smart home equipment may all be done with just a few phrases. The sound from the 5th generation Echo Dot is superior to those of its predecessors, filling the room with music that is both crisp and balanced. Whether I'm listening to my go-to podcast or a constantly evolving playlist, the Echo Dot always delivers excellent sound quality.Voice control is surprisingly reliable because to the system's several microphones, which allow Alexa to hear my commands even in noisy environments. I was blown away by how well the voice recognition worked. It almost never fails to comply with my demands and provides instant feedback. The Echo Dot has become an indispensable device, allowing me to effortlessly access information, schedule updates, and entertainment.Since privacy and security are so important in today's interconnected world, I am overjoyed by the privacy safeguards Amazon has implemented in the Echo Dot. The ability to switch off the microphones is a convenient feature that allows me to enjoy some peace and quiet whenever I need it. Amazon's openness about data usage and the ability to review and delete voice recordings via the Alexa app are further indications of the company's commitment to user control and data protection.Setting up the Echo Dot was a breeze with the help of the intuitive Alexa app, which took me through the process. The process of linking the device to my Wi-Fi network and making my desired adjustments was quick and painless. The Echo Dot is a good long-term investment because Amazon regularly updates its software to include the most recent features and enhancements.The Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022) with clock is a great example of smart technology that has been simplified to perform a single, specific task in a time when smart technology may sometimes seem overwhelming. The combination of a high-tech watch and Alexa's brainpower has made my regular tasks much more manageable and enjoyable. The Echo Dot adapts easily to my needs, whether I'm setting an alarm to gently wake me up in the morning or just listening to my favorite music. This smart speaker has seamlessly integrated into my life at home and become an essential tool. The Echo Dot with clock has undeniably merited its five-star rating for its top-notch functionality, sleek design, and helpful contribution to today's simplified lifestyle.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"163 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1692921600000}

Over the years we gave up on choosing cds so its been teh same cd for the alarm for a decade, which he complained about but was not willing to choose a cd.  Meanwhile it got harder and harder to see the time - not sure if my eyes got older or if the leds started to die.  but it got to the point where this thing takes up SO much space on my bedside table and is regularly annoying me.I dont have any other amazon alexa items.  I just was getting used to google assistant on my pixel.  But this little speaker was super easy to set up.  I only have the free amazon prime music with my prime account, but I was able to tell the dot to set an alarm for 7 am and play a song by (one of my husband's favorite artists), and then go into my phone and make it repeat for weekdays.  So, i wont have to remember to turn it on and off every friday\/sunday.  Woot!He didnt seem to appreciate it (grumpy old man) tho he did admit it was easier to wake up to a song he actually likes.  and i realized I can listen to NPR while i do any cleaning in my room.We all dont really like noise - we rarely watch a show together and all of us use headphones in public spaces.  So i cant imagine getting more of these.  But as a replacement for a 21 year old Bose CD alarm clock? I think its a HUGE upgrade!  Easier to read by a huge margin, too.Oh and it glowed yellow and i was panicking - that was too bright for sleeping - but all good, it was just telling me my amazon packages were delivered.Now I need to go check out some sleep activities!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707436800000}

However, I do want to call out the Tech Support person Vijay who spent quite a bit of time assisting via a chat.  Very patient and helpful.  Thank you!Update 3\/8\/2024 - I would not purchase this item again nor any of the Amazon devices based on the issues with this item and the poor technical support I've received thus far.  I've moved it to 4 different places in my home, rebooted it & my home network.  It continues to randomly turn off when playing Amazon Music.  I'm not having issues with any other device and do not have many devices running.  I've asked for it to turn off after a certain number of hours and also, as tech support suggested, even asked to play in an endless loop (which as I told them made no sense).  Also ensured my Alexa software is updated.  Seems this is a known issue with this item. I'm going to do a factory reset which is all that's left other than returning it.....which will be the first time I've had to return anything I've ordered.  I hope the return process is easier than this has been.Update 2\/11 - This Echo still does not continue playing music as expected.  I can give a turn off command of a XX hours and it will turn off way before then.  I've restarted it, moved it, etc and still continues to be problematic.  It can not be my network as this is the only device I have an issue with.This is the first Echo product I've purchased. and I must admit the sound from this is very nice.  My primary use of it is to play music and it sounds excellent.  I am having a problem with the music shutting off.  No rhyme nor reason nor specific amount of time.  I've just tested it to see if i can give a turn off time \"Alexa turn music off at XXXX time\" so see if that helps.  I have no issues with my WiFi and have very few devices running so can't be the issue.  Lastly and most importantly, my dog is afraid of the Alexa voice coming from the Echo.  I've tried to acclimate her slowly and introduce her to the sound of it (with the music) without her hearing Alexa voice.  She does ok until she hears Alexa voice and she's still afraid of it.

Having purchased said product (two to be exact) in March 2023, my initial enthusiasm stemmed from a prior positive encounter with an earlier iteration that had been gifted to me by a relative. However, the two products I purchased failed to measure up to my expectations.Foremost among the setbacks was the product's persistent inability to establish a connection with my WiFi network. This led me to engage my service provider, whose extensive troubleshooting endeavors unequivocally attributed the issue to the product itself. Regrettably, despite their conscientious efforts, a resolution remained elusive. Subsequent recourse to the product's customer service department yielded a similar outcome: both products I had acquired were indeed flawed per the customer representative's attempt to rectify the issue.Of equal perturbation is not solely the inherent flaw of the products in question, but also the circuitous and convoluted refund process. What was once a straightforward refund procedure has now transformed into a profoundly arduous ordeal to receive my money. This unfortunate state of affairs stands in stark contrast to my years of being an Amazon customer. Regrettably, this situation has left an indelible negative impression, compounded by recent reviews highlighting the persistence of similar concerns\/dissatisfaction among other customers.In conclusion, this sequence of events has engendered a discernible disaffection and disillusionment that contradicts the previously solid foundation of trust and satisfaction I had cultivated as an Amazon Prime subscriber.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691452800000}

Continues to cut in and out, and I never know if I am going to make it through a playlist or even a song.Purchased from Best Buy in December and have had constant problems with this device.  It constantly loses the connection to the Wi-Fi.

I constantly check my Wi-Fi signal and it is strong in all rooms, so my only conclusion is that the device is just no good. I also do not run more than 3 devices at one time.I have decided to add to this that, while a tech support person called me and we discussed the issues, they also told me they would call me back on a certain date and time, and guess what?

I\u2019m sure that because it defaults to calling through the internet. But I have it bluetoothed to my dads phone as well and it won\u2019t call through the phone, only through the internet. I don\u2019t understand why they put a cap on the number of phone numbers it can call from. Obviously Alexa to Alexa is free.  But that requires the other person to have one which many will not. It is so simple. \u201cAlexa call\u201d. But he\u2019s blind and cannot see and I had to have him choose 10 phone numbers to use. For any others he has to call a nurse at the assisted living to dial for him. I called their tech support hoping maybe we could pay $5 a month or whatever. Also asked if prime members have this same limitation. And they do. This is a serious hindrance to an early perfect decide for visually impaired people. I guess that\u2019s why the association for the blind in his town recommended the iPhone and apple home pod. But his jitterbug phone bill is $25 a month and his phone was $100. And the echo dot was $60. I love apple ecosystem. But it\u2019s way expensive for a blind man of 93 on a fixed income. We are using the echo dot and it is working for him. But he\u2019s limited to being able to call only 10 of his friends through the device.Second challenge is there is no way for the incoming calls to his cell phone to route through to the echo dot so he can answer the incoming calls to his phone. Even collected through Bluetooth he needs to manipulate the phone which he cannot. On the apple devices this is not a problem. It\u2019s all seamless.It\u2019s too bad.

I've added many smart devices and have created rooms, groups and routines within Alexa. These devices can be controlled by our Echo Show or Echo Dot.Focusing on the Echo Dot: By adding an Echo Dot in our \"owners suite\" (avoiding the previously used term for the same location), I've extended the Alexa functionality further.  The Dot has surprisingly good sound for it's size.  Not saying Bose quality, but very good.  We went with the Dot model with a clock to completely eliminate the need for an alarm clock in the room.  You can listen to iHeartRadio, Pandora, SiriusXM or Spotify on the Dot (or Show).  Depending upon the service, it will scroll artist and song info on the screen.  If you ask for the weather it provides you with the weather and scrolls the high and low temps on the Dot.  The Dot has a temperature sensor that you can query.  If you ask for the indoor temperature it averages the temp on a Nest thermostat and the Dot.  Or, you can ask for the individual temperatures.  You can also adjust the temperature settings on your Nest thermostat from your Dot (or Show).The only \"negative\" is with the brightness of the \"screen\".  The lights\/dots are perfect when the room is illuminated (the dots are brighter).  When the room is less bright the dots are less bright.  In a dark room the dots are a little dimmer than we'd like.  I am going to play to see what settings are available to address this modest concern.Overall, I am very happy with our Echo Dot (and Echo Show)!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701648000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great for programming things around the house! But a few adjustments would be nice.","reviewDescription":"I have several Amazon Alexas. This one was a need for the new house, so that I had a speaker in one of the new rooms. I use the The echo for things like: Turning on or off the lights, playing music, weather, and the clock face on the front. The devices is a helpful little thing to have around. it can run routine (So It can turn of lights after you've left your house, start or stop music for kids or pets, all on a timer. And can make simple tasks simpler. It does have a mute button as well (So it stops listening to you) Which is nice, too.The only complaints I have about the alexa device is:-It's biased. I don't know what I was expecting from an amazon product. If I needed to know where I can watch a specific movie, the alexa will tell me \"For rent on Amazon for 3.99 or purchase for 14.99\" When What I wanted was a list of places. I ask google the same question and id get a much less biased response. \"Disney plus, Youtube, Vudu, Amazon prime, Google play movies\" Etc. That's what I wanted to know.-Alexa pops in on convos: These devices are a little tricky and only let you name them of a select few options. So if you talk about Computers a lot and you name your device computer, it will pick up on it. Same with Alexa, and echo. Sometimes, the device recognizes the conversation was not for it and will simply disregard the command. and sometimes it will pick up on what you said and assume you asked something. In which your conversation will be interrupted by \"Bob ross was born on October 29th, 1942 -\" (We weren't even talking about bob ross which was pretty funny XD) Not gonna lie, it can be fun. but it can also be inconvenient.-Echo does not call 911.Which I thought would be kind of a cool option incase you got in some issue and needed help, where you couldn't reach a phone yourself. (Im not elderly and struggle some with this issue, but I thought it was kinda sucky that it couldn't do that.) It can call contacts and your own phone though! So if you need to find your phone and you have it programmed to, you can say \"Alexa, find my phone\" And it'll call you.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703721600000}

Move over, roosters\u2014I've got Alexa telling me the time with the enthusiasm of a caffeinated morning person.Pros:1. **Clock with Sass:** Forget your average wall clock; this Echo Dot's clock has attitude. It's like having a personal time announcer who's always on point. \"Hey, sleepyhead, it's time to rise and shine!\" Alexa says, as if it knows I hit snooze three times already.2. **Soundtrack to My Existence:** Not only does this little gadget tell me the time, but it also serenades me with my favorite tunes. It's like having a DJ who's attuned to my mood. Need some pump-up music for the day? Just ask, and Alexa's got you covered.3. **Dimmable Smartness:** The clock's display is dimmable, which is fantastic for those nights when even the smallest glimmer of light is an intruder in your quest for the perfect sleep. It's like having a night light that adjusts to your nocturnal whims.Cons:1. **Sudden Sass Attacks:** Sometimes, Alexa's responses are just a tad too sassy. I asked her to play some chill vibes, and she replied, \"Sure thing, chill master. Anything else, or can I continue being the DJ you never knew you needed?\" Easy there, Alexa, I just wanted some background music, not a roast.2. **The Clock Can't Make Coffee:** As much as I wish my Echo Dot could double as a barista, it's strictly a time-telling, music-playing genius. I asked, \"Alexa, make me coffee,\" and all I got was a polite suggestion to visit the kitchen. Maybe in the 6th Gen, Amazon?3. **Clock-Watching Addiction:** With the clock right there on my nightstand, it's impossible not to check the time every five minutes. It's like having a miniature time portal that I can't resist gazing into. Productivity plummeted, but at least I know exactly how much time I wasted.In conclusion\u2014oops, I almost broke the no-conclusion rule\u2014this Echo Dot with a clock is more than a bedside timekeeper; it's a witty companion that adds a touch of charm (and occasional cheekiness) to your daily routine. Just don't expect it to make your coffee or hold back on the sass\u2014it's a clock, not a miracle worker.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"70 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700524800000}

The clock face has changed from being on a darker colored device (the gen 4 dot with the red ring which is a darker blue color) with more solid numbers to a dot style clock, with a lighter device color, so there is less contrast between the color of the text and the color of the device. I have the \"darker\" of the 2 available color options, which has a very slight grayish color vs the other option, a white color. The dot style text is harder to read if you have any sort of visual impairments or processing issues, and can appear blurry. The dot style font's added spacing between the dots makes it harder to read the numbers without them blurring together or appearing as one blob with visual processing problems or impairments.My gen 4 stopped working properly after about a year (which is about as long as these devices seem to work without beginning to have major issues) but I'm going to have to keep it for the clock function for now, because the gen 5 is much more difficult to read.Overall, I'm really disappointed that the big titular feature of this device was made less accessible and there is no option or way to make the font different or to add more contrast between text color and device color.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1689206400000}

Every improvements of Alexa seems more like a new feature that was integrated, but not something that is created because it understands what my habits etc. are. Example: Living in Europe, it still cannot tell me when the train leaves from the nearest station.As a non-native English speaker (well, it also has difficulties to understand my Irish friend), there is still a fair amount of questions that are answered with \"I don't know that\" or \"Here's what I have found on Wikipedia\".So overall Alexa is suitable to turn on a device as a timer or alike. But I am not into searching for jokes. I'd like advice on things and Alexa would be so convenient to do so - if it could.Another example: The clock is too bright at night (and even in automatic mode) - and interestingly for a smart device it can not turned of at night only. It's these little things that point out that it is not intelligent, maybe smart in the sense of being able to understand spoken language - but then it doesn't know what to do with it.The app is still central to for some configurations that I'd like to do on the device or by voice.

We use the normal Echo almost exclusively for the temp sensor to trigger the AC or a Space heater depending on the season. In the device settings you can check the temp, and are also prompted to set routines using the temp sensor, but when you go to create a routine for it the device doesn't show up.Also, your option for the clock seem to be always on or always off. I was assuming that the proximity sensor would be able to trigger it turning off or on, but that doesn't seem to be the case either.The promotional images also show the clock face displaying the temp. My dot has never done this either.On the plus side the sound quality is better than my 3rd gen Echo Dots. It's marginal, but I do notice it. But even then I'd rather use my Stereo Paired 4th gen Echos with the Echo Sub, so there's no point to use it for that either.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670371200000}

What it really needs is the ability to control the volume of Alexa separate from media being played. Alexa is always too loud when the media is at a normal level. (I know they're 'separate' on the phone and the unit, but you'll see what I mean. A low volume setting on the unit gives a small range for volume on your phone, so you it turn up on the dot and now Alexa is booming loud.) After five generations, you'd think they'd do better.

We are very disappointed because it is so difficult to see the time even when we have it on the highest setting of 10 brightness. The numbers are small and difficult to see. At first, we thought it was the brightness, but even when we turned it up to 10, it was still very dim. The clock is in our living room and we sit about 9-10 ft from it in the evening in a relatively dim room.

It may work very nice on a nightstand right next to your bed, which would make the time very easy to see.

{"reviewTitle":"Unfortunately, Could Not Get Past The Display","reviewDescription":"I have two 4th Generation Echo Dots with Clock Display, and I absolutely LOVE them!  I was excited to order the 5th generation...but my excitement quickly turned to frustration with the clock display.First, the display is too blocky.  Every number or letter is composed of large dots leading to squared corners. Although it is a bigger display, I think it is harder to read and not very attractive.  The previous version has rounded corners and is much easier to read.The worst issue for me is the brightness of the display.  The Echo Dot does not auto-adjust the brightness like my other two 4th generation Echo Dots.  I could turn on the room light, and the clock would get brighter to make it more visible.  Also, when I turned off the room light, the clock display would dim to a very appropriate level.  The 5th generation Echo Dot does not do this.  I have tried adjusting the brightness level so the Echo Dot can \"learn\" my preference, but the feature is a failure.  I have to manually go into the app to adjust the display at night because it brightens up the room regardless of the light adjusting around it.  I never had to use the app to adjust the display on my other two Dots.I have not tried the other new features with this 5th generation version.  I am sure they are great, but I will be returning this item.  Hopefully, the next Echo Dot release will fix the clock display.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676246400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Downgrade in sound quality. Stick with the previous generation.","reviewDescription":"I wanted to replace the previous generation dot in my master bathroom with one that has a clock. Trade-in program made that a reasonable option. Coincidentally, the day that I looked on Amazon is the day they released this new generation for pre-order.Form factor is almost identical to the previous. Features are good. Display is now a dot matrix, which is definitely more flexible in terms of what it can display. But two things keep me from recommending this speaker:1) Poor sound quality versus the previous dot (in the same exact location and environment as my old one). Fine for podcasts, but music sounds like the bit rate is heavily compressed. Highs are harsh and uneven, and they don't extend much. Mids are messy. Bass is decent enough for the size of the speaker, comparable to the last one. One of the biggest grievances is the compression (not only of bit rate, but also of tone and volume). Even with the EQ set totally flat and at low\/moderate volume, you can hear the speaker constantly adjusting to prevent overdriving the little speaker. I've dialed the bass on mine almost all the way down and it still has a boomy and compressy sound to it. Ultimately, it just sounds like a cheap speaker subject to way too much processing to make it sound almost adequate to most casual listeners. My old one sounded WAY cleaner.. Even enjoyable. I previously never felt compelled to bring another speaker into my bathroom, but now I want to. But....2) They got rid of the 3.5mm output. Now your only option for improving the mediocre sound quality is to pair to a Bluetooth speaker, which, in my experience, is wonky at best. If your device shows up at all (my Klipsch One II from my kitchen does not), you'll likely run into the issue of the speaker automatically shutting down after not receiving a signal for a while.So ultimately, I regret this purchase. Stick with the previous generation. If you can utilize the trade program more than once, I'll likely trade this one for the old one, despite still having a couple 1st and 2nd generation devices. This is the one that disappoints.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668384000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Problem Integrating With Ring Cameras","reviewDescription":"The Echo Dot version 5 has a serious problem integrating with the Ring camera system.  When linking the doorbell and\/or stick up Ring cameras to Alexa the audible Ring notifications go to the Echo Dot and not to your IPhone.  This means that when you are away from home your Echo Dot will be announcing the notifications to an empty room while your IPhone is silent.  There is no provision in the Alexa software to send verbal notifications to both your IPhone and to the Echo Dot.  The only way to work around this is to unclick the notifications to the Echo Dot in the Alexa software. That way you continue to get verbal notifications on your IPhone but not on the Echo Dot.  This seems like a software problem that could be easily solved but it has not.  I contacted Amazon support and they confirmed that there is no fix except to turn off notifications from to the Echo Dot for each camera.  Otherwise the device seems to be working properly.Update:  I tried to continue using the Echo Dot with the Ring alarm system bypassing the cameras.  The Echo Dot makes itself part of the Ring alarm system by listening for loud noises and then sounding a separate alarm on the Echo Dot if it hears something. The Echo Dot is in my bedroom.  My Ring alarm system is in an adjacent guest house.  When I arm the Ring alarm system for \"Away\" the Echo Dot makes itself part of that system and alarms whenever I move around in the main house.  The only way to fix this problem, according to Ring and Alexa, is to disable the Ring alarm in the Echo Dot.  This defeats the purpose of using the Echo Dot to communicate with the Ring system so I am sending the Echo Dot back.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1672185600000}

I got this and it\u2019s like two in one. I will end up getting a separate Bluetooth speaker since this has to stay plugged into the wall but I can connect my Spotify through the app and it will play my music that way. You can turn the ring light off through the app (I think it\u2019s the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d feature) and still ask Alexa for whatever you need. Before, I was flipping my old alarm clock on its face to keep the light from bothering me but now I can ask Alexa the time, turn the display on and off, and ask for the weather all from my bed and without getting on my phone. Alexa is shockingly good at hearing what I\u2019m asking for even if I\u2019m not talking loud or on the other side of the room which is nice so I can keep the noise down so as to not bother my roommate.

My favorite part is the display. Being able to look over and see the time has let me remove multiple clocks from my home just for that reason. I also love that there is a feature to dim the display when the lights are out (especially in the bedroom when trying to go to sleep).Even though I've had these for 2 months, I just seen that some questions are also answered with text on the display, such as weather, measurement conversions, most math equations, spellings of words, and even what music is being played.If you want to get an Echo Dot or upgrade the one(s) you currently have, I highly recommend this generation, just for the endless options.

Suggestions that it may be cause by \"poor wifi\" or proximity to the router make no sense, because my wife has a gen 3 device in next room, which is further away, and it continues to work without interruption.
