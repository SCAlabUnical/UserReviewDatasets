{"reviewTitle":"A major step up from a PS4 PRO (and previously, PS3)......faster and better graphics....","reviewDescription":"UPDATE 1\/26\/2024:After using the 4K DVD player functions of the PS5, I've got to say that the over-all quality of resolution and clarity of 4K Blu-Rays beats my stand-alone 4K DVD player by a lot! The PS5 has a a very clear, noise-free output that simply excels for graphics, gameplay or whatever the PS5 is displaying. Sony did a superb job with the video output hardware of this 4K console and it will not disappoint. My stand-alone 4K player s currently in storage. If you want to see 4K Blu-ray media at its very best, the PS5 is the way to go for a do-it-all console!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm not going to review the Amazon selection or delivery process. I'm just going to briefly review about why I upgraded to a PS5!First the negative....... my PRO was compact and reasonably designed in a flat symmetrical style......  The PS5 throws out the space saving rule book in favor of waves and advanced looking style and it'll not fit where your PS4 PRO was if it was in a tight space.Be aware that although the PS4 and PS4 PRO had 4K HDMI output for games, those PS4 models were limited to playing only 1080 Blu-Ray or regular definition DVDs.  The PS4 will not play 4K Blu-Ray disks. Why Sony left that feature out, who knows!  The good news is the PS5 DVD deck plays 4K movies to their full resolution. (as well of course as Blu-Ray 1080 and lower resolution\/standard def DVDs). Now I only need my PS5 in the living room to cover it all rather then the 4K blu-ray player I had to use along with my PS4 PRO.I own several PS4 games and have yet to purchase any PS5 games.Let me say that my PS4 games play better on the PS5 then they did on the PS4 PRO. Graphics are superior, speed to access any menu or just in game play is much faster and these PS4 games take on a new and improved view on screen on my 65\" 4K hdtv!I can only imagine how great games specifically designed for the PS5 will be to view and play.My initial perspective on the PS5 compared to my PS4 PRO is that although the body design for the PS5 sacrifices space and fit for cosmetics...... the PS5 blows away my PS4 PRO (my PS4 PRO is using an upgraded 2 TB SSD for more capacity and much faster access\/read speed than a spinning hard drive).....Speaking of SSDs and upgrades; the PS4 used the common SATA 2.5\" internal SSD for upgrading capacity and speed. (But) The PS5 has a soldered in ~860GB internal SSD which can not be removed. Sony added one slot for expanding the hard drive capacity using rather a plug-in PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD over a conventional SATA connected hard drive. Thus, the PS5 allows you to not replace the original hard drive, but, to add an additional on-board SSD instead.Typically, the soldered-in or card type SSDs are a bit faster then using a SATA based protocol connection and given the PS5 requires a very fast solid state hard drive, they designed it so you install an additional PCIe type SSD over replacing just the single hard drive as it was done in the PS4.Be advised that (some) PS5 games take 2-3X more capacity then a PS4 game did. Perhaps why Sony designed the PS5 to add more capacity by using a second expansion slot rather then like the PS4 just having only one slot to use for the total capacity.Google PS5 SSD upgrades and there's much info out there regarding how many games you want to be able to store on the console and how large an upgrade you need to do accordingly!Everything on the PS5 is faster........everything......menu, access, games ...graphics are better in detail, clarity.......I could go on.The other thing the PS5 asks you to do when you first set it up is a complete setup for display for best gamma, brightness, contrast, color, etc......it takes you through a complete and easy set up to -maximize- the quality for display on your HDTV. It made a huge difference on my Samsung 65 inch 4K TV.5 Stars all around! Read the pro AND owner\/user reviews on this new PS console. Yes, it is worth upgrading.The ps5 is a totally new and better gaming console. It's the first to be backward compatible with PS4 games, ...something my PS4 PRO would not allow for my PS3 games. So if you have a PS4 game collection, don't get rid of them!If you own a PS3, PS4 or PS4 PRO, yes, it is a worthwhile upgrade and substantial evolution for the PS Game Console series. You will not be sorry for upgrading and a big upgrade it will be!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"188 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671926400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Crazy-Fast Delivery. Console Works Perfectly. Glad These are Easier to Buy Now.","reviewDescription":"If there's a chance for you to order one of these and get 1-Day shipping, I highly recommend that. Mine was delivered in perfect condition and it worked amazingly well out-of-the-box. Overall 5 stars.In case there are any buyers out there that want one of these and are new to how they work, or want to know how to set it up best for their family, here are some things to know:1. The God of War Ragnark\u00f6k game comes as a digital code, so expect that versus the physical game (I thought it would be a disc, but that's probably because my expectations of bundles are still stuck in the PS3 era). I redeemed my code, but I've not loaded the game yet (when it's nearly 100 GB, I'm going to wait on this until I've earned the Platinum of Final Fantasy VII Remake).2. The controller works REALLY well and the charging cord is efficient, though if you can get a dedicated charging stand, that wouldn't hurt since the cord can sometimes be finicky. I think these can be purchased for $25ish, so if you have the cash to spare, that's a worthwhile addition (it also apparently helps the battery life of the controller).3. If you're new to how the PS5 works, here's one thing to keep in mind: PS5 games can only be played if they're stored in Console Storage. If you plug in an external drive, PS5 games stored there cannot be played. Doing that just saves you the hassle of reinstalling them. From what I under, internal storage is expandable, but you need to buy a special hard drive chip-thing dedicated for the PS5 to make this work. I've not invested in this yet, so if you stick to the storage you have, prioritize the PS5 games you want to play.3.5. If you use an external drive, have that be dedicated to your old PS4 games. They'll play like a dream.4. When it came to transferring console data, it was done within an evening for me. If you're starting fresh on the console, don't worry, but if you are transferring data from a PS4, expect to play your games to be playable in about 2-4 hours. Make sure to look up guides if you've never done the transfer before. Videos are also really good resources, too. Also, definitely use an ethernet cable to help with the process.5. Make sure Game Sharing is turned on if you have a family. This is buried in the settings, but if you find it, this will allow you to have the various profiles play the games the others have bought. Save you money from re-buying a game all over again.6. The disc drive can run loud when it's first loading up the game. It'll make you wonder, \"is it ok?!\" Don't worry. It is actually ok.Those are the big things I think are handy to be aware of before buying one of these. Overall, I have no complaints. It's done everything I've wanted it to and it's helped my brothers and I play together far more easily.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"142 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1680652800000}

{"reviewTitle":"A Mix of Excellence and Disappointment","reviewDescription":"The PlayStation PS5 Console \u2013 God of War Ragnar\u00f6k Bundle is undoubtedly an enticing package for any gaming enthusiast. The combination of powerful performance, stunning design, and a highly anticipated game like God of War Ragnar\u00f6k is hard to resist. However, my experience with this console has been a blend of delight and disappointment.Outstanding Design and Performance:Let's start with the positive aspects. The design of the PS5 is nothing short of exceptional. It's a true eye-catcher with its futuristic aesthetics and sleek contours. In terms of performance, this console delivers in spades, providing a truly immersive gaming experience. The visuals and speed are top-notch, making every gaming session a joy.HDMI Port Woes:My disappointment arises from an unexpected flaw: the HDMI port. After just six months of use, I encountered issues with the HDMI port. It's disheartening to invest over $500 in a premium gaming console only to find out that an additional $120 was needed to fix a recurring problem. It was even more disheartening when I learned that this issue is not unique to my console but has affected many users.In conclusion, the PlayStation PS5 Console \u2013 God of War Ragnar\u00f6k Bundle offers an amazing gaming experience in terms of design and performance. However, the frustration caused by the HDMI port issues is undeniable. Sony's reputation for quality products makes such an oversight disappointing.

As for the system, it was easy to set-up and it works terrific, but the games take forever to download. I am used to plugging in a system, inserting a disk and playing within minutes. The game I downloaded for this system took about an hour. Even a game I bought on disk took several minutes to download before I could play.

So, imagine my excitement when I got my hands on the God of War Ragnar\u00f6k Bundle! It was like a dream come true, until it turned into a nightmare.For the first year, everything was fantastic. I was blown away by the graphics, the speed, and the overall experience. But then, exactly one year from the purchase date, disaster struck. Out of nowhere, my beloved PS5 started acting up. It would power on, only to shut down after a mere 2-5 seconds. Just like that, my gaming sessions were abruptly cut short.I tried everything to fix it. I checked cables, I prayed to the gaming gods, I even attempted some questionable DIY tricks I found online. But alas, nothing worked. It was dead, Jim.To make matters worse, the warranty expired just as this issue reared its ugly head. Coincidence? I think not. It's like Sony programmed the thing to self-destruct right after the warranty period ended.Now, I'm left with a glorified paperweight and a heavy heart. All those memories, all those unfinished games... gone. It's not just about the money; it's the emotional investment I had in this console.So, if you're considering buying the PS5 God of War Ragnar\u00f6k Bundle, proceed with caution.

Either way, I'm not satisfied and returned it. Well its been 10 days and nothing yet as I still have no confirmation that they have received it. My UPS tracker says they received it 6 days ago in AZ.

Heard the disc drive make a loud noise and was almost certain that it wasn't supposed to (never had a PS5 so I wasn't positive). Turns out I was right, as I was setting the console up, it told me to insert a game disc and it would not allow me to insert one without resistance. All of the troubleshooting involved taking the console apart... No thanks.Also, I didn't even realize it until now that I'm sitting down and thinking about it because I never even really got though setting up the console, but I never even found the code for God of War in the box.So I was sent an incomplete box with a defective or maybe previously used PS5 (I say that because when I went and got one from Walmart, it had two stickers to open the box, one being a holographic PlayStation sticker. The one I received from Amazon did not have the holographic one so I can only assume it was previously opened).So instead of getting my console and being able to enjoy the last few days playing, I had to wait and spend another $600 to get a working console. And who knows how long it'll take to get the refund, so as of now I have what amounts to a $1200 PS5 until I get it. Will never buy a console online again, not worth the risk. Just go get it in person even if you have to wait longer for whatever reason.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676592000000}

{"reviewTitle":"The PS5 is great. But the controllers already having pro lems after barely a month.","reviewDescription":"1st, I'd like to say I love my new Playstation 5. All the games I had for PS4 are compatible and can be played on it. That's the only thing I cared about console wise. However I bought the console in December 2022. It's now January of 2023 and I'm already having problems with the controllers.1. The left bumper gets stuck after I press it. It doesn't look stuck so I don't usually notice until Kratos decides to throw his axe randomly.2. There seems to be some sort of delay\/ controller drift with the right stick.3. I don't see the point of the Duel sense controller. It looks good, but I don't particularly like it when the triggers vibrate. It might make the triggers more prone to malfunctions. But that's more of a personal gripe I guess.If anyone knows how I can get the controller fixed or replaced please comment with the contact info. I can't play God of War Ragnorock till these problems are fixed. Also you can use the ps4 controller for the homescreen but not any games? Why Sony?Anyway all and all console is great controller is crap4\/10.

Playstation exclusives are some of the best games available.It's really hard to see all of the rave reviews of games like God of War, Spiderman, The Last Of Us, Horizon, and a whole lot more, only to have to wait months or years for them to be released on PC.2. It's already optimized.Coming as a guy who waited to get into PC gaming for a long time, I guess I didn't realize how much time I'd started to spend tweaking graphics settings and finding the perfect balance between visual fidelity and high framerates. Playstation knows exactly how to run each game so that it's as perfect as it can be.3. That controller tho...I've heard people brag about the controller and it's haptics. It wasn't until I tried it that I finally understood. I'm still not sure if I find it too gimmicky or if I genuinely enjoy it, but the utter glee that welled up the first time I pulled the trigger and it had variable resistance was definitely a great experience.4.

{"reviewTitle":"Next Gen Gaming console","reviewDescription":"Full disclosure I have been looking for this since the PS5 was released. I wanted the disc version in order to upload\/play PS4 games using the backward compatibility. But I was not going to pay more than MSRP for this. Had multiple opportunities to purchase one for $800 or more, but turned them down.With tax I paid a little over $600 for this console bundled with God of War: Ragnarok. That was a very fair deal.Graphics are amazing. I have it hooked to a 4K 120hz refresh LED TV and the picture is beautiful. Games load fast because of the internal SSD drive. Running the audio through a 700 watt 7.2 surround sound system, and the console allows you to customize those settings based on speaker placement. Audio is outstanding. Transferring data from my PS4 to the PS5 did take a little longer than expected, even on a gigabit network. I suspect that was due to the limits of the PS4 network card, but can't prove it one way or another. All in all, setup and transfer of data took about 4 hours.PS4 games run upscaled look great, but there is still a huge difference in the graphics for a PS5 release.The way Amazon did the sale via invite only was great. No trying to beat bots. Didn't have to worry about getting it in my cart and have it disappear when I submitted the payment. Amazon nailed this sale process.Sign up for the Amazon invite if you are still trying to get a PS5 and don't want to pay upcharges through other sellers or resellers.

I have almost a month of play on mine and it\u2019s running great. I immediately got upgrades for mine. Camo plates with better ventilation, cooling fans (highly recommend this no matter how long you play for), and LED lights.The first thing I noticed is how fast things load up. From the time you turn it on- your actually playing your loaded game in less than 45 seconds. Plus updates and initial game loads - none of them have been over 20 minutes. I remember PS4 days where game updates and initial load times took HOURS!!! So much so that I always knew I\u2019d be playing the game either the next day or later in the day if things were kicked off in the morning.Graphics are a massive improvement. Even for remastered PS4 games.The controller improvements are substantially better too. The new haptics are much better.Overall PS5 is a major improvement over PS4.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll buy any consoles or actually any games from Amazon anymore. This and their preorder failures have made me consider other options.

{"reviewTitle":"terrible ergonomics otherwise solid new console","reviewDescription":"The unit\/box is huge and aesthetically unappealing. That makes it difficult to place on and around your entertainment center, particularly if your setup is in a room that sees a lot of guests. More frustrating is that the curvature makes the unit awkward to place. The circular stand doesn\u2019t have a secured attachment point when in horizontal mode, and I\u2019ve already had it slip off while trying to access the back panel USB ports. Lastly, the curved top means you have to be incredibly careful even temporarily placing objects on top, such as the CD case or PS5 controller while load a disc into the system.System OS and controller ergos continue to be superior to those of the Xbox line. I have not played anything on either the Xbox Series X or PS5 that could not have been played without complaint on the previous generation consoles. We\u2019re what? 1? 2? years into these releases, and while load times are clearly faster, I find myself playing significantly more PS4 titles (ports) than games truly made for PS5, and the same is true for Xbox, so my recommendation as of January 2023 is chill on trying to get your hands on these new gen consoles. At the moment, their appeal is more of a mirage than real - like bragging rights that you were finally able to get one.FWIW, my assessment of the games is based on gameplay using a 77\u201d LG C2 OLED with HDMI 2.1 and a 7.1 ch surround system powered by a Denon AVR-930H. I certainly have the hardware to take advantage of next gen console gaming, but as I said, there\u2019s nothing to play that makes the experience palpably better than previous gen consoles\u2026yet. So still no rush to buy this thing. I would try to hold off until SONY releases a slim version, hopefully in early 2024. Good luck. Have fun.edit: unlike Xbox, games cannot be played directly from external drives, so while you can download and store them on a USB drive, you still have to manually copy games onto the internal drive, which also means having to decide what to remove to make room for the new game. it\u2019s unnecessarily inconvenient in my opinion, but it\u2019s typical of sony and nintendo who are both more guarded and restrictive than microsoft.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673568000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Excellent Upgrade From The PS4! No physical copy of the game","reviewDescription":"I'll start off by saying that I really like this console so far! The menus are smooth, and the gameplay (at least on the included God of War: Ragnarok) is smooth and responsive.The setup of the console was easy, although I did need a small flat-head screwdriver in order to carefully pry out the screw-hole cap that you need to remove in order to screw the console into the vertical mount. After that, attaching the vertical mount to the console was a breeze and I really like the look of having the console standing upright. It also feels sturdy enough that Im not worried about it tipping over.The controller is a massive improvement to gaming controllers as a whole. The adaptive triggers alone can add an entirely different experience to playing a game. I haven't found this feature used very often in God of War yet, but the included \"Astros Playroom\" introduces this feature, and gives you some scenarios to play where this feature is showed-off a bit more, and it's really fun. It adds a new level of immersion that I wouldn't have even thought of to the controller. The haptic feedback vibrations are a nice feature as well. Having more intense and involved forms of vibrations from the controller helps with the immersion as well.The package I purchased came with the God of War: Ragnarok game and, like the description of the item (and other reviews) mention, it does have the digital version included. This is one of my biggest complaints, is that I wish that they had just gone with including the physical copy. Downloading the game wasn't too long of a process, but having the physical copy to have and collect would have been nice without having to purchase a separate physical copy (which I won't be doing myself). Especially for those who collect video games\/manuals\/etc.Overall, I'm glad to have gotten the opportunity to get this, considering all the shortages.

Granted I didn't have too many expectations.  Graphics are definitely a step up from the PS4. Faster load times for sure. Controllers are comfortable and familiar with a few added features such as vibrating triggers and a built in microphone.  Some not so great things about it could be led by the ridiculously expensive cost to add on to this already expensive machine.  Standard controllers start at 79usd before sales and discounts.  The built in memory storage is pretty lame and it costs upwards from 100usd and beyond to upgrade to any quality internal ssd.  Lots of good options out there for that though so pick and choose as you'd like.  Don't even get me started on the PSVR2 price tag!! If that's your thing.  I mean overall, the PS5 is next gen and it is fun, but at what cost.  However, at this point in the PS5's existence, I don't feel like my PS4 is obsolete yet. Mostly everything that the PS5 has, is just a tad better than what the PS4 offers.  If you're on the fence about the next gen systems but not suffering from FOMO(fear of missing out) then go ahead and wait a little longer.  Nothing super extraordinary about the PS5 yet.

Overall the process was simple and relatively painless, but annoying this needed to be done on arrival and needed to wait another 2 weeks to use the console.

For example, on one occasion I defeated two easy attackers and a 3rd very difficult one only to turn around and the very same 3 attackers jumped me again...and again...etc. I did escape and just avoided that confrontation, only to later encounter the \"Flame Phantom\" ( difficult to beat ) and, once again, I moved my character a few feet and out he jumped again! In tracking one of the dragons, I beat 2 trolls (protecting the path to the dragon showdown) possessed by 2 pixie-type villains (Nokkens) and, as I left the arena, I could hear a Nokken resume his chant and atroll growling again--I returned to fight again, only the pixie was frozen in place and invulnerable and the troll proceeded to bash my brains out at leisure...so, I cannot beat the troll(s) and cannot fight the dragon.In ALL these cases, I tried reloading checkpoints, restarting the console, reloading earlier saves, to no avail. Today, I tried pursuing the adventure with one of the other main characters (Atreus) but he got stuck with Thor in a dead-end ice tunnel that is supposed to open up when you point a mask object at it, but does not open up...meanwhile, villains continuously jump out of the ground and walls and proceed to bash my brains out.I prefer games that give me a fighting chance not get my brains bashed out.I am attempting a new download (which takes hours) and will try again. It's too bad...turned out to be so disappointing. If the new download changes things, I will update this post.UPDATE2 days after I wrote the above, an update downloaded to my game when I opened it. I am v happy to say that the update resolved ALL the issues I had, so I changed my rating from 2 to 5...definitely the best game I have ever played!N","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"37 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1674432000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great price, great bundle, not so great design.","reviewDescription":"For those who actually care, there are three models of the PS5. A 1000, 1100 and 1200 series. The 1200 model actually uses less energy to prevent it from overheating and its lightest version of the PS5. In the product description it says this bundle comes with a 1100 model PS5. However, when I got mine it was actually the 1200 model. Which makes sense since it was so hard to keep PS5s in stock that most of the ones you see now WILL be the 1200 version unless you buy it used.I purchased mine when it went on sale for $509, which was an unbelievable price. That means you\u2019re getting God of War for $10! My only complaint is that Sony didn\u2019t put any special designs on the console or the controller to indicate this was a God of War bundle. Sony have released themed consoles in the past and I was hoping that this would be one. They actually did create a God of a War themed controller but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t come with the bundle, which is a shame because it\u2019s pretty cool looking.Lastly I\u2019m a person who used all of my Xbox\u2019s as media hubs for watching Tv and movies. After hearing how PS5s were overhearing I was worried about leaving my PS5 on all day. Though I just got my PS5, I have friends who use theirs in the same fashion and they have not had any issues from their system overheating. They use their systems to watch Tv and game, it\u2019s set to go in rest mode when it\u2019s not in use and they have yet to have any issues.I will say that if you are planning on getting a PS5 you may want to see what deals you can get on a compatible SSD. The PS5 only has a little under 700gb of storage and games(digital or physical) can take up a lot of storage. God of War takes up approximately 84 Gb of storage. Ultimately this is a great bundle and this is the perfect time to pick them up, while they are available and on sale.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"76 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1679961600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Been waiting forever to finally upgrade from the PS3.","reviewDescription":"As an almost 50 year old who is not a huge gamer and has been waiting forever to finally upgrade, I'm glad that I finally did. I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good decision or not, but really it's been better than expected! First, it's almost paid off due to Christmas money. Second, I was concerned about the cost of building a collection of games. But due to the fact that there's so many games and so many sales, especially on the games I like, I have a small collection of fun games already in many different genres that feels well rounded, and didn't cost a fortune to get! I'm slowly reacquiring my favorite games like the God of War franchise and the Arkham Batman games, while discovering old arcade games that are super cheap, as well as newer games like Spiderman Miles Morales, Spiderman, Ghostbusters, Creed boxing, and Stray all on sale. It's a great time to be gaming, and while I generally am not a big gamer, I went through a phase where I was gaming a lot just before meeting my wife Rebecca, and then life got busy, crazy, and wild for a good long time. But now I have a little bit more stability, and while still busy as heck, I have a couple of hours here and there to enjoy. I even bought Trivial Pursuit just to get Rebecca into the fold. She doesn't really even know how to use the dualsense controller! So I'm trying to get her involved enough to learn how to use the controller and navigate around in different ways. Anyway, very pleased with the purchase! I've played a little bit and it's a great experience. Quite a step up from the PS3, and a good time to get back into the gaming world. I'm glad that the shortage is ending, and I'm glad I did this when I did. Had I bought it in 2020 it probably would have been a weirder experience. I feel like gaming is finally at a place where oldsters, youngsters, and middle of the roadsters like myself can find something to enjoy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"50 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673136000000}

And with the quickest hands in the west and the power of a credit card, snatched one up. Actually did get an invite for the regular one without the bundle not just once but twice, back in June and even further back during February. Skipped out though mainly because most of the games I cared for was multi-platform. But that's besides the point because as a lot of the futures games that I am eying are now making the jump towards this generation of hardware, PS5 Xbox Series X level, I figured I would go for it. Plus it came with  one of my most anticipated games so that was a big push.But yeah product wise, everything came as advertise: Console, kickstand, a controller, HDMI, USB C and a Power cord. On start up you have the option of copying over your data from the PS4 in terms of content, save data and games. It doesn't get rid of it, just a straight copy. I skipped this option though since I had most of my games on an external Hard drive. Fun fact is that you can change and share that same hard drive between the PS4 and PS5 and it will work vise versa as long as it's on the same account. So on the PS4 side, if you have a External Drives, makes it easy to store your PS4 games. And you want to save your PS4 games somewhere else because the main storage , although a good amount, can easily be filled.But yeah, very happy with my early personal Christmas Gift to myself and can't wait to check out more games with this nice SSD! Also the controller and its haptic feedback does make a subtle nice experience that you definitely have to feel. Sounds like a gimmick but it's completely in the background while adding to the experience.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"36 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671580800000}

I never thought about it so I was surprised to see it come out of its box in all its glory.Wow what a horrid PS5 stand that the console comes with! One thing I did was buy a horizontal stand which I am happy about. It has screws for vertical, but heaven help you if you decide to dust with it being horizontal.The PS5 comes off every time I need to move it. Now on the stand I do not need to worry about it.I am pleased with how it starts up..but never turns off like the PS4. So, putting the sleep to 20 minutes and leaving it took some time to get used to.I haven\u2019t played God of War yet, but going into my account at Sony entertainment and clicking redeem game (first time ever) was simple enough; since my game collection is actual disc. Also setting up for Fortnite was straight forward.I have never transferred back-ups before, but I found the place easily that points to what I need to do; so, I am hopeful it will continue to be easy.When the manual says before turning on console plug in your controller that would be a yes. Yes, it will sync, and yes it will charge. I can\u2019t seem to get the controller to charge on a USB C off the console; I haven\u2019t figured out why that is.Everyone has written all about stats etc. so this is just me saying I really enjoy having it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688688000000}

You will only have around 600gbs when you start off with a new ps5 I believe. Memory gets used up extremely fast! I also had a pleasant experience buying this from here. From me sending a request to purchase a ps5, I had an email invite like 2 days later plus only like 2 days to send it. So I received it extremely fast! I have heard of people waiting much longer though. This can also play most ps4 games as well. Also you can get a playstation plus membership for like $15 a month that allows you to play tons of ps5 and ps4 games. There is a lot of cool things to do with this ps5!! Highly recommend!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671753600000}
{"reviewTitle":"FINALLY!After all these Years! \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd70","reviewDescription":"So happy to finally be able to buy this at a reasonable price. I refused to buy it of $1800+ dollars and 3 years later here we are.  I am enjoying this game system especially Astro world. I'm a big kid inside and enjoy a lot of rated E games with option for T and M rated.Which is why is why I didn't immediately think to download the free game that came with the system.  Watch my vid of caution so you don't overlook or toss out the paper with the redeem code. Thankfully I keep my game boxes as I travel often so it was still there. But for others who toss everything this can be in the trash because it's so small. Anyways the PS5 is so much fun and worth the wait for the right price.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691452800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great system with a couple","reviewDescription":"design flaws. The two major ones: 1) Lack of initial memory. You'll need to buy a second drive but those are easy to install and they are easy to find. 2) Whomever designed to Stand for the Ps5 needs to be fired. It is terrible and should be something else a person buys at the time of purchase. 3) <Personal choice but I didn't like the bright white cover and bought a replacement Midnight Black. BUT that is a personal preference.>------------------A couple of months later and things are still moving along great. One thing I HAVE to tell people - For the love of everything , do NOT place your Ps5 in an enclosed space . Give this thing room to breathe and receive air in order to keep it cool. Make SURE you are able to at least access it in order to clear it of dust every now and then. This console is a tank. It's big. It's bulky. And it needs space .  This thing is too valuable to risk blowing up because you store it in a cabinet ; simply because it looks neat.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670198400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Best console since the PS1","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve had every interaction since PS1 and every Xbox as well up to the series X and this is my favorite console to date. It\u2019s wicked fast on load times even for old games. The graphics are insane (even old games look better) the storage can be expanded easily with an M2 or external disc drive (I\u2019m using both and it lets you determine your install location by game type. So all my PS5 games go to my M2 and all my PS4 games go to external storage leaving console storage free for photos and software updates) there\u2019s a couple minor bugs in the gui but those are gradually being taken care of as updates continue to roll out.
