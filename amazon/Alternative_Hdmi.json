{"reviewTitle":"4K @ 120Hz HDR works some of the time...","reviewDescription":"I've been using a 4K TV as a gaming monitor for my PC since 2016. I was using a QLED 55\" screen and pretty much any HDMI cable I used worked to output 4K @ 60Hz and HDR + 10-bit color. I recently replaced that QLED with an OLED which can do 4K @ 120Hz and HDR + 10-bit color. Any old HDMI cable will no longer do.So here we are, The Highwings 8K cable, rated at 48Gbps. Does it work to support 120Hz and HDR? Sure it does, with caveats. Read on.After attaching this cable to my new LG G2 OLED TV and my RTX 3090 GPU, I had nothing but problems. Everything will work for a while but after some time, eventually, the HDR will go on and off like the TV is losing the signal, or these weird artifacts will appear across the screen. It wasn't very pleasant if I'm being honest.After this, I proceeded to purchase multiple HDMI 2.1 cables (some even claimed certification) but after buying 5 different brands, and all of them having issues with 4K \/ 120 Hz with HDR, I finally decided to go to a brick-and-mortar store and buy a $50 HDMI 2.1 certified cable. Would you like to guess what happened next?EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY.So, if you really need a high-quality HDMI cable, maybe you'll get lucky with one of these cheap cables from Amazon, or maybe you can save yourself all the aggravation and just buy a good, brand-name cable from your local audio\/video store.I've never been one to spend a lot on cables, and Amazon is my go-to for fair-priced cable options but one thing I found with these cheap HDMI 2.1 cables from Amazon, is they typically work out of the box\/bag but during long hours of use, they start to fall short. Maybe they really aren't truly 48Gbps cables. I couldn't say. I can say I had nothing but issues and when finally un-tightening my butt cheeks and spending $50 on a name-brand cable (probably made in China too but to a higher standard) everything just worked. I could have saved myself a lot of research and time.\/edit. I am going to repeat this very review for each of the HDMI cables I bought recently that were not up to snuff.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"45 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676851200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Short and very stiff","reviewDescription":"I bought the 1 foot and 1.5 foot cable lengths. They seem to be of a good build quality. However, be aware that these cables are very, very stiff and they come looped. This means that the cable is curled in one direction, and you hope that it's the direction you need it to curl in!Additionally, the length is a bit misleading. The measurement is from the tip of of each connector. The cable length itself ends up being about 8 inches for the 1 foot and 13\" for the 1.5 foot.No issues with signal transmission so far, but I had to twist them 180\u00b0 to connect two pieces of equipment. With the stiffness I do have some concern about it twisting the ports into which it's plugged. I am most likely going to return them for a different cable because of these issues.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714608000000}

I don't see how this is possible.  My only guess is that the complexity level that humans have allowed is too high.  Since this HDMI cable enables USB and other digital intercommunication between the devices, I can only guess that HP or LG (monitor manufacturer) screwed up their implementation of some standard which should allow the HDMI video to stream to the monitor screen by default.  I doesn't do that.  I can't make it do that.I guess my advice would have to be:  Don't buy this cable if you want to connect your computer to an external monitor.

Well friends, I\u2019ll have you know that this Highwings HDMI cable performs just as well, if not better than MONSTER CABLE and at a fraction of the price.I bought this cable for a couple of factors; for one, it was half the price of another cable I saw at the store. But also, this cable was a little longer 10ft, as opposed to what most cables were cut to - 6ft. I\u2019ve never heard of Highwings honestly, but there seemed to be a lot of positive reviews on Amazon, so here I am. And fear not for weary reviews ladies and gentlemen; this product is legit!Right out of the box, the packaging was nice. Nicely appearing in a  plastic sealed wrap. Upon opening, the product felt great. Strong, sturdy, durable; all around good quality craftsmanship. I excitedly and immediately connected it to my PS5 and TV. When plugging in, it felt solid. Nice connection. No wiggle room, no loosely fitting cables here. Same thing connecting to the PS5. Fired up my PS5 and was happy with my newly upgraded quality 4K video on screen.Haters and nay-sayers will say it\u2019s just a cable; but it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s a durable and high quality product that produces fantastic quality video. Everything and then some of what I imagined I would get with this cable. I\u2019m about to order a few more for all my devices that require HDMI cables.If you\u2019re still reading this, STOP, and go buy yourself some of these cables!

I mounted the cable to baseboards around the room to keep it out of the way, so it wasn't being wiggled around or stepped on or anything.

I checked my settings (which hadn't changed since setup), connection points at each in, drivers, etc... All were fine, no random changes I wasn't aware of. So, I swapped the cable out with another high speed HDMI cable and played with that for a few hours without a single issue. Sucks because my other cable is too short to tuck out of the way and I'm out of the refund window for this junk cable.Although, it is a really hefty braided cable, so maybe I can use it to secure loads in the bed of my truck.

It also appears to be eARC properly.So why do I only give it three stars?There are two nasty flaws.First is that it has a built-in velcro thingie that I expect someone thought was a great idea for helping you wind up the cable. Maybe so, but my experience was that this damn velcro kept catching on table cloths, curtains, and anything else near to the cable as I was trying to arrange it.Second is the cable is surprisingly stiff. I expected something like an HDMI 1.2 cable, or ethernet; very flexible  and easy to bend. Instead this is more like coax, with a very wide bending radius. Enough of a problem that where I'd previously used a 3' cable as the perfect length, doing the job and easy to hide, I now had to get a 6' cable and try to wrap the excess around the back of the TV while never bending it too much. Maybe the specs demand that all 8K HDMI cables have to be this stiff, so it's not this manufacturer's fault, I don't know. All I can say is be prepared for something a lot stiffer than you expected, both in terms of requiring something longer than you expected, and in terms of having to find a way to hide the excess cable that's bulges out at turns and bends.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"78 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1622678400000}

I found this out the hard way when, shortly after installing it, I noticed that every so often, my monitor would go solid black for about 1-2 seconds then come back on and would do this about 1-3 times every hour. I'm sure the fault isn't with any defects in the cable, but instead with the fact that it's too long a cable to carry that type of signal for that amount of distance. Anyhow, If you need more than 12-15ft for an HDMI 2.1 cable, get a USB powered one or an Optical variant so it will be able to carry the signal the entire distance.

Just like people said on the top reviews this seems to fully support the refresh rate at the 4k resolution. Though, there is a catch that I ha e not seen mentioned. For whatever reason my cable has no audio pass through whatsoever, if you where hoping to use your surround sound or a good pair of TV headphones there seems to be no working audio pass through. This is a pretty big flaw, but since I'm using my computer headset and have no other issues with the cable I think it is fair to give it 3 stars. So if you are planning on using this for your PC set up, just know that that the audio pass though may not work and you will have to use your desktop headset.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1634860800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Big difference!","reviewDescription":"Using the cable as an eARC between an 85\u201d Sony Bravia TV and a Onkyo TX-RZ50 receiver. What a difference! The lag is not as bad as when I was using a standard hdmi cable same length. Increasing\/decreasing the volume is quicker than before. The standard hdmi not only caused a lag but would also not respond at times when changing the volume. Streaming has also improved when using the eARC connection. No pausing is occurring like before. If you\u2019re wondering, I don\u2019t go cheap on my internet speed to cause pausing, it was the standard cable. Also, I don\u2019t see a noticeable change of video\/audio. Lastly, it\u2019s not instantaneous response otherwise I would rate it a 5 star. However, the price is better than paying $100-200 for the hi-fi name brand cables that I researched. Hope this review helps you!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1715385600000}

I will tell you this, for how cheap these cables are, they work very well but as well as do not be fooled thinking that it'll \"improve\" quality since quality is only as good as what your console or PC is capable. As long as the HDMI meets specs(2.1 or whatever version of HDMI) and meets what speed it needs(18 or 48 GBPS), it'll work just fine.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1716768000000}

I purchased the 35 ft. 8K HDMI cable, but it was just under 33 ft long. I'm sure this is because it's actually a 10 meter cable and they just picked a close whole number in feet. Luckily for my situation, 33 ft will be sufficient.Again, these are fantastic HDMI cables. They work great and are well made with quality materials. They're at the top of my list when looking for 4 & 8K HDMI cables. Just be aware that they are made outside the US and thus are made in metric lengths, so the listed lengths in feet are only approximations.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716508800000}

I do wonder how well it will work with the looseness of the plug though (will it loosen and fall out over time?)

In my application it is connecting the EARC  output of a Samsung QLED 85 to a Sonos ARC sound bar. Due to the limited space at the input of the sound bar the HDMI connector has a tendency to back out of the female receptor. Tried to make a 45 degree bend in the cable however due to its structural rigidity it was impossible to make a tight enough radius. If the cable had a 45 degree connector it would have been beneficial.
