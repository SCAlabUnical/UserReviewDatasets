{"reviewTitle":"Should Have Bought This Years Ago","reviewDescription":"This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.This worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!So here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.Setup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.If you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services\/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).So basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.The interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.Just be sure you have:1. A TV with an HDMI port2. Wifi at home3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"1,957 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673568000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Favorite Invention of the Year","reviewDescription":"We finally cut the cable, well, cable to the satellite Dish. We were spending a lot for so much stuff we didn't use. The problem: We were left with a smart TV that was not quite smart enough to allow install of the FUBO app and another that had HDMI ports, but nothing more modern than that. I was just about to pull the trigger on the Google Chromecast, but thankfully happened onto a Firestick review. I think Chromecast would have been adequate, but it's just a streaming device, allowing us to mirror what was playing on our phones or computer. The two gadgets were in the very same price range, and the Firestick has *far* more to offer. In short, it converts a dumb TV--as long as it has an HDMI port and access to WiFi--into a very very smart TV. The Firestick has its own memory, so I can download and install apps for the various streaming services like Peacock hoping to nickel and dime me to death. A truly marvelous invention. I bought a second Stick for the oldish TV in our cabin and then a third for my mother-in-law to use at her rental condo in Florida. Each was a snap to set up and so far all have worked flawlessly. The remote is intuitive, but the fast forward\/rewind function took some getting used to (YouTube TV's remote has FF\/RW that is far superior) but we have adapted. So pleased I went this route!

{"reviewTitle":"Comparable to an APPLE TV!","reviewDescription":"Overall an amazing product! Amazon thought of everything and then fit it all into this little gadget. I'm an owner of an Apple TV and when the streaming box of one of my TVs broke, I decided to give the Fire Stick a chance since I didn't feel like dropping $100+ for another Apple TV. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION I'VE MADE. My initial impression of the Fire Stick was how tiny it was compared to the Apple TV. It wasn't a huge, heavy box that I had to lug around whenever I traveled, even to the point where it became too big of a hassle to bring. Instead, the Fire Stick is small, 100% portable, and doesn't weigh any more than a pen. So you can imagine how surprised I was when I found out that this little stick had more features and abilities than my Apple TV. The built-in Alexa is so much smarter than Siri and I love how it can switch between applications and do everything that an Alexa can do, the only big difference being that you have to click the Alexa button instead of being voice-activated (Maybe Amazon can add that feature). Installing it was super simple, all I had to do was plug it in and connect it to the power. The fire stick plugs into any HDMI port and if the stick is too long to fit in the HDMI section then you could use the provided HDMI extender which has a flexible cord. Again, Amazon thought of everything for this product. P.S. I must say that Amazon was super generous including the needed 2 AA batteries, a shock for big companies these days. The Fire Stick can turn any TV into a smart TV and add many features if you already have a smart TV. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription, you'll get access to Prime Video and a LOT of news sources (I'm not sure about what it'll be like without a Prime Subscription, sorry) But everyone can log into apps like Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube, and my new personal favorite, Spotify. My only concern with this product is how easy it is to lose the remote, especially if you're a very forgetful person like I am. Amazon does have replacement remotes that they sell, one even has additional features like the ability to make the remote play a sound to locate it, but even the basic one can go for up to $20 which is more than half the price of what I paid for it. Also, a little tip, I noticed that this product specifically goes on huge sales from time to time so I recommend waiting if it currently isn't on sale.  The Fire Stick is truly an amazing product and in my opinion, it belongs in the top tier of streaming devices.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"35 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701561600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great design, poor reliability and exceptionally poor warranty:","reviewDescription":"I love the functionality of the Fire Stick. It is easy to use, intuitive, simple but easy remote. However, the reliability isn't very good . . . and Amazon obviously doesn't trust it to last very long either. It only has a 90-day warranty, which I believe is the worst warranty (for name-brand electronics) in the smart video-type business.Mine very quickly just started to get painfully slow. Watching movies on it is great, but everything else is painful. Clicking on what you want can take over 5 seconds to respond. Of course you get to a point that you think that you didn't click and you click again, then it takes you into whatever the next click would have been. I takes several minutes to get back out of that and to what you originally wanted to click on. Moving just from icon to icon is painful, and the voice control is nearly useless. You have to hold down the button for a really long time, then speak, then wait a while to see if it actually caught it (if it didn't, it looks the same so it's tough to tell if it got it or not). This started to happen after about 4 months and has gotten worse since. Yes, I've applied the updates (which maybe *caused* the issue?), and I don't add other apps other than what it came with. I only use Amazon, Netflix, and Disney+ so I haven't exactly overloaded it with apps.So to sum up, some work for a while and some don't. Amazon doesn't have enough trust in the product to even give it a 1-year warranty, and now I know why. With such a short warranty, the Mean Time To Failure must be pretty bad. If these tended to be robust, they could afford to put a normal warranty on them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705881600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Save your money and buy a Roku.","reviewDescription":"Lately it seems anything I buy from Amazon that is an Amazon product just sucks. You would think after all this time of doing this that Amazon could at least make a decent Firestick. Apparently not. I just received this yesterday and it doesn't work very well at all. Most of the time it just freezes up. It will say it is doing an update and then totally locks up. The first time it said it would take 1 to 2 minutes. Wrong after a mere 33 minutes it supposedly said still updating then when i tried to get out of it it just remained frozen. So I unplugged it and sort of rebooted worked for maybe 10 minutes then did it again. So the few minutes I have had it working it is far far worse than any Roku I have used. Sadly this a just a reflection of how badly Amazon is getting overall. I just found out few weeks ago that not only do we paying shipping to us, we now have to pay shipping back. I bought a small amplifier that after the 3rd time of switching it on the switch fell inside the housing. So i wanted to exchange it. So in trying to ship it back they wanted to charge me 7.99. I argued with them and they finally said okay we won't charge you. Then they lied to me and charged me anyway. So apparently the truth isn't important to them either. So since that little episode they have lost over a thousand dollars in sales from me. Just as all that was going on I had 2 chairs in my cart, a AC fan motor, another amplifier and a box of very expensive AC filters. Which totaled about $1076 bucks. I emptied my cart and bought from other sellers not on Amazon. Also I had close to 3,000 dollars in my save for later cart. I emptied everything out of it.  I have been a member of Amazon since the beginning. I never returned anything that I ordered by  mistake, I never returned anything because i did not like. I usually gave it to friends and family. The only things I returned were damaged or broken items or items sent to me from their error not mine. So I have now decided since I already renewed a few months back that I will not buy anything over $25 dollars if it is more than that I will buy elsewhere. I am finding already a lot of places are a lot cheaper than Amazon are these days. One little item i have bought from Amazon for years I found at my local supermarket for $2 dollars cheaper that Amazons. So because of their stupid new policy they have already lost a thousand bucks from me and that number will continue to grow.

{"reviewTitle":"Massively increased internet bandwidth\/usage!","reviewDescription":"So, first off, I have using fire tv for years, it's my \"go to\".  I'm all in when it comes to Amazon, I've just always liked the quality.  So this is the first negative review of one of their products that I can remember doing but sadly I'm not a fan of this new fire stick.  Since installing it, my internet usage massively increased.  I didn't realize it until I got my bill this month, but had been given warnings by my internet provider that I was exceeding my monthly limit.  I just blew it off thinking I was just getting close to it and really had no idea how much I used each month or what my limit was.  This was the first time I saw the warning.To add to this is the menu that is quite beautiful but slooooooooow.  Netflix takes forever to load, hulu takes forever.  The menu has recently started showing warnings that I'm close to being out of space.  I look at the apps and I hardly have any.  Yet, I'm still trying to delete apps and its still slow.  I simply do not understand.  It tells me that the capacity is gigabytes, yet all the apps I have barely add up to one gigabyte.So I use Eero for my home wifi mesh and thankfully it has a great dashboard to help track down the bandwidth usage of every connected device.  Yesterday we were gone most of the day and all evening and came home and went to bed, yet Eero shows that the fire tv used nearly a gigabyte of data!  How is that possible for a tv that is off?One interesting thing that I noticed the other day was that I switched on the tv and it went right to showing some movie on Showtime, it didn't go to the main menu.  It was interesting but I thought nothing about it.  Now I wonder if while my tv is off, content is still streaming to the fire stick?  Is that possible?  It would explain the rapid increase of internet data usage.I do not recommend this version of the Fire TV Stick.  I give it a few stars because I liked the new remote with individual buttons for the main content providers (netlix, hulu, etc)Edit:  Last night I tried to do an update and it kept erroring out.  I believe because it was out of space.  I hardly have any apps on it, so it has to be something else that has gobbled up all my space.  So, I decided to start over and so I \"reset to defaults\".  The first thing I did when it was rebooted clean was make sure I had every update available.  Amazon had the option to grab my profile so I didn't have to add any apps, the ones I normally use were added (netflix, hulu, and plex).  Looking at my space now, I actually had a 1.5 to spare now and the menu was snappy and quick.  Also, my technical opinion on my massive uptick in internet usage is that when I turn off my tv, the fire tv keeps my connection to hulu or showtime alive and I'm still using bandwidth.  This is evidenced by occasionally when I switch on my tv, the first thing I see is a moving or show playing via one of my streaming accounts and not the main menu which is what I would expect.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1647561600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Well, I'm the proud owner of 2 new Fire TV Sticks...","reviewDescription":"I had two perfectly good Gen 2 Fire TV Sticks which are now on their way to a landfill after an unwanted and unneeded update was forced on the devices and turned them into bricks.It started with apps failing to launch. They would start loading, then crash and go back to the home screen. Restarting the app, deleting the cache, deleting data, removing and reinstalling the app did not fix the problem. Then I rebooted the device itself. Bad idea. It is now stuck at the \"Fire TV\" splash screen. For two hours until I pulled the plug. A couple weeks later, the same thing happened to my other Fire TV Stick.I guess the up-side is that the new Gen 3 devices seem to handle streaming much better than the previous generation. And being able to restore the old device settings to the new one was a time saver. Still it is irritating to throw away functioning hardware because some knob-developer could not bother to do testing and debugging before forcing the updates out to people who do not want them.I, probably, would have purchased a Roku (or something) as a replacement. However, the <$20 price of the Stick would suggest that Amazon is selling these at a loss to keep people in their ecosystem. They are welcome to eat the cost.

Unfortunately, whenever I use the Fire TV Stick, there are constant ads on YouTube Premium and Prime Video that I do NOT see when accessing these services through my Playstation or laptop. The whole point of paying extra for no ads is...no ads. It completely defeats the purpose to have constant ads breaking up my viewing experience when I use the Fire TV Stick (it's especially bad when I want to stream relaxing\/anti-anxiety music for my dogs because out of nowhere THERE IS A SUPER LOUD OBNOXIOUS AD PLAYING every few minutes). I've also noticed that when I watch NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV via my Playstation's YTTV app, I get some \"moments of zen\" (nice nature sounds\/animal photos) instead of commercials but that doesn't happen when I watch YTTV via the Fire TV Stick.Also absurd...I can access more shows and more episodes of shows available on Amazon Prime Video when I'm using my Playstation than I can when using the Amazon Fire TV Stick. Unfortunately I recycled the box in which my Fire TV Stick came, so I can't return it.

In the last 9 months, I have needed to purchase a total of 6 of these to use with two TVs (one in the den that gets used mostly just on weekends and one in the bedroom that gets used daily, almost entirely in the evening only). Doing the math, these remotes have lasted me approximately 3 months each before each has malfunctioned in some way, requiring me to have to buy a new one (I\u2019ve googled every method I could find to reset one of these in an effort not to have to purchase a new one, with mixed results but still, most haven\u2019t survived past 3-4 months).  After the first couple died I decided I would only re-purchase when on sale.  At this point I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the short life span doesn\u2019t even justify buying at a sale price.  Most recently, my Hulu interface wasn\u2019t working right (it would literally kick me out of Hulu every 5-10 minutes while I was trying to watch a program; whether the program was live TV or a recording didn\u2019t matter) and at first I thought the problem was Hulu but after seeing that Hulu didn\u2019t have this problem on the other TV at that time or on either of our tablets I came to realize that the problem was caused by yet another malfunction of the Amazon Fire Stick.  So I decided to stop throwing my money in the toilet at that point and switched to a Roku remote (I have since purchased a second Roku remote for the other TV as well as that Fire Sick began to malfunction not too long afterward on the other TV, as well).  So fat the Roku remotes are working flawlessly and the Hulu interface is working correctly again (confirming the Amazon Fire Stick was the problem and not Hulu).  The only thing less than perfect (for me) is that the Roku remote doesn\u2019t have a built-in \u201cHulu\u201d button on the remote like the Fire Stick does (I mostly watch Hulu) but it\u2019s literally only one extra click to open Hulu from the Roku\u2019s Home Screen (instead of pushing a dedicated button right on the remote) and while I haven\u2019t been using the Roku remote long enough to compare its longevity to the Fire Stick, it\u2019d be hard not to top the average of 3 months I\u2019ve gotten out of multiple Fire Sticks so I\u2019m giving Roku my business now and we\u2019ll see how this goes.  It\u2019s 100% worth making one extra click to open Hulu if Roku has a better life span than the Fire Stick (again, I think it\u2019d be hard not to considering how short lived most of my Fire Sticks have been).  I am a fan of Amazon branded products in most cases, but not this particular product as no one enjoys wasting hard-earned money on having to replace the same thing you just bought a few months ago over and over again, right.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1676073600000}

I purchased and downloaded 3 games, which turned out to be a mistake because I was constantly getting low storage notifications prompting me to free up space. This lead me to buying a 128gb usb stick to expand the capacity so I could download and store the apps that I actually want. The problem is that there are some apps that can't be moved to the usb. There were games I purchased that I simply had to uninstall, and guess what? I can't re-download them to my usb stick without repurchasing them. What a shady business practice and a waste of money!

{"reviewTitle":"Great device until you use Amazon Prime on it. Update: even worse but hope.","reviewDescription":"Edit:  Press and hold the home button for 5 seconds+ and you have an interface 90% better than the stock one. But...Wish I had gotten something else. Now I have \"Try Alexa\" literally every 5 seconds on the screen breaking every single \"overview\" of every application. Yes I have every single possible notification, popup, you name it OFF or in the case of inverted statements, the epitome of crappy interfaces, ON.This thing is trash. Already looking at buying\/building something else and feel so bad I recommended it to someone I plan to buy\/build something else for them on my costs.The only way to stop it is to go into, some not all, apps. (or hold home for 5+ seconds and use a minimal launcher)Original:The short of my personal recommendation is if you plan to use an Amazon Prime app get something else that has a different form of app. If you plan to use everything else then this is a good bit of hardware and software.Been using a Samsung TV for many years but its old enough the non-amazon apps are starting to not be supported. The firestick was on sale for a decent price and far less than building my own so I picked it up. Installation went well, I really like the controller and the level of apps and their performance is fantastic. Then comes Amazon Prime. I realize I am reviewing the app and not the device but it can't run a \"different\" amazon prime app. You are only as good as your apps end of day and the fact is this is an Amazon device and its Amazon's flag ship application that you'd think would be a match made in heaven. Rather its the other \"h\" word.So why the one star when I originally rated it three? Time teaches, in short.1)The inability to stop preview video causes massive problems with navigation from crashes and massive slow downs to it disrupting controller button presses and down right a gargantuan annoyance trying to navigate around. Seriously, your only option is to mute the auto-play previews not the actual video. All other apps I have tried that support this feature allow you to turn it off. Whoever came up with the idea to not allow it being disabled should be fired. If I want to preview something I'll watch this thing called a trailer. It is so bad while navigating the app I feel like I'm going to have a seizure due to the constant flashing and movement in the background that I have zero control over aside from not using the app.2)It defaults to one-click purchases. Yah, can't imagine why they did that. The real issue though is that you have to use \"Parental Controls\" to disable one-click purchases. Excuse me? What does this have to do with parental controls? I don't want myself, the \"parent and owner\", to be able to do this and I don't have kids. \"Oops, pressed a button and just bought a 20 dollar movie.\". Wow, moronic. Ok, so you disable it and now you are having to punch in a PIN every purchase and yet another password to remember. While I have not checked let me guess, if you forget your pin you have to wipe the device? Um, here is an absolutely genius idea, ready? Add a toggle to just turn off one-click purchases. BINGO. I want a million dollar check for that idea. I might even patent it. Make that two million since topic #1 I plan to patent too, button to stop auto video preview.3)My amazon credits for digital purchases don't show up even under the more options. On my Samsung I could click on the rent button and see exactly what was going to happen and even elect if I wanted to apply credits or not. Now, you see nothing. Searched the net and roamed around in the device for a good hour and I can't find a single reference to this. Granted I have only tried purchasing once but the only message I got was an email indicating the purchase and the cost. Pretty bad that I have to go log into my computer to find out what my credits are. Oh wait, 15 minutes of searching for that and I can't find it either and no its not under your redeemable section in account. I checked. It's \"a mystery\" or more likely just more epically poor \"UI\/App\" design across the board.4)The entire 40% of the top of the screen is nothing but an advertisement that is again, annoyin. The \"app bar\" is limited to a tiny middle row and half the width. For the size of Amazon you'd think they could find some decent UI developers. \"You think you can do better?\" \"Yes, game over.\".5)Because of all this bloat and forced useless features the amazon app is SLOW and I'm talking at least 20-30% slower than even the poorly created apps I've tried for free streaming. That's pretty appalling considering its their app on their device and speaks volumes, I presume, about their developer, marketer and management teams.I am sure people will have some sort of \"answer\" to many of my points but not all and none will solve the elephant in the room. The epically poor design of a flagship app on a flagship device that, in my view, defines said device.The app is so bad I sincerely doubt I will be renewing my prime membership. I can't stand using it so much it's not worth the literal headache it causes, I am not joking.Amazon ruined a great device with tons of great apps with their own app. It's pretty much one of the worst UI setups I've seen on a streaming device. My nearly 10 year old Samsung TVs amazon app interface is still vastly superior and actually faster. Maybe all of the new devices out there have the same bloated, seizure inducing, rigged for accidental purchases outside paying the price of more annoyance and down right poorly designed app but it would be worth taking the time to find out if that is one of your targeted applications.As to my suggestion to amazon, presuming they read this or even allow it to post. Go look at some of the other apps and definitely those for free streaming because they have you beat by light years on UI design and user experience. Amazon does some great stuff but this app is not one of them.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"180 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1680739200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Remote would not turn on the TV","reviewDescription":"After purchasing 3 fire sticks in January (2 for my sister and 1 for myself) which worked perfectly on my TV in my living room. So I decided to replace my old model fire stick in my bedroom to this new one, since the old one was starting to give me problems (I've had the old one since 2015). I never read the reviews because I had no problem with those I purchased in January 2022 so I didn't expect to have a problem with my next purchase. The first thing that should have caused me to have a little doubt is the fact that it was $20 cheaper than the one I bought in January. However, who doesn't appreciate a sale. But, give me a sale for equipment that works.I put it on my bedroom TV and it would not turn the TV on. So I decided to try using my old fire stick remote to turn it on and it came on (however, the old one could not be used with the new fire stick) so I took the new fire stick remote (you remember the one that wouldn't turn the TV on) and I tried to set everything up, it kept asking to reprogram the remote. After the 4th time directing me to program the remote and doing absolutely nothing, I decided to call customer support.The first person (a woman) was very nice, listened patiently to everything I said, but could not help me at all, so she transferred me to someone else (a male this time); Well, I never thought that anyone could be as awful as this man was. I explained that I could not turn the TV on with the remote, which meant that the remote didn't work (not turning on the TV should have been enough), I told him I used the old remote and then tried using the new remote, which I described above what happened. Well, this customer support person said, they were not going to send me another one, nor put in for a refund until we could trouble shoot it. I explained to him that I could not even turn it on, and there was no way I was going to use the old remote to turn it on, and then trouble shoot the new remote. I explained to him that if the remote won't turn the TV on, then evidently it's not working and it needs to be replaced. I told him I will return it and could he put in for a replacement. He said NO, because if I tried to return it, then UPS would have to trouble shoot it. WWHAT????? I have never heard of such.So, after wasting 30 minutes with him, I hung up, got back onto the Amazon website and requested to return it. Unfortunately, I didn't have the choice to get a replacement and I believe that was because I got it on sale for 19.99 plus tax and at the time of my return request, it had gone back up to 39.99. To, me that was poor customer service. If I tell you it doesn't turn on the TV, a replacement should have been sent out immediately and a return postage for me to return the defected one.By the way, I returned it via UPS and the woman thought I was crazy when I asked her if they had to trouble shoot it first before sending it back to Amazon.Now, that I see it's on sale for 24.99, I am going to (crazily) try to purchase another one. I am praying that it will work. For whatever reason, (judging from the reviews) there seems to be more that work, than those that don't work. My main issue is customer service. If your equipment (fire stick) does not work, you shouldn't have to go through what I went through (and others) to get a replacement. So, I am leaving this review to tell customer service, you have got to do better.If they look at my order history, they will see I order all the time, and have been a faithful customer for years. I, (along with others) desire to be treated better.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"102 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671321600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Amazon doesn't issue refunds as required!","reviewDescription":"I ordered this month's ago as a gift. The person had already gotten one, so I requested a refund. I have the pick up confirmation receipt from UPS, showing they took the fire stick. It is now Thanksgiving 2022, and  I have been refused my 30+$ refund. They claim they never received it, even though I sent the receipt from UPS showing they picked it up from me. Amazon has continued to claim that it was never received by them in their warehouse. I was also told by 2 of their reps who are in other NON US based Co. Said they show they they(Amazon) sent it back to me. So.. I have asked more than 5 times, how can they say they never got it, but then say it's being returned to me? I guess this logic makes sense to the reps in NON US countries.  Which,.. Fyi.. I have NEVER once given any permission for my personal info to be shared with ANYONE, ANY CO ETC. That is NOT IN THE US!!  When u think about this situation, u can clearly see, non US reps DO NOT follow US protocols and abide by Consumer Protections we have in place in the US. I like most of us, have spent Tens of thousands of $ on Amazon over the years. Which sadly, until someone holds them accountable for allowing this Refund scam to continue they will keep doing it. There are countless complaints on line just like mine. So.. I have Decided to take more of my time and report and share these details with the Protection agencies, that I do hope will FORCE them to finally change their ways, and be fair to all, no matter what Country they chose to allow to have my(Our) personal, proprietary, sensitive info, that is absolutely unauthorized that they do because it saves them Countless Millions, hundreds of Millions in wages due to those other countries work much cheaper than US based workers. Which, I don't think I would be so angered by this if..A. Those non US reps were held to the same standards as the US reps. B. They asked for out permission before just giving them this personal info of mune\/ ours, and probably the MOST important issue I have, is that all of the Cyber Hacks, Black market issues, Identity theft,  Scams etc. Became Prodomanant, RampantEtc. once these large Co. decided to give all of our personal, sensitive, information to these countries that have ZERO laws and Rules prohibiting the resale, self use, etc of such info, and they( the non us Countries) are not bound by our US laws to ask for permission to share, reproduce etc. Such info. So, if Amazon and or any of these other big Million\/Billion $ Co that outsource their CS which gives them all our proprietary, personal sensitive info is NOT the reason for all the Ick as I feel, then I will consider giving LIMITED permission for them to have access to JUST what they absolutely have to have to help me. Other than that... I am seeking one or more of our US Protection agencies to enforce our laws, hold these Big Co accountable for the damages we have endured at their negligent sharing hands. Can you even believe that all of this is happening because Amazon refused to refund a little more than 30$ from a great client who has spent tons of $ with them?? So, now as I said, someone has to do something and if we all keep waiting for someone else to do it, we will be \/ Stay in this same spot! So.. I'm taking a step to help us all, but if anyone else wants to do it as well, it won't hurt. I am sending to the BBB, FTC, FCC & CFPB.

But these things happen.My review comes from the life of these devices and the overall support offered by Amazon. The first one mentioned above only lasted a few years. The purchased replacement\u2019s fancy Alexa remote never worked but this wasn\u2019t discovered until about 32 days after purchase (just past return window) - the included batteries had done some nasty business in the back and no amount of replacements could make the remote work. Amazon refused to replace and suggested we purchase an entire new device. At the time they didn\u2019t sell just remotes (they may still not), so we had to buy a generic one that has never been great. I\u2019ve always been a little salty about that.Now here we are and my current fire stick is stuck in an endless update loop. It worked perfect 2 days ago, went to sleep on its own, and now this. For a few seconds there\u2019s an update message, then it shuts off, reboots, and starts all over. Tried every trick online and given by Amazon staff in the help forums. (Which btw, why should we have to take a device that previously worked with a tv to another tv to get it to work?) Nothing worked, the remote isn\u2019t even acknowledged, the device is getting hot. Guess that means we will have to replace or look to something different. How convenient for Amazon that an required update would make their device unusable. (Shoutout to them taking things like 3G\/4G off kindles for free or the perma-shuffle with that last Amazon music app update.)","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"25 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693440000000}

I have a perfectly good flat screen LG TV that still works just fine and has a beautiful picture but its kind of old by today's tech standards. I bought it in 2008. We wanted to get away from Xfinity because of the rediculious high prices for bad service so we got rid of Xfinity and got Star link but that did not solve the entertainment problem only the internet so we tried the Amazon fire stick and WALA! It has turned my older perfectly fine TV into a new up graded version with any channel I want. Most channels are free and some require subscriptions which is still way cheaper than Xfinity was charging. Sound quality and picture is wonderful and my TV works through my stereo just like before. And the price for this fire stick was so very reasonable! Yayeee! My husband hooked it all up fast and easy. GOOD BYE COMCAST.

Then for it not to work at all even from day 1 when an employee said oh just play with it reset it. Then today to waste my time over 2 hrs to not trouble shoot and tell me to use my Cellular for a Remote!  This is what Amazon is paying Tech Support in Manila to say to me and all of us.  Are you kidding me?  Then no trouble shoot was even performed by 3 different techs either their language was not good English or they did not know how to do the trouble shoot so they ignored the questions.

I had to chat with 3 different people on one chat session. I had to repeat some things multiple times.

Nobody responded when I mentioned the 8GB issue even though I told two of them. And after resetting my device, as if that would magically increase the storage, he wanted me to do it again! When I told them that I had just done it for the first time moments ago he said that, according to his records, I attempted a reset 2 years ago. I had just bought this last month! So beside skimping on the storage are they selling used devices as new to their customers?!Anyways, I just got my replacement and storage is still 5.35GB.

Perhaps they have far more time on their hands, because I started to get perturbed after the setup process decided it needed a third software update. That's in addition to the firmware update. Once it actually started, I was greeted with a video. Honestly, Fire Stick, you talk too damn much. Once we got past that, I spent a few minutes getting acquainted with settings. Wow, you know so much about me, but say very little about yourself, such as what the blue button on the remote is for. For a button being featured so prominently on your remote, you really should tell me what it does. While I'm at it, you really could use a setting to fix resolution, because I know what 4k should look like, and my TV said it was in 4k mode. I've known it longer, so I'll take his word for it.While digging through the installed apps, I searched for one so I can watch my cable channels from Spectrum. It shows one in the search, but you wouldn't let me download it, so I asked my friends Google and Amazon reviews so other people you date might provide answers. The consensus is that I can, by side loading the app, but even then it may not work. Something about regions. What?? Dude, the Roku I just started seeing offered to incorporate my Spectrum account with his services. That was easy peas, and he didn't need to do three updates in addition to a firmware upgrade. And he let ME easily change which apps go on my home screen, all without trying to get me to watch some ad for his services.For those still reading, at least there is a setting to factory reset your Fire Stick, and Amazon has a very good return process.

I would have to unplug and restart it to get it to work properly.The second one I had a problem with was admittedly my own fault as my puppy chewed the remote up and it was nearly the same price to just buy a new one as it would have been to get a replacement remote.The third one I had would freeze up constantly and I had to unplug it to get it to reset almost daily.I'm currently on my fourth one and it's doing the same thing as the first one did except unplugging it and restarting it doesn't fix the lag in voice and picture.I double checked and Amazon says that I purchased brand new Fire Sticks each time so they're not refurbished or used.

The fire stick does not want to remember any of that.

{"reviewTitle":"Just get a roku","reviewDescription":"Around fall off 2021 Amazon *updated* the fire stick OS, taking up wayyyyyy more space and forcing their apps onto devices. Do I really want live shopping, Amazon kids, or photos?  No. But too bad, they're taking up space on my device. This update also caused first generation fire sticks to completely freeze and stop working if the voice controls were used. So they forced an update that broke the original devices forcing users to buy new ones. Straight up corporate greed. I would hardly call the next generation an upgrade either. Not only is it glitchy and needs to be fully reset daily, We bought one end of November 2021 and by early November 2022 it wouldn't connect to any remote. Not the one it came with, or our phones. I spent hours trouble shooting it with poorly trained *tech* employees in a chat where they upload a script and are zero help because they can't answer any questions they don't have a script for. Finally I get escalated to be told I'll have to buy a new one because I didn't buy a warranty. Here where I lost it. The device was not even a year old. I had to upgrade because they forced my old device to not work anymore. And now they are selling a next generation device that THEY KNOW will not last even a year. Add to that they changed Amazon music so you have to pay to skip songs (and it's a limited number of skips) or to listen to an album not on shuffle.  It's just gone downhill with greed since the start of the pandemic and I can no longer advise getting a fire stick. In fact, I highly recommend getting anything else for streaming. They did eventually replace the fire stick, but it took 2 hours of negotiating and I had to buy another one and then *return* the broken one for an Amazon credit.Just get a roku.

You'd think when it's brand new it should be able to complete simple tasks like scroll through a list of aps without there being a two or three second delay after every button push on the remote. You'd be wrong. Simply navigating the menus is incredibly frustrating.-The listing claims their is 8GB of space, but they install so much bloatware (that you can't delete) you end up with maybe 2-3GB out of the box. Once you've put a few apps on there, you're usually below 1GB, and there isn't much you can do to clean up the storage. Not sure if this leads to the laggy nature of this stick, or if it's the 1 gb of memory, but I'm sure it doesn't help.-Infinite updates. I don't know what the heck is going on, but every single time I power the stick up, there are updates. Every. Single. Time. Get ready to sit around for 5+ minutes as this goes through the motions. And if you don't update? Yeah, good luck getting anything to work properly. (It's entirely possible that if I left the stick powered up all the time it would do the updates during \"downtime.\")Any pros? Well yeah. I guess if you want a stick that allows you to sideload android apps, this is a contender (and the only reason it gets two stars instead of one). I originally wanted to use it for emulation, but performance and storage issues were too much to deal with.Anyway, pay a little extra and get a device that actually works properly.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668470400000}

Last year, as the wifi in the room where the viewing was to take place wasn't working, we tried Chrome casting, but we are a very small, elderly group, and only one or two of us have the combination of an Android phone, tethering feature enabled on our phone plan with enough data to support the entire set of sessions, access to the URLs, and the knowledge of (or rather, the ability to research and figure out) how to put everything together and make it work.This year, there was only one such person: me.  I didn't want to have to be there for every session, from beginning to end, so I looked for an alternative to Chromecasting.  The first step was to establish WiFi connectivity in the room - that was resolved by restoring the configuration that had somehow been wiped from the old wifi router.  Next was to get web browser functionality.  The congregation's Visio TV doesn't have a browser app, and the YouTube app doesn't have any way to enter a URL (not on the TV, not on my phone, not on my PC).  But the Firestick does!It was easy to set up, once I created a dummy Amazon account (no financial information was required), and for our needs, the navigation was not difficult, either.  Once I found the browser app, I created bookmarks for all of the sessions and showed several people how to find them.  It worked great!

There's a lot of ad content and theater movie trailers loaded toward the top of the menu. I thought there was an option to avoid ads autoplaying, but I no longer see it on the menu. It keeps playing ads before content unless I can grab the remote and click Skip. Seems like a great way to waste data while spamming me with repeated ads for football or shows I don't want to watch.Presently, Amazon's Fire TV stick is very tedious to use because Amazon is aggressively advertising and upselling. The interface can change for the better or worse at any time, but it's been progressively more cluttered and harder to navigate.

{"reviewTitle":"Slow, unresponsive, a disappointment","reviewDescription":"This review is for the Fire TV Stick. I'm coming from the \"R\" brand, so expected that it would take a bit to get used to the differences between the R platform and this one. However, aside from just being different, I found the menus to be somewhat quirky and unintuitive. To get to your apps\/channels, for example, requires scrolling over and then drilling down one level, as opposed to having them right there when you turn on the system.Other than that, it was -very- slow to respond to remote commands, with a lag time between pressing a button and something happening on screen anywhere between approximately half a second to several seconds.Granted, the lag problem is probably just a defect, but the weird, unintuitive layout is the deal-breaker for meI've been working with it for about a week and have decided to return in, and will instead be going back to the 'R' platform.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698278400000}

{"reviewTitle":"The REMOTE DESIGN compare to previous gets a ONE STAR \/ Updated 11\/22","reviewDescription":"I appreciate that I got this at a very good Prime Day price. I now have 3 Fire Sticks and am grateful to have them. This generation seems to work faster than the previous as well -- scrolls faster, responds faster. I don't generally use voice, because the previous version was horrid to even attempt, so I gave up long ago.Now here's the rub. AMAZON, YOUR NEW FIRE STICK DESIGN IS A FAILURE. Here's why:The new remote is great for those who never used the previous remote. The previous was more streamlined which made it easy to locate buttons without even glancing at it. The previous had fewer buttons so there was little confusion as to what you were pressing at any given time. The batteries were near the bottom of the remote which is where the bulk of the weight would rest perfectly in the palm of your hand.The NEW remote is the opposite of all of the above. First, there is no way I can find the play\/pause button on this remote unless I physically look down at it. Even then, it's smack dab in the middle of a square of NINE buttons, plus 5 more. The mute and live TV buttons are placed so that it's easy to feel for them without having to stop to look at the remote (there is blank space below both). I am often pressing the wrong button when trying to play\/pause. Yes, I could click the large round Select button at the top, but if on YouTube, it takes two clicks to pause, and the screen menu appears on the screen which takes yet another click to remove. All this means extra clicks (wear and tear) on the remote, extra battery power, and is a general annoyance.Now about the battery.. the batteries on the new remote are at the top which puts the bulk of the weight opposite of where most people hold the remote -- either in the palm or with the fingers. I have dropped this thing numerous times already because it feels unbalanced and top-heavy. It is unnatural for the way we're used to most remote controls. In addition, because I still have two other Fire Sticks with remotes that I still use, it is difficult to retrain my hands to use this clumsy, awkward stepchild of a remote just for this one device.Lastly, the new buttons for streaming services are nice to have, but not the greatest to have. If you truly have -- and USE -- all 4 services, this remote is made for you. Anything less than 2 or 3, and it's just another device with useless functions. While I appreciate being able to single-click to Hulu, I would much rather go through the main menu and get rid of these excess buttons. PLUS, most remotes have a different colored Power button at the top. Between the fact that these buttons being at the bottom + the awkward weight distribution of the remote, I frequently mistakenly hold this remote the wrong way and end up clicking incorrect buttons. I'm watching a video on YouTube, and with one errant click, I'm in that wild maze of a Live TV menu, wonder where I went wrong in life.AMAZON, HERE'S WHAT TO DO TO IMPROVE THIS REMOTE:1. Move the batteries back to the bottom right at the area where most people hold the lower half of the remote in their palm. 2. Move the streaming buttons to the top of the remote. 3. Move the mute, volume up, volume down, and Live TV buttons down into a separate section AWAY from the navigational buttons. Leave blank space below the rewind, play\/pause, and forward buttons so we can again find these buttons without having to turn on lights and look down at the remote. 4. A more complete transfer of previous Fire Stick data to the new Fire Stick would be appreciated -- my transfer of data was incomplete. Why not allow a simply one-time cloning of apps via Amazon AWS so we don't have to spend an hour reinstalling apps we're used to?Until then, I'd like my money back or an exchange of this Fire Stick for an older generation like the other two I have. 1 star for the price, 1 star for the volume control, 1 star for speed. I'd take off more stars for the annoyances, however.UPDATE 11\/2022:I still have the same bad review regarding the design of the new remote control. I STILL find myself grabbing it and holding it the wrong way which makes me click the wrong button (upside down, the forward button is mistaken for the rewind) and I use it daily. STILL hard to get used to. No product should be this difficult to transition to. NEW COMPLAINT: Actually, this is something I noticed right away, but can verify after extended usage. Occasionally, my Internet cuts out. On my laptop, I see that it is restored in about 1 minute. However, the Fire Stick takes upwards of FIVE additional minutes to have it's connection restored. Of course, I can EXIT the app I'm using, go to Settings, and go through the network prompts to get it to reconnect, but c'mon... really? The old Fire Stick would reconnect as quickly as my laptop. There is something off with this new device. Please fix, then send me another for review. \/\/\/ I still greatly appreciate the quick buttons (Hulu, etc.. although if you don't use those services, the keys are useless and just more clutter) and the volume buttons.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"243 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661472000000}

The image tends to freeze, especially when connected to Echo Dots. I've gone through the setup process multiple times and disabled the theater application to verify the cause. Unfortunately, every time I connect it to the Echo Dots, it leads to the image on the screen eventually freezing.This has been quite disappointing for me, especially since I invested in additional Echo Dots specifically for the home theater experience with the Firestick.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706140800000}

The speed of the device is pretty quick. Here ends the good. In the setup process you are asked if you want to put a pin to protect purchases\u2026and getting apps, going into app etc. could have ended at purchases. So we set up a kid account, which only allows Amazon products that are free and those movies that show on your Amazon owned movies. There is no adding Vudu or Disney plus to that account. So a product bought to be simple for my children to be able to navigate became a nightmare as soon as the first show was put on.  First pin to protect purchases are a must, tired of accidental purchases. But to go into an app is the same pin as that pin. What is the point of having a pin if the kids can just enter it and have to in order to use this product at all. Then there is the feature of the multitude of apps undesired already loaded. Which wouldn\u2019t be bad if the apps that were downloaded weren\u2019t a multi step process which my spouse cannot figure out, which means I get to jump between tvs to provide all the remote user needs. Except the volume.  My spouse is determined \u201cAlexa\u201d is smart enough to do his bidding. So he asked the device to put on something from Disney plus. Instead it went to Amazon where the show needed to be purchased\u2026 then when the multi step was finished a reminder from a different Amazon product with Alexa went off and put it on the screen. Which at first was awesome. But soon became regrettable. For when you try and play the movie again it went to \u201cok let\u2019s find you something to watch on Amazon\u2026.\u201d. Ok I get this is an Amazon product and they obviously don\u2019t get enough time or money when there products are purchased.  I have had Roku and apple devices before.

{"reviewTitle":"Be prepared to purchase new every 2-3 years","reviewDescription":"Since 2016, I have purchased three Amazon Fire TV Sticks with remotes included.  I usually have gotten them around Black Friday Christmas deal time.  The 1st purchased in 2016, the 2nd in 2019 and this 3rd in 2022.  The remotes are included in this review, since they come with the Fire stick.  The remotes are generally not worth their sale price individually.  In fact, the current sale ad shows a \"fancy\" remote for $29.99 and the packaged Fire TV stick with cheap remote for $19.99.  Seeing that the sticks and\/or remotes usually don't last more than 2 1\/2 to 3 years, I purchased a 2 year Square Trade extended warranty this last time in 2022.  Sure enough, the remote has stopped working and won't power up or pair with the Fire TV stick (which is still working).  I am having to use my phone with the FIre TV app to control the channels.  The old remote also controlled the TV volume and power, but the phone app does not.  So I'm stuck with the volume as it was when the remote stopped working.  I called in today for the warranty claim, and basically it involved calling Amazon customer service, as the Square Trade site recommended.  Apparently the warranty \"fix\" is to send me a refurbished remote, I have to send back the faulty one, and they will supposedly \"repair\" the faulty remote and send it back to me.  At least that's what I understood.Botom line, I love using the Fire TV Stick and have no issues with the way it works.  But be prepared to replace the Fire sticks every 3 years or so.  And buy the 2 year Square Trade Warranty (usually $3 during Black Friday period).  We'll see if I can squeeze another year out of the current stick and the refurbished remote that I'll be having to put up with.Thanks Amazon for dealing with my customer issue in a prompt friendly way.

{"reviewTitle":"Only if you WIFI is adequate","reviewDescription":"The Fire TV Stick works if your WIFI signal is fast, strong, and reliable.  But in much of the USA (rural areas), WIFI is not as available as in other more developed countries such as China or in urban America.  I can go to the top of a remote mountain in China and my iPhone and WIFI still has great connections.  In American rural areas, just 40 miles from the capital of Michigan (no mountains, no valleys, no obstructions), I can show you many dead areas.  In the rain, snow, and windy weather, rural WIFI is often down.  Local storms will damage infrastructure often, meaning a week's delay before WIFI is working again.  Normally, my Fire TV Stick works about 60% of the time and when it works, it is very laggy. There are lots of hidden fees, often I have to resubmit passwords, and apps to download-- in other words the whole system is dysfunctional.  Finding what one desires is a chore too.  The system keeps trying to sell me things I do not want and imbeds things I desire. TV has become a madhouse of remote controls, paid content advertising, and the migration of sports to pay per view. In many ways the days of only 3 American TV channels over the airways was at the height of television-- the golden years. Now it is one big corporate jungle. I am not a socialist, but free enterprise does have limitations.I obtained the Fire TV Stick to watch the Uefa soccer tournament.  With the limitations of rural WIF, I see about 60% of the games.  It is better than none, but a D- in performance.  In theory the Fire TV Stick is an interesting idea, in application it has a long way to go, especially because of very poor infrastructure.  In the USA everyone is equal but some are more equal than others.  The Fire Tv Stick gets full, at its memory limit; then one has to manage the memory of the applications.  It is suggested that one get a USB external device to story applications.  The process gets so convoluted and involved, not a simple task, illustrating the poor standards of the memory consuming computer applications industry.  5 GB is not enough, and someday 5 terabytes will not be enough-- memory hogs.  It is a terrible situation.  There is a fair amount of memory irresponsibility in the industry.  It has been that way for 30 years.  No matter the amount of memory, it is never enough.  Computers do many things in the background, taking memory that rarely benefits the consumer.I urge everyone to travel the world.  It will illustrate both the limitations and the beauty of America. We have a lot of work to do. For economic reasons, rural America is treated as second class citizens. It is easy to understand the divide between the two coasts and the center of the country.  The Fire TV Stick illustrates this point well.My kids enjoy asking Alexa impossible questions, such as does Alexa have a boyfriend? or if Alexa enjoys hunting or fishing? This all came about as the kids watched a laggy Mandalorian and so had fun asking Alexa questions. Even though I signed-up for Disney +, the kids have no interest in it-- and maybe that is a good sign that they would rather play baseball or soccer or go swimming outside.  For sure, my kids are not impressed, neither am I.Update: Now after 6 months, I have cable internet to the house and the system works better, but still the kids call it very laggy, but it is better.  Connections to providers often disappear and require rebooting.  But the youngest enjoys Disney + now. I might consider buying a second fire stick.

{"reviewTitle":"We have switched from Roku to FireTV for all of our devices","reviewDescription":"While the device works great for streaming, it still has room for improvement.We first started with Roku devices. Over time though, Roku devices basically stop working. They stop being supported, and even though they may have worked fine for years, you can no longer update them or install software, even old versions, so you have to throw them away.So, we tried firetv sticks. The first generation was rough, but they have come along way. For media streaming and app coverage, they really can't be beat..... but....We love that they are tied into Amazon, but also hate that they are tied into Amazon. It never lets you forget that its primary job is to let Amazon sell stuff to you and its secondary job is to be your streaming device. What do I mean by this? Well, it really likes to put you back on Amazon's homescreen as much as possible, and when you are in Amazon's homescreen, you are presented with the content you have paid for, but also a lot of content Amazon would like to sell to you. I really only want to see the content I have already paid for. For example, if you are watching something on MAX, or Netflix, and you pause the program, if you unpause it quick enough, it will just pick up where you left off. However, if you wait to long, you will find yourself back at Amazon's homescreen asking you to tell it which user profile to use. Well, unless I tell it otherwise, shouldn't I be the same person I was when I hit pause? Shouldn't I want to continue watch what I was watching when I hit pause? Once you select a profile, you are back to Amazon's homescreen where the show you ads for services they want to sell you, when all you really wanted to do was resume what you were watching when you hit pause.So then, you have to remember... what was I watching again? And what service was it I was watching it on? And then you have to navigate back to wherever it was you were and then and only then can you resume.So other than that, the device is great. I wish there was a way I could just pay a fee like you can on the kindle, to alter this behavior so its primary function is to be my streaming device, instead of to show me ads.This also becomes a problem if you have guests or visitors that don't understand this is how an Amazon device works. We didn't have a password set on the device and we had an older house guest that unknowingly subscribed to all sorts of streaming services and pay per view not realizing what they saw on the TV was not in our services, even though we already subscribe to more services than you could ever possibly watch.Lastly, the stick periodically has little flukes. Like we have the remote set to turn on the tv. One time, it wouldn't turn on the tv anymore. It turned out, it seemed to be turning it on, but then turning it right back off. Like when you hit the button once, it was sending the on off signal more than once. Unplugging the stick and plugging it back in seemed to fix it and then we could turn the tv on again. It happened in the opposite direction too. One time, we couldn't turn the tv off. We would press the button and it would turn off and then it would turn right back on again. Same as before, a reboot seemed to fix it. This doesn't happen often, but it is annoying when it does.As for Alexa integration, it usually works well, but sometimes, it just stops working. All of a sudden telling Alex to pause just doesn't work anymore. It just doesn't do anything. Doesn't tell you there is a problem or anything, so you have to go find the remote, even though you have paused it that way 100 times before.The wanting to take you through the advertising screens is a problem with the Alexa integration as well. You can't say \"Alexa watch some movie on some service\" and get taken to that movie. No, no, it is first going to want to know who you are, so you get to the profile selection screen. I should be the same person I was last time, unless I have logged out for some reason. Selecting a profile still doesn't get you to where you asked to go, it gets you to the Amazon advertising center. So then, you have to repeat yourself \"Alexa watch some movie on some service\", and then, and only then, will it do what you asked it to do in the first place.So the device, is great. But it is my device, and should focus on my needs more than Amazon's, but it doesn't. That is its only flaw.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"689 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1688688000000}

However, I had run into a few issues w my roku device about a month ago bc quite a few apps(most notably Prime Video) had completely stopped working, and other than scouring their community forums to troubleshoot my roku device, customer support was nearly non-existent(my device was an older model and did not qualify for tech support). The absolute frustration i felt after purchasing a 4k roku stick and a Roku 4k Ultra and finding out that neither were compatible with my older smart tv, I decided to explore other options. I landed on the Amazon Firestick(their most current basic model) after reading lots of reviews on the device. It was also important that whatever device I chose had to have a robust customer support portal to quickly and easily handle any issues that may come up. The Firestick checked all the boxes! Now, compared to my roku express, the user interface is a bit less intuitive on the Firestick, but I had a good understanding of it after spending about a half hour exploring settings, etc. One HUGE benefit of the firestick is that you can open up a browser and sideload 3rd party apps that aren't available in app store. With the roku express that option wasn't available to me(though it may be different w newer roku models, it wasn't a feature mine had). So, maybe the firestick is a bit less user friendly than roku, but navigating through all my options, adjusting and personalizing my settings and app preferences  took under an hour before I felt completely comfortable using and maximising all the benefits of my amazon firestick...oh! And I love love love that the remote is alexa enabled and will pair w my echo dot! I know newer roku models have voice activated remotes, but my cheapo and years old roku express did not!

The setup process was incredibly straightforward, making it accessible for anyone regardless of tech-savviness. However, if you're a bit more knowledgeable about tech, you'll find that this device offers ample opportunities for customization, which I found to be a significant plus.The device allows for the installation and use of numerous apps, which is great for tailoring your viewing experience to your preferences. However, it's worth noting that as you add more apps and the device gets busier, you might notice a slowdown. When the processor is under heavy load, the performance can become noticeably sluggish, which can be a bit of a drawback if you're someone who likes to have multiple apps running simultaneously.Despite this, I would still highly recommend this product to anyone looking to move away from traditional cable services. It offers a user-friendly interface, the freedom to customize your viewing experience, and the convenience of having all your favorite streaming services in one place. Just be mindful of the potential for decreased performance with heavy use, and plan your app usage accordingly.Overall, I'm giving this product 4 out of 5 stars.

What kind of garbage is this? Amazon contacted me after the first review and left a message, which was great, but when contacting them back, no one helped!!!! The CS rep was either incompetent or trolling me because he kept asking me to give him the order number and then asked if I'm contacting them about the pack of shirts I bought? What?! Can't return, and don't want a new firestick!!! I love Amazon for everything else, but they make garbage devices anymore and don't stand by them.Previous review: To preface, I've owned many of these over the years since they first came out and loved them. Last year I finally had to junk the 2nd generation Firestick. That's how long it lasted. We have two that we bought at the same time that are the 2nd ones we bought and they are still going strong no issues, no lag whatsoever, believe it or not (Sorry for not remembering the exact model name and year) But this one... it's always saying there's no storage. It is only a month old! Search the keywords \"low storage\" in the reviews and questions and you'll read similar experiences. We've not downloaded anything new at all... In YEARS.  Same old apps because we're boring people like that and like what we like and don't like change. Case and point... whatever they changed on these ruined Firesticks for me. I'd be willing to try a Roku instead for the first time ever because the constant need to \"delete apps due to low storage\" ruins the experience and ease of using this device. I reluctantly deleted 7 apps and nothing changed at all. Mind you, we do not store photos or anything on our Firesticks. But no updates on any apps are possible because it says we are low in storage.**also, we bought the Fire Cube and out of the box it didn't work. We went through the instructions, checked cables, etc... even Customer Service had no clue why it wouldn't work after they performed their own troubleshooting measures. We returned it and didn't buy another one.

Overall, Amazon fire stick just gives you one big Amazon ad when all you\u2019re trying to do is find something to watch.  Prime Day ads were heavily pushed to the point of being intrusive.THEN you have to click the buttons on the remote about a dozen times to play something outside of Prime video.

The Luna gaming app works very well with the Fire Stick Ethernet Adapter, which I also bought. It also works without ethernet connected, but there is some lag. But like I said, I just bought it for Luna gaming and I'm satisfied with it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1705622400000}

So..... It is awesome. So awesome that I gave it 1 star. Amazon is now so awesome that I have completed my christmas shopping & did not purchase a single gift from them. It is so amazing that you get 20 year old specs on the new 3rd gen device. If you like broken up streaming video with white snow lines (on a digital tv) then you will really like this. If you like going to Kohls and standing in line for over an hour. Just to return something. Then this is a MUST HAVE!Screw it, time for the truth. If they flag it then they flag it. Remember when Amazon was an AWESOME small company? When you could brag and show any doubters their web site and ask them to show you a flaw. It was all about customer service. Selling good products at a good price. When you clicked on an item and the entire page was dedicated to that item.  Instead of what else you can buy. Now I am typing a review and what do I see? \"Similar to your past purchases\".... Recommended items... More items for you to explore..... Your browsing history.... Just non stop selling of their snake oil.Now lets tie it to this item. When you launch Netflix it will play. It will ONLY show you things you can stream. It does not try to get you to buy or rent anything. Amazon Prime is a whole different animal. Now what you can watch free is buried in all the junk for you to buy, rent or subscribe to. It is not a streaming service. It is a Sales Service!!! That was the only reason I kept my membership. I really don't buy from them anymore. I am tired of throwing stuff away. Who wants to jump through all the hoops now to return something? Now the streaming service sucks as well. Talk about ironic. The Amazon Fire struggles to play Amazon Prime videos. The sound is horrid, the picture is just as bad. It will hang and freeze. Alexa seems to have the IQ of a soap dish. Working at their biggest competitor. People would ask me if I was a plant from Amazon or on their payroll. I would tell other employees & customers to get it from Amazon instead. The price is a little higher but the company is the real deal. It is not all cheap made in china crap. They have real customer service. The reviews are legit. Good or bad they will post them.I never thought I would see the day (or even dream of saying) Walmart is better then Amazon. Yes with untrained staff, made in china junk, filthy stores. They are better. The items cost less. You can buy it the same day. Return it the same day if needed (no questioned asked). The return line time will be 1\/4th of waiting at Kohls.

Why are they doing this?Fire TV used to be ad free. God knows we are paying enough for it.  First they RUINED Amazon music for prime, where you cannot even select a single song to listen to anymore without being forced to eat whatever song they serve to you instead, then they mess up kindle by taking ALL THE STORE LINKS OFF OF YOUR KINDLE LIBRARY AND HOME SCREENS (yes, you can still click on the kindle thing on the home screen but it doesn't take you to the home screen of the store, only to the KINDLE UNLIMITED page, and you CANNOT NAVIGATE OUT!!!). Now, the store button in the library has been replaced with \"shorts\", which I have NO INTEREST IN. I have over 5k books on my kindle and NOT ONE IS A SHORT. All you can do now, is go into a book, go into the options, go to the bottom of the menu, and click \"shop in the Kindle store\". That is the single and only way to buy books now.  Does Amazon not care about money?Worse than all this, I was paying $70+ a month to get extra prime channels and then THEY TAKE THE \"YOUR CHANNELS\" tab OFF the fire home screen for over a month straight. Only way to see your channels was to go into the leggy, glitchy Prime Video app and scream in frustration waiting for your channels to load. This happens periodically but this time, it was gone for so long, I decided to just cancel almost all my channels. I've had it with Amazon destroying everything good about the company. I've stopped buying books almost entirely, I've canceled channels, I've erased the Amazon music app, and honestly, with now being force fed ads, Prime and Kindle fire stick will be the next things to go.

{"reviewTitle":"Ruined By Software Updates - Slow, Buggy, Ad-Riddled","reviewDescription":"I've owned this FireTV Stick for exactly one year now, and it gets worse on a monthly basis. The best way to describe it is like an early 2000s computer\u2014painfully slow with intrusive pop-up ads that get in the way of everything you try to click on.When you turn on the FireTV Stick, you're greeted with a full-screen ad that autoplays video with sound. You can disable the video and audio, but not the ad itself. In order to access things like Netflix or HBO, you have to scroll \"below the fold\" aka past another two rows of advertisements (disguised as 'sponsored' or 'recommended' content).The endless ads slow the device down tremendously. It's easy to click a button on the remote, think nothing is happening, click again, then once the device catches up you've skipped past what you were aiming for in the first place. Apps take twice the time to launch as they used to. When I try to live stream sports, it often crashes and I'm brought back to the home screen (and have to navigate the maze of ads again).This is all a shame because the device could be excellent. I bought it for the simple yet powerful remote, which easily turns on by TV + Soundbar and controls both flawlessly. Setup is a breeze. The Alexa voice search, while slow, returns accurate results. It's affordable and basic, but meets all my needs from a streaming device.It's clear Amazon decided they would make money on this product through advertising, at a reduced upfront cost. When you buy this, you're paying less upfront but it's honestly not worth it in the long run. Unless Amazon changes course, you're better off paying more for a streaming device that respects its users and doesn't turn their TV into a slow, cluttered billboard.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702425600000}

I tried pressing the play\/pause and select buttons simultaneously to restart the device. It got stuck on the logo page with the animation. I tried unplugging the device (for over 5 minutes) and plugging it back in, at which point it was stuck on the regular logo screen. I tried leaving it there for more than 10 minutes, and nothing happened.I got on with Amazon support. They asked me to plug the device into a different television, which I did, only to find that the logo wouldn't even load anymore. The support agent asked a number of questions without a lot of context (for example, which of my 3rd generation fire sticks was this -- the one I got at the store or the one I got on Amazon? How is someone supposed to remember which of the exact same fire sticks is which?).After about a half hour of troubleshooting on my own and about a half hour of working with the agent, I was offered 15% off a new fire stick. I told the agent I was frustrated, and that saving a few dollars (while giving Amazon even more) was unsatisfying. They went up to 25% and eventually 30%. While I appreciate that, they should have STARTED at that number if it was available, not wasted my time (after I'd already spent so much time troubleshooting).I'm not sure if there are better options out there, but Amazon should do a better job standing behind their products and actually replace broken ones. They shouldn't be haggling over a couple of dollars just to leave customers frustrated, exhausted, and unsatisfied.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704844800000}

I can't see buying a remote that we need to replace every year.Update:  If I could give it ZERO stars I would.  I was contacted quickly by customer service, which gave me high hopes.  That was quickly squashed by lies and rude customer service.  JJ (on a positive note he was nice) called and wanted to attempt to get the remotes working again. He stated he could only see the remote that I got from a retail store (Target) and not the one I purchased from Amazon in October. He requested that I login to the phone app to access the remote and un-link it.  As I was at work and could not access the remote , he stated he would send me an email with a link to get immediate customer service so when I returned home I wouldn't have to wait in a long line to speak with someone.  I did get the email, but it only contained the link for the generic \"what can I help you with\" customer support.  I shrugged it off and attempted to call customer support again.  After explaining my situation AGAIN to the support rep I was transferred to a rep from Fire Stick Support (they must be bad since they have their own support line) where I was met with a cold and rude response.

We instantly started having the same issues. The batteries would drain less than 24 hours after putting brand new ones in. I followed all of the steps online for resetting, making sure that there were no pending updates, etc., but still had issues with being able to use the remote. Reached out to Amazon support and they sent out a replacement and guess what...had the same issues with that! Finally gave up on using the remote and downloaded the FireTV remote.

I had to move to streaming since Directv dropped channels, and after settling on the somewhat pricier YouTube TV for my base package, added a small handful of other apps\u2026I generally was aware I would see more data usage, I had 1.2 TB cap, and had used maybe 200-300Gb a month before, so did not expect huge issues.Boy, was I surprised! While we are a small family, we tend to have 1-2 TVs on a lot during the day, each with their own Firestick. But we are not crazy using a lot of higher res stuff. Nonetheless, within a week of more intensive, but now new normal usage, got word we were already at 75% of our \u201ccap\u201d. I immediately began researching how to control this, and have spent, so far, likely 8 hours fine tuning since we have 4 sticks in use throughout the house (of course, no more than 2 at a time).After all this effort, while the daily run rate came down a lot (some 40-50%), still had high usage, and finally figured out had to do with how one EXITS using the TV. Suffice it to say, NO, one does not simply press the off button in the device as this merely turns off the TV, NOT the stick, and NOT a show open using data. To totally shut down data, one needs to FIRST press the home button to get back to the main menu and FULLY exit the program or movie. BUT, to my dismay and chagrin, at times when one presses this, one first gets an intermediate screen which again does NOT stop the program from using data (one can still hear dialogue). So, one then has to AGAIN press the home button and wait to ensure the stream is fully stopped\u2026This is flat out silly, and makes me wonder if Amazon gets a cut of the action from the data usage fees users will pile up! So, Amazon, how about next time having a simple on-off button which not only turns off TV, a minor detail compared to the $50-100 more one can rack up each month in excess data usage, but also effectively shuts down any send\/receive on the FireStick. I am not totally familiar with other alternatives, though seems Roku literally has to be \u201cwoken up\u201d after one turns off whatever its on-off button controls.Bottom line suggestion\u2026before settling on FireStick, check out other alternatives\u2026for sure, Roku (we tried but dropped because Roku did not have an internet app that could be used\u2026","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1650758400000}

The Fire Stick worked fine for several years.  Recently, however, it got so closed captions would not sync with the dialogue at all--on any streaming service.  I called Amazon tech support, and after ascertaining that my wi-fi and router were working fine, the tech suggested that my Fire Stick was old and that was probably the problem.  She was kind enough to offer me a discount on a replacement--either as upgrade or as an \"out-of-warranty\" consideration.  However, these things are not expensive, so I simply ordered a new one.  I knew immediately something was wrong.  When first booted up it would work ok; but if you left it on pause or tried to navigate to different show or a different steaming service, the remote buttons became totally unresponsive and the whole thing froze and had to be rebooted.  I sent it back and ordered a replacement.  Same exact problem.  In frustration, I ordered the updated basic Roku box:  it never misses a beat, using (of course) the exact same wi-fi set up.  Bottom line: Amazon Fire- Stick is the pits.  DO NOT BUY!  Get the equivalent Roku and you will be happy.  PS, I still love Amazon's mail order services.

It would work fine for a day and then start saying something like \"Title unavailable\" regardless if you were trying to start something on Netflix, HBO Max, or Prime.  Other older version fire sticks all kept working across the home.  I went through all of their troubleshooting online...Updated the firmware, unplugged, restarted stick, redownloaded apps, factory reset, etc.  Work work for a while then started failing again.I thought no biggie, clearly it is a problem with the stick, I will send it back for a replacement....Tried on the site, only could send in for a refund which i didn't want because I bought it cheaper during Prime days.  Finally contacted customer service.  After a lot of back and forth their resolution was to return for a refund, when I explained that I don't want a refund, the product was under warranty and I want it fixed or a replacement sent, I don't want to pay an additional $24 for a product I just bought from them.  It was explained to me that it wasn't an option.  They then offered to forward me to the Fire TV team.  I then spent the next 45 minutes walking through the troubleshooting steps that I had not only already tried, but had done multiple times to get it back up and working.  Of course those steps \"fixed\" the issue, just like it had for me multiple times when I had done it before, and of course the next day we started getting the error messages.  I gave up.Funny, I can buy just about anything manufactured by 1000s of companies across the world and when it doesn't work, a replacement will be provided no problem, but for one of the few things Amazon manufactures, it appears impossible for me to get a replacement on their product that is faulty.  Congrats, Amazon, your product gets my first one star review on Amazon!!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1658707200000}
{"reviewTitle":"NOT AS PICTURED. VERY DISAPPOINTED!","reviewDescription":"I was so happy with the fire stick I bought 10 days before that I ordered 2 more so I could update my other older sticks and was very excited they had these disney plus and hulu convenient buttons that I use daily so I \u201creordered\u201d from my 1st order so I should have gotten the same product, but they changed the 2 shortcuts on the remotes from hulu and disney plus to peacock and direct tv. Why? The picture of the product along with the actual link of the product purchased in my history shows this item has disney plus and hulu buttons, not peacock and direct tv! Disappointed that I didn\u2019t get what I asked for so I called Amazon to complain and try to get an even exchange(which they wouldn't do although they admitted it was their mistake) then, they wouldn't even pay for UPS to bring the label to my home to pick it up for return since I don't have a printer and I don't know of any UPS store around me to drop it off without saying they would charge me to do that because they have to make up for expenses!(Funny a billion dollar profiting company won't pay for their mistake for a paying prime member and I have to use my gas to find the UPS to return it!) And then if I were even able to reorder these, they would not give me the sale price I paid for them unless it's on the site and I asked how do I know I won't go through this again?! The representative said she would said me a direct link to order the hulu and disney plus version but when I checked the email while on the phone with her, the link was not included, so I told her and she said she would send another email with it and that email never had it either, so how would I even know I'm gonna get the right product again. This is not worth going through again! I wouldn't recommend it! Now I have to go out to return them and wait many days for my refund.

The 2nd device I didn\u2019t activate until 4 months after purchase. Fast forward a little over a year later BOTH devices stopped working. On 1\/26 I placed a claim using my 2yr protection plan.  I was advised by 1\/28 I\u2019d get an email about  the decision to either replace or refund me. I never got an email response, but I did receive an email survey regarding a call to Amazon about a completely different item that Was on the same purchase order as the 2 firetv\u2019s I bought over a year prior. I hadn\u2019t reported ANY concerns about that particular item. So Amazon clearly got the items wrong. I cashed back on 1\/31(after not getting a response from Amazon or the seller) I was promised 2 Brand New replacement devices without the remotes and advised to use the old remotes. I was advised the replacements would work with my old remotes and the remotes weren\u2019t getting replaced because they had not been reported defective.. (I questioned why wouldn\u2019t the remotes come with the fire tv devices but ok, fine.) I received the replacements 2 days later. They\u2019re BOTH REFURBISHED, one is defective (don\u2019t work at all) the other  device won\u2019t  connect to either of my old remotes as the Amazon agent said they would. so of course I had to call Amazon AGAIN.

{"reviewTitle":"Forced Amazon Downloaded Streaming apps vs the Free streaming app","reviewDescription":"My review rating is actually a 1\/2. Since Roku and Fire Stick both came out, I appreciated Roku better because they didn't require you to pay for a monthly service fee to us their device unlike the Amazon Fire Stick. But Roku was limited on what apps you could download or maybe they weren't available at the time. Since Amazon no longer required a monthly service fee I started getting their devices because I was able to download more of my favorite streaming apps. But over the time Amazon started making it harder for me to install my favorite streaming apps because of their wanting to install their forced Amazon apps. I should not have a brand new updated Fire Stick, telling me that I'm out of space from installing my streaming apps.  With just ONLY 6 of my streaming apps downloaded, with only a couple more to install. To delete one of them to only have Amazon install several of THEIR apps that I don't even use or care for. Then when it's time for my streaming apps to update, they can't because the stick is out of storage space. So I have to go through the process of uninstalling and trying to reinstall it without the time staking process of managing my downloaded apps which requires me to delete some in order to reinstall the ones I deleted to allow the updates.  Roku has come along way with their streaming devices and Roku TV'S. I'm getting rid of all of my Fire Stick devices and outdated TV's for the Roku TV'S. I'm able to install ALL of my favorite streaming apps now without having to pay for any monthly service fee or restrictions on my favorite streaming apps to download. Or not having to worry about Roku having their own apps automatically downloaded and needing the extra room to do so blocking me from installing my own.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1685318400000}

The Firestick itself lags a lot, especially when going between apps on the menu. It freezes when turning on shows and stays on a black screen too often.We had our Roku connected to our Alexa show. My kids use the Alexa to pause and unpause the show they are watching. As well as turning on and off the tv. We got the Firestick because we were planning on connecting it to the Alexa as well. You would think since Alexa is connecting to another Amazon product the connection would be seamless. Not the case, half the time the Alexa won\u2019t connect to the Firestick, or she indicates that she heard the command and nothing happens. Never had this problem with the Roku. We tried disconnecting and reconnecting and this issue just isn\u2019t fixed.Lastly, the fire tv remote app leaves a lot to be desired. It won\u2019t connect to the Firestick most of the time.

This model is simply inferior quality. Of course, if I could uninstall any of the useless Amazon bloatware, I might have better luck, but I'm not allowed to. Amazon has decided that shoving there own products down our throats is more important than the user experience.I've used and loved Fire Sticks for a long time, but if this is the new normal, it might be time to try a Roku or a Chromecast.Edit: Even worse, now it keeps rearranging all of my apps.

Since I'm staying in the den, I purchased this Firestick for the TV in there. I was shocked at the ease of setting it up! I gave the item an overall '4' rating because, once I did get it set, I couldn't find any sports whatsoever in any lineup. It was a Saturday, so college football is my favorite time of the year. I could not get one college game to watch on anything, even after trying signing in to my Google network, my Prime account, or my Dad's YouTube TV account. I ended up watching the games on my parents' TV in their room. I'm not sure that all of my issues were from the Firestick, but that was the common denominator between the two sets. That being said....I did watch a couple of really good movies yesterday with it. One other small issue....shipping! I have a Prime account and have had it for several years. I ordered this item on Monday. Generally, I would have gotten it on Tuesday. However, I didn't receive it until Friday. I kept checking my tracking info...for whatever reason, it sat at the USPS for two days once it got into our town. At one point I was afraid it had gotten lost because it is a very small item. Again, thinking this was due to our USPS, not Amazon, and I'm not sure how all of that works with the shipping.

I recently bought 3 more, along with an Apple TV, to cut my cord on cable TV.The Apple TV required literally 5 minutes to setup. I my iPhone next to it, the Apple TV had a chat with my iPhone, then automatically set itself up with my Wi-fi, and then loaded all the apps on my other Apple TV. Five minutes and it was done.Next, around 9 am, I started with the 3 Fire Sticks. It's now 5 pm and I am still trying to get the last stick to function.I am somewhat tech-savvy and know that my wi-fi is working at 50+meg based on a speed test. The high end router is close by. All my computers are working fine on the internet. The only thing that is slow is the Fire Sticks.All of the Sticks had the same problem; they would boot up, somehow connect to my wi-fi without a password, and try to download updates. They would there for half an hour without showing any sign of activity until eventually timing out. I did the rest-to-factory trick, tried again, and again, and again. The screen would show that the stick was trying to update the software, then advise that it was slower than normal, and then time out advising that I try later. Very frustrating. There was no progress bar to see if it was even working, which I now suspect that it was.If I waited long enough, and then rebooted the stick, it would install the first of several updates. I lost count of how many reboots and updates I have done today, with each one getting a bit better along the installation path. Meanwhile, my wife is enjoying the Apple TV that took 5 minutes to setup.Once I did get the sticks to work I had to set each one up on its own. There doesn't seem to be a way to \"clone\" settings from my account, or from another stick. I've been typing in my email and passwords for hours.  So I think these Sticks are finally working, but it was a long day of tedious hassles that I don't want to ever do again.My time is worth more than the $75 I saved with each Fire Stick (compared to the cost of an Apple TV).

Did the setup & the product is still sluggish. I had to install wanted apps & realign my menu for the apps we use to stream. For less than $1 per device amazon could upgrade the ram or storage during manufacturing, possibly both depending on the manufacturer they are contracted with. The product is still sub par & seems to work marginally better than the one I was hoping to replace. Unfortunately amazon pre-installed even more bloatware & didn't increase storage or ram to account for the apps they install that I cannot remove.It amazes me that each newer generation of Amazon product consistently has been worse than the previous versions.The original Fire TV still works well. The Fire TV Stick I picked up to replace my first one that got lost moving the television ended up having multiple issues after a year (no problems with First Gen products). Consistently I need to restart & delete cache on the one I was hoping to replace.Now this one I ordered died in the middle of the setup & hit a white screen & I was unable to get it to work again.Went back to the other fire stick that requires frequent restarts to play content & rewinding during videos to resync audio properly during movies (just had to rewind 5 times tonight for a movie under 2 hours).Amazon your service & brand has lost the very reasons I defended your company for so long. Maybe it is time to move to Walmart's services & Roku.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1687651200000}

For very little more and probability the money in return for Amz is Not made on the hardware of the device, in IMO the minimum amount of ram should be 3 gb.3.  Internal video software producing videos for Amz & other apps, this is not an app you select, has terrible memory leaks and cache management.4.  8gb of internal storage is Terrible.  With poor OS cache management being an issue right along w\/memory leaks - I have had to trim down to a bare essential set of apps used and paid for.  Extensive usage, while even at 85% of capacity will run into 100% due to the 3 aforementioned issues.  I recommend utilizing the developer option (or adding it if stripped) to limit no more than 4 TSR active apps at a time (based on the last 4 used, with exception of system, services, app updates, & notifications.5.  It's convienient, there are some Good ideas conceptually about the device, design.6.  The addition of adding profiles - excellent!  The device will or can reset to its default ROM image through power loss or surges.  Using your Amz login and profiles can make rebuild easy.  Tip for Amz, write a .config.ini file or Linux equivalent under the home users root profile to store and sync:  Apps installed vs apps owned, app tile placement, & keep login data out of synchronization or...7.  Encrypt the OS as a default, with user permisson to unencrypt.8.  If you sell a 3rd party media service, take Paramount+ for example, which you have two app versions for (unnecessary) please update your Amz version to assure content is on par with the service as if purchased direct from the media service.  In the Paramount service, you might be able to search for something in their library, but the various screens & views are non-existent in the Amz version of the app.  This is the same as selling a service and providing only a portion of the service.9.  Reach an agreement with major service providers of various media services to allow or adopt a consistent screen\/view schema, or even a set of schemas (which actually you may have).10.  Git rid of the insane volume of BS apps.  Some are not really providing a service while also having a MRC or subscriber cost.  Very few non-Amz utility apps function, especially without paying (IMO & humble opinion, an outrageous cost.  Those types of apps shouldn't be needed if some of the recommendations above are considered (especially on the internal service media player).11. & finally... open to more apps, using your market and give the opt-in for people to use Android Market.  If the perf, storage, app coding updates for leaks and OS updates are made - this might move your target price range per unit an additonal 7 to 10 dollars.

{"reviewTitle":"Works ok, with issues.","reviewDescription":"I have owned FireSticks and Fire TV\u2019s before. The Fire TV\u2019s are the obvious best choice, having the software built into the TV itself.The FireStick\u2019s are (used to be) pretty good. I never have issues watching movies and playing some games. However, the newer ones aren\u2019t performing as well.This is the second \u201cnewer\u201d one I have owned, and they don\u2019t perform near as well as the older ones did. For starters, you have to buy special 3rd party adapters if you want to add a USB memory stick. Not having the adapter, and after you have installed the general apps allowing you to watch movies and tv shows, you\u2019re left with around 1GB. And if you\u2019re someone like me, who is disabled and not able to do much, other than watch TV all day; you want to download a few games to cure your boredom. Obviously, there are other things to do that would cure boredom, but I am very limited.As for performance; the sticks fall very short. Maybe it\u2019s just the unit I received, as my previous one wasn\u2019t quite as bad, but it is constantly crashing, it lags, the WiFi is very substandard (I have a gigabit connection which has a consistent 900Mbps, and the best I have gotten from this stick is less than 300Mbps on a good day), going back to the Home Screen after watching a movie takes far too long, etc.I am constantly having to go into settings and app management to clear the cache on every app. I\u2019ll change the view to view the apps by size, and it will come back with two, three, sometimes more of the same app showing, and not all apps are shown. You have to exit the settings completely and try again, hoping it will correct itself. Sometimes it does, most of the time it doesn\u2019t. And it builds up so much cache, that after a while, you won\u2019t be able to watch movies or open apps as it tells you there\u2019s not enough memory to perform that operation.I had to download a 3rd party app to complete the task. Even when the settings do work, I\u2019ll go into the app, and the app will clear around 200MB of junk that the settings wouldn\u2019t. So you\u2019re almost forced to purchase one of the adapters so that it doesn\u2019t crash.There are just too many issues involved, and it can be quite the pain.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the Fire TV\u2019s, and the sticks are usually pretty good as well, allowing you to watch movies on any TV. But I would definitely recommend getting a Fire TV instead of the stick. The ones I have found are very reasonably priced, and the performance by far outweighs the sticks! Being able to just plug in a memory stick is huge!

I restart the stick, or in extreme cases, try a different port on my TV, etc. Maybe it works, usually it doesn't. If it works, you've still spent about 30 min of your time.

Apparently the \"home\" button turns the TV on and off in some situations, which can be pretty annoying, because it is also the ONE command that my Echo devices recognize is intended for the Firestick. I would prefer that the power button control on\/off and not have some weird gimmick attached to the Home button. I've had to change the voice command for my IR blaster to \"TV menu\" to stop this from happening.Fortunately I was able to get it to stop using its own \"IR remote\" feature that kept turning on the other TV in the same room, which I use as a computer monitor.All in all, it's nice because it lets me use my Echo Studio as a sound bar, but that's about it. If you have a Smart TV that can reliably connect to your Echo Studio via Bluetooth, you don't need one of these.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1694908800000}

Now that they're also going to start charging $3 extra per month to get ad-free Prime streaming, the ads have been extremely intrusive.

{"reviewTitle":"Previous Firestick version was more user friendly.","reviewDescription":"It's OK, but not very user friendly. If you've been a Firestick customer for a while, this new version does not seem to make significant difference.Most annoying (at least for me) is that the placement of the mute button has changed. It used to be in the center, right below the volume button, and with a single press of the fingertip your TV was muted. Now it's on the left side. In other words, if you have the remote laying on the table and press the mute button, the entire remote tilts to the left, unless you have a good grip on the entire remote. It's the little conveniences that can make such a difference! Why the 4 App buttons below were added is beyond me! You can easily glance at those apps once you're on the home screen. The TV icon on the right opens TUBI, which is also easily found on the home screen. Lastly the top button: They switched out the Microphone icon for the Alexa icon. I actually liked the Microphone icon better. For new users all of this will be of no significance. But if one knows how it previously was, there is an air of disappointment. Had I been more aware of the changes, I would have not obtained this version. Last not least: After setup, you need to download and reinstall all your former apps from the app library. They do not automatically carry over! Then you need to sign in to all your previous apps as well, in order for them to work.

{"reviewTitle":"Great product, when it\u2019s actually working","reviewDescription":"The Fire TV Stick is a great streaming device that has pretty much everything I could ask for. I recently moved and chose not to get cable this time around since I barely watch it and it\u2019s been great. I have all my streaming services in one place with even more options to choose from and it\u2019s user friendly. I had no issues with it except\u2026..The first one I received worked fine until about an hour later when I got a notification on my television saying that the batteries were running low and needed to be replaced soon. Shortly after, the remote completely died and I had no way of using the Fire TV Stick. I found that odd because I used the Amazon Basics batteries that came with the device. I reached out to Amazon\u2019s customer service requesting new batteries, but in the meantime, I purchased a new set of batteries. This new set came with four batteries. I inserted two of them and the device started working again\u2026for a couple of hours. Then I got the same notification again about the batteries running low. This happened a total of three times.I eventually reached back out to Amazon to describe the problem and they sent me a replacement device. I was hoping that the second one wouldn\u2019t give me as many problems, but unfortunately, that was not the case. I repeated the same actions from the first time around, using new batteries each time, but still, I\u2019d get a \u201clow battery\u201d notification.Ultimately, I asked for a refund and sent both devices back. I know that not everybody has experienced this, but I just can\u2019t understand how I would have the same issue happen with two different devices. I also wasn\u2019t going to keep buying new batteries every time the remote decided to drain the energy out of the new ones I used.Not sure if I was just \u201clucky\u201d enough to get two duds or if there was an actual internal issue, but I really wasn\u2019t interested in getting another one to find out.I would\u2019ve given a higher rating, but seeing as how I really couldn\u2019t enjoy the device for several consecutive hours without the remote going out on me, I couldn\u2019t do it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1631664000000}

Using the older ones we could change volumes using the vol control on the headphones & buds very successfully.We bought the new firesticks to basically go for the latest technology. It worked okay. activated and linked them pretty well individually, one to each new 'stick as a start, and that's when the deal-breaker problem began.  On each new stick, the controls available on the 'phones and bud's there was no capability to raise or lower the volume as we needed - sometimes we'd up the vol if it was a good or special stream we wanted to watch - click up or down - hah! nothing happened, the volumes remained almost as preset and at quite low volume, to the point you could barely hear it..  We swapped earpods between all 3 of the Firestick, none worked on any of the new ones, but perfectly on the old Firesticks, no matter how we hooked them.Finally took them out  and put the old  'Sticks back in, and as said before, they worked fine.For us, these new firesticks don't work, are faulty and of no real use to us.  Unfortunately, we've had them to long to return.  Sorry I bought them really, even tho' they were at a pretty good price.So, my advice to you is that if you buy the latest 'sticks, TEST them with bluetooth  before you settle in with them.

If you are looking to use more than just a few streaming and\/or music services on this device, I recommend using Roku (or something else in general). I purchased this Fire TV Stick on sale to replace the dated SmartHub on my older TV; however, I am considering switching back to the TV SmartHub. We cancelled cable and use several streaming services. I was able to download 8 apps on the Fire TV Stick, and then I was out of storage. Furthermore, you are unable to delete several of the pre-installed Amazon apps. The Fire TV Stick is slow and buggy as well. I have a couple of Roku\u2019s in the house with well over 12 apps and have never run into storage or lag issues (same goes for my Apple TV). I can find more apps on the Roku app-store as well. Amazon also places too many advertisements on the home screen(s) of the Fire TV. I am quite disappointed as I love my echo and thought I\u2019d love this device. I will not be purchasing another one, and will opt for the Roku Express (which is typically the same price, or cheaper than the Fire TV Stick). For those of you who like the integration of Alexa, you CAN link Alexa to a Roku. I\u2019ve given it 2 stars overall because it does do what it\u2019s supposed to do, but there\u2019s other devices that are much better.

The least it should do is remember the last app you were using before you turned it off.

If you allow Amazon Kids to perform an app update, it doesn't overwrite the existing app but, rather, eats up the same amount of storage IN ADDITION TO the installed app. So, I have to conclude that any app update will also add more storage to the already crowded FireTV stick which, out of the box with NO additional apps, already has a bit more than half of it's 5.35 GB available used up with operating system.So, I subscribe to Hulu plus, Disney+, Peacock, HBO Max and Paramount. I can only have TWO of these apps download to the FireTV stick before it starts coming up and telling me I'm almost out of storage space. I go in and clear the cache, but the next day, same message, so, we keep Hulu on the stick, and only install any other app as we intend to use it. When we're done with it, we uninstall it again. It's a super pain in the\u2026uh\u2026well, it's a pain because you have to keep logging in every time the app is reinstalled, but it's the only way to keep it from freezing up and whining about storage space.Sure, I could spend MORE money and try to expand the storage, and perhaps that's Amazon's plan all along - I mean, I'm sure Mr. Bezos is having a tough time making payments on that super yacht, right?When not \u201coverloaded\u201d with more than two apps, it streams well and I find FireTV's presentation very intuitive and easy to navigate, which is why I gave it three stars. I'm just glad I didn't spend the extra money to have this aggravation on the 4k UHD stick which has the same amount of storage space.I miss my old FireTV - it was not a stick, a flat, square device that hung from the HDMI port and had TONS of space so I could have ALL my apps I use on it.Seems like every time Amazon \u201cimproves\u201d something, it takes a step backwards.I would recommend a Roku stick over this one.

Once my recast goes kaput, I will not get an internet dvr again.

Did a google search and found this has sound sync under settings > display & sounds > audio > AV Sync Tuning.  Will see if that helps.

So we did. The next time it told us to switch it to the other one. So we stopped using those buttons & used home button & selected our app like we did with our old one.This week it started glitching, freezing & lagging mostly while streaming live, Hulu live in particular. It is not a streaming issue or a WiFi issue as our other 2 fire sticks stream with zero issues. I chatted with representatives & was disconnected 6 times! So I had to explain everything SIX TIMES! I had done all troubleshooting including deregistering the device. They kept saying it was our internet which I know is not true bc our 3 echo dots & 2 other fire sticks work properly as does all other device connected to the internet. Strange coincidence but my warranty ran out the same week we started having issues. One rep finally agreed that it needed to be replaced & of course I lost them & another rep jumped on & said sorry best we can do is offer you 15% off a new device. They refuse to replace this garbage!!! Then ended the entire chat! Absolutely unacceptable! This fire stick arrived on Nov 2 & by Feb 1 was glitching so badly we can\u2019t watch live shows bc we get motion sickness!! I can stream other shows but it\u2019s slow to load.

{"reviewTitle":"Layout seems complicated and messy, but may be a better streaming device than others","reviewDescription":"Firstly, just FYI, another reviewer said that when you are watching, say, your cable TV on one HDMI port and  and want to switch over to another HDMI to watch Firestick, all you have to do is just ONLY press \"Home\" on the Firestick remote, and it will immediately take you to Firestick on the other HDMI.  This works.  Prior to that I had been confused, pushing various buttons just to accomplish it.Now for my HBO MAX story:I'm a female, retired senior citizen.  I have owned smart TV's, Roku boxes, and a smart blu-ray player for streaming services like Netflix and Prime, but nothing I currently own gets HBO MAX.  Therefore, I bought this Firestick just to get HBO MAX, which became a struggle, as follows if you'd like to read it.I had wanted to view a series which was only available on the new HBO MAX ORIGINALS streaming channel.  I didn't have any HBO subscription.  However, my cable provider (Verizon) was then offering a \"deal\" for a subscription to the regular HBO movie channels, ALONG WITH a new HBO MAX ORIGINALS streaming channel.  But, as my streaming device did not support HBO MAX, I bought this Firestick, which does, priced at $24.99 in Feb. 2022.  But then, after hours and hours of chats with Verizon and Amazon to fix the problem, my Firestick would simply not hook up to Verizon's streaming service.EVENTUALLY, after these hours of frustrating chats, Verizon informed me that they could not give connection service for any streaming devices unless I updated to a larger, more expensive channel line-up plan as well as purchase a new, high speed router for a few hundred dollars or rent it for $15\/month, and in addition to that, a $100++ fee for a service visit to update my system to facilitate the new router.  However, my old, self-purchased Verizon router was still working, and doing everything I needed just fine, except getting me HBO MAX ORIGINALS.  Also, a few years ago when I tried one of Verizon's faster routers, the speed increase would not work well with my old laptop so I returned that router and just went on with my old equipment until now.  But it won't get me HBO MAX ORIGINALS streaming.As an alternative to all this, Firestick was offering a $15\/mo. subscription to HBO MAX with HBO MAX ORIGINALS streaming channel, using Amazon instead of Verizon as provider.  So, I decided to just purchase that, and it hooked up right away just fine.  I watched the whole series I had wanted to see, and then decided to cancel, as there was nothing else that plan seemed to offer but a few more \"MAX ORIGINALS\" along with a list of past HBO movies you can stream if you want to.  I decided to stay with Verizon's HBO subscription instead, because I was enjoying the usual HBO live TV movie channels and didn't want to give them up.So, my \"free deal\" from Verizon for both HBO and the MAX ORIGINALS streaming channel, for $15\/month, never happened, with only the promise that the new, expensive router would work.  Maybe I'm just not keepin' up, but would rather save my money for now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"12 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646524800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Lag response, no input button","reviewDescription":"Dues this work? Technically yes, but there\u2019s a definite lag every time you hit a button before the tv actually responds (because you aren\u2019t using the tv\u2019s sensor anymore, you are waiting for the fire remote\u2019s signal to go to the little fire stick in back of the tv.) It drives me crazier than the remote I was trying to replace.Also, there\u2019s no way to select the tv input from the remote. Meaning, whenever I turn on the tv it goes to the original Home Screen menu. I then have to use the original remote (which barely works) to select HDMI2, where the fire is connected. THEN I can switch to the fire remote. Alternately, from my tv\u2019s original menu, I can hold the Alexa button and say \u201cswitch to input H-D-M-I-2\u201d but since I\u2019m not in the fire menu yet I can\u2019t tell if Alexa is listening to me or not (there is not the sound or blue bar at the bottom of the screen). I just have to wait and see if anything happens.The point is, this is not improving our tv experience. It is just adding more steps that make it harder for my kids to navigate. I do love the fire menu once I actually get to it (minus the lag response of the remote of course), but I think in this case I will benefit more from just ordering a replacement for my original remote.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1700956800000}

The menu shows a lot of potential programs to watch, but it depends on if you have one of many different apps installed on your stick. The problem comes after you install a couple of these apps, you run out of space after 2 or 3 installs, and needing to install 5 or more frequently-used apps you'll have to attach your own storage device to the stick, making it an odd assortment of attachments hanging from the back of the tv. Maybe it's just me, but a stick that looks like a large storage device, which wants to offer you programming from dozens of apps, should be able to handle installing all of the apps it wants you to use.Another issue I'm having with my fire stick is that the audio vanishes about once per day after not using the tv for a few hours. You sit down to watch some tv, get comfortable, turn on the screen, and there is no sound from the fire stick. You then have either go to settings and reboot the stick, usually multiple times, before the audio returns, or get up, unplug the fire stick from the power source, wait 30 seconds and plug it back in to get it reboot with sound working again. First world problems, but I believe some simple upgrades would make this a quality device to own. For now if I were shopping, I'd look hard at other devices.It comes with a nice simple remote. It would be great if there was a system to help locate a missing remote, but it's not included on this one.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686873600000}

They offered my a 15% off the next one I get it and just told me they could not help me with my fire tv so I had no choice but to buy a new one but one thing I\u2019ve noticed is the refresh rate for the response time every time I click a button just takes a while to even respond the click. I\u2019ve changed my battery and even then. The voice recognition also takes a minute to activate. Sometimes the connectivity on my streaming depending on the platform just exits out or buffs a lot. I tried through my Roku or Samsung tv and that same streaming channel works totally fine . I know fire tvs are just cheap so doesn\u2019t bother me to buy a new one but most times when you need a tech help for it good Luck\u2026most likely just gonna be told that you need to get a new one and they will give you a discount . I\u2019m not willing to be having to get a new one every few years..","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683676800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great in so many ways, but there is a fatal flaw","reviewDescription":"I liked the firestick so much that I bought another.  It turns even an old TV into a great streaming device.  I had Rokus before but they became outdated, and got slower as a few years went buy.  so the thing is each firestick has 8 gb of storage.  By the time the OS is loaded there is only 5.5gb.  Then add all of the apps channels that Amazon adds that you can't remove, I had just over 1 gb of storage left.  I added Netflix, Youtube, Prime Music, and Plex and was off to the races.  A few weeks later, I tried to add disney plus for my great granddaughter and I couldn't.  Critically low on storage.  Apparently 5 is too many apps\/channels for this device after the many bloatware type apps (Amazon Shopping Live anyone?).  So I attempted to add a USB drive to the device for additional storage.  Unfortunately none of the channels I added can take advantage of the storage, they can't be moved without some crazy complicated sideloading hack, which I tried with poor results.  So if you want to watch Prime and the built in Amazon apps\/channels and nothing else, then great.  But very limited number of channels you can add to it through the amazon app store, before you run out of storage.  Too bad.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691884800000}

No problems until I tried to watch a movie.  See the picture.  I tried \"restarting\" the TV, then the Firestick. No luck. Alexia was useless. What does \"restart\" mean in Amazon speak?

I constantly had to reset it and unplug\/replug. Finally, today, it went totally out. The previous models lasted for years. I'm really pissed and there doesn't seem to be any way to contact Amazon or return it. With Amazon's new price gouging and crappy products, it's certainly not what it used to be. Just how many trillions does Bezos need to make?

{"reviewTitle":"Extremely Glitchy","reviewDescription":"So I purchased this device against my better judgement. For I had a fire stick about 6 years ago and had problems with it immediately and swore I would never purchase it again. I should\u2019ve listened to my gut and stuck with Roku. \ud83d\ude10When logging into my streaming services, it takes forever to load. Once I counted between 5-10 minutes! \ud83d\ude28 While a show is playing, the app crashes, there\u2019s a lag where when the characters are speaking, it\u2019s not keeping up with the mouth movements,\ud83d\ude05 when ready to watch the next episode of a show, it skips like 4 episodes ahead, that\u2019s annoying. Or when resuming a show, it starts completely over! \ud83d\ude44 The rest of the issues are just too much to type. So, I\u2019m returning it and going back to my Roku device. \ud83d\ude43","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703980800000}

{"reviewTitle":"3 units stopped working - latest died within 2 months","reviewDescription":"I've never left a 1-star review. This works great when it works, but we've had 3 different units that have stopped working for no reason (we are gentle on our stuff and don't have littles or pets yet). The first lasted a couple of years, which is shorter than I'd hoped but seems almost reasonable. The next lasted 8 months. The most recent lasted 2 months. The same thing happened with one of my parents' units, too.Every time I've called Amazon about a unit, I've just missed the warranty period. When I've asked them how long the warranty is, they've said that it varies and can be 3 months, 6 months, or otherwise and there's not really any way of knowing how long the warranty is when buying. Then they offer a small discount to buy a new one. At this point, it's starting to feel scamy.On a more functional level, the included browser is glitchy and slow, and it's a bummer that you can't stream directly from your phone to the unit. I was happy with everything else while it was working. Plenty of app options, and it didn't have connection or buffering issues - until it started to die.I'm not sure if this latest unit is under warranty, but at this point, it's not worth the hassle of the phone call to get another glitchy unit. I'm usually loyal to brands, but it's time to give another brand a try.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1685145600000}
