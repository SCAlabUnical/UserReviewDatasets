{"reviewTitle":"NOT ready player one","reviewDescription":"I\u2019m an artist, 28 and figured I could use the Quest 3 to draw, game, watch movies and be social! I was excited, especially after all the videos I\u2019ve watched leading up to me pulling the trigger on the purchase.The packaging is nice, the product feels good around your head. But quickly I learned there\u2019s a lot you must do to start actually enjoying this product.First, download an eye app to calculate your eye width. You\u2019ll need that to properly adjust the lenses on the Headset.Second, create an account (no problem).Third, begin to feel sick 30 minutes into playing (others may vary (sooner\/later)).Fourth, hop online to see what you can do to reduce feeling nauseous. The following are what you can do:\u201cTrain your body\u201d* Get a fan and point it at your feet.* Stay hydrated at all times and keep a water bottle around.*buy a better strap for the headset as this one loosens up and becomes uncomfortable.* Train your body by playin in sessions, around 15 minutes at a time. Take frequent breaks and even go as far as putting it down for the entire day to cool down the feeling of sickness.I thought I would\u2019ve loved this. But I could not play any of the moving games. I understand you can teleport to places, but the fact that this thing makes you sick and you have to train your body just shows that it\u2019s Not ready.This is a toy for those who can afford to sit around all day, do nothing and feel sick in the process.If you plan on watching movies, listening to music then you\u2019ll do a lot better and won\u2019t feel sick as quickly or maybe even at all! The problem is your brain gets confused when it sees you walking but knows that you are not actually moving your legs, so you end up feeling sick very quickly (try it. ) I literally had to close my eyes as I pressed forward in the remote and open them when I was at the spot.I played a round with a special needs kid and he was kicking my butt and enjoying himself so clearly others have become accustomed to the system. So you just gotta decide if you love gaming that much that you\u2019d be cool with learning this. Because you have no choice but to learn, or not enjoy it as much.But good luck to all who do try it. And good luck to the companies making these, I hope for innovation at its finest!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1722729600000}
{"reviewTitle":"To me, it's a letdown. A pretty big one. but it DOES have some good qualities to it.","reviewDescription":"SSSOOOOOOOOOO....Let's go ahead and get the cons out of the way and then I'll tell you the good.The biggest HEAT BAD - There is a spot of tech that heats in the top center of the faceplate and I can feel it from forehead, that heat issue is immense and imo dangerous, I don't use any tech that reaches that heat, especially things like phones, battery packs, and chargers, cause ya know, lithium go boom. Heat is bad, and if meta knew this was an issue since quest 2? That's the first thing they should have addressed.Second biggest - for me, visuals are a make or break deal for me. I came from quest 1, this tells you how bad I thought their visuals were. I connect to pc, my quest 1 has outdone quest 2 for a long while, and I thought maybe quest 3 could outdo it. No. The overall sharpness increases, that's where the good dies, I will reiterate that later. The pancake lenses are cool and all, but when you look outside of direct center of your visuals you get a very bad dark ring in the lenses. LCD screens are 90s tech that never got better really.  The overall colors are washed 100 too many times, the ingame and inmenu colors are all darker than they should be, like brightness went to die. I could not stand it for very long, it was that bad.Third - BATTERY, I read the stuff online and I was like \"ok, cool, but how's it while plugged in?\" Same deal, and adds to the heat issue from 1. The heat exists with or without plug, it's a couple degrees difference. Bad battery, won't last. 3 hours is not acceptable as a time limit, and if you really want to make a standalone, make it last alone longer than 6 hours while operating at the full capacity, if it can't do that, it's kinda not worth it. If you guys can't make a headset that can stand alone, make it pc locked, but increase the efficiency of the energy transfer and focus on heat mitigation.fourth - less relevant, but they need to stop with the non-halo straps, it's like 10 bucks worth of plastic you cheap people, 20-40 if you're doing it right and making quality >>.. that's something that should be mandatory.five - the controllers are harder to use due to the wide head size and I have no idea why you guys thought it was a good thing to make the  top like that.six - the depth sensor actually hurt the color camera performance, you would have been way better off just leaving it off and letting it stick to optional zooming in and out controlled by the user.seven - tutorial voice super annoying, have option to do text or speech tutorial, or better yet, a friggin skip button!So, now that's out of the way for the main bad points, here's the some goodTracking is REALLY a huge step up from before, the controllers are really good at placement from what I know.the fps is actually a decent upgrade as well, smoothness was nice.the color passthrough was actually kinda nice for like 2 minutes.it had a lot of potential. who knows, maybe with some software tweaks, the depth sensor won't be a detriment, and maybe it'll be an unexpected grower like the quest 1 was. But if my quest 1 still lives and outperforms it on the visuals and battery life while not overheating? You guys went in the wrong direction.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"36 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697068800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Buy Quest 3, Get Immediately Worse at Beat Saber","reviewDescription":"I don't use VR for many different things, but when I find a game I really like, I play it a lot. I only really use the VR for Walkabout Mini Golf and Beat Saber, and occasionally table tennis and bowling. I previously had used the Quest 2 for four years, playing these games exclusively. I needed to replace the head strap on it, and there was a scratch in the lens glass that was permanently visible, so I knew I would need to either upgrade to a Quest 3 or buy a replacement Quest 2. I read a lot about the tracking issues on Quest 3 when playing fast-paced games, but decided to upgrade to the 3 anyway, thinking it would be a better longer-term investment. But so far, my experience has degraded so much that I very much regret going with this newer model.Beat Saber was one of the games that put the original [Oculus] Quest on the map. It is one of the most popular games on VR, and you would think that Meta would take that into consideration when coming out with newer headset models. But the Quest 3 is a significant downgrade from the Quest 2 when it comes to playing this game. The tracking is far worse in the same room as I used the Quest 2 in, and the new controllers do not allow for the same grip that was used with the previous controllers. I instantly regretted this purchase and am considering returning and buying a Quest 2 instead.I am sure this is a phenomenal unit for other purposes, and the VR world does not revolve around 6-year-old games. So perhaps this is still something to consider. Just not for me.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723334400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Crapped out of my after 2 weeks","reviewDescription":"Getting this was Awesome, I've been wanting to get one since I tried the oculus one like 5 or 6 years ago. I finally got this one and was super excited to have it, especially once I saw I'm able to use it for work even. Having multiple displays was awesome and my productivity went way up. After a few weeks however I went to use it, put it on booted it up and then unplugged it from charging. It immediately turned off. I thought that was weird but whatever, then I couldn't get it to turn back on. Just kept showing the Meta symbol and then turned back off. It did this for about 20 minutes (I finally just set it down and got on my computer to get some work done) until I noticed it turned all the way on and stayed on. So, I put it on plugged in the external battery I got for it. Every time I plug in the external battery it'll automatically start charging the headset so I'll turn the battery off and just run off of the headset battery until it's low and then turn the backup battery back on. This time however, when I turned the backup batter off my whole headset turned off. It started doing the power cycle thing again and wouldn't stop until I unplugged my backup battery. Then, again, after about 15-20 min it turned all the way on and stayed on. I looked up some troubleshooting things I could try. Hold the power button for 30 seconds (didn't fix it), even did a total factory reset (still didn't fix it). Finally I reached out to Meta and told them what was going on. They were nice enough, told me they'd send me a replacement device. Except they mapped out the return process and after I send my device back to them it takes them half a month to get me my replacement headset. I was a little annoyed about that because I haven't had my headset for very long and I've been able to use it for work too. That's all they were willing to do for me. Send me a (hopefully) fully functioning headset that I paid for and that's it. They aren't doing me any favors they are just giving me what I paid for. After using this for such a short time and now it doing this and then them not even getting me a replacement in a quick time frame, I was really disappointed. I wasn't going into this looking to get a bunch of free stuff with the replacement, I wasn't even looking to get a replacement at all, but once I heard that was the route it had to go to get fixed and it was going to take over 2 weeks for me to get it back, yeah, I wanted some type of compensation! I've already paid for this product so I'll take the replacement but I'm never going to buy a meta product again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707868800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Headset good, software is garbage.","reviewDescription":"DISCLAIMER- This is about a specific software issue not a full review. If you're looking to buy a Quest 3 for PCVR like Racing and Flight sims this applies to you!Because you can't even set up the headset without Meta's Oculus software, I consider this very much part of how this headset should be reviewed. I'm coming from a Reverb G2. I went this route because of the newer lenses, pass through mode and price. Only the Pico headset has the same lenses at this price point. I tested one out and it's not bad but it's software support for US users is lacking big time so I went with Quest 3 thinking its got to be better, right?..My use case is mostly seated sim play from my gaming PC. I wanted to create a big virtual screen with pass through sometimes, and other times just go full immersion. Those two options were very appealing on paper. Little did I know, the Oculus base software that is required to run the Quest 3, will not allow removing the visible safty boundaries and have pass through on at the same time. You can set up a free developer account and remove the boundaries but it locks you out from switching to pass through mode at the same time. This has to be the worst software design choice ever for a VR headset. If I'm in pass through mode, I can see my surroundings environment! Why the heck would I need a virtual boundary grid visible in the headset!? Even if I manual set up a stationary boundary, the moment I lean back in my sim seat a bright blue boundary ring envelopes my view. The general response to my complaint is, \"Just set up a custom boundary\". Well I would, except my setup is against a wall on one side like most people and the floor is also considered a boundary. So when you're low in a sim seat, you're so close to the floor boundaries they almost always appear. You can only draw the boundary on 3 sides with a wall there. So that doesn't work either way. This makes my racing and flight sims basically unplayable. META, FIX THIS! I've spent hours researching a workaround and have read many, many people having the same issue. There simply is no way around the restrictive Oculus software to allow pass through without virtual boundaries. I'm extremely close to returning this otherwise great headset because of terrible software choices. If you are buying this for a similar use, you may want to wait until Meta hopefully fixes this boneheaded software restriction.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701648000000}
{"reviewTitle":"VR isn't ready","reviewDescription":"The Quest 3 is my first VR headset and I did a considerable amount of research before purchasing it. I watched and read many reviews of the device and reviewers largely were pleased, calling it a big step up from the Quest 2.I bought the device primarily for Golf+, but also to try out with games on Steam like No Man's Sky and Subnautica. I bought the Quest 3 over the Quest 2 because I heard it had great features like passthrough and automatic boundary detection.Here are my issues with the Quest 3:- The headstrap. Everyone will tell you the strap is absolutely terrible and it is. It's extremely uncomfortable and hard to adjust. The primary issue is how little margin for error you have with your eye placement relative to the lenses, if you don't want an awful blurry experience you need the headset adjusted perfectly, which is really hard to do with this strap.- The passthrough. It's really, really low quality - it looks like watching a 240p video. For simple things like walking around, picking up controllers, etc. it's fine, but it's not the quality I expected.- The field of view. In games like Golf+, I found myself wanting to use my peripheral vision to see something, only see the black of the headset. This was a big strike against the immersion which otherwise would have been good.- The visual fidelity. At first I thought this was user error, I spent two hours fiddling with the headset and the headstrap getting my eyes positioned perfectly in relation to the lenses. Eventually, I got the text in menus looking clear... some of the time. Some text would look clear and some would look blurry, there were differences in quality even between floating menus that were right next to each other in the same game. The quality just wasn't good - everything looked very low resolution. Even playing games over SteamVR had similar results.- The hand tracking. Interacting with menus, grabbing them and dragging them around, etc. all sound great in theory but 95% of the time I couldn't get it to work at all.There's definitely a lot of good things about the Quest 3, VR is on a great trajectory, but for me it just isn't ready yet. Even if I had gotten the headset for free, I can't see myself using it regularly.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704326400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not worth it, at least not right now","reviewDescription":"I have Quest 2 and I was very excited about Quest 3 because of the mixed reality, better resolution, faster processor, etc. I'll start with clear improvements:- Quest 3 is much more comfortable. Headset is lighter, controllers lost their halos- Resolution is better and you can actually tell the difference- Lens adjustment wheel so you don't have to take your headset off a dozen of times when you set it up for the first time- Hand tracking is fun but I cannot see myself using this headset without controllers all the time unless app developers start integrating this feature. Right now you can interact with the OS UI but that's pretty much it. At least in my case hand tracking didn't work in any of the apps I have. Still a very cool feature.But that's about it. And now the reason for the low rating:- There seems to be no good mixed reality app\/game yet. I tried Espire 2 and a couple of other games but they are either buggy or they lack mechanics and feel super repetitive. I am sure there's going to be ton of MR content in the future, just not today- It keeps crashing running games like \"Into the Radius\" throwing either \"Lost tracking\" or \"Not enough memory\"- The passthrough mode is fun but it's not as clear as you might think after watching youtube reviews of this headset. Very grainy picture- Quest 3 suggests that you scan your entire house, which made me very excited because this led me to believe I could play mixed reality games walking from one room to another. Turns out you cannot set guardian too far from your position. In my case it was about 20' away max. But Meta still suggested that I share the scan of my house with them so I skip this step in the future. Sure :)So if you are hesitating whether Quest 3 is worth it, I think it's not. Especially if you have Quest 2 and looking upgrade. The fact that it crashes running a 4 year old game is kind of a red flag, losing tracking every now and then in a room full of light feels like a software bug that hopefully they can fix, but who knows. And the biggest disappointment, the key feature (in my case this was the most important) colored passthrough + mixed reality falls short because there's not enough content to enjoy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702080000000}

I tried everything I could for multiple hours, every bit of googling, undoing things I had done, restarting my computer, the headset, changing old information on the computer.I could not get the controller to reactivate.Finally it felt like I had spent multiple hours of wasted time and decided if this is where the tech is, then I will come back to it in a few more years when it has more support.The native games still feel like tech-demos so they don't interest me nearly as much.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1724630400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Disappointing on multiple accounts","reviewDescription":"Let me preface by saying I couldn\u2019t have been more excited for the quest. I held onto my Oculus Rift CV1 for as long as I possibly could and was really looking forward to my first headset with inside-out tracking. Unfortunately, the Quest 3 didn\u2019t deliver. Here are five reasons why I ultimately decided to return it:1. Meta is neglecting PCVRThe latency induced by playing over Wi-Fi\/USB rendered my PCVR games unplayable, and I even own a Wi-Fi 6 router that I was within a few feet from. Also, licenses don\u2019t transfer, so if you own a game on PC and want to play it standalone, you\u2019re forced to purchase it again.2. Pass-through is good but not great.There is lots of distortion that isn\u2019t shown in the promos. The pass-through camera is relatively low resolution and performs poorly in low light conditions. I can read my phone if I hold close to my face, but cannot read my computer monitor at arms length. Also the FOV is only 110\u00b0, so it still feels like you are in a simulated environment.3. Dev support isn\u2019t thereIn the past few years, there have only been a handful of notable releases. If you are brand new to VR, there might be enough to keep you busy for a little while, but VR veterans won\u2019t find anything new here except the typical main stays.4. The battery isn\u2019t big enoughYou only get about 1.5 hours of playtime before you need to spend another 2 hours charging the thing which means you\u2019ll almost certainly have to purchase a separate power bank if you want to enjoy the Quest without interruption. That wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it weren\u2019t already so expensive to begin with, which leads me to last point:5. It\u2019s too expensiveFor the same price as the 128GB model, you could get a current gen console plus a few games. It\u2019s ok value if you only consider it as a standalone device only, but as someone with a VR capable PC already, I\u2019d rather not have to pay for he onboard tech I will hardly ever use.That\u2019s why, much to my chagrin, I chose to return my headset. PCVR support, dev support, battery, and pass through were major pain points that should be selling points. Hopefully, another company can fill this hole in the market that Meta has left wide open.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700697600000}

But curiosity got me and I purchased it.I'm very happy with it, more than I expected to be.First of all, it's a lot lighter which makes it way more comfortable to wear, especially for longer periods.Second, the color passthrough is a big upgrade, you can see the room clearly and even see and use your phone through it, not grainy black and white like in the original Quests. Many apps and games support passthrough so the upgrade is noticeable. Scanning the room is also a lot simpler with the new device, you don't need to draw your boundary, the device recognizes your surroundings for you.Third, the strap that comes with it is a lot better than the stock strap that came with the Quest 2. It's much easier to adjust, which is especially useful if other people want to try your device. I still recommend getting a third-party strap but you can get along with the one that's included (with the Quest 2 I immediately replaced the stock strap with a halo strap).Fourth, the screens are a LOT better, they are clearer, better graphics, and most of all, there aren't weird blurry\/fuzzy areas you would see with the Quest 2. Just for this the upgrade is worth it.Fifth, the hand controllers are lighter and nicer.The only downside I have with the Meta Quest 3 is that for some reason the hand controller batteries run down REALLY quickly. Even if you're not using the device for some reason. With the Quest 2 the controller batteries would last for weeks, it was actually quite surprising how long they lasted. With the Quest 3 the controller batteries just run down while the device is turned off. It's pretty annoying but I learned to always have a pair of rechargeable AA's nearby to just swap them out when needed.

{"reviewTitle":"A Leap Forward For Mixed Reality","reviewDescription":"I owned the original Oculus Rift and upgraded to the Meta Quest 3. It was a big leap forward for me.\u2014 TRACKING \u2014Gone are the days when you had to have fixed sensors in your room with a fixed play area. Now, you can bring this anywhere and play wirelessly, with or without a computer. Just the fact that I don't need sensors is a win. The tech packed into this can detect your surrounding environments quickly and easily. It even tracks your hands and you can navigate with just your hands using gestures similar to an iPad\/iPhone.\u2014 SCREEN \u2014The screen is a big improvement over previous generations, including Meta's Pro model. The colors are vibrant, the sharpness is perfect, and getting your head in the sweet spot is much easier. I advise using an app to measure your eye distance (like Eye Measure), and then you can adjust the lenses to suit your exact eye distance for optimum viewing comfort.\u2014 STORAGE \u2014I got the 512GB because I was torn about their pricing model. I didn't want to underdo it so I spent the extra money so I had more space, even if I didn't know if I would need it. Frankly, 256GB would've been perfect for me personally at the moment.\u2014 WIRELESS PLAY \u2014The games runs off the headset\u2014if you buy games from the Meta Quest store. They do run more expensive and the sales are okay when they're there. If you have been buying VR games on Steam, you can run them wirelessly with SteamVR as long as your computer's graphics card is compatible. You can also physically connect a USB-C cable to a computer to play your games.\u2014 GAMES \u2014Games feel like an elevated Nintendo 64 at the moment. The tech is there, we just need higher-quality textures and more AAA games when the masses start pouring in. Most games seem to have a stylized polygonal quality to them, and few games are going for a realistic look. Currently, I would say the quality of games is good enough for where the technology is at the moment in terms of the processing power that's in the headset at this price point.One of the great things is Asgard's Wrath II is included free with purchase and this is one of those games that takes full advantage of this headset's capabilities. You also get a 6-month free trial of Quest+, which is two pre-selected curated games per month for as long as you're a member; you lose those games when you cancel, but if you subscribe again your library will be there.\u2014 APPS \u2014Besides games, you can use different apps with this. I use Virtual Desktop to access my 3D movie files on my computer, plus other media I have. I can also access my SteamVR games this way as well. Then there are media consumption apps like Amazon and Netflix. Explore and you'll find useful things to install.\u2014 MIXED REALITY \u2014This is part of the future of gaming, baby. Having a big play space at home combined with a mixed reality game is one of the most fun experiences to have. This is also similar tech in Apple's Vision Pro. There are a couple of free games included, and I can't wait to see what the future holds in this growing game category.\u2014 BATTERY \u2014The battery lasts on average about two hours. For me, that's great because I generally get a little dizzy before that period so the headset will die before I get fully nauseous. VR dizziness is a real thing and I advise that if you start feeling some type of way, to stop sooner rather than later. I would build up your brain's tolerance to VR slowly. If you get dizzy, start timing how long it takes. Take a day off and try to add 10 minutes or so in the next session, until you can go longer.If you are one of the lucky few who are not affected by dizziness, you can plug this into a wall while playing and it will charge while you play. In theory, you could play non-stop with the right cable and charger.\u2014 SUMMARY \u2014If you haven't gotten into VR yet, try it out in the stores. If you like it, then definitely get the Meta Quest 3. If you're unsure, you could wait for a price drop hopefully around Christmas of 2024.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"96 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706054400000}

I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.The amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine\/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.I had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.Visual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear\/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution\/pixel count.  I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors.  But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.The passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface\/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp.  Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy.  Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.I haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fianc\u00e9 to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..So the big question: Is it worth the money?My answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.I was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store.  This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again.  (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)With that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly.  Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling\/reinstalling, clearing cache\/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"43 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701561600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Game Changer","reviewDescription":"My top 10 reasons to buy the Quest 3 over other headsets:1. Best stand alone headset for the money! (Even better than the Quest 2, see next point).2. Best lens technology and it\u2019s not even close. (Better than PSVR2, Quest 2, etc) Only buy pancake lenses. The sweet spot is massive (sharp vs blurry). This is enough to upgrade from the Quest 2 alone. Do your eyes and brain a favor.3. Backwards compatibility with Quest 2\/1 and other Meta headsets. Some are upgraded for the new hardware but even if Quest 2 games are not upgraded for Quest 3 they will look sharper and the frame rate will run smoother\/stable which will reduces fuzziness while turning your head. You also have the QGO (Quest Games Optimizer) that will overclock the Quest 3 to run the games at higher resolutions and frame rate a lot of the times at 140%+ on average I have found. I do not recommend QGO for casual players.4. Game\/App sharing with one other user simultaneously and online on another headset. I have 2 Quest 3s and this is a wallet\/life saver. We can play multilayer games together on separate headsets with only one purchase.5. It\u2019s mobile. It\u2019s a VR headset you can take to a friend\u2019s house and share with ease. Sharing VR is the best, especially when you have 2 headsets and are playing multiplayer together.6. Best Mixed\/Augmented Reality headset for the money and it\u2019s not even close. The only other headset is the Apple Vision at $4.5K.7. Great for long distance friendships\/relationships. It is the only way to feel like you are spending time with someone in the same room (not exclusive to Quest 3).8a. Meta\u2019s global user friendly operating system. This is helpful for new players to jump in and significantly reduces the stress of teaching a new player. (See next bullet)8b. You can stream the gameplay to your Meta App or TV for others to watch wired or wirelessly. (This helps a lot while coaching new players)9. You can play Xbox Gamepass via the cloud with an Xbox controller in the headset. (Quest 3 Only)10. Watch regular and real 3D movies, relax\/meditate, surf the web, listen to music, play Xbox, VR\/AR games, and YouTube in peace without people bothering you or you bothering people.Favorite games right now:- Dungeons of Eternity- Demeo\/Demeo Battles AR\/VR- Asgards Wrath 2 (Q3 upgrade)- Contractors Showdown- Red Matter 2 (Q3 Upgrade)- Walkabout Mini Golf- Hauntify (Q3 only\/AR Horror Game)- Multiplayer Sports Games (Any)Future Quest 3 games not on Quest 2:Batman: Arkham ShadowAlien: Rogue IncursionHitman 3: ReloadedBehemothMetro Awakening","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723248000000}
{"reviewTitle":"A billion times better than the Quest 2.","reviewDescription":"UPDATE: 10.5 Months Later (Updated on Aug 23.) (Lying Down mode works great now.)COMFORTThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.I was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.But the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for countless hours without feeling any discomfort. If a person is experiencing discomfort, it is because they didn't adjust the straps properly.TIP - ADJUSTING STRAPSWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top middle strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be on your head. And the most important adjustment are the headset arms because they determine how clear your vision will be and how comfortable the headset will be. You want to adjust the top middle strap and the interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. The back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I recommend making it loose and not at all snug, so long as the headset won't slide around your face. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's because the headset arms are not at a good angle which causes the pressure of the headset to be solely on the forehead which will go numb due to a lack of blood flow.PASSTHROUGH IS AWESOMEI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it. I thought that Meta could make the headset lighter if they didn't add extra passthrough cameras. But the Quest 3 is not at all heavy and is very comfortable. Passthrough is important to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Passthrough is important for apps like Virtual Desktop and some games use passthrough.The Quest 3 passthrough isn't crystal clear, but it is definitely good and leaps and bounds better than Quest 2's. I have no complaints whatsoever and am really happy with it. Also, I think that a software update made the passthrough a tiny bit better.LIGHT LEAKAGE ISN'T A PROBLEMThere is a small opening around the nose area. It's very small and not at all noticeable. I have spent countless hours on the Quest 3 using all sorts of apps and playing all sorts of games, and that small opening has never been noticeable to me. In fact, it has been immensely useful. I can tilt my head towards the ceiling to peek through that opening at my computer screen if I need click on something but don't want to take my headset off. Having that small opening lets me keep track of my surroundings so I don't bump into furniture or stub my toe. If people seriously think that the small opening takes away from the immersion, they can get a cheap nose cap on Amazon.SMART GUARDIANAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary which is very time consuming. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary included my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using VR and AR with no interruptions.MEMORY SPACEI bought the 128 GB version. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have bought that instead and it really bothers me that Meta did a crap move by not providing us with a 256 GB version. I didn't want to spend an extra $150 for the 512 GB version, and I still don't wish that I could go back in time and get the 512 GB version instead. Out of the 128 GB, around 22 GB is being used for System apps. But before Asgard's Wrath 2 came out, I had around 30 apps and games installed (most games only take up around 4 GB or less) and still had 51 GB available. Unfortunately Asgard's Wrath 2 takes up 36 GB of memory. But it is fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so we have a way to manage space if we run out of room.PRODUCTIVITYI like using Virtual Desktop to have multiple computer monitors, and I can use the passthrough mode on it to do things like exercise, indoor walking, and indoor biking. It's cool that I can still see the virtual screens when I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be more productive and be a happier person in general.LYING DOWN MODEQuest 2 received the Lying Down mode in version 63.0. Quest 3 received it in version 64.0. At first, Lying Down mode was unusable for me because it would always force me into Stationary Boundary and it would delete my previously drawn Roomscale Boundary. But it no longer does that, so Lying Down mode is really great now. Not only that, but before the Lying Down mode forced you to look directly at the ceiling and it would rotate the screen at an even 90 degrees. But now you can tilt the screen to any angle that you want, which is really good because my head never looks directly at the ceiling when it is resting on a pillow. I had been discouraged because I waited a really long time for Lying Down mode to be implemented and it wasn't usable for me when it finally was. So after 10 long months, I pretty much quit gaming and was only using the Quest 3 for Virtual Desktop. But now that the Lying Down mode works perfectly, I will be doing a lot more gaming now. I'm really thrilled about that.QUEST 3 - WORTH THE PURCHASE, NOT EXPENSIVE IF YOU DON'T BUY UNNECESSARY THINGSThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should experience if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and 10 months later that is still true for me. I still don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use a 20 foot extension cord.I just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.VR COVERSI could live without VR covers, but I went ahead purchased some around five months later for those rare moments when my face is extra sweaty. Two VR covers on the VR Cover website would have cost me $61.20 (after a 10% discount code and $9 shipping). On Amazon, it costs $38.46 for two VR covers (after $7 shipping and $2.50 taxes, and free returns). The VR covers are extremely well designed and fit the interface perfectly. The improvement in comfort is very minimal, but it probably does make a tiny bit of difference.BATTERY LIFEI use the Quest 3 while it is plugged into an extension cord. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a small drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I can play a very long time. Some games use a lot of battery, but I can play for a very long time and the battery will still have 20-40% left after I am exhausted. But I have never had the battery die on me before I finished my gaming session when the Quest 3 is plugged into an extension cord. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using some demanding apps and games, especially with Passthrough, the battery will probably only last 45-55 minutes. I am using the default Quest 3 18W charger and charging cable. If I were to use an Anker 30W charger, the battery would probably always stay fully charged, but it's not something that I need right now so I don't have any plans on buying one.TIP - USE EXTENSION CORD INSTEAD OF BATTERY PACKSI just use a 20 ft extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 charger and charging cable. It lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I just tuck the heavy extension cord in the front of my pants which just leaves the default Quest 3 link cable between my waist and headset. That default Quest 3 charging cable is light and its 3.3 feet length is actually a bit long, so I usually wrap it around my neck once so my controllers won't get caught and snagged on the cord.APP - VIRTUAL DESKTOP (FOR WIRELESS)Virtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Virtual Desktop Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance that I am aware of, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. I think that it is better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem\/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it worked well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.TIP - WIRELESS VS WIRED. SAVING MONEY.If you use Virtual Desktop, you won't be using a link cable. And I absolutely loathe Oculus Link (Wired and Wireless), so there hasn't been any need for me to use a link cable at all. I just use an extension cord to keep my battery charged and I use a wireless connection for virtual desktop apps like Virtual Desktop and PCVR games. An extension cord is probably better at keeping the Quest 3 charged than a link cable connected to a computer. The extension cord I bought only cost $15, but the 16 ft Quest Link cable costs $80.TIP - OCULUS LINK PROBLEMSOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, but I have only encountered one or two games that only worked with Oculus Link and they were both game that I did not care for and uninstalled.TIP - USB-C WATER\/DEBRIS ISSUEThere is a \"serious\" issue with all Quest 3 headsets known as the water debris error. \"USB-C charging port disabled... Liquid or debris has been detected...\" Most people experienced this since v62, around the time the Quest 3 headsets were first released. I was lucky to never have experienced it until 10 months later on Aug 2024. For me, it prevented me from charging my headset and probably from transferring data too. Meta sent me a replacement charging cable and that fixed the problem. My advice to you is to have some backup Anker charging cables in case you run into this problem. It only costs $10 for two Anker charging cables ($5 each). Also, I think that backup charging cables should be brand new and never been used before. If you have some cables that seem to be in good condition, they might still be worn out enough to cause the water\/debris error. That's why I recommend having NEW charging cables as backups.RECOMMENDED APP - USE VIRTUAL DESKTOP (NOT IMMERSED)I like using Virtual Desktop to access my computer screen. It's easy to grab and move the windows around, and it has Headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it works in passthrough mode.Don't use Immersed. Immersed purposely made it so that their app won't work if your PC is connected to one or more external monitors. Immersed virtual screens are extremely difficult and practically impossible to move around. Immersed's free plan only lets you have 1080p monitors at most, but Virtual Desktop lets you have 1440p if you have multiple monitors and even higher resolution if you are only using one virtual monitor. Immersed is a really buggy, flawed, and annoying mess. The only good thing about it was that it allowed you to be around other people and the Meta avatars were nice.RECOMMENDED GAMES AND APPSAfter a while, I was only using the Quest 3 for Virtual Desktop to get extra computer monitors that I can move and put anywhere in the house. And on rare occasions, I would indulge in VR adult stuff. I had played Red Matter 1 and 2 and mostly enjoyed them, but I only played them the one time because they don't have any replay value.I had some games installed that I hadn't played in a while such as The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, Propagation: Paradise Hotel, Resident Evil 4 (VR), Doom 3 (VR), Project Terminus, Arizona Sunshine, Survival Nation, and Beat Saber. But now that Lying Down Mode is working perfectly, I will be playing these games more often and other games as well.I recommend using Lighting Launcher. It's great for organizing games and it is free. You can easily create and rename groups, have certain groups be the default location for newly installed apps, adjust the tile size of apps, use custom images for apps, change the names of the apps, hide apps, and more. You will no longer need to go digging around for your Unknown Sources apps as they will appear alongside the other apps. The UI and background image of Lighting Launcher looks great.I also paid $10 for Quest Games Optimizer (QGO). It lets you increase the resolution of games (not PCVR games). It does make a huge difference and is worth getting. I use Lightning Launcher to organize my games and I use QGO to launch certain games. Increasing the resolution and CPU\/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, but I keep my headset plugged into an extension cord so it isn't a problem for me.GAMES - PCVR GAMESI have a laptop with GTX 1650 and i5-9300H. It doesn't handle PCVR games well, but it can handle some with minimal to moderate lag. But most games are unbearably laggy.COMPLAINTSThese are complaints and feedback that I have submitted to Meta countless times since October 2023, using my headset to send the reports, but all my Feedback was ignored. I'm a lazy person and not good at making videos and image demonstrations, but I will hopefully get off my behind one day and reach out to Meta more effectively to get them to fix and improve these things.There is an Accessibility feature that lets you play games sitting down. It will adjust the height to make the game or app think that you are standing up. But if you restart your headset, it will reset to standing mode even though it will show that sitting mode is still on. So after every headset restart, you will need to go Settings and then Accessibility and then toggle it off and back on to get it working again. But not only that, some apps and games don't play well with that setting because they have their own sitting down mode. That's why I asked them to add the Sitting Down\/Standing Up toggle button to the app dock tray.We can only have five pinned apps on our app dock tray, and three of them can't be unpinned. It's so frustrating. I want to be able to unpin any Meta app that I want to unpin. I never use the People app. I rarely use the Store app, but if I do I can access it through the Library app, my phone, or a computer website. It bothers me that I can only unpin two of the five Meta apps, but also I don't understand why we are only limited to five pinned apps. We should be able to pin ten if we want. Also, I never use the Horizons Feed app, and it also annoys me that the Horizons Feed (Meta Explorer app) will open up on its own from time to time, like when I restart the headset. But since I switched to the new Windows Layout, it doesn't look as bad when it does pop up.A lot of time, the apps on the app dock tray will have a big round blue circle on the top right. It's so annoying. I don't want that. I don't know what it is for, but I don't need it. I want to remove that, but there is no option to remove it.Meta told us on v67 that they released an update that lets us remove apps that we no longer want to see in the Library window. It's now PTC v69 and I have yet to see that feature anywhere. But Lighting Launcher is a billion times better than the Meta Library window, so I guess that it isn't a big deal.There are probably some other complaints and feedback that I had, but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"410 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697328000000}
{"reviewTitle":"1000% Better than the Quest 2 Headset","reviewDescription":"I was absolutely blown away by the difference between the Quest 3 and the Quest 2.  I used my Quest 2 nearly every day for at least 1 - 2 hours for four years, but it started failing.  So I looked up reviews and thought about saving a few dollars by buying a Quest 2 again, but after reading some very helpful reviews, I decided I would splurge and get the better headset.  I am sooo happy my old one died, and every happier that I bought the Quest 3.I do workouts every day on my headset, and with the Quest 2, I had to readjust the headset every few  minutes, because it would try to slide off of my head or slide down onto my nose after I had built up a sweat.  And for some exercises, I had to hold onto my headset so it would not fall off because I had to bend over to accomplish the moves.  When I did sweat, sweat would drop down onto the lenses and blur my vision, so that was horrible.The fit of the Quest 3 is absolutely amazing by comparison.  It fits onto my head, and hold fast to my head no matter what kind of movement I do, so I can do all the workouts and even Zumba routines without readjusting or hanging onto my headset.  That alone was worth the extra money.Even more surprising was the color and totally clear pass through in the Quest 3.  I sometimes had to use pass through when the phone would ring, in case I needed to answer a call, and I could kind of walk to the phone and kind of see who was calling, but not very clearly, and it was grainy and grey tones.  The first thing that happened when I powered up the Quest was see the entire room I was in in totally clear color!!  I had heard they had color pass through, but I had never read how truly clear it is.  You will feel like you don't even have the headset on, it is so clear.  Now I can walk around the house and read anything I want, like who is calling, or the time, etc.  It was a huge, and very pleasant surprise to me.I also bought the Kiwi design upgraded Comfort Controller Grips, and I am so very happy I did that.  I did not do this with the Quest 2, so I did not realize what an enormous difference they make in my comfort and ability to not throw the controllers across the room.One other item I bought was the Kiwi design Comfort Head Strap.  I got that mostly because the Quest 2's battery started failing after one year, so I had to buy a head strap and battery set up for that one, so I figured I might as well buy it right off the bat and not worry about the battery.Altogether, the Quest 3 is an amazing and truly \"worth it\" headset.  I highly recommend trying it out, and you too will be blown away.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1724025600000}
{"reviewTitle":"I've had 'em all  -  This is BIG WIN!","reviewDescription":"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive,  Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion.  I went back and played some older games,  finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge  Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away.  There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.The Mixed Reality \/ PassthroughAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture!  You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.How about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.The beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So,  now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set.  One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room  becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!Of course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which,  I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this?  I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart.  Now it's, \"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.The comfortWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.Battery life ...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.PCVRLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!Overall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"524 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697328000000}
{"reviewTitle":"For me good enough to work full time through VR desktop (long review) - UPDATE 2 months later","reviewDescription":"UPDATE after more than 2 months of use: I am still super happy with this headset and I'm still using it daily as my \"work rig\". The only thing to add is, absolutely do find a better strap that lets you balance it on your head slightly loose, rather than strapping it tightly to your face, unless you're doing some vigorous gaming. As far as games, I can only play certain ones that are somewhat static, like Table Tennis  because I'm too sensitive to motion, but for productivity work, I have no issues with keeping it on for 10+ hours daily. For me this is not a toy, but an amazing tool. One additional note, I have now upped my default virtual monitor count to 4 (got a Black Friday subscription deal for Immersed to allow more than 3 monitors). I also ended up buying the extended warranty for the Quest as well, for peace of mind.Some small beefs with the Immersed app: it takes too long from launching it until it actually starts and connects with your laptop, but once it's on, it's fine. It would be nice to have an option to just start it in mixed reality mode right off the bat, it's my usual way of working. Other than that, all good.Original Review below ---------------------------------------------------I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop  to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.  I was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.First, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely.  I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).  The first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face. How about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself  to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.  Some things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset in the Immersed app, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.  The passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.  My big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.  One last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"164 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698710400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good Standalone VR Headset. Unusable PC VR Headset","reviewDescription":"for a TL:DR, I would say if you are looking for a PURE standalone VR headset and do not plan on ever using your PC on wired mode, then I'd say you'd find value in purchasing this product, but if you want to use the Quest as a standalone AND wired\/wireless PC VR and using it for serious tasks or gaming, stay away, buy a dedicated PC-VR headset or give up on using this headset as a PC-VR headset.I have had the Quest 3 since early May, and coming from the Quest 2 it is a good upgrade, I have not used the passthrough features that the Quest 3 offers that the quest 2 does not even have, but as more of a gamer I have had little need to use those features. The best way I can describe the Quest 3 to the Quest 2 is more akin to going from the Xbox One to the Series X, PS4 to PS5, unlike going from something like the Wii U to the Switch, where the upgrade is purely a Hardware with some software upgrades rather than a complete overhaul, which I do say is nice, considering you can just take your Quest 2 library and just jump into the games again after you download them on your Quest 3.The Quest games itself have gotten a slight upgrade, taking better advantage of the hardware, and providing a more clear and crisp image, with some performance upgrades in some games. I find that games that show long distances look a lot more crisp and clear, making for an overall much better immersion in games, the design itself looks more appealing with the 3 beans in front and the slimmer design, the controllers bundled in are just the Quest Pro controllers missing the cameras for self tracking, I already have Pro controllers so I cannot say for how good the Quest 3 controllers are, but they felt nice enough when I opened it. However, changing the lenses' positions felt confusing and never felt like they remain secure, though this is in my experience, as I also wear glasses.However, if you plan on buying this, also buy a different strap, the one bundled in is truly atrocious, Don't buy the elite strap from Meta, too overpriced and they made the one bundled in bad on purpose so you buy their overpriced 'Elite' strap, look into 3rd party ones, they are much cheaper than the 1st party offerings.Overall I'd give the Quest 3 an 8\/10 when it comes to it being played and used as a wire free VR headsetWhat really drags this down is in the Quest Link, which is so bad I would rate it a -10\/10.Why?Because it never works after a few tries...For context , my PC is more than capable of playing most if not all VR games at mid-high settings with a constant 30-60 fps, minus some instances where a lot of resources were being pulled by any game. though those were rare.And to be clear, this is not the fault of any hardware from the Quest 3 nor my PC, this is from just how unfathomably atrocious the Quest Link software is, and this is not new, you look these problems up, I can go back as 2021, so not only does Meta know about this, they have been actively refusing to fix this issue, their only response is \"Update your quest software\", other solutions seem to work, but require you doing a Fresh Install of Windows, or doing other steps with the Link software, and before you ask, I have deleted my Link software and downloaded a new app of it, I have done the PTC, none of these options have worked, and I am NOT going to be doing a fresh install of Windows because Meta can't patch something like this, and if this was a Hardware issue, It would have surfaced from day 1, but this happened very much after I started using the Quest for my PC.And for those saying I am being lazy: I am the Customer, I bought the product,  End. Of. Story.  It is not, nor should it ever be, my responsibility, as a consumer, to have to become Linus Tech Tips, Gamers Nexus, and Nicola Tesla's child and fix an issue Meta is VERY much aware of, and has had at the bare minimum, 3 years to fix said issue, yet has not. The very fact that you have to look to others to fix a persistent issue that has followed the Quest since the Quest 2 days is an issue in it of itself, if this was a new development, I would absolutely not hold it against the devs that are maintaining the Quest Link software, but it isn't, I have already looked up everywhere on Meta Forums, and they have all said the same thing.Will the Quest Link work? For the first few times, but then once it stops, good luck, or you might be lucky and not have any problems with it. Some might ask if I am using a Quest Link Cable? Yes I am, and using the right ports, am I using the Meta one? No... I am not paying 80 Dollars for an overpriced USB-C Cable, seriously, The Quest Link Cable is so overpriced that it should be a crime to purchase it, besides, there are posts where people are experiencing the same problem with much better hardware than me, and even using the Quest Link Cable itself, I am using a USB 3.0 Cable to a USB-C Cable, a 3.0 Cable is compatible with the Quest Link software.and the Quest Link using Wireless never works either, do not even bother using it, you will not be able to connect to your PC, even if it see's it, and the lag itself is not worth it, I am playing in the same room with the PC, there is nothing interfering with the connection like a wall would, and I am still experiencing lag and immersion breaking issues, and my PC is connected with an Ethernet port, so my internet is no issue either.Overall, the Quest 3 is a nice standalone product, even a good upgrade from the Quest 2 IF you really want those nicer graphics, but if you are buying it purely to use it or using it heavily for the PC, save your money and purchase something else, it might be cheaper to buy this or the quest 2 compared to something like the Steam VR, but you will be in a world of hurt dealing with these issues, and if you have a quest 2 and are happy enough with it, I would say stick with the Quest 2, coming from it myself, it is more of a step up rather than a true upgrade, think of it like a Nintendo 3DS to a New Nintendo 3DS.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1724112000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Tracking not as good as Quest 2 for Beat Saber E+","reviewDescription":"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).Preface:  So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.  The Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.I was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!  I also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrrSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS,  so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol*  Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank!  My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.Yes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better.  I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers!  My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!However, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.I haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.  The controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.  The Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.The Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day.  Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24\/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when\/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!)  So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!  I'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.That's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.In closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!PS: 2 1\/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins  ,  & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will!

{"reviewTitle":"Don't buy unless ok with being a public beta tester","reviewDescription":"Basically the entire concept of VR with the general public is hit or miss, they haven't nailed down away to make it affordable and easy to get into for the average person and I don't see most people spending $500 on something like this; it's not a high end game console by any means and that's what that kind of money really is getting at, something high-end. It's a fun novelty as of right now, You're better off buying the Quest 2 or wait until the Quest 3S comes out sometime in the next year or two, Don't drop $500 on this like I did. The feature set is still very limited, and a lot of games don't take advantage of the fact THEY ARE IN VR and are still figuring out how mechanics should work in the setting that they're in. Once companies figure out a way to make this an easy and accessible medium for people to get into whether it's creating games for or hopping into a game with friends, then I'd say this would be worth every penny; but as of right now I'm the only one in my entire friend group that even considers VR interesting; much less, usable. They either have motion sickness issues which the VR industry has yet to figure out a way around that; or they just don't have the money or drive to get into something that they deem \"not worth it\" due to the lack of support by most actual game developers whether Inde or otherwise. One day this medium will be something special and amazing, but that is not today. The technology is still in its infancy, here's to hoping that something amazing can come of this and that Mark Zuckerberg didn't end up trying to make this all a reality far too soon before it was possible; because if he did; The medium might be damned to an eternity of obscurity and an intense lack of support.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1722556800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Impressive toy.  Not quite there yet as a tool.","reviewDescription":"I am a semi-retired systems engineer and this is my first VR headset.  Until the MQ3, I didn't feel the technology was far enough along to be anything more than a expensive \"toy\" and social platform - neither of which I have much use for - I would much rather play real golf with my real friends.But with the advent of mixed reality and better display resolutions, I felt it was time to see if the technology was ready to do serious work.  And I think it is.  For some things.Example: \"Nanome\" (see nanome.ai) is a fascinating 3D collaboration space for students and scientists to model molecular structures.  Very nifty but not my field.Mixed reality (XR) is fascinating but the \"real\" pass-through is still too grainy to allow detailed work from within the XR.  And they don't appear to have any use for it yet other than games (First Encounters is very cute, admittedly.  Tribble-like \"space puffins\" start bashing holes in your rooms walls and come pouring in).  Still, I think XR has real potential.  Maybe in 4 years....But what I hoped for was a virtual desktop for my workstation.  I have 4 BIG monitors and it is still not enough surface area.  I have been eying VR to provide me with a 360 degree desktop since the Rift.  And there is a Virtual Desktop app available but it does not support Linux - again, not quite yet ready for the professionals.  Again, maybe in 4 years.I am finding uses for the MQ3.  There are fitness and wellness apps that I like: Tripp, Holofit, and my favorite Supernatural.  What a workout!But I am not sure the Quest 3s hardware is up to rigorous use - I just had to return my first MQ3 after only 3 weeks (it started rebooting itself repetitively every 20 seconds yesterday).  I got a second because I love my morning workout.  I am just afraid that sweating on the headset killed it.I need my tools to be as reliable as a hammer.  Well, maybe that is not fair.  OK.  At least as reliable as my phone which has much the same technologies as the MQ3 and I can drop in a bucket of sweat and still expect it to work.I hope to have better luck with my second MQ3 (it is from a more recent manufacturing batch - maybe they fixed some stuff).  I will update this review either way.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716681600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Absolutely amazing, but...","reviewDescription":"We love the Quest 3. Love it! Just two 54 year olds that love everything from virtually visiting most places people have ever been, to whacking around an invisible racket, putting an imaginary golf club, hacking up zombies, and most especially sweating it out while punching imaginary dots and slicing fictional bricks (I have never enjoyed exercise this much). So why 3 stars? In four months I have spent more time dealing with tech support for this one product than anything else I can think of in decades (the occasional health insurance nightmare comes close, but still the award goes to Meta). It\u2019s not one thing, always something different. Sometimes it\u2019s an app double billing or a sale not going through, or a profile and app sharing issue, or an app crashing constantly, once trying to buy my dad an app for his Quest on his birthday (Meta eventually gave up trying to fix it and just gave us a refund). Most recently, and the worse so far, our headset broke. One day the image inside just started floating around in weird ways. Meta honored the warranty, but it took almost 4 weeks before we were back online (an eternity!). After they received the broken one back and processed it we waited the \u201c5-7 business days\u201d for them to mail us a new one. When the 8th day came and nothing had happened I reached out and was told they would look into it and someone would get back to me in 3-5 business days, not with a solution necessarily, but just a status. From our experiences and having read many online support forum posts over the months it is hard not to conclude that Meta really could care less about the ownership experience. Large segments of their VR world are completely half baked. There are some amazing apps, but there are also many more apps that haven\u2019t been touched by their developers in 3-5 years. Meta will change the UI and various features as they see fit every now and then and there will be no notification or release notes anywhere. It is the wild west. So if you are not already addicted like us you may seriously want to reconsider hitting that Buy button. I might suggest knitting. For years I used to knit a lot and I don\u2019t think once did I have to contact tech support.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708128000000}

It is an overall dramatic improvement compared to the Quest 2. I can list a few:Better Load timesImproved UIMore intuitive controller designGreat catalog of gamesMore functionality (pass-through in color is amazing!)HOWEVER, I have knocked two stars off of this product for two huge reasons. I have found out that many Oculus headsets, including the one that I own are riddled with dead pixels. I have a nasty one that is right in the middle of the left lens, causing a huge distraction and immersion breaking during gameplay.Hold on it gets worse.Meta does have a program that allows for an easy replacement for defective models. They call it the \"Advanced Replacement\" program. An option to keep your headset as a replacement model is sent to you. Simple, right? Very consumer focused, sure. Except, the problem is THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK.I have been in discussion with meta support and agents for the past month, and have not gotten any word back on the status of my replacement for my Quest 3. I have been passed around from specialist to specialist with seemingly no solution in mind. There is no way that going through this method is faster than alternative methods to get a fix for your device.Look up anything surrounding dead pixels and Advanced Replacement issues, and you will find post after post on how badly Meta has screwed their roll out and support system. It is embarrassing. This multi-billion dollar company can not provide quality hardware, or quality support for said hardware. And from the word of a few testimonials, expect a refurbished device in return for your defective hardware, some with even worse issues than your own.This is not acceptable, and I knew I had to use this review to give a warning before others decide to purchase.

The headset ends up resting on the bridge of my nose because the strap doesn't lock your head it properly. Once you start moving around so does the quest.

Let me list them:- Carrying case ( it comes in a cute box, why not add in the case as well? why not ship it in the case instead?) it costs 70 usd currently.....- Charging dock ( understandable but it costs 130 dollars...... wireless chargers go for 15 dollars) the quest is also a clunky piece of equipment. It should come with a stand or something similar. Not surprisingly, the dock is perfect for this issue..... like... you see what I'm saying? My point?- Active straps 40 usd ( again, why not ship with the device? its perfect for it so why not include it you're supposed to be active so it would make sense to include it, no?)- Active facepiece- silicone- 40 usd ( again, why not include it? its not that expensive and you're supposed to be active right? )- The one that's the worst. The one that I think Meta should be sued for. A class action lawsuit at least. The \"Elite Strap\" that sells for a whopping 70 usd 130 with an extra battery included on the strap. How is it elite? It's what's supposed to come with the device, that's how. I'm not even joking. Anyone can attest to the fact that the head strap that comes with any meta headset is injury inducing. It feels terrible and uncomfortable. By design? Yes. It was the same for quest 2. It couldn't have been a mistake. The cheapest Quest 3 is already 500 plus taxes so 540 for most people. 540 for what, exactly? A device that's lacking. Meta knows this and sells \"bundles\" with the correct attachments. Its a joke. The product is nice, cool but this issue needs to be addressed.The software is ok. Besides the accessory issue, it runs somewhat expected. A billion dollar company and its software still lacks.- The native meta link ( cable and air) pale in comparison to the 3rd party apps sold on the store. Of course, you have to pay more to fix issues that come with the quest. Such a joke. In order to connect your pc and quest, you can the buggy, terrible native software or use exceptional but still lacking 3rd party software. Nice.Overall, I've enjoyed using it. Sometimes I feel like a sailor looking through a scope, but still, its cool. I'd only recommend, if you feel like supporting this type of, \"pay for part, buy the rest later\" type of mentality companies have. Like a game without the much, much needed dlc. If you want to be a pay pig, if you want to pay 2-3 hundred more for the needed accessories, then buy it, if not, then do not. Buy the quest 2 for 500 and get everything you'd need instead of this dare I say, cash grab?

{"reviewTitle":"Had high-hopes, but had to return to sender","reviewDescription":"I play Eleven Table Tennis competitively, but my 2 year old Quest 2 was slowly circling the drain.  I read all the specs of the Q3 and ordered one, excited about the boost in graphics power.The good:* The GPU in the Q3 is pretty awesome, I could push the Eleven Table Tennis (ETT) graphics almost to the max and it stayed pretty much rock-solid at 120FPS.* Although not really my cup of tea, Mixed Reality is really cool, and if my focus wasn't ETT, then I would have likely used it more.* It's light, noticeably so compared to the Q2* The picture is bright, and the lenses are a big improvement over the Q2.  IMHO, based on the numbers, the FOV is a little better than the Q2, however it feels MUCH wider to me.The not so good:* The facial interface is way less comfortable to me as compared to the Q2.* The battery drains a lot more quickly as compared to the Q2, but that's probably a trade-off for the enhanced graphics.  Compromise is a thing.The BAD:* If you are a competitive table tennis player, then you probably want to use an adapter to make the simulator feel more like real life.  Meta, in their infinite wisdom, decided to do away with the rings found on the Q2 controllers.  This causes the IR LEDs to face away from the headset, and it loses tracking.Tracking loss is a BAD thing for ETT, it causes you to miss-hit the ball, whiff completely, or you may even watch as your paddle floats away from your body.  That's cute and all, but not so good if you're playing a competitive sport.  Just sayin'...  :)My guess is that Meta got cute and tried to use some sort of advanced AI algorithm and hand tracking to predict where the controllers are when it loses tracking.This DOES NOT WORK for apps like ETT that require your arms to move fast, and where millimeters count.I'm also guessing that no amount of software gymnastics can fix this issue because the Q3 controllers have an inherent flaw.  If they ever make the Q3 backwards compatible to Q2 controllers, that may fix the problem, but I'm only guessing.So back the Q3 went to Amazon.  I will likely explore the Pico 5 when available (assuming Meta remains stubborn, and won't have an effective hardware fix).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"34 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699574400000}

I re-launched the game and I could hear the game but I couldn't see the game. I took the headset off and if I held it about an inch away from my head I could see the game. Can't really play VR like this. I shut it down and tried again with the same game and a different game and same issue. I then did a manufacture reset on it, went through the setup again. This time I was able to play 1 game for a very short time before the battery died. I charged the battery, tried again and was able to only play for a little over an hr and a half before the battery died again. Charged the unit overnight, tried it the next day and the original issue came back with the app crashing then not being able to see the game unless I took the headset off my head. I contacted Meta's support via chat and what a joke. First they are extremely slow at responding. I went through the issues and they wanted to troubleshoot the battery issue first. I asked why do that when the battery is irrelevant if the unit can't be played on. I told the rep I felt like I received a bad unit, it happens. she insisted on troubleshooting the battery first so I said sure whatever. After troubleshooting the battery she decided the unit needed to be replaced \"this is over an hr and a half later\". She says that I qualified for their advanced return so I could receive the new until and I would have 45 days to return the old unit. I thought that was great as I was intending on just getting a replacement versus a full refund. She came back a few minutes later telling me they couldn't offer the advanced return as it was having problems. They wanted a normal return which would be I send the bad unit back, wait for them to receive it, then they would send me a new unit. I decided to decline thinking I could just return via Amazon and just order a new one and to my surprise, I could only return it via UPS and for the free option, I had to print my own label and drop it off myself. That wouldn't work as I don't own a printer. The other option is to pay $7.00 for UPS to pick it up and provide a label.

{"reviewTitle":"Black\/Blank Screen","reviewDescription":"**UPDATE**It took FOREVER for my refund to get processed so I ended up purchasing one from Best Buy. Everything seemed great until I was greeted again by the blank screen.I did some research online since a few weeks had passed and online forums were starting to catch up to the newly released Quest 3. One person mentioned that the proximity sensor had issues detecting when the headset was on your head. So while I had the headset on my head, I stuck my finger up from the bottom to where the sensor was located in between both eyebrows and surprisingly, the screen came on and everything worked fine. Playing with a finger up my headset was not ideal so I am seriously considering returning the Quest 3.I tend to play a lot of action\/exercise apps so I usually play with a black skull cap on my head to reduce the amount of sweat that I get on the headset. It seems like the proximity sensor doesn't like either the color or the material as the screen constantly cuts in and out if I adjust my headset even the slightest bit. Playing without a skull cap, I was able to adjust the headset as much as I wanted and the screen stayed on. The Quest 2 did not have this problem.I also had a minor issue charging the Quest 3 and official elite head strap with extended battery. Normally you can leave the extended battery plugged into the headset and plug the charging cable into the extended battery in order to charge both.I happened to play until the extended battery and headset completely lost battery and shutdown on its own so I left it to charge overnight. The led indicating it was charging came on but the next day, both the headset and extended battery were still at 0% and the headset only showed a low battery symbol.I ended up unplugging the elite strap extended battery from the headset and charged them separately. Both are now operating normally and can be charged using just the extended battery charge port.Lots of weird issues which the Quest 2 did not have and the Meta website was absolutely no help whatsoever. It costs double the price of the Quest 2 and so far there aren't many apps that can use the mixed reality feature so my review still stands at 1 star.It is working for now and I will update if anything elses comes up..**ORIGINAL REVIEW**Setup was a breeze, all my apps downloaded with no issues and I had a blast for about an hour before being prompted to charge the headset.One hour is all it took to go from 100% down to 2% which was my first disappointment. Maybe the setup and downloading of all the apps is what caused the battery to drain so quickly? Maybe the mixed reality using all the cameras drained the batteries?I will never know because after fully charging the headset and powering it on, I was greeted by the Meta logo followed by a black screen. Controllers would not connect and the Meta Quest app would not connect to the headset.I tried a factory reset by holding the volume down and power button but was again greeted with the Meta logo followed by a black screen. I tried the factory reset a second time to see if it would help but had the same results.While I was chatting with Amazon Customer Service, the headset eventually booted up with the setup process but now when I adjust the IPD dial, the screen cuts in and out.I LOVED the Meta Quest 2 and I do love this Meta Quest 3 but it seems like they have some kinks to work out. There was no option to exchange the item since apparently it was shipped by Amazon but sold by Meta so I have to return the item before purchasing a new one.I will update once I get a working headset..","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"57 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697068800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Meta took my return but won't ship replacement","reviewDescription":"First, if you wear eyeglasses, don't get a Quest 3 or at least get prescription lenses ($50 from Zenni and others) and use those instead of your glasses. Glasses are likely to scratch the built in lenses, and the design does not allow them to be replaced. Once they are damaged, the whole device is ruined. Meta should have made the lenses replaceable or at least included lens protectors of some sort. Very bad design.I had an issue and needed to RMA my Quest 3. It was quite difficult to get them to accept that the issue (damage caused by eyeglasses due to poor design) should be covered. But they finally said \"since you didn't intentionally damage the unit, we will accept a return\". Apparently they had previously thought I damaged it intentionally. Yeah, right.So I shipped the unit back to them, being careful to follow the return instructions exactly.On Dec 28 I got an email saying they had received the unit and accepted it.It is now 3 weeks later and they still haven't shipped the replacement. When I ask about the current status, they say \"we are working on it\".Checking in the forums, I see that this is pretty common. I posted on the official Quest 3 forum about this, but my post was deleted (big surprise). I have seen other posts there about slow turn around on returns, but they seem to be gone too. Meta doesn't want anyone to know about their horrible RMA process.The real issue is probably that they are experiencing many times more returns than they anticipated and don't have replacement units available. And of course they prioritize new sales over replacements since they've already been paid for the replacement units, whereas new sales are additional money.The Meta support system is also a train wreck. The individual people I chatted with were all pleasant and professional, but every time you talk to them via chat or email you get a response from a different person. Each person's job is to put you off so the next person can deal with you. Once they respond to you they will probably never deal with you again, so they are incentivized to tell you \"working on it\" and let the next person deal with it (or even better, maybe you'll stop bothering them).I will never buy anything from this company again, and at this point I'm trying to get Meta to give me a refund instead of replacement. I have spend around $200 on software and accessories for Quest 3 (I'm glad I didn't buy more games right away), and they are unlikely to refund that. But at least I may get the $650 I spent on the Quest 3 itself, which can go towards a different brand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701302400000}

Give this a few more years and it might be consumer-ready. Some notable areas that are not ready for consumers: hand tracking, hand gestures, UI responsiveness, system UI design, weight \/ weight distribution, comfort, fit \/ light blocking, store app, UI responsiveness, small number of decent apps in the app store (especially mixed reality, of where there are nearly none worth bothering with), real world visuals (grainy, distorted, poor dynamic range), real world occlusion of virtual objects, rendering power (all apps look pretty lousy), notification intrusiveness, and lack of synchronization with another Quest in the room.All things considered, this device is not worth the price unless you're a real fan of the technology or are developing for it. These are early days. This stuff is promising but it's still years away (maybe 5 - 15 years) from being ready for mainstream use.UPDATE: even worse in low lighting situations. It seems that the device was not properly designed or tested. Incredibly annoying, to the point where I had to stop because I was so aggravated. To be fair, this is partially because the apps on the platform are so broken (though I suppose they may seem broken because the platform is broken). Right now there are only a few apps I've found that really have held my attention for more even a little while. (I tried to get into Asgard's Wrath 2 but it's pretty bad, I eventually gave up out of boredom and annoyance with its poor game mechanics. After Assassin's Creed VR, which has its own serious issues but was pretty fun, Asgard's Wrath 2 feels like a big corporation's take on an indie game - intended to be pretty and charming but ultimately uninspired, unoriginal, clunky, unrefined, and without the TLC you'd expect in an indie game.)Anyway, still waiting for Meta to get on the ball.

It's a mixed bag of cons and pro. the biggest con is the discomfort levels, I couldn't wear this thing for longer than 15-20 minutes. I constantly was aware of myself wearing it. the strap and the headset warmed up my face too quickly and i could constantly feel the straps around my head. in VR mode, i could see light coming down from my nose and i could see the floor while wearing it. even in complete darkness, i could still see part of the floor. i tried adjusting to close the gap but cant block the light. another big con is the battery life being only 1.5-2 hours long, depending the app you're using and your settings.They're trying to sell this as a mixed reality device but really there's very little apps that show the potential of that idea. the demo game First Encounters is a neat little game that does show that idea off but after you're done with that.. there's very little to do with mixed reality.the color pass through mode is grainy, distorted, blurry and not ideal for serious use situations. but for some reason, all the quest menus and text are sharp and clear. you can see good enough to see the room around you, BUT everything on my computer monitor or phone screen still looked too blurry for real use.i would say, i'm probably in the minority in feeling all of this.

{"reviewTitle":"Overhyped product","reviewDescription":"Pros:- The lenses are excellent. Indeed, the pancake lens is the standout feature of the Quest 3. It has a large sweet spot and no issues with aberration or other lens-related problems.Cons:- Resolution: It's quite close to the Reverb G2. I wasn't expecting a \"screen door\" effect, but it's noticeable.- Heat Generation: It produces a significant amount of heat.- Battery: I couldn't even play for 2 hours straight. For my gaming sessions, an external battery pack is necessary.- Facial Interface: It feels cheap, is too narrow, and the pressure is not evenly distributed. Most of the pressure is concentrated at the top, which isn't ideal given the weight of the headset.- Straps: They seem cheap and are barely usable. In my opinion, an aftermarket strap is essential, which increases the overall cost.- Pass-Through: It's somewhat usable, but it's far from a high-quality \"mixed-reality\" experience.- PC VR Gaming: Videos have to be compressed, which consumes GPU and CPU resources. Often, this compression degrades the image quality.- FOV - it's a bit better comparing to quest 2, but it's very minor improvement. Probably it's even good for this price range.Overall: Compared to the Quest 2, it's a step forward, but the only significant improvement is the lenses. Other upgrades are minor. Considering the price tag \u2013 which is $500 for 128GB, and given the need for an extra battery, better head straps, and a superior facial interface, which can raise the price to around $700 \u2013 the value for money isn't impressive.

I have turned every single light on in every room I've used it, including the overhead ceiling light thats so bright it hurts and I avoid using it in daily life. Still, everything is blurry, grainy, and forget trying to read literally anything with this on your head. My eyes are struggling so hard to see that I end up with a massive headache after about 20 minutes, and yes I've tried adjusting every possible setting available, including the IPD wheel that makes absolutely no difference whatsoever. Extremely dissapointing with such a hefty price tag (I opted for the 512 version as I expected to be playing this so much more...after tax almost 700$) the menu screen is the only clear and readable thing but open youtube or netflix? Forget it. Strap is also very uncomfortable and refuses to keep the headset from falling down my face, spent an insane amount of time adjusting it still to no avail but haven't given up on it yet.

Passthrough is slightly better with color. It\u2019s more comfortable with a much better lens, the pancake lenses have made the biggest and best impact for me. Controllers feel slightly better. The 4K quality is a game changer for movies and games. Load times are better.Cons: the left controller when sprinting in a game will continuously stop. Others tell me they have the same problem. The battery life drains decently faster. Sometimes In all games the screen will freeze up making me have to press the power button on and off to fix it. I noticed games run better but at times it can feel worse than the quest 2, it\u2019s kind of random. The passthrough quality is far worse than what they showed us in the trailers, it feels like we got lied to for that part. The strap it comes with gets uncomfortable for long play sessions and the controller trigger came with an annoying springy sound to it.So far it seems worth the purchase if it was at a lower price unless for the most part my problems are defects for my particular headset.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699488000000}

It feels solid and well-made, which gives me confidence that it\u2019s going to hold up over time. The design is sleek and comfortable for extended use (with the right accessories).Performance: The performance is top-notch. Everything runs smoothly, from games to apps, with no noticeable lag or hiccups. It\u2019s powerful enough to handle everything I\u2019ve thrown at it so far. And when paired with powerful PC, gaming in VR on the PC is one of the best gaming experiences.App and Game Selection: The app and game selection is impressive. There\u2019s a wide variety to choose from, and it keeps getting better with new releases. Whether you\u2019re into gaming, fitness, or just exploring virtual environments, there\u2019s something for everyone. Some of the games are pricey though.Screen Quality: The screen quality is okay\u2014not amazing, but not bad either. It gets the job done, but it\u2019s not a standout feature. I was hoping for a bit more clarity, especially given the price point.Light Leak: One downside I\u2019ve noticed is the light leak around the edges. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but it can be distracting, especially in darker scenes. It takes away from the overall immersion, which is a bit disappointing.Battery Capacity: The battery life is another area that could use improvement. It\u2019s on the smaller side, so I find myself needing to charge it more often than I\u2019d like. If you\u2019re planning on long sessions, you might need to keep a charger nearby.Overall, the Meta Quest 3 is a solid VR headset with great performance and a lot to offer, but it\u2019s not without its flaws.

The hardware in this in any other system would easily have been closer to $1,000 otherwise. That said aside from the actual headset and controllers itself Meta skimps in every other aspect. Assume you will need to spend a minimum $100+ for accessories to actually make prolonged use of the headset comfortable and enjoyable.Day 1 replacement should be the facial interface. The facial interface is so bad whoever made the decision to keep it should be fired. Its bad enough that if this is your first exposure to VR and don't know much about it you're going to think its miserable having this thing strapped to your head. As of this review Jan 2024 the best interface you can get is from AMVR. Its about $30 and its a  night and day different. Not only does it improve your field of view but it also allows more air circulation for reducing fogging. The main improvement though is comfort. Going from a deep pain in my face to not noticing anything was a huge quality of life. Oblik offers a customized 3d printed facial interface but it requires an iphone for scanning your face and costs around $80. I have not tried this yet but it looks interesting.Day 2 should be the headstrap. I don't understand why Meta doesn't provide competitive quality accesories for their systems. Look at Destek, Bingbok, Bobo VR. All three have excellent head straps that again like the facial interface greatly improve comfort and potentially offer other features like much high capacity batteries with passthrough and hot swapping.Day 3 get some controller straps. Included are strings that will at least keep you from throwing the controllers but otherwise you will have them hanging from your wrists or you will be gripping the controllers non-stop. I like AMVR's strap with battery compartment but other options that allow you to rest your hands will still be a big step up.The Quest Link Cable for tethered PCVR and charging is $80. The problem is it maxes out at 3A \/ 5V charging which will not keep the Quest 3 charged if you have Wifi on, let alone Wifi, bluetooth, and running an on headset game. With all those off and doing PCVR 3A is enough to keep it powered for a very long time. Ideally for $80 the Quest Link should at least include Power Deliver PD charging for 30 Watt+ charging speeds that would keep the Quest charged.I'm using a Cable Creations 16.5 10 Gbps cable. It doesn't matter how fast your cable is the Oculus software seems to rarely recognize it being over 2.5 Gbps anyways. Anything over 1 Gbps is sufficient. This cable is $55 and is nearly identical to the Quest Link and is a good alternative. There are some other manufacturers claiming 20 Gbps 100 Watt 16 foot cables but be skeptical. Keep in mind most PC USB ports max out at 900 mA unless they note otherwise. I added a Startech 20 Gbps expansion card with 3A charging that keeps my headset alive for many hours as long as WiFi is off. Battery burns about 50% faster if Wifi is on. Sinefine also has an expansion card with 10 Gbps 45 Watt ports that should keep the Quest charged even with Wifi on as long as your cable truly supports PD.The Quest 3 has decent video pass-through allowing for really interesting Mixed Reality \/ Augmented Reality applications. As it also includes depth sensors this doesn't mean it just superimposes graphics over a grainy video of your living room. The software actually understands where walls and objects are. There is a small alien invasion game where aliens start knocking out your walls and ceiling invading your room. I've had these tiny ball like aliens pop around and hide behind desks and chairs. And when I peek around the objects they're actually there, when I look away and come back they persist. This isn't the cheap AR that was in mobile games and handhelds many years back that for the most part just ignored what was actually in the environment.PCVR is where the really compelling content for VR is. Mobile graphics power has came a long way and there are some bigger mobile VR games like Asgards Wrath 2 and Assassins Creed Nexus now but the reality is for the most part on-headset content looks like games from 10 - 15 years ago or more. However, on PCVR there is content that in the Quest 3 is sometimes nearly indistinguishable from real life. Usually just some object or in smaller closed environments. But its where the really interesting stuff is.Unfortunately Meta seems to hate PCVR. Developers apparently don't have the USB access needed to allow PCVR directly. That's why apps like Virtual Desktop must be streamed via Wifi. Accessing Steam Games goes like this - Turn on Quest 3 -> Enable Quest Link -> Empty barren environment -> either go to desktop and launch game or go to SteamVR Home and then launch game from library.A bit cumbersome and often games won't launch, won't launch in VR, or have poor controls without an easy way to rebind. Often games, even big ones like Pistol Whip have no native recenter function. In which case you have to bring up the SteamVR overlay to use its recenter function. If you launched the game directly from desktop though sometimes this isn't available and you basically just have to exit the game, launch SteamVR, then the game then recenter. It's very unfortunate but a lot of PCVR content is like this - very compelling if it works but can be frustrating and tedious.I think we're still about 7 - 10 years away with hardware + software that really makes VR truly mainstream. The release of the UEVR mod that allows turning newer flat Unreal Engine games into VR games is a huge step towards that. But even with a 4090 many newer Unreal games still require turning many settings down to get smooth gameplay in VR.TLDR - Unless you have cash to burn the Quest 3 is probably the best single package VR system available as of Jan 2024 but expect to spend another $100 in accessories to make it an enjoyable, comfortable experience. The most seamless experiences tend to be Quest Native applications, however, the most compelling and graphically realistic experiences are on PCVR. Though the ease of use of these can be inconsistent.If you expect to wait for something better keep in mind the price difference between the Quest 2 and Quest Pro was over $1,000 so if a Quest Pro 2 comes out it could very well be the same. Valve has still not officially announced the Deckard but even if they do it tomorrow it likely wouldn't be available for at least a month, probably sell out very quickly, and almost certainly be priced at $1,000 or more. Apple Vision Pro is already expected to be priced at $3,500 and its specs are still unknown, probably won't be available till later in 2024, and it's unknown if it will be compatible with PCVR or they will completely restrict users to the Apple walled garden.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"22 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704672000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Over good, Better with a  few simple additions","reviewDescription":"The  bottom line is I recomend it. I have  compared it  too all preceeding  models  and  can contrast it  with  a few  none Meta  options  as  well such  as the  Index,  Pimax,  and Window MR kits. If you  have decided  your  ok  with Metas privacy Issues you are getting  a nice  device. Its  greatest  weakness is  its Very  power  hungry and  as  I  write this there are few  options for power  blocks  and piggy back power packs  that  will keep  up. You need allot  of  wattage (30W ish i'd  recomend too be safe) like the stock power  block  puts  out, other  wise you  will lose  charge slowly.  Just  as  Quest 2  did.  Only  Quest  1 would  run all night  off  anything.  It was also a  bit  dissapointing  too find out that  it  doeas  not offer face  or  eye tracking, If  you desire that  you  may  need too  opt  for the  Pro at great  expense  and the cost  of  some  visual  quality. Quest 3 has exellent  Fidelity with its Pancake  lenses  and  high res panels, they combine too put Q3 on par  with  the  Pimax 8k x  and far beyond Index or other Quests. Its Tracking is  Only so so however, the removal of  upwards camers  effects  it  when  placing hands  above  or behind ones  person.  on the plus side  hand tracking  is  very accurate and  we  can  expect  it  too improve  with  updates.. Its  Room  scanning abitlity  is  very  usefull  the  new AR focuse of this  device  sets  it  apart  from  previous  VR only  devices.  Now games  can exist  in Real  space  and so  can  other participants. I see this  as the  future  of  VR so it has relivancy that may  last longer then other HMD's and  effect  more  titles  as Developers get  more accustomed too creating AR  content  for  it.  I found  the  audio  too be  noticably  improoved  over  Quest 2\/1  although i  could  not  get a  good  test  with  the  Pro. I am  reminded of  Index  when I listen too  it  though it  does not  have the  Base  or  power of the  Index  speakers.  Still ,very  impressive  for  something so  small and  direction.  I find no need  for headphones  or  ear buds. As I mentiond its  got  great  looking  visuals with  only  2 caveats the  FOV has only  improved slightly  over  Q2  and in a  testing  envioment  its  blacks were consistantly  scoring a 4 on 0-10 black too white. So  basically it  does make  very dark  blacks. Though its  not horrible noticable if  you  are  not thinking  about  it  during  a  movie. I will  also  Recomend  a Light Leak incert  for  the  nose, they  are  about  $8-9 bucks I  use this  one : https:\/\/a.co\/d\/6yyfSZy. With out  this the Q3 has  a huge  light  leak  around  the  nose  but  its  comfortable even  with  the  incrt  installed. I give Meta  marks  for reducing its  form  factor  It is notacably  lighter and more  compact,  which  I  worried  would  make  it hard for  me too  wear  with  glasses. Instead I  was pleasently  suprised too  find  my  frames  fit  under it  nicely  and  Meta  formed the  interior  in such  a  fashion so the  lenses rarely  make  contact with  each  oth as most  other HMD's  do.  This  is  do  too  a small  rubber  lip around the  lenses that  protrudes.  Later I got RX lenses  made  for it  at a  discount  courtasy  of  Meta  and  the  snapped  right in perfectly  even  with  the protective  ridge. Returning too  the  Power topic I recomend if  you get  anything  be  sure it  has  Over charge  protection\/smart  charging.  I tried  Some combo Battery and delux  head bands  but they  had bad  fans  and poorly  placed  Usb C jack prone  too breakage. So Untill a better  power strap is  out  Im Make  do  withe the  cheaper and  proven Rebuff reality battery which includes  charge  protection and while  not  fast  enough too  charge the Q3 it  can  do  a  decent  job of  extending  play  time: https:\/\/a.co\/d\/fPsh5hs along  with these Usb cables too reduce the  chance  of  breaking: https:\/\/a.co\/d\/5Ti1VlM and I  always  advise  a Magnetic quick  connect such  as this: https:\/\/a.co\/d\/7IDXYLZ Now my  Final  recomendation Is the  Knuckle straps as the  controlers  are still  a bit  slippery I found them  too be  over  price  but this  model  works  fine  at  a  reasonable  cost https:\/\/a.co\/d\/jld7EsV Thank You for  Reading  I hope this was usefull.

{"reviewTitle":"Awesome Headset With Some Flaws","reviewDescription":"Update 2: It took over 2 months of frustration for me to finally get a replacement for my malfunctioning headset. They acknowledged their lack of quality customer care by giving me $130 Meta store credit. I can tolerate screwups and things going wrong as long as things are made right in the end, so I'm putting this back up to 4 stars. It's not perfect, but I love this headset.Update: My headset started to have a problem where in some spaces it wouldn't detect some of one of the controllers buttons. I went through talking with customer service several times about this. Every time I got disconnected and even though I would put in a reference number they gave me I would have to explain everything from the beginning to a new person every time and they kept making me do the same trouble shooting over and over again. After several days and many hours of this they said I would get sent a new one, then that got screwed up somehow I guess. It's been over a month now since I started going through this. Nobody on their side has any information on what is going on or how much longer this will take. Every single time I try to email them for info I get a different clueless person with absolutely nothing to tell me other than people are working hard to solve this for me. To me nothing will cause you to lose stars here more easily than bad customer service and Meta has about the worst, so this thing went from 4 to 2 stars over this stupid BS. I wish I had just returned it and bought another one instead of dealing with this annoying crap.I love this headset for the most part. It's not quite the game changer the Quest 2 was, but it is still a solid generational improvement. I went with the 512GB one even though I feel fairly extorted having to choose between paying an extra $150 or having to deal with swapping out apps all the time due to very low drive space. Quest 2 was only $50 extra for 256GB which was great. By the time I get all the accessories to make this thing more comfortable I'll probably have a little over $800 into it. Compared to the about $450 I had for a fully decked out Quest 2 with lots of aftermarket accessories I'd say we are entitled to some fairly high expectations. Also on that note I will say that if you're tight on cash Quest 2 is still a great option because this doesn't really have very many must have features right now. Perhaps once the software catches up with the hardware, but I kind of expect the quest 4 to be around the corner from whenever that happens. I'm somewhat of an enthusiast and I've blown more money in stupider ways than this, so I'm on board.The Good-I like how it is thinner and sits with a better center of gravity. It makes a big difference with how it sits on your face and I'm sure when I get an after market headstrap it will be much more comfortable.-The higher resolution, the pancake lenses, the higher refresh rate, the wider field of view. These are all things that are easy to write off as minor, but then you realize how much of a difference these are making when you put a Quest 2 back on. Things look very nice and very clear. I'm sure it will only get better as more and more apps add updates to them. So far the updated apps I have tried are a very noticeable improvement. However I have to mention that since they didn't use OLED this time around I still notice the lack of true blacks and a fair amount of bloom in some circumstances.-The speakers sound pretty darn good. There are actually 4 this time around and they do a good job with 3d audio.-I like the feel of the new controllers and the tracking actually seems a little better during some of the more intense moments of some of the faster paced games like Pistol Whipped.-I'm a bigger fan of color passthrough and AR than I thought I would be. I would say that it's still in the early days of this tech though. Pass through is still producing a fairly low res image with lots of warping and distortion.  You can't make out text on your computer monitor or phone unless you get extremely close, but it is clear enough to watch a show while you put together a puzzle in one of the apps that's been updated for AR like Puzzling Places and Cubism.The Bad-The two biggest things are probably how uncomfortable this is out of the box (I can't wear it for more than an hour before it starts to cause me pain that gets progressively worse to the point of being unbearable) and the battery lasts less than 2 hours most of the time. Sometimes even less than an hour and a half if you're using pass through. I personally don't mind this and even prefer it if it means a much lighter headset because I use BoboVRs halo headstrap with hot swappable battery.-They left out some improvements that seem odd to me because they wouldn't have cost much especially when you consider the substantial price increase from the Quest 2. The microphone still sounds pretty crappy which is odd considering how Meta seems to be pushing the social aspects of VR pretty hard, bluetooth headphones still have too much lag to use, and there isn't as much RAM as people were expecting which would have come in handy for a lot of things including more multitasking.Things I'm Looking Forward To From Metas Next Headset-Obviously a better mic, less bluetooth latency, more RAM.-Pretty much the stuff the Pro had that they left out here like OLED and face and eye tracking.-clearer AR. It works pretty good here, but I can tell the next iteration is going to make how this AR looks now seem like low res old tech.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"187 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697328000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Much better than the Q2","reviewDescription":"I was using the Q2 since release day and based on specs, knew the Q3 would be enough better to pay for one.I haven't used my Q2 since the 3 arrived.On the Q2, I used the Vive Deluxe Audio Strap (DAS) and did the same with the 3.  The original Q3 strap has not touched a head and probably never will.  I can't say if it's better than the 2 strap (which is awful) and don't care.  The Vive DAS is very comfortable and has decent sound.The pancake lenses and true IPD adjustment on the Q3 are a huge improvement over the Q2.  The Q1 also had true IPD adjustment which was removed from the Q2 to reduce the price.  I'm happy to pay more for a better product, and a better product the Q3 really is.  Add to that the partnership with Zenni to make prescription inserts that are of very high lens quality and with a great fit and you have a real winner.I've read reports of disappointing battery life but that hasn't affected me.  I use a battery pack in my pocket with a short cord to the headset.  I also use PCVR which uses less power from the headset battery.  The Q3 is an awesome PCVR headset.Yes, it costs more than the Q2.  Yes, it's enough better.  It's worth it.Cons (big one):  It's Meta.  Might be unusable if Meta decides it shouldn't be supported.Sometimes there's a Meta update pushed for PCVR and it crashes my game.  The PC wants me to accept or delay the update, but my game has crashed to display it.  A real bummer for online games and it seems to be happening pretty frequently lately.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1723680000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great headset, but some issues versus Quest 2.","reviewDescription":"I loved my Quest 2...had it since launch of the Quest 2. It did have some drift problems develop on the controllers though, which became somewhat of a pain at times, especially in competitive online multiplayer FPS games (Contractors is mainly what I play).  The Quest 3 has already started developing some mild drift on my left thumbstick, and that that is pretty disappointing, for as new as this Quest 3 is. I play it for several hours probably every other night, on average...but it still shouldn't have drift already.I also noticed micro-scratches on the lenses, ALREADY. The lenses are great, except that issue. They create a very clear and probably no warping or blurriness on the edges either, which is a small issue on Quest 2 (though still not one that bothered me). The coating on the Quest 3 lenses is apparently very sensitive to scratches. I never noticed any scratches in the 3+ years I had my Quest 2, and I always would wipe it with micro-fiber cloths, like what I've done since getting the Quest 3.  It is very disappointing to have that happen already as well, like the drift issue.  Seems to have been almost within the first few times of cleaning the lenses (again, with specific lens cleaning, very soft, micro-fiber cloth too...must be the dust gets dragged around while wiping it, but that is seemingly way too sensitive to scratching then).One other issue I have seen that is not so great with Quest 3 is tracking. I randomly lose tracking (seems to be headset and controllers, since the system will say \"tracking lost\", and cuts out of the game I'm in, for no clear reason (but luckily not too often either).  I have the same lighting and location as I regularly play in, and played in with Quest 2 without those issues, and yet, to randomly lose tracking is a headscratcher. Really messes with your game when in the middle of some action.  Also, the controllers don't have quite the same consistent solid tracking that the Quest 2 has, in my opinion.  Mind you, I do use controller holders\/cups\/sleeves to put the controllers in, which came with the gunstock I use for my primary VR FPS gaming, but that is where it is frustrating to know that without the tracking rings as on the Quest 2 controllers, the Quest 3 apparently has some of its tracking done in the \"handle\" of the controllers(?). Hmm, so that would be where my problem lies, and still degrades the experience with the Quest 3.  I mostly am able to track solid, but it doesn't pick up on all movements as well as on my Quest 2.  Luckily, this tracking issue doesn't end up being game breaking, but hinders better results and often makes the controllers jump back into place slightly, more often than not, for a moment.  A bit of an immersion breaker and another annoyance.The field of view and extra pixels\/resolution are 2 upgraded characteristics that are great but not a game-changer, but noticeable and pretty nice semi-upgrade (again, it's not a huge difference, but nice enough to notice).Would I recommend Quest 3 though?  Yes, in most cases. The overall hardware is much up a step up in processing power, and the visuals are clearer and crisper and enough of a field of view upgrade to appreciate that.  But, I would still whole-heartedly recommend Quest 2 for anyone not feeling sure about the price of Quest 3 and not sure if they will keep playing VR enough to get their money worth.  To me though, for those that stop playing, I can't see why not, because VR is a whole new eye-opening and mind-blowing experience to be \"in the game\" than even high-end PC and console games. There are plenty of great games in VR to experience, and graphics are not always as important as the gameplay and experience of feeling so immersed that sometimes you forget you have a headset strapped to your face\/on your head.  Some people get motion sickness though, and some are just not impressed by much. To each their own. For me, I was sold from the first time I even tried a demo of some of the original VR systems back in 2016.  It's my main gaming platform now, and probably will remain as such.  I find it hard to go back to \"flat\" games, even many of the AAA popular games.  By the way, Azgard's Wrath 2 is a really cool game, AAA style game play and it was a nice perk when getting my Quest 3 to get it for free.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704585600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Huge upgrade from Quest 2 - WiFi SUCKS","reviewDescription":"So out of the gate, the controllers are meh. I couldn't care less because I use finger tracking when in quest mode. The finger tracking is soooo much better than quest 2. SO GOOOD. Although if you're tall and got long fingers like me, the tracking may feel slightly off. It doesn't affect usability, it just looks weird when you notice in pass-through. Some games I also keep an xbox controller on-hand because movement with hand-tracking is just awful no matter how good the tracking is. It's just too small of a window for consistency...The cameras are a huge upgrade, looking through them is like wearing glasses that are slightly too strong for your eyes. It doesn't hurt but it's slightly blurry and you can't read some distant words. There's actually colour now and the tracking is superb.The resolution is nothing to right home about unless you run it on a PC using Steam Link. It just always looks sub-par in quest mode. You really feel the difference on PC. I mean it's really nice. The FOV is not that amazing. But that's coming from someone who would use very thin custom masks to maximize FOV on the Rift CV1 and the HTC Vive. It's nothing crazy.. I dunno, to me it didn't seem like a huge thing. It was about the same as it was on the vive for me.The straps are awful. I have long hair and it makes the straps constantly slide and apply too much weight on my face. I had to buy a custom strap. The face mask is fine though.THE WIFI! Oh my lord.. it's SOOO BAD. It was SO PICKY about my wifi. I spent days fiddling with it to get it to stay connected to my wifi. At first I had to connect my quest to my phone hotspot then to my wifi for it to work. But eventually I fixed it... still, I read about how many people had issues and how they STILL haven't made a definitive fix that fixes it for everyone.Truly... terrible... buyer beware.All-in-all a good headset.

{"reviewTitle":"Not bad","reviewDescription":"I\u2019ve been using the Meta Quest 3 for a while now, and it has truly elevated my VR experience. The visuals are sharp, the processing power is impressive, and the overall performance is smooth and immersive. The library of apps and games is expansive, making it easy to find something new and exciting every time I put the headset on.However, there are a few drawbacks.First, the head strap could be more comfortable and adjustable, especially for longer sessions. It doesn\u2019t always provide the best fit, which can be a bit frustrating.Second, the lack of a physical IPD adjustment slider can be inconvenient. While digital adjustment is available, it doesn\u2019t always allow for precise tuning to individual needs.It\u2019s also worth noting that despite the device\u2019s high quality, its price is higher compared to previous models and some competitors. This may be a deterrent for some potential buyers, especially those new to VR.Finally, the Meta Quest 3 doesn\u2019t natively support PC VR. While you can connect to a PC via Oculus Link or Air Link, this might lead to latency or quality issues, which could be a downside for those who want the best possible PC VR experience.Additionally, the battery life is quite short. I often find myself needing to recharge after just a couple of hours, which can interrupt the experience.Overall, the Meta Quest 3 is a fantastic VR headset, but it would benefit from a more comfortable strap, a physical IPD adjustment slider, longer battery life, and a more accessible price point. Despite these minor issues, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to dive into virtual reality.*Here\u2019s my photo with custom Head Starp","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1723507200000}
{"reviewTitle":"My First VR Experience","reviewDescription":"This is my first VR experience. The words \"blown away\" have been overused in regards to this item, but those words are justified, and entirely appropriate.Pass-Through: This feature is absolutely wonderful. If you have have watched enough YouTube previews, you will be led to believe that Pass-Through provides a flawless see-though experience. In truth, it will be much grainier than you expect, and the colors and contrast will not be right. However, it works more than plenty good enough, and I can't imagine using the headset without it. The two-tap feature to flip in and out of Pass-Through works like a charm, and you can navigate around the house without breaking your neck or removing the headset. Besides, when you are doing a game in Pass-Through, you're not looking at the environment to see if your sofa is fuzzy...you're looking at whatever 3D thing is coming at you.Headset Comfort: It's not as bad as I was led to believe. Some people said they get headaches after 20 minutes. They must have had the straps cranked down trying to achieve total darkness. The only place I see light coming in is around the bottom of the nose. It is not bothersome. I've had the headset on for 2 hours without any unusual strain. About two hours of VR is all I can take, anyway. I have not encountered any headset fogging.Menus and Navigation: Really Outstanding. Everything works amazingly well without glitches. I had some trouble getting the floor level correct for a couple of games, but I'm getting used to it. Two taps to the headset, go to settings, adjust the floor a little, and tap back in.Setting Your Physical Boundaries: Unbelievable. The room-mapping feature is fast and incredibly precise. It's a snap to design your own boundary, and fun, too. You get a heavy warning when approaching a boundary, and you can easily see your boundary by glancing at the floor. This feature works in just a spectacular way.Battery: The battery has gotten stronger each time I charge it. I can go for the advertised two hours straight now. Charging time is 60-90 minutes.Controllers: Work great, easy to hold, \"B\" button is a little hard to reach, but not a problem. This is from a person who has never used a controller. Motion tracking of your hands and fingers is superb. When a game overlays a twisted, veiny hand with filthy fingernails of top of yours, the awesome effect is something bizarre to see.Games: The little free mini-games they package with the headset to teach you the fundamentals are really neato -- especially the one with the Dancing Robot. The included full-blown Asgard's Wrath 2 game is just spectacular. You have to understand that the headset itself holds all the games, so space is at a premium. Thus, even though the graphics in Asgard's Wrath are great, they are probably equivalent to games of 10 or 12 years ago (not that I'm an expert). I usually find games of this type to be too hard, particularly the puzzles, even on the \"easiest\" settings. This is not true with Asgard's Wrath. On the \"Story\" setting, I've advanced to Level 6 and have not met anything I could not handle. I think anyone who enjoys gaming would have a blast. There are three levels of difficulty you can choose.Sound: Fabulous, with great stereo effects. Plenty loud enough, immersive, and very clear.Clarity: Extremely good. The Interpupillary Distance setting works well.Motion Sickness: If you are prone to it, there are numerous settings that allow you to adjust parameters to minimize it.The only real trouble I had was setting up the Meta account. The app only gave you two choices; log in with Facebook, or log in with Instagram. To make a a long story short, I was forced to create a Facebook account before I could create the Meta account. Once the Meta account was made, setup was done in a couple of minutes.I can heartily recommend this headset to any first-time user.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1707264000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Mostly better, but worse in weird ways than Quest 2","reviewDescription":"I think everyone\u2019s familiar with the upgrades: better resolution, wider field of view, lighter, better processor, better airlink, etc. etc.However, there\u2019s a few things that I consider to be downgrades from the quest 2.The controllers have a much smaller detection range (probably due to the removal of the rings, which is a good thing).

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing VR Quality","reviewDescription":"I don't know why I avoided the Quest in the past. But with the release of Quest 3 I decided to pull the trigger. The game selection on the store and the support received so far has been great. The visual quality on a lot of games is amazing, I have no problem playing the \"portable\" versions of some of these games. When you start playing with Steam VR Link though, that's when it really opens your eyes. You simply still can't beat a \"tethered\" experience(at least in graphics). With my PC I can crank the graphics and resolution beyond what is possible on the native headset. What really grinds my gears is the included accessories and quality (or lack thereof), it's arguably a barebones experience and you can tell Meta wants to steer you towards their overpriced offerings. At $500 and with the very marginal improvements over the Quest 2 they really couldn't at least include a better face pad or head strap? No, that'll be another $100(if you want the official stuff). That's an obvious cash grab and pretty inexcusable.Good- Controller tracking. I'm surprised how good it is without external tracking- Visual quality. Every game I've fired up looks great and has a good frameratesBad- The head strap. Very uncomfortable, I hate this thing. Replace it as soon as you can. YOGES brand is what I got and it's been very comfortable.- The face pad. If you're sharing this thing with family or friends the you absolutely need a silicone face pad. Why they didn't include one from the get-go is beyond me.- I wish it had OLED screens.

I would have expected things like this to be included with such a high end machine that absolutely requires constantly being handled.

I thought I would be getting something better for nearly 700$. The two plastic straps at the back of your head dig in where you intensely moving. The design makes the face pads constantly put pressure against your forehead cheeks and temples.. I've been playing about once or twice a day for a week now and when I touch my forehead extc it hurts.. When i was done with a play session i had RED ALLOVER my face it looked like i was blushing so intensly! It is expected to have vr face but i didnt think that intensly! DO NOT buy the elite strap for nearly 70$ it is a scam. And if you want more battery life you will have to cough up 120$ for the elite battery pack!!! The elite strap may solve some of your issues but it does break. Your paying 120$ for a piece of plastic and a battery! I would recommend a third party head strap that will solve all your issues for nearly half the price of the battery elite strap. I personally recommend the BOBOVR Q3 its a really comfortable head strap with a design to not put pressure on your face. It also comes with a battery pack that's lasts almost 2 hours and is magenticly put on. The best part is the BOBOVR Q3 only cost 50$ its a great deal.

{"reviewTitle":"Solid upgrade from the Quest 2","reviewDescription":"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.Pros -Display - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.Audio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvementAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.ConsDisplayWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.ComfortThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.EcosystemThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headsetPassthroughThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"15 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699747200000}

About an hour and a half at best without battery or link cableEven with additional power it only slows the drain on the main battery, it doesn't stop it entirely or refill it while playing. It does effectively increase game time but something to keep in mind.Default headband pressed headset down on my glasses causing pain and discomfort. Didn't matter how I adjusted it.

If you have not used real VR before, be sure to temper your expectations.TLDR: Goodbye god rays. Good bye screen door effect. Hello Sweet Spot. The lenses are crisp and the sweet spot is massive. However do not buy into the hype of pass through, this tech is not there yet.Pros:Visuals: I came from Vive to Vive Pro, to Quest 2. Quest 3 is a nice upgrade. Mostly because no more Fresnel lenses, massively improved sweet spot and no more screen door effect.Hardware: The controllers are mostly great. The formfactor of the headset is nice and tight.Software: Easier integration with PCVR than ever beforeThese Pros are more than enough to justify an upgrade from early headsets but prepare to buy accessories to offset the cons.Cons:Passthrough: The passthrough is the equivalent of 6 shots of vodka while simultaneously swapping out your eyes with a 2009 Logitech webcam. This is still an improvement from what we had before in the VR space, but if this is your introduction to vr passthrough, beware. DO NOT fall for the pass though hype. Tons of content creators out there make passthrough seem amazing with these cool software demos, driving cars, doing parkour, etc.. Do not fall for the hype. Passthrough is neat but it is not even adequate yet for mass market. In my opinion, passthrough is only at a devkit phase. Its enough for developers to build out cool experiences for a future good mixed reality headset. Hopefully can be improved in time with software updates, but I am doubtfulComfort: The face gasket is fine, however the fabric face gasket is a bit itchy for my taste. The head strap is serviceable.  Can be fixed with 3rd party products.Battery Life: Kinda abysmal. It is enough for most of my VR jaunts but definitely does not keep up with my occasional long plays.

My take so far:It\u2019s not comfortable at all so you\u2019ll want to get a third party head strap. The ideal set up would be to have something so that you can lift up the eye piece to see without having to take it completely off. Yes, you can see a VR version of the room you are in through the quest, but if you are trying to do something like read your phone screen or look at the joystick buttons, it\u2019s a bit like trying to look at the after you\u2019ve had your pupils dialated. The other thing is that if you are trying to draw a map of a room and not just use the system in stationary mode, you might as well just forget it unless you have access to a large empty room, otherwise it\u2019s just going to tell you your playing area is too small and you have to use it in stationary mode anyway. Otherwise so far so good and I\u2019m glad i decided to go with the Quest 3 over the Quest 2.

There's a lot of great content that continues to grow over time. The lenses are some of the best that I've seen for Standalone VR. The spatial audio is incredible. The control use is largely fluid and intuitive. There are more improvements that can made though.1) While the handtracking is actually pretty good, it still has some quirks with the finer motions. This is probably something that can either be patched to fix or it might be something more for Quest 4 when we're reaching that point.2) While the headstrap is pretty good in relation to other headsets, it can be better with a better adjustment system. You shouldn't have to buy a new headstrap to optimize your fitting. It's still one of the more comfortable headstraps that I've seen come on a VR headset, but it can be better.3) The battery life. This has always been an issue for standalone VR. Quest 3 is one of the worst offenders though due to the new features. There are ways to improve the headset. As the production over time improves, so will the battery life at least a little as they find ways to make Quest 3 more efficient on the production side of things. They can also probably patch programs and the OS to better optimize for the hardware so that what energy the battery is capable of on a full charge can last longer. That said, this might have to wait for a mid-gen refresh or the next generation for this issue to be fixed, unless you get a power bank or one of the battery pack headstraps to replace the current headstrap.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708128000000}

The Quest 3 lenses are FAR superior to the Index Fresnel lenses.Game library: Sort of a win for the Index although you can play most Steam VR games on the Quest 3FOV: win for the Index but only marginally, kind of a personal preferenceMaximum refresh rate: win for the IndexTracking accuracy: Index base stations have better tracking but the Quest 3 tracking is by no means bad.Sound: Index sound is better if you care about that sort of thing.Battery life: Can't compare since the Index is tethered but if you add a battery pack to the Quest 3 I doubt you can play long enough for the battery to die which brings me to comfort;Comfort: Out of the box, the head strap the Quest 3 comes with is utter garbage, I do not understand a strap this bad ever left the design table, just throw it in the trash and purchase one of the many available 3rd party straps with extra battery. Both headsets are still kind of heavy and get uncomfortable after a while, for the Quest, long before the battery dies.So since I do not care that much about sound or FOV, not being tethered and the great improvement in image quality make this a no contest for me, the Quest 3 is the better headset for me.  The mixed reality thing is cool but still a little gimmicky. The pass through on the Quest 3 is nice but still grainy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1706400000000}

Surfing the web and using social media is more work than enjoyment. Not to mention the battery life isn\u2019t good, like at all. 2 hour use max unless you purchase a battery pack like 600$ wasnt enough. In addition to that, if you have ANY SENSITIVITY TO MOTION SICKNESS, just leave now. save yourself the waste of time. Any VR video or video game will affect you.

So far I\u2019m 0-2 on the 512GB Quest 3.  For reference, I\u2019ve only played Beat Saber, tried the Asgard Wrath game that came with it for maybe 10 minutes total, and watched maybe 10-15 minutes here and there of YouTube VR over a 2-3 week period with the two different Quest 3 I\u2019ve purchased.The first Quest 3 I purchased had a battery life of maybe 40 minutes. The product is rated for closer to 2 hours so I expected at least 60 minutes on battery saver mode.  I had to enable battery saver mode after getting ~30 minutes of gameplay at first using out of box settings.The second Quest 3 I purchased I used for about 2 weeks, battery seemed good. All the sudden during the third week of playing, the left speaker started going in. This created a terrible experience with only right side sound.Amazon only offers a full return and not exchange so you need to re-purchase again if you run into issues within the first 30 day return window. I am debating going with a 3rd try on the Quest 3, or possibly downgrading to a Quest 2 based on my experience plus other reviews that indicate hardware issues on the Quest 3.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1710633600000}

I could see this at $399.00 but that's it.6) Controllers are AWESOME, unfortunately they are so small, make sure your using the lanyards, if not your going to wish you had, also these little guys do eat batteries quicker than the Q2.7) Headstrap, as someone else called it, Satans jock-strap, they weren't kidding, get red of it and get something else, anything else!8) If you want to get phone notifications in your headset, it isn't going to happen, yup that's broken too.Overall by the time you get through spending all this money for the headset and the other things your going to need, your better off waiting until they can either fix this thing, or better yet, reduce the price tag or even better still get a better VR system.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698796800000}

Here's my experience after the \"upgrade\"Pros:- Loading times shorter- Higher resolution- Pancake lens expands \"sweet spot\"- Passthrough is full color and higher fidelityCons:- Microphone! The mic is awful and other people can barely understand me, and it's really quiet. Truly terrible and this singular issue might be the reason I downgrade back to the Quest 2. Apparently this is a known issue with the Quest 3, just google \"quest 3 microphone\" and see for yourself. External microphones are not supported, either. The only software options are to turn the mic on or off.- Battery life. You're lucky to hit 2 hours.- Accessories. The Quest 2 came with the silicone cover. The Quest 3 did not.- Meta support. Just awful unless you like talking to A.I.Summary: I was excited to upgrade and Meta has stomped on that excitement. I can't believe how much they fumbled the mic considering their whole thesis was for this to be a product for social spaces. Maybe I'll upgrade someday later but as long as I'm in the return window, this thing is probably going back.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705536000000}

This completely defeats any parental locks as they have to know my pin just to get their stuff to work.2- If you begin downloading an app or game, there is no way to pause\/resume the download. If you leave the quest alone for long enough it will forget what it was doing and restart the download completely at 0%. We dont have unlimited bandwidth here so this hurts alot by eating into our data plan with zero to show for it.3- actually this is the worst.

The quest 2 resolution and improved graphics were a big step forward.  The primary benefit of the new quest 3 is the color pass through which will allow mixed reality gaming (search a video on youtube to see a representation of what it means).  The other upgrade that I think is overlooked is the change to the lenses.  Read the CNET or other exhaustive review if you want all the details, but essentially the new lenses allow a wider field of view and don't have the glare issues that the first two suffered from.As I type this and the headset has been out for a few days.  The mixed reality demo's are really amazing.  There is a ton of promise there.  I expect over the next year many new and interesting experiences will be available.  In the meantime many of the games I already own are releasing quest 3 graphical enhancements.  What is old is new again.  Enhanced games will keep me occupied as I wait for quest 3 specific games to go through their development cycle.  The developer support is second to none for the Quest platform and Meta has been really classy about not charging for these enhancements.  So games I purchased 3-4 years ago on the original headset have grown, changed, and improved significantly with no upgrade charge or fee to play on my new Quest 3.  Specifically Pistol Whip, beat saber, and drop dead dual strike.As a life long gamer, this wireless VR headset is a true next gen experience.  I love my PS5 and Xbox series X, but its still sitting on a couch using your thumbs.  PC gaming is an endless cycle of hardware and driver updates.  PSVR has wires and that is a deal breaker for me.  I want to be up moving around in 3d space.  There are a lot of active games like boxing or various interactive fitness games that making working out fun.  If you don't own one of these headsets, this purchase is a no brainer.  If you have the Quest 2, and money is a concern you might want to hold off a little until the games show up.  Its incredible what the oculus (now Meta) team has been able to accomplish with essentially mobile phone graphics processors.  I am excited to see where VR goes over the next 10-20 years, but this Quest 3 is amazing right now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697068800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Valve Index-Killer","reviewDescription":"Long time PC-VR-only user but I've been really wanting something \"more.\"  I wanted a headset that took better advantage of my PC graphically with a 4080 GPU and I wan5ed more and more to get rid of my tether and try wireless PC-VR.I was worried that the FOV going from the Index to the Quest 3 would be deal-breaking.  It's not.  The optics are so much clearer, with a bigger \"sweet spot\" than the Index and no fresnel lens god rays that amount to a so much more positive viewing experience.  What you lose is raw FOV (which would be really blurry in the Index anyway), you gain in the ability to move your eyeballs around inside the headset to see more clearly and less head movement.I thought I was gonna miss the Knuckles controllers.  I don't.  You come to think that the grip and finger-sensing is 100% necessary and the best, but most games don't use it and it really isn't calibrated all that well when it is or for various hand sizes.I thought wireless PC VR, with SteamLink, would have noticeable lag and visual degration and require extensive setup or tweaking.  I was wrong there, too.  Super easy to use, if a bit clunky to launch and manage the two interfaces (Quest Native>Steam Link to access Steam Library)Lastly, my room is already wired with three lighthouse 2.0 basestations.  I thought I would really miss my tracked controllers.  I don't.Long story short: if you're a PC-VR-only user and been wanting more out of your Index, consider buying the Quest 3 for the $550 it costs as a little upgrade to the investment in the ecosystem you already have.  Then dump the Index stuff.  Someone will buy it from you.  It's good hardware still.  Holding on right now is an exercise in sunk-cost fallacy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712361600000}
{"reviewTitle":"The Quest 3 is the best looking headset under $1000, it's worth it even if you only ever use PCVR.","reviewDescription":"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.There's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.Background info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.Review: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"73 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700870400000}

{"reviewTitle":"It's everything I could have wanted... almost","reviewDescription":"I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!It's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail  to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook\/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color\/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.If you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"89 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699574400000}

{"reviewTitle":"I wish I could rate it lower but... it's still market king.","reviewDescription":"SETUP:Q3 + Elite Battery StrapCOMFORT - 4\/10:To me, this is less comfortable than the Q2, despite being slightly better balanced (weight distribution is closer to face now).  Namely, the interior plastic now makes contact with my face, which digs in, making it uncomfortable.  This happens even at the furthest facial interface setting (for folks with glasses, which I don't have)... and that comes at the price of worse FOV.LENSES - 10\/10:Compared to the Q2, this is much clearer, with a much more forgiving sweet spot.  In fact, it's so wide that the IPD adjustment seems to have almost no effect, and we can pass between players without adjustment.  That's wild, and very different than our Q2 experience.COLORS - 7\/10:It's still an LCD, so expect washed out greys instead of blacks, muted colors, and no HDR.PASSTHROUGH - 7\/10:It's cool, but was massively overhyped.  Do I prefer passthrough as my default view?  You bet.  It's nice to have a sense of my surroundings while in menus.  Is passthrough viable for things like reading texts and working at your computer?  Heck no.  It's a grainy (albeit color) mess of compression artifacts and distortions.  You'll give yourself a migrate trying to read small text or even the keys on your keyboard.  It's worse if your keys are backlit, as the glow bloom adds to the artifact mess.I've had some issues with my Q3, namely in what seems like a loose lens or display panel or something.  The lightest tap sends my vision stuttering - which has never happened in hundreds of hours of the previous Q2.CONTROLLERS\/TRACKING - 9.5\/10:This still has occlusion and line of sight issues, like the Q2, but otherwise it's MASSIVELY improved.  I'm a decently ranked beat saber player, and my scores significantly improved when switching to the Q3, despite using a claw grip (which could interfere with the LED signal from the tracker, since it doesn't have the ring like before).PERFORMANCE\/SPEED - 10\/10:This is the most noticeable gain from the Q2 (aside from the usable passthrough), and you feel it everywhere.  Bootup is faster, shutdown is faster, menus open faster, apps\/games load much more quickly... and I assume this has something to do with why the controller tracking is so good - it likely can just handle the tracking math much faster, thanks to the improved compute.GAMES - N\/A:I've basically given up on the Quest store at this point, mostly using this for SteamVR via Virtual Desktop (which continues to work great).  I'm sure there are some good titles on there, and native apps do perform with much better latency than via wireless PCVR, but the visuals are just much worse in comparison.  For instance, Beat Saber is smoother on native Quest, but looks like a blurry mess (with fewer visual effects) than on PCVR - not to mention the lack of mod support without jumping through even more hoops than we have to on PCVR.OVERALL - 9.5\/10:It's not perfect, but pretty close, and arguably hits the ideal mark based on its incredibly low price point.  If Valve finally releases a new HMD, will I buy it?  You bet.  Until then, the convenience of the Q3\/wireless trumps all other headsets IMO.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717632000000}

They\u2019re building a huge audience to justify their future investment in innovation. Eventually they will get so small they will fit in a pair of sunglasses. The Ray-Ban partnership gives credence to my prediction. At that point everyone will need to have one. It\u2019s gonna be Meta\u2019s iPhone moment.The only better hardware than this (and not by much) is the Apple Vision Pro. That thing is roughly 7x the price and maybe 10% better build.

I was concerned that the lack of a direct DisplayPort or HDMI connection to the video card would degrade visual fidelity (because of the need for the signal to be compressed). But, using the Oculus LInk software with a high quality USB-C cable to the PC, I was able to get an excellent image to render for MSFS 2020 with a 4080 Super graphics card (and 7800x3d CPU): 100% DPI with very smooth framerates and almost no artifacts (even with the added overhead of image compression on the GPU).For those prospective buyers who are interested in PCVR applications with a direct cable link, I'd say give the Quest 3 a try if you're willing to do some custom software tweaks (see YouTube for tips). I had an HP Reverb G2 before, and I'm very happy with the quality of the Quest 3 (I prefer it a bit over the G2). I think Meta has ironed out some of kinks in the last several months.

{"reviewTitle":"Huge step up from the Quest 2 I owned!","reviewDescription":"Wow oh wow. Visually, with the new lenses and higher resolution, the Q3 goggles blow away my older Quest 2 which I have since sold.Over-all, everything seems clearer to see, contrast and tonal values from dark to light are much better and everything just seems to be quite obviously, much clearer. I have no eye strain from these, even in use for well over an hour.The elastic head strap though, had to go. Gave me a slight headache. I purchased one of the fully adjustable, padded headsets for this Q3 and that comfort issue is now resolved!As for battery life, it's not that bad and it depends on what you're doing for a game or activity plus your brightness settings (higher brightness drains battery faster). I've got a small usb-c battery I used on the Quest 2 and it does help extend battery life for perhaps an hour or more over the built-in battery. A larger usb-c battery pack placed in the pocket works well too for longer use and to avoid any extra weight on the headset.As for the faster CPU in this new model,... yes, the fast response of going through menus or opening up and running apps is quite noticeable. Big improvement there.The Q3 is more fussy about what USB-C PD charger you are using (the Quest 2 was not fussy at all), and it at times refuses to charge at all (or very slowly) if using a none-Meta usb-c charger, so for now, I am using the stock charger packaged with the Quest 3. The Q3 has a small battery in it so those high wattage chargers won't really charge much faster than the stock charger will at its lower wattage spec. In measuring watts\/amps during charge using a USB amp\/watt\/volt meter (Amazon has these!), you won't be fast charging that little battery in the Q3. But, even using the stock charger seems to charge up the Q3 quickly (and hour or more depending how far down the battery is) so no big deal.So, bottom line, if you are considering moving from the Quest 2 to a Quest 3 because you want a clearer, sharper and smoother\/less pixelated image quality experience (plus far less need to tweak the googles to exact position to eliminate viewing blur like the Q2 lenses had), for that reason alone, I highly recommend the Quest 3. It's night and day better with no exaggeration.For me, the Quest 3 is a totally new and much improved VR Goggle over the Quest 2, not an upgrade, but, a totally redesigned VR goggle and the investment in this more expensive Goggle will be well worth it.Consider selling your Q2 as I did and recoup some $$ towards your Quest 3 purchase!5 Stars all around.

{"reviewTitle":"The best VR headset, hands down.","reviewDescription":"The meta quest 3 is the successor to the meta quest 2 and that is VERY apparent during both initial setup and usage afterwards.Pros:Clarity, Clarity is an absolute GEM with this VR headset, the pancake lenses are so good and clear that when I tried to use a quest 2 it was like looking through the pancake lenses but rubbed all over with VaselineGameplay: the increased resolution and power compared to the quest 2 are absolutely insane. To put it in perspective, The quest 2 and 3 both do a game called \"beatsaber\" at a lower than native resolution. Looks a little pixelated but that's what the quest 2 could do. Quest 3 can play at the quality of a PC if you tweak it right (install mods to increase resolution, quest 2 would struggle)Weight: The weight distribution is also better, even though the headset is only slightly lighter, because the headset itself is closer to yout face, the weight extrudes less meaning its less front heavy causing less strain on your neck.Middle:Comfort- Comfy headset? Heck yes! But not really with the included strap. The included strap doesn't really even out the weight and puts too much pressure on eyebrows, nose, and cheeks. I found that a halo strap (usually around $35+, mine is the bobovr m3 pro) is a MUST have. The weight makes it feel like you aren't even WEARING a headset.Cons:Space for glasses- if you wear glasses then you will need either an additional spacer for the face cover or lense inserts (I use the Zenni inserts, meta approved). They definitely helped a ton, before when I used glasses with it it put a ton of pressure on my face, which made it bruised in the middle right between my eyes, however, the lense inserts are so good cannot even feel them!Misinterpreted con:Battery life-Battery life is technically worse, however, this is because of passthrough (most of the time, anyways). Passthrough requires the headset to process both a GAME and the environment around you, It isn't just a camera displaying an image, it's 4 cameras stitching together an image in real-time and sensing depth ad well as keeping track of where you are in the plane of the 3d vr world to ensure proper tracking. Hence why it uses more Battery. The quest 3 also uses more battery in heavier more \"intesive\" games that take advantage of the quest 3's extra performance over the quest 2. An easy and not too expensive remedy is a Battery bank. For games in which you have to move around I recommend the bobovr m3 pro or S3 because they feature Battery packs, the m3 pro has a 5000mah battery bank that increases battery capacity by around 2-3 hours and the s3 around 4-6. And these batteries are hot swappable meaning you can buy more, charge them as you play, and when your existing batteries die you can change them! For basically infinite playtimeI totally recommend this headset for anyone either still on the quest 1, sharing a quest 2, or as your first VR headset ever. Battery life isn't really a problem and a battery bank (18watts or higher) is a great way to fix any battery life issues you'll have, especially for Mixed reality passthrough games","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1711756800000}

You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improvedThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\ud83d\ude10 Controllers: neutralI liked the rings on the Q2\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.Things I\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2Overall: while I\u2019m sad there weren\u2019t any BF\/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \ud83d\ude39BTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled.  I didn\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix._____\u00b9 \u2014 For PCVR I\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\u2019s \u201cHVEC 10-bit\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \u201cHVEC\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\u00b2 \u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701216000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Quest 2 airlink veteran; First day, I'm impressed","reviewDescription":"Been using the Quest 2 for a while and honestly, I hate it. I really wanted to avoid the Quest 3 because I thought Meta was incompetent at delivering reliable productivity features, I know now it was likely the limitations of the Quest 2. I'll be back to praise or talk terribly about it in the future, for now, first impressions.Note: I have not tested the headset by itself much. I use VR so I don't have to sit in front of my desk all day (Remote work & school) I almost only use it for remoting my PC and playing VRC.Physical Impression - Quality build, it had a nice feel in the hand. Quest 2 feels like holding a hollow brick, the Quest 3 feels like holding a neatly bound book. The regular straps feel amazing, but I'm still 3D printing an adapter for my Quest 2 battery strap, largely due to that awful 2 hour battery life. Controllers are amazing, that ring not being there is freeing and hand gestures in VRChat feel so much more natural now. Also they made the batteries easy to access which is worth its weight in rechargeables.Image Quality - I have a big head, which means wide PD, 75 to be exact, but 70 seems to hit just right. I took a look around some VRC worlds and discovered that even with prescription lenses, I was blind on the Quest 2. I saw details I didn't even know were there. I was able to see crisp pixels from a distance. Particle effects no longer look like fuzz. Every few seconds I asked myself \"Is this what other people see when they play VR?\" My desktop looked like it was a screenshot I was viewing on my PC it was so crystal clear and I feel like that's an understatement.Airlink - Above for basic visual quality. Compared to the Quest 2, no contest. Virtually no issues connecting, didn't have to take the headset off to adjust my PC. Realized I was getting the same frames I usually get in VRC, now I know the Quest 2 was dropping frames and still looked like a blurry dream. What little controlling of my desktop I did seemed to work great, virtual monitor updated immediately.Built-in audio\/mic - Can't speak for the mic yet but I'd be amazed if it's worse then the Quest 2 which already rivaled my Razer Siren Mini. Speakers were okay, better than the 2 but I doubt they'll replace my headset. I feel I can comfortably take work calls while just wearing the headset though. I can already imagine laying on the couch, incense burning, tea in hand, listening to angry customers scream in my ears.So far, I'd recommend it!

Re-playing the Half Life series all the way from HL1 to Alyx was the bomb.dot.com! Dirt Rally, Asseto Corsa and BeamNG are amazing.

{"reviewTitle":"Coolest thing I've ever owned!","reviewDescription":"I've wanted VR ever since the first Oculus Rift was announced in 2011. It was beyond expensive for a kid in high school and the tech just wasn't there yet to justify the cost.As new products came out, the tech improved but then required things like the mounted sensors, minimum amounts of clear space, etc - plus they were upwards of $1000.More than 10 years of waiting for the right product later, I saw the Quest 3 and decided to pull the trigger. I was nervous to finally jump in, but my god it's been by FAR the most fun piece of tech I've ever owned.If you're like me (someone whose only experience in VR was at an arcade for 30 seconds) and feel unsure, just go for it. It's phenomenal. You will not regret it. I legitimately never had this much fun in my life.If some of the common cons reported are concerning to you:- the strap CAN be slightly uncomfortable, but as someone with a large head, it's really not as bad as it might sound. At it's worst it feels like when your glasses are a bit too tight against your head. I've been able to find a sweet spot with the factory straps that don't bother me for a full session. Worst case scenario, a cheap third party strap will solve the issue- battery life is pretty short, but for such a powerful standalone device it's amazing that it can even get 2-3 hours in a single session. Seems like some solid charging pack-straps are available if you need more (plus you can share while using -- just get the right cable and adapter).- passthrough quality is FINE. It's not 4K, it can be a bit grainy, but it's really fine. It's the only headset around with functional passthrough and it gets the job done. You can see and move around without removing it - that's what matters IMHO.For what it's worth, I've now bought 3 as one family member wanted to buy mine as soon as they tried it, and another one loved it so much we're getting it as a gift for them.If you have any interest in VR and don't want to jump in early, this is the one to go for.

{"reviewTitle":"This headset is very very worth it.","reviewDescription":"I've had this headset for a few weeks now and I've had nothing but fun with it.Here are some pros.- Mixed reality is very smooth and works extremely well with the systems UI-The battery life is more than enough for a few hours of gameplay without a power cable connected, or an external battery.-The stand alone mode features many apps and games like Roblox, YouTube, VR chat, Bonelab, and more.- The lenses are awesome and they're super easy to clean (Make sure you use a micro fiber cloth and apply cleaning solution TO the cloth and rub into the lenses.)- The airlink cable connected to your PC will allow you to play for an extended amount of time due to it also slowly charging your headset as you play. (your battery will still go down slowly, it's not meant for charging as it's a fiberoptic cable, the dying process just slows down.)Here are some cons!- Sometimes airlink (With the cable) can be stuttery if you're opening the home menu while playing a steam game. (I just suggest using the steam menu instead by pressing the home button on the left controller.) (((I have a GTX 1660 Ti and a 9th Gen i7, 16 gigs ddr3.)))- getting used to adjusting the straps to your head can take a few days.- Sometimes when you turn the headset on while the headset is strapped onto your head, there is a bright white flash that appear briefly, usually I just close my eyes so I can avoid it.- The official airlink cable costs a hefty amount of money after already buying the headset, I suggest going for a cheaper one that's 16 feet or more.That's about it, thank you!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710979200000}

Ease of setup is good, a mobile phone or computer is not required but can be helpful.Other annoyances:  if you are hoping to use the 6 month subscription trial, your meta account has to be old enough to enter a contract.  This means an adult must be the admin on the device to claim the deal.  If you are like me, I let my kids play with their new things before I do.  So, after my kid setup the device, the admins also set to a child.  The subscription trial notification goes to the admin on the device.  Then since the admin is a child, they will not be allow to get the subscription.  Now the awesome part (sarcasm), the only way to switch admins is by a factory reset.  Ok, I did that and got the subscription set up in under my adult name. After re-setting up the device we were ok till I wanted to cast what my kid was doing onto my mobile phone.  Only the admin can cast to their meta account mobile device.  Now I have to do another factory reset to put my kid back in admin role so I can screen cast to a mobile device with their meta account on it.For all the technical achievements the VR presents you would think people tried this stuff out before putting it on the market; Focus group; beta test some parents, something.  Finally, last gripe, any supervised meta account can disable supervision on their own if they are older than 13.

{"reviewTitle":"Mixed Feelings","reviewDescription":"I've owned both previous headsets and have put extensive hours into them.The Good:- Noticeable pixel\/screen improvement.- Hardware seems more capable (casting wasn't as laggy as on quest 2)- Controller design is much better with getting rid of halos. It wasn't uncommon to hit your other hand\/controller with those.- Scroll for focal width is much better than quest 2 (quest 2 was a downgrade from the first gen in this regard with just a few rigid positions).The Bad:- BIG price hike. If I didn't have a $100 gift card already, I Iikely would have just stayed with the quest 2 and waited for other vendors to compare before buying.- Not enough memory on base model and too much money for bigger storage model- Uncomfortable fit as is. I really expected more with a big price hike and the quest 2 fit better out the box to me. You shouldn't HAVE to buy aftermarket and they made it so you can't use previous headstraps on the new headset. We really should have a class action on this one and Meta needs to make up for this going forward or I'll be definitely be looking at other vendors.- I have notable light leakage around nose now compared with previous headsets.Neutral:- I don't really notice field of view improvements but I didn't switch back and forth between headsets to figure out and I would have bought this headset without that improvement (as long as other items improved).I have another negative but I'm not sure where to attribute it. The most frequently used game by me is Thrill of the Fight - a boxing game. At the same time as the new headset drop, there was a game update. I've noticed my punches are registering completely differently than before and I'm fairly confident one of my power punches is being greatly mis-tracked.

{"reviewTitle":"A very nice and welcomed upgrade to the Meta Quest 2","reviewDescription":"I'll start with my favorite enhancing features. First of all, the adjustable sides for glasses wearers, THANK YOU JESUS. This is huge, if you don't need glasses, it comes default in the closest position so you don't have to do anything, but, if you have glasses, there is a little button on the inside of both sides where it has 3 different distances, I pushed mine all the way out and I can now wear my glasses inside the head-set no problem. I'm extremely pleased with this functionality.The second biggest change which is extremely close in magnitude to the first, is the sweet spot for virtually clarity is noticeably larger, in the Meta Quest 2, things could get a little blurry around whatever it is you're focusing on, and you could just tell, it needed improvement. The Meta Quest 3 delivers with a much more forgiving sweet spot, much larger, it significantly increases the pleasure of use and immersion.The headset is much more sleek and less bulky than the 2, which is nice. I like the design of both the headset and new controllers.The mixed reality cameras and feature are very cool. I haven't got a chance to explore them more but I'm excited to. When I went through the set-up I was impressed by the quality and clarity of the passthrough cameras, they are a noticeable improvement and it makes me want to mess around with some mixed reality games\/ apps.Okay, so overall, very pleased, the reason however for the 4 instead of 5 stars is that I would really like there to be some sort of dark mode where the Quest isn't trying to force the mixed reality features. I like to use the Q3 in my bed at night without any of the mixed reality even needed, but sometimes the Q3 will force the user into turning a light on, and errors will come up say that you need to re-create the boundary, and tell you stuff like, \"are you sure you want to continue with limited functionality.\" You have to deal with this, every flippn time, it's like, Bruh, I know what I'm doing, leave me alone, stop forcing me to recreate boundaries and warning me. Every time I use the thing I have to deal with these complications. Meta needs to understand that maybe not every thing you do inside the Q3 needs the mixed reality component and not everything you do needs lighting in your room. There needs to be an option to completely disable mixed reality features or a dark mode where the quest isn't trying to incorporate mixed reality. If they fixed that issue, I would rate it 5 stars. Really great toy for 500.Also honorable mention, it's a great unboxing. The box it comes in is very compact and easy to open box and everything was extremely easy to set-up. I know unboxing is not a big deal to a lot of people but it's special when the box opens easy and everything looks good and sleek, and it's not a hassle to set-up. It makes for a fun time getting to know your new toy.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"36 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704585600000}

{"reviewTitle":"A reasonable upgrade from the Quest 2","reviewDescription":"I guess it doesn't take a whole lot to wow people these days, because reading some other reviews or watching videos on the Quest 3 you could be led to believe it's some life-changing improvement over the Quest 2. It's really not. It is an upgrade in just about every way, but not by some insane amount. Everything is simply a little better than the Quest 2. FOV? A little better than the Quest 2. Lens clarity? A little better than the Quest 2. Screen resolution? A little better than the Quest 2 (most of this probably goes to your improved FOV actually, since PPD is just a wee bit higher here). It's a little smaller, a little better balanced, technically heavier I think but since it's closer to your face it's less of an annoyance. The biggest upgrade is probably in the passthrough cameras and Time of Flight sensor, but this is something you're rarely using outside of a few choice games, and the quality is frankly kinda ugly. Don't get me wrong, the few little mixed reality things I played (like their demo) are fun, and the ability to map spaces is cool if painfully underutilized, but it really feels like they were just trying to tick boxes here. As for the extra graphical horsepower, I feel like calling it \"twice as powerful\" is a big, big stretch, or at the very least all that power doesn't seem to be doing much yet, the few \"Quest 3 enhanced\" titles I've played so far do look better, but not by a whole lot. It's still a good headset, but I'd say if you're already using a Quest 2, and especially if you're already deep in the Quest 2 ecosystem, you'd be better off waiting, because for the privilege of these upgrades you lose compatibility with almost literally everything you bought for your Quest 2.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1712707200000}

That plus a nose light guard.Now it's perfect! So I give it 4 stars because for $500 it should be more comfortable out of the box, or offer a custom fit option. Still a vast improvement over the 2 for picture quality and processor speed. Battery lasts about the same too.

Whatever I expected was way off as the whole experience was a blast!  I haven't had this much fun with something since I was a kid.Initial acclimation to the whole experience may leave you feeling a bit funky at first, but it didn't take me long to get used to.  Brain literally needs a minute to adjust to the new environment you just gave it.  You will literally get lost in your own home, so be careful lol.The built in speakers are great, they don't get real loud but you have the option of headphones.  It's real dang close to the sound quality you'd get in a traditional arcade.  Kind of adds something to it.The only Con's I can mention is setup is a bit tedious, meta wants your name rank and serial number(s), and battery life is pretty short lived, which means a lot of down time recharging. - smart phone will be required for setup\/pairing with meta's services.  Charging block gets pretty hot so this is something I would NOT recommend leaving sit unattended overnight.  A hidden Pro is most of the games I see for sale on their platform are in the 20 bucker's range.  I call that a deal.I went through a lot of reviews before purchasing, which mentioned the strap that comes with this thing is awful, so I went with a Kiwi battery head strap (both arrived the same day, sweet!), and the thing is so comfortable I can almost forget I'm actually wearing the thing.

You\u2019ll probably feel sick walking around casually with them on. I\u2019m not sensitive to this at all but it\u2019s a bit nauseating.Hand tracking is okay. Pretty good even.The resolution looks really tight and I\u2019m happy with the quality of the screens and lenses.The audio is actually really good. It feels 3D with how they beam it at your ear, if that makes sense. Plenty of bass without being overpowering.The head strap and facial interface are BAD. You\u2019ll want to get a pleather or silicon facial interface and an aftermarket head strap. Buying it from Meta is encouraging them to put awful head straps on their devices like they did with the last 2 Quests.The included USB cable is short and just for charging. It\u2019s $80 for the Meta fiber USB C air link cable. You can find them way cheaper but not like this. The fiber aspect is important for keeping the cable from breaking when you move around a lot.I haven\u2019t been able to get it to charge faster than it does while I\u2019m using it. Official USB cable, aftermarket, nothing.Battery doesn\u2019t last super long at all.Your face will probably get a bit hot while you\u2019re playing.Overall I like it but make sure you include the things I mentioned and a hard case in your cost analysis when comparing\u2026 if AR \/ standalone game streaming isn\u2019t that important to you, maybe get a Beyond or another headset.Still 100x better than the Quest 2.

{"reviewTitle":"A realistic review: 10 Overactions","reviewDescription":"I've heard a lot of things said about the Quest 3 but so far here are my more down to earth impressions.1. The sweet spot is a bit bigger. Just a bit. It's still very much there. You can tell when trying to read fine text. However, outside the sweet spot is so much clearer than previously that it's easy to do a quick try on and think it's gone. It's not. But still very much better than then Q2. I'd say it's the biggest game changer for me.2. Screen door effect. I can't think that I noticed one at all in the hours I've worn the HMD so far.3. God rays. I've not noticed any, but I've also not played in any particularly dark environments.4. Dark levels. Seems about the same as the previous generation.5. Default Head strap fit. Much better than previous generation but I will be buying a 3rd party strap at some point. Its good enough for now though.6. Built in sound. WAY better. Still going to use headphones personally but I can see the improvement there. I could, in a pinch, use them without hating it.7. Battery life. Same as previous generation and by that, I mean not great.8. Increased screen resolution is nice.9. Increased FOV is so slight you won't really notice much but it's nice to know it's there.10.  Color Passthrough. Its grainier than some of the videos online make it seem. Can you read your computer monitor? I can't. Can you read your phone screen? Maybe if you get the distance an angle just right. Is it better than the previous black and white pass through? Very much yes.Overall thoughts. Not as hyped as people made it out to be. But what is? The quest 3 is a good generational upgrade over the Quest 2 for enthusiast. And a fantastic jumping on point for newcomers. But not such a drastic upgrade that you should consider jumping if the price is a concern or your Quest 2 is still meeting your needs.I can't wait to see what the Quest 4 eventually brings to the table.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"134 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696982400000}

Adem\u00e1s el rango de ajuste de brillo es mucho mayor, lo que me permite bajar mucho mas el brillo que en Quest2 y obtener mejores negros.Cuarto: a pesar de que parecen tener el mismo FOV, las quest3 son superiores.

Al volver a usar las quest2 volvi\u00f3 la sensaci\u00f3n de estar mirando a trav\u00e9s de una lentes de buzo.Quinto: se nota la potencia del procesador, especialmente en el excelente tracking de manos.Tengo que decir que mi unidad tiene algo de MURA que en un principio no hab\u00eda notado, pero que es evidente en fondos muy claros, pero es casi imperceptible en un uso normal. Las Quest2 tambi\u00e9n tienen alg\u00fan tipo de mura, pero no se notan tanto porque las lentes no son tan claras.Tambi\u00e9n creo que tengo uno o dos p\u00edxeles muertos (revisando muy detalladamente), pero cada vez que trato de encontrarlos estoy mas de 10 minutos intentando hasta ubicarlos (a\u00fan con un fondo totalmente blanco).

{"reviewTitle":"Game-changing","reviewDescription":"I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.In practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.With that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \"accessories\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.Ignoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701129600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Freaking Sweet!!!","reviewDescription":"I bought my daughter the Oculus Quest 2 last year and she loved it. I finally gave it a try and had so much fun so I decided to buy myself one. I logged in to buy the Quest 2 but started researching The Quest 3 and was amazed by the mixed reality feature so decided to go for it. I am so happy with my decision and having a blast.  :-)  My wife doesn't even like video games but I let her play in augmented reality game and she immediately fell in love with you. Now we are both excited to try new apps and games. This is only the beginning if mixed reality, and things are only going to get better. Do you want to try mixed reality and don't want to been $3,500 on an Apple vision, this is actually a really reasonable option. You can use the controllers or hand tracking. There's tons of videos on YouTube showing you tips and tricks and everyday I'm more impressed with this device. You can use it for games, work, or even if you just want to spend time at a movie theater without leaving the house, The Meta 3 can take you there. I suggest ordering a comfortable headband because the one that comes with is flimsy. You don't need the elite because they have a bunch of third-party vendors that sell decent once for as little as 12 bucks on Amazon. I bought a $12 one my friend said it's better than his authentic Elite one. The next one I buy will probably be a bobo with a built-in battery for the battery pack that goes around your neck but for now, I am using a noco battery charger\/car Jumpstart and it surprisingly added an extra 2 hours of play time. Batteries do run out quick so you want to get something. You can use the regular power blocks with the long cable but they run out of juice pretty quick. I found a small, light gym bag and have all my power blocks inside with the cable running to the backpack and I just keep swapping out the different power blocks. When doing so, it takes the juice from the power block first before it starts draining the internal battery so if you keep swapping them out, your battery stays at around 80% for hours. Anyways, there's so many features on this thing including using it to play Steam games on your PC. For being a standalone VR unit, it's incredible that they give you that option. Meta also let you try the games that you buy and if you played less than 2 hours and you don't like the game you can return it for a full refund. If you thinking about getting the meta 2 because of the price drop, you might want to reconsider because the games that will be making in a year or two will most likely have mixed reality. But if you totally new to the vr, the meta 2 is still an awesome unit.

{"reviewTitle":"My first thoughts as a previous Quest 2 owner:","reviewDescription":"First of all: the box is AMAZING! The entire box which has the headset, controllers and charger fits inside my laptop backpack! I can even easily fit my MacBook Pro and headset in the backpack and still have space left! This makes it much easier to travel with the Quest without having to buy an expensive travel case. This wasn't possible with the humongous box of the Quest 2.Now to the comfort. It's fine. The facial interface feels premium, but is also hard to clean. The soft strap is still mediocre, but after a bit of fiddling, I found it quite comfortable. The softstrap also has the advantage of portability and being able to lay more comfortably on the couch. On the Quest 2, my lenses used to fog up a lot. This was one of my biggest annoyances. It's so much better now. On the Quest 3 they still get some fog, but not nearly as much. It isn't a bother to me anymore.The visuals: I haven't experienced any blur, godrays or chromatic aberration YET. But I haven't really looked for it either. That said, I found it to be very noticeable and distracting on the Quest 2. It is very obvious that the UI is rendered at a lower rendering target than the native display, as are most games. They still look good, but it feels like untapped potential. I will be testing it with my RTX 4090 at 150% supersampling soon.Passthrough: it's okay I guess. The reports of it looking like 360p were very accurate. Theres also jitter, I think due to the lower refresh rate. The depth is very accurate when not at a near distance, that's impressive. I was able to use my phone, but barely. Wasn't very comfortable. Although I was able to type out a long message.Mixed Reality: I've only tried the First Encounters so far. The setup was simple, but honestly too simple. It wouldn't let me add every wall in my living room, I think it capped at around 6 walls? Not sure though.This didn't really affect my experience because OH MY GOD it was SO COOL. Seeing an alien bounce on the head of my sister (sitting across the room) while another one was climbing the furniture was really impressive. So much fun as well. I really hope that developers go all in on this. I wasn't really a believer of Mixed Reality for gaming, only for productive purposes, but I am now.Also: even though I slandered the passthrough quality, which just isn't good enough for real life activities, it was more than good enough for Mixed Reality. I was so immersed that when looking back on the experience, I can't remember any grain or poor image quality. Even though it was definitely there. The overall experience was great.The controllers: I noticed that the haptics are a lot tighter than they were on the Quest 2. They aren't very powerful or as impressive as on the PS5, but they are very very tight. Ans it helps a lot when navigating through the UI. Makes it feel a lot more intuitive. It just feels better.CONCLUSION: I honestly gave up on VR after the Quest 2. It was a good headset, but there were way too many small annoyances with it. Controllers buzzing when vibrating, lenses fogging up, having to take off the headset when grabbing the phone, front-heavy design, heavy chromatic aberration, etc.It's too early to say, but I think that the Quest 3 might have just fixed nearly everything I hated about the Quest 2. It's an impressive device overall.That is everything that comes to mind now. I'm not able to test it any further today as I have a busy schedule. But I will definitely be using it all day tomorrow.

{"reviewTitle":"A Big Leap for VR!","reviewDescription":"I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.I pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.4. Pass through \/ Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.Probably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.I see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.I think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.Where I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.My WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream.

Easy to change the head strap if you want a comfier or cushion type one.Adding a compatible battery power bank is easy and suggested.*The bad*Quick battery drain. This is my only real issue. The battery drains pretty quick and even faster when using MR.But that can be offset by using a compatible battery power bank or a 20ft USB C cable.*The Ugly*I can't say much here. The price for many is pricey ands if you want to play games with your family, they each have to have their own head set. That can get very expensive.Unlike a console, you can't plug in a second controller and just go. Only you can see what's on your screen.

I know you can do that on a PC or buy a retro pie, but it looks so cool right on front of you and looking like it's a movie screen.With the help of SideQuest, you can install CX file explorer and then Retro Arch and copy your classic games from you PC to the Quest.And lastly for anyone asking or maybe those who don't have the extra cash after putting out the funds for this device.I can't recommend pirating, but a quick Google search for Meta and the opposite of mother can help you with that problem.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"164 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1717459200000}

{"reviewTitle":"I own a Quest 2 and bought this as a gift for my father.  I will DEFINITELY be getting myself one!","reviewDescription":"As an owner of the Quest 2, I wasn't too sure how much of an upgrade this would be, but let me tell you, this thing is a significant upgrade that I think is well worth the cost.The way the weight is distributed, this thing feels lighter on my face than the Quest 2 ever did, and while I'm probably still going to buy the BOBOVR strap replacement for the Quest 3 (like I did for my Quest 2), it's not because I think the Quest 3 is uncomfortable to wear.  On the contrary, this thing is definitely more comfortable out of the box than the Quest 2 was, so anyone on the fence about comfort can lay those worries to rest immediately.I'll be honest:  When this thing first arrived and I tried it on, I wasn't wowed like I expected to be by some monumental leap in clarity, crispness, and screen resolution.  No, it wasn't until that same night when I used my own Quest 2 again that I was blown away by the difference.  Is it a staggering difference?  No, it's not.  Is it VERY obvious when comparing the new and the old side-by-side?  You better believe it.The Quest 3 is more comfortable to wear, improves upon the Quest 2's already impressive motion responsiveness (which is huge for folks who suffer from motion sickness if the scene they're viewing doesn't move *precisely* in lockstep with their head movements), has UNBELIEVABLE hand tracking capabilities (this thing makes the Quest 2 look like a knockoff product in that regard), offers a noticeable bump in clarity and responsiveness, and takes the rudimentary pass-through visibility system from the Quest 2 and instead gives you a true \"I can see everything around me, in color, without visible skewing or synchronization issues\" experience when you're wearing the headset and need to be able to see the world around you.Heck, even the built-in speakers (which were already excellent in the Quest 2) got a really nice bump in terms of volume AND fidelity.  I don't know if this thing is *actually* louder than the Quest 2 (at max volume), or if it just *sounds* louder because the speakers are positioned more intelligently when you're wearing the headset, but either way it's yet another significant upgrade.Bottom-Line:  The Quest 3 is truly an upgrade over the Quest 2 in every way.  This is an absolute home run product for Meta that I think literally everyone who enjoys gaming at any level will enjoy.If you own a Quest 2 and are still in love with the thing, I wouldn't call this a \"must buy,\" but I *can* guarantee that you'll be significantly impressed by the upgrade should you choose to pull the trigger.As for anyone who's never owned a VR headset and is on the fence about taking the plunge?  I'll just say this:  Back when the Quest 2 was first released in 2020 I told anyone who would listen that right then was *the* time to get into VR.  The Quest 3 just made 2020 me look foolish, because this thing is a slam dunk experience, and NOW is objectively the time to hop on the VR train.

The change from Fresnel lenses in the Q2 to the pancake lenses in the Q3 has to be seen first-hand, and then actually used, to not only believe the difference but to appreciate the difference as well!I use a D-Link VR Air Bridge for playing PC VR games and have always been able to increase the quality of the link to the max 200mbps, but on the Q3 the play is just much smoother and the visuals on games like Half-Life: Alyx are just that much more immersive due to the pancake lenses and faster graphics processing of the headset.I'm not seeing the color fringes that are common with the Q2 or the light rays that can happen with bright scenes with Fresnel lenses. Going back to the Q2 to compare really drove home how much better the visuals are. I'm looking forward to playing both MS Flight Sim and DCS World in VR now and should be able to actually read the cockpit displays...I love that my library of Oculus\/Meta apps (both the Quest apps and the PC\/Rift apps) migrated with the new headset as that's a significant investment in time, energy and treasure. Everything seems to play better and even the apps not Q3 enhanced look and play better as well. I purposely went with the larger storage size for the Q3 than I had with the Q2 (I have both a 64GB and an 128GB headset) as the Q3 enhanced apps take even more space now, something that's easy to forget when deciding which Q3 to go with.But using the lessons I learned with the Q2, I immediately got an elite style head strap with a built-in battery pack (10,000mAh), a case that can fit the headset with the strap (see photo), a silicone face pad cover with the flaps at the nose to block light, knuckle straps for the controllers, and controller extension grips (for games like Beat Saber, Gorilla Tag, Golf+ and my favorite Kayak VR: Mirage).All is not roses though.Battery life really SUCKS, so you NEED that extra battery during game play (particularly with playing PC VR). On the Q2 I used to use a USB battery pack clipped to my belt and connected to the headset, though that went away when I upgraded to the elite-style head strap with a built-in battery. With the Q3, I skipped that altogether and went directly into a head strap with a large battery.None of the Q2 accessories work with the Q3, except the Link cable if you are still using one of those. I had to replace the face cover, head strap, controller grip extensions, etc. with the Q3, even had to get a new case for storage (though there are a few cases that work for both, my Q2 cases weren't those).And I wish Meta had gone with OLED displays! That's not to say the Q3 displays are crap, because they aren't, but OLEDs would have added a premium touch to the headset like nothing else could.If you have a Q2 and are looking to upgrade, do it if you can afford it! If you are looking to get into VR and are looking at the Meta products, get the Q3 over the Q2 if your budget allows, as you will be more satisfied with your purchase overall.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704758400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great headset, but some QC issues.","reviewDescription":"As of this writing, I've had this vr headset for over an month now. Ive been an VR enthusiast since 2017. Upon using it from day one. I still get the joy of its quick boot up times and launching a game\/app really quickly over the quest 2. The lens are day and night over the quest 2 or any other VR headset ive used (Pancake lens over Fresnel lens) field of view is nicer too. The quest touch + controllers are nice, it is strange though after getting use to the older oculus\/meta's controllers with its rings on as these don't have the tracking rings. After getting use to it, Id say they are perhaps the best and most comfortable controllers Ive used. tracking accuracy is great!,  however tracking volume (where the headsets sees the controllers) are different. Meta has moved the cameras down more so controllers above head or behind shoulders are a little harder to be tracked more. Headset is nice, though I am alittle sour with it coming included with a cheap head strap, for $599 I would of liked it to at least include a elite strap. knowing this, I got my self an off brand head strap from Kiwi design. it only cost me $30 (prob during a sale) Also Ive heard alot of QC issues from others who I play with that also own a Quest 3 headset, such as broken USB port that falls into the headset, etc. so feeling alittle skeptical.  Hardware wise, ive been fortunate that none of those has happened, however the meta software seems buggy, sometimes something just freezes or apps doesn't launch.  When using its Link, the Meta\/Oculus dashboard seems to be very buggy and overlooked since the Rift S days.  as if Meta is like not giving much care for the desktop side of things. however there are alternatives, such as virtual desktop and steam link, but as a meta product you spending $500 for at least. they could at least give more effort on the bugs.  Hardware (at least for me) is nice and solid.  If i were to nitpick. would wish the battery was a little longer.  It is true that the Quest 3's battery is slightly shorter then Quest 2's. using a 18+watt power bank or using long cable while plugged into wall can help extend playtime.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1710374400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Improved, But Lacking Battery Life","reviewDescription":"First and foremost, it outperforms the Quest 2 in just about every category. The visuals are much sharper, immersion works better without increasing vertigo, tracking is leaps and bounds better, and the controllers (clones from the Quest Pro, I think) are a great improvement. One of the best things (for me) is the new room-mapping software; it 3D maps your play space--including floors, walls, ceilings, and obstacles--automatically and very quickly. You can still manually set the floor height and draw an area if you want, and you can edit anything the headset maps. It's really a great function that lets you set up pretty much anywhere very easily. Meta and its partners are also supposedly hard at work updating and optimizing their gaming library to take advantage of the 3's improved processing and display capabilities. Red Matter 2 was ready at launch, and...DANG; the difference is kinda stunning. The new pass-through view is improved, too. It's a full color mixed or \"augmented reality\" (AR) setup, where you see the real room you're in and a scaled-down version of the menus grafted over it. This view is a higher resolution than the old grayscale IR passthrough, but it's still a little grainy. Given the limitations of the sensors and cameras Meta used, this wasn't surprising, but still, you shouldn't expect 4K resolution outside of actual applications.Onto problems; the main ones being the battery and the interface menu (OS). The battery sucks. Like...a lot. I drained it from full to less than 20% in less than 90 minutes playing \"Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge.\" I could get over 2 hours on a single charge out of the Quest 2. Less resource-intensive games did a little better; \"Superhot\" lasted just about two hours, and dorking around in the included tutorial games did about the same. It feels like they kept the battery from the 2 when an upgrade was clearly called for.  This could be a QC issue; maybe the battery in my particular headset is just a little off or something, but from other reviews I've seen, this seems to be the norm. The user interface (UI) is the same as the 2 as well; as in, identical. Same menu placements, settings, everything. I can understand why, since the 3 came out very quickly compared to other VR headsets, and Meta obviously wanted to focus on performance increases, which they did very well. But...come on; at least a new look for the UI would have been nice. The headset is also a few grams heavier than the 2, which becomes noticeable after about half an hour of playing. The facemask (point of contact with your face) is cloth, and if you work up a sweat, it will be absorbed. That's a hygiene issue that could have been addressed; the Quest 2 came with a silicone gasket cover specifically for this, but the 3 did not have one included. The included headstrap is a great improvement over the original iterations, but still not great. Meta has a $70 \"elite\" option, but there are already aftermarket options available at a fraction of the price.Despite the issues, it's hard to beat at this price point, especially if you want VR untethered.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697068800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Not for Me","reviewDescription":"I am returning this Q3 to Amazon. Not because it's terrible or a bad VR headset, it's just not as good as my HP Reverb G2. So you might ask, why did I buy a Q3 if I already had a HP G2? Mainly because my G2 is having the universal issue of USB connectivity issues, usually caused by a weak HP provided VR USB cable and a poor system of inserting the cable into the G2. A new cable is almost $160, so I ordered the Q3 to replace my G2. While it was being shipped, I tried a couple of the cable fixes for the G2 I found online, and one in particular, using a Zip tie to strap the cable to the headset frame, fixed (for now) the cabling issue. But most importantly, from all the reviews I saw, most said that the picture quality was amazing on the Q3. And while it is better than the Quest 2, it's not amazing and not as sharp as my HP Reverb G2. In  the end, I am a gamer, I have a High end PC, so the picture quality is the most important thing to me. If you don't have a VR headset and have $500, it's a good option, especially if you play a lot of untethered games as the Q3 does not require a cable, although you can link it to your PC to play Steam games and others. I also got the Quest 3 for the new pass through option and while it is good, I could not use it to see my keyboard or my button boxes, it just wasn't clear enough. For the short time I used it, the Q3 headset was comfortable, although I did not do any long sessions. The Oculus Quest App was brutal for me, it worked for 10 minutes then would not recognize the link cable. I took another two hours of fiddling and online searching for a fix. This turned out to be an issue with the Quest app rather that the headset itself. If you mainly use the Quest 3 for stand alone gaming, then the app problem is not an issue. If you have a G2 and gaming is most important to you, keep the G2.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701388800000}

Not even the VALVE INDEX supported it, even if it got close. But this does! And it's good enough to support up to 75mm, which is crazy!I CANNOT understate how important IPD accuracy is. A bad setup can make you sick, ruin your immersion or just make the screen look bad. Well, with the Quest 3 you've got the IPD control combined with the best lenses a consumer can get. Aside from standalone resolution being blurry, it's crystal clear and SO much clearer than the Quest 1 or 2. FOV is still downtrodden, but that doesn't matter when these headsets make massive steps each generation. If you've needed a headset with an extra large IPD range, this is the headset to get. Almost no other headset on the market will get you right.*Now the only issue I have is how BAD Meta's software and programs are. If you wish to use PCVR wirelessly, you have two options. The ORIGINAL Oculus app that downloads at 1,000-50 kb\/s, yes that's kilobytes. My wifi averages 300mb\/s.  It's like they don't want you to use PCVR. But what about Virtual Desktop, you ask. I do own that, but I set up two factor authentication to my account, unfortunately, so when I went to do the one specific thing two factor authentication is supposed to do (text me a code), it didn't work. I'm using a new account now. This is horrible and dumb. DO NOT ACTIVATE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION, it can absolutely ruin your upgrade process. I was really gonna give this thing a 5 star rating, but the fact I won't be able to play what I bought just because I got a new headset is so bad.Anyways, assuming you don't have 2FA activated, you should consider that even that massive issue only knocked it down to 3 stars.

{"reviewTitle":"Very solid VR headset","reviewDescription":"Overall pretty cool experience so far using the Meta Quest 3 VR headset. I got the original Oculus rift years ago that could only be used while plugged into a computer, so an upgrade was a no-brainer. Some of the things I noticed so farPros:-The design is DEFINITELY improved. Is lighter, thinner, sits better on my head, uses clearer lenses, doesn't fog up with normal use like the rift did, better components like GPU, etc. I think Rift was the same price back then which isn't even comparable-Screen resolution - slightly better. I believe this is because higher resolution capabilities and 90hz refresh. Also the screen door effect is definitely way less than on the rift (however still exists- I think - but haven't noticed it much at all). I think the only major way the screen could get better is if included OLED screen instead of LCD, however that would make the device MUCH more expensive (ie Apple Vision Pro). Insanely good for the price w\/ LCD imo-Mostly Chords free - Isn't needed to be tethered to a computer to be used. Huge plus and honestly could never go back to computer tether as only option.-Mixed reality - Huge addition to the headset and is already really cool. The mixed reality screen is slightly blurry but still cool as heck. I would call it equivalent of 480p or 720p seemingly while looked thru (specs could be different). I haven't had time to explore this more or know if many apps are even available but I'm sure this feature will get better and better as time goes on.Cons:Battery - supposedly lasts around 2 hours. Would be cooler if battery lasted longer but I believe there are options for mobile batteries that attached or could get a long ext. power cable.Apps\/Software - I think I'm spoiled with the iPhone because there is literally an app for anything. For the quest store there are a lot of good apps however there definitely isn't an app for everything. I have a feeling major cool apps are yet to even exist. I think as VR goes more mainstream there will be cooler and cooler apps. Calling all software developers - Get on it!Games - On a similar note I'm an avid gamer and in my opinion most of the greatest games of all time... are  not in VR. Probably the  greatest VR game released as of this review is Half-Life Alyx. Some others are good, but most don't come close. Meta puts A LOT of  money into R&D, they DESPERATELY need to start investing in a gaming and entertainment division, this would greatly move the industry forward.Overall experience thus far 8.5\/10. Very Solid headset, especially if you're coming from an older VR headset. VR is just cool, not going to lie.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696982400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Very Impressed So Far","reviewDescription":"First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!Being able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.The pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.Everything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.Controllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.My one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.The headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.I've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.I was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"179 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1697673600000}

Listing advertisement was a bit confusing, but at least it ended up being worth it in the end!  He's loving his gift.-------------- Old review below ---------------I suppose, it's partially my own fault for not reading all the contradictory fine print - but thought Meta's own store would be a reputable and trustworthy listing. The page showed pictures and says it's a bundle with Asgard Game in numerous spots on the page.  But in the fine print scrolling down the page it says offer ended 3\/30\/24 (Ordered 4\/5 and still shows the listing as a Bundle including game...)Ridiculous.  Now I have an expensive gift already my budget limit (saved up for this bundle) which, with the game included, tipped the scales to me buying it the first place. Going to return and get something else.Also would like to mention the actual Quest 3 box was shoved into a white plastic bag with zero protection.  It arrived with damaged corners and dents on the side.  Not a great look for a very expensive gift...  Why it wasn't put into larger cardboard box with bubble-wrap or something is baffling.Still left 3 stars to try to be fair, since the headset unit itself is probably fine, but I have to review what was shipped to me slightly damaged and a significant part of the purchase boldly advertised is missing.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1712275200000}

The Rift is great, but within 24 hours of using it with the racing sim I ordered this. Much much better quality, I'm probably not going to be able to use it exclusively, I haven't been able to turn the settings down enough to get the same silky smooth gameplay as the Rift, but I've used the Quest 3 a lot. I've had it for less than a week so far. Audio Trip has become part of my morning wake up, it's a fun way to get some cardio in before starting the day, and then when I get home just for more fun. Quality is top notch all around.....BUT....the pass through cameras really aren't great. If you have really good (bright) lighting in your home then it's decent, but if it's what I would consider average or normal home lighting it's subpar, but you can still walk around and do things. I did feel that the display was too bright, I'm getting used to that now though. I feel like everything is always too bright, so I keep my house dimmer than most I suppose, and probably hurting my pass through experience as well.  Great device. I did get to demo a Vision Pro at work, a coworker preordered and the Vision Pro is visually better, but lacks expandability. I feel like there is no comparison though. Quest 3 for the money, or if you're considering the Vision Pro, the Quest Pro is are more comparable device from my understanding - but the Quest 3 more powerful. I'll be interested in a Quest Pro 2 when they release those.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1708214400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Spectacular VR with Mixed Reality","reviewDescription":"The jump from Quest 1 to Quest 3 is huge.  I skipped Quest 2 as I wanted the portable VR headset technology to be more mature before investing more money in VR.  Everything has improved tremendously, especially the visual and sound which are the most critical components of VR experience.The sweet spot to get a clear image is much wider and easier to obtain with the Quest 3.  The images are crisp and the 3D sounds are so much better.  The days of dealing with fuzzy images of Quest 1 have become a past memory.The slow and laggy response of the menu has become a thing of the past with the Quest 3 processor which is multiple times more powerful than Quest 1.The game First Encounters demonstrates the ability of the passthrough cameras in future gaming.  Although the passthrough cameras are not perfect with some distortion of colors and shapes.  But chasing aliens around the living room makes you soon forget the imperfection of the cameras and the imperfections become a minor issue.  The cartoony aliens look like they are really there with 3D sounds to match their locations.Playing Vader Immortal clearly shows that even the games not optimized for Quest 3 still benefit from drastic improvements in optical and audio experiences.  I have all three of the Vader Immortal and it is great to play them all over again in Quest 3.  The visual is so much better with images looking smooth, clear, and substantially higher resolution.The 40% slimmer headset allows much better weight distribution closer to the face resulting in a much more comfortable headset.  I have heard that the Elite strap from Meta is one of the essential elements for comfort.  But I found using my head strap foam pad that I bought for my Quest 1 works well enough for comfort.I bought the 512 MB version as many of my old Quest 1 apps were worthy to use in Quest 3 which already took a big chunk of the memory.  Video recording takes another chunk, and the newer apps can take multi GB with probably bigger apps that are coming which take advantage of the Quest 3's power.  The 512 GB version also comes with a 6-month Meta Quest+ trial which I think helps to justify the cost.  However, I wish they made a 256 GB version for about $575.I don't have a Quest 2 to compare with but the reviews that I read tend to agree that Quest 3 is not just an upgrade but a generation above the Quest 2.Quest 3 has clearly revolutionized Portable VR and Mixed Reality to a whole different level!Disclaimer: I don't work for Meta and this review is based on my several hours of experience with the Quest 3.  Hope it helps!10\/25\/2023 Update:  The front weight of the Quest 3 unit makes the faceplate press onto the face which is probably the thing I hate the most about the unit.  But I think I have found the solution:1. Halo Head Strap with a good posterior cushion (or attach a separate posterior head cushion).2. Take out the faceplate (less immersive but so much more comfortable!).3. Use a counterweight such as two small liquid ice packs (about 1\/2 pound total) in a ziplock bag attached to the back of the head strap using a velcro strap.It is almost like wearing glasses with the weight distributed onto a heavier cap.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"67 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696982400000}

You will be swapping out games with this small space, which is annoying of course, but just due to the quality differences of Quest 2 vs Quest 3, I would still recommend the 128 GB version of Quest 3 instead of the Quest 2. Games are going to be updated to higher quality, and you'll be glad you have the more powerful chip and better lenses.I use it for a lot of PC VR, and because of this, the space concern for me is of less concern since I'm not storing a lot of apps directly on the headset. But with the quality this headset offers, even I, a hardcore PC VR fan, see the attraction of just making it simpler and buying the game in the Meta store instead of on Steam! There are still quality differences in a lot of games, so I still take advantage of the Steam sales when I can instead of the Meta store.No matter what you might think of Meta \/ Facebook and their practices, the truth is that with the Quest 3 they really have a big hit on their hands here. This thing is amazing. The only drawback I see is the short battery life. You'll get 1.5 to 2 hours out of the battery, depending on the settings you use (screen brightness, 120 Hz mode, etc), and depending on the game or app you are running. I realize this adds to the cost, but you can get the upgraded strap with an extra battery. I found this made my playtime a perfect length, roughly doubling it to 3 or 3.5 hours.If you have saved up and only have enough for the Quest 2, I would advise you to save a few more months and then get the Quest 3. I've used both, and at least in my opinion, the quality of life and fidelity differences between the two are worth the extra spend and waiting. At the same time if you are outfitting your kids with multiple headsets, I can understand why going with the Quest 2 may be an attractive alternative due to the price, and potentially the headsets getting a little more beat-up and tossed around. Just realize the difference is \"meh\" vs \"WOW!\".","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1700524800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Fun.  Watch out for some motion sickness","reviewDescription":"totally reignited my job in video games.  Beat Saber is a favorite.  some of the more immersive games cause a little bit of motion sickness but that isn't uncommon and there are articles all over the internet giving you advice on how to fix that.  It basically a matter of getting used to it.  Most games have a warning level on how comfortable they are related to motion shickness and most games can be returned if they cause too much motion shickness.  All in all a good deal as long as you are willing to create a Meta account.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1720483200000}

{"reviewTitle":"No lo pienses mucho, lo vale","reviewDescription":"Me parece que es una experiencia genial, vengo de tener el Quest 2, me he disfrutado la promoci\u00f3n que incluye el juego Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2, y la subscripcion a Quest + que trae varios juegos en el catalogo usables mientras se mantenga la subscripcion, el dispositivo trae 6 meses asi que hasta ahora las he bajado todas y disfrutado mucho la mayoria. El juego AW2 que trae si se queda definitivamente aunque no renueves el Quest +.No le quito ningun merito, pero si es necesario mejorar al menos el strap de la cabeza, en la foto se observa el S3 Pro de bobovr que para mi es el mejor de todos, un poco caro pero lo vale, tambien el agarre de las manos y mucha gente dice que la interface de la cara tambien, a mi me va bien con la de stock.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1718323200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Incredible upgrade from the Quest 2!","reviewDescription":"Having own several headsets over the years from the HTC Vive to the Oculus Quest, I didn't think the Quest 2 could get any better. But after upgrading from the Quest 2 to the Quest 3, I was amazed the moment I put the headset on. The clarity, comfort, weight, and processing power blow the Quest 2 out of the water. I also LOVE that all the Quest accessories work seamlessly together. That was one big drawback with the Quest 2, nothing worked together, especially with the charging stand. They really put a lot of thought and effort to make sure all these accessories work together and it really shines! I have never been more excited in recent years with VR until now.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1718928000000}
