{"reviewTitle":"Little difference between this and my old setup of a router + various extenders - 12\/2022 update","reviewDescription":"My setup was this:TP-Link Archer C9 routerTP-Link TL-WA855RE range extenderTP-Link RE305 range extenderNetgear EX-7000 Mesh extenderNetgear PLW1000 powerline extenderI\u2019m in a 2800 sq ft house that is basically a 2 story rectangle. The C9 was in the lower level at one far corner of the house and the EX-7000 was in the opposite corner upstairs. The power line extender only works well when on the same breaker as it\u2019s paired unit so the farthest I could place it was about 14 feet from the C9 just outside of the lower level office. Of the two TP-Link extenders, one was in the garage (lower level but opposite side of the house from the C9 but connected to the Netgear power line extender since it was 14 feet closer). The other TP-Link extender was on the upper floor about midway between the C9 and EX-7000. The EX-7000 connected to it.I then have 24 IP cams spaced around the house (mostly outside but attached to the house). Several Alexa devices, tablets, smart lights, smart plugs, and laptops spaced throughout the house. The problem is about half of the IP cams are capable of sending fairly high res video to their server hardwired to the C9 but the best I could do is about 7 frames per second at 384 to 768 Kb\/S (depending on their signal strength).The Netgear EX-7000 was purchased about a week before the Deco Mesh since it was also touted as a whole house mesh system (but only up to 2100 sq ft). I was hoping it could handle the opposite side of the house from the C9 and I could remove all the extenders.I previously used separate SSID\u2019s for each extender (so 2 for each as I separated the 2.4 from the 5). I\u2019d then log into each camera and look for the strongest signal and connect to it. This whole thing worked ok, not great but just ok. So I bought the Deco 3 pack hoping to replace everything previously mentioned and turn off the wifi on my C9 and use it just as a router.I didn\u2019t want to use the deco as a router as my C9 works fine for that.I ran a 25ft cat5e cable from the C9 router to the first deco unit (still in the same room as the C9, but on the opposite wall). I placed a second Deco just above the first unit on the second floor. The third unit was placed on the far side of the house on the 2nd floor (so opposite from the first unit). I connected all my cams and the results were far worse than my original set up. So I decided to start adding back in the extenders. I first tried the EX-7000 but eventually re-added all the above mentioned extenders. I now can support fairly consistent (but far from perfect) IP cam video at 7fps and 768Kb\/S from the cams that support it. My goal was 30fps but that just wasn\u2019t possible. I\u2019ve spent 5 full days configuring and moving extenders to get the best coverage.  I may consider adding on a 4th or 5th deco unit in the future, but everything is working for the moment. I think it may take 6 units to fully cover the house without any additional extenders.I didn\u2019t like the fact that I could not access the settings via a web page like all my other extenders but the app works well.  It seems to be geared towards the average user and has mysterious things like \u2018network optimization\u2019 which appears to simply choose the best channel to have the wifi signal broadcast on. I\u2019d much rather just have the ability to change that manually but I guess I\u2019m not the normal user they are targeting with this.I also don\u2019t like that you can\u2019t separate the 2.4 and 5GHz signals. I have many smart plugs that simply wouldn\u2019t work until I turned back on my wifi of my C9 (even though the Decos had the same SSID). Thankfully, they are all close enough to \u2018see\u2019 my C9 so they don\u2019t have to connect through the decos. I did try turning off the 5GHz band on the decos to connect the smart plugs but they just weren\u2019t having any of it.Another negative of this system is I now have all the SSID\u2019s the same. This allows each cam to find the best signal on boot up but they are fairly stupid little devices and sometimes get hung up connecting to a farther away extender. A more sure fire approach is to have each connected to the closest unit all the time and only connect to another if the closest is offline. I was able to accomplish the first part of that by having separate SSID\u2019s for each unit. I considered going back to that type of setup but as I\u2019m now on day 5 of this, I really don\u2019t have the heart for it right now.Yet another thing I don\u2019t like about the new setup is the farthest deco from the source deco (in the far side of the house in the basement) doesn\u2019t connect to the closest deco but to the farther away unit on a different floor.  This seems inefficient.12\/2022 updateLowering my star rating from 2 down to 1 for the following reasons:In November, TP Link updated their app with several promising enhancements. These included being able to see details of the clients connected to each deco (including MAC addresses). This was great as I was finally able to tell which of my IP cameras were connected to which deco (to see if it was connected to the nearest one or not).  When I found the camera connected to the closest deco, I turned off the 'mesh' button for that client so it would always connect to the closest deco. The problem is, it didn't... it would still just allow the IP Cams to connect to a random deco (usually much farther away at a very weak signal).I've had to connect all these cameras to 5 different access points I have configured around my house with unique SSID's so they'll always connect to them.When performing 'network optimization' through the app, it used to just find the least used channel and change to it. I am able to control the channels on all my other devices so now, I let deco pick a channel (usually after they reboot) and then configure all my other devices around it to keep from interfering.  I wish I could set the channel on the decos in the app.As long as I'm wishing, I wish I could also give each deco a unique 2.4 name while keeping the 5GHz the same across decos.  That would allow me to connect to the closest deco with all my 'smart' home devices while allowing true smart devices (phones, laptops, etc) to roam on the mesh 5GHz network.My other huge complaint is stability.  Probably 5-6 times per week, I need to unplug\/replug the main deco because it just lost it's connection and flashes red.  Sometimes, it even requires me to go all around the house rebooting all the decos.I would also like to be able to connect a deco that is far from the main deco to a closer satellite deco rather than to the main when it can't get above a 'fair' signal.I did end up buying 2 more decos a few weeks after my original review for a total of 5. 4 probably would have been good enough as the 5th seems to be fairly redundant regardless of where I position it in the house. The original 3 units are S4's and the 2 additional are AC1200's if that matters to anyone....I actually have one of my decos outside (under the front porch and hardwired to two cams in that area (they usually wouldn't connect via wifi to that deco even though it was by far the closest). I now have a couple other cams that were outside and struggling to maintain connections hardwired to other range extenders as well.  Between this and moving the other decos around, I've been able to get most of my cams up to 10fps and 1024KB\/s. Some still struggle to his 7fps at 768KB\/s.All this and my wife's complaints about the laptop in her office constantly lagging when trying to browse webpages (or just disconnecting) have forced me to have to put her on the same setup she was on BEFORE I bought any of the decos (which is connecting to a TP link range extender -RE305 -which connects to the original C9 router on a 5GHz wireless connection. Since this is also not perfect, she can choose to connect a lan cable to her laptop that is connected to one of the powerline range extenders (which is connected on the other end to a Deco via another cable).In short, I now wish I would have spent a little more and bought the linksys velop.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"40 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661126400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Extreamly POOR app and even worse customer service! DONT BUY!","reviewDescription":"Rarely do I leave reviews but this one I have to warn you to stay away from. The APP is the worst excuse for a user interface that you could imagine. It started off by showing my connected devices but then only a third of them. After spending an entire day digging into the issue I settled on the following. Note I created the main wifi using only 5.0 and not 2.4 and 5.0. I wanted to keep my IoT separate on their own network so I created a guest 2.4 network. Here are the problems I had with no help from their supposed tech support people.1. The app only showed devices connected to the main Deco router and not the two remote mesh units. This is proven because when you click on the device it shows which Deco unit it is talking to.2. Anything on one network can NOT be seen on another network. I could not ping from 2.4 to 5.0 and I could not ping from 5.0 to Ethernet-connected devices.3. Since I could not ping to Ethernet devices then I could not use my two printers that were on the network. One printer I switched over to WIFI since it had the capabilities for it. I selected 2.4 since it didn't have the 5.0 option on the printer. Guess what, my 5.0 connected devices could not ping the printer so they could not use it. My 2.4 devices (older PCs) connected to it okay and would print. I then switched the printer back to LAN and I could print from my Ethernet-connected PC but not the 2.4 that I could on the wireless. To be clear I NEVER had any network issues like this with my previous router.4. Research their website and you will see lots of complaints about this problem. The App stops showing you the connected devices! I had just named all the devices in the app matching their MAC address so I could name them accurately. I have over 50 devices which were one of the reasons I chose the router. Remember though it only showed a third of them connected however all of my devices had internet connections which means the app is only showing the one on the main router and not the remote ones. The second day the app stops showing any connected devices just blank! This means all the time I put into naming a third of my network in the app was wasted! On the third day, their tech support suggested I factory reset the deco and start fresh which means if the devices could come back into the app named they would be lost after the reset.5. Their tech support is not existing - they are not there - go into outer space and turn left, might find them there! I tried finding a USA phone number and couldn't (looked all over the website and only found Canada numbers). I decided to try the chat sessions with them and after three attempts I sent the crap back to Amazon for a refund. Their \"tech support\" would ask me to try different things and when I did and told them I just tried it they insisted I send a screenshot after every try and fail to \"prove\" I had tried it before they would move on to something else!?!?6. To be very clear here I really like Tp-Link, when I said I have over 50 devices on my network, well about 25 of those are Tp-Link outlets and switches for lighting and things (IoT). I really like the Kasa app for those products so I thought (very wrong without much research) that this router would be the same quality. Well, the router performs well for speed, and then it ALL stops there.Poor excuse for an APP and beyond belief they would let something like this APP out there knowing it has issues and has had issues for over a year or more. Again that my fault because I didn't review the product well enough!Won't make that mistake again so please don't follow in my footsteps! Find something - anything - besides this brick!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"54 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1606176000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Drops Client Devices Regularly","reviewDescription":"Pretty disappointed with all the 5 star ratings. Started with three units in a single story 2200 sq ft home. Could not get full coverage and deco nodes showed weak to fair signal. Bought another node which made 3 nodes now and one main. Got strong signal to 2 nodes and still just fair in garage. I have a few security cameras on the exterior and I had to place nodes literally within 10 feet of cameras to get them a strong signal. They were lagging bad and now they drop off and have to pair them like every day. I run several iot devices like smart bulbs, plugs, relays etc. have tvs, iOS devices all set up on mesh. Full time job trouble shooting and was expecting this was going to be the solution. It works but pretty crappy and unstable. I\u2019m plugged directly into AT&T router and have a good signal to main Deco. The nodes do not manage mesh devices well. Slow and lagging. Nodes are roughly 20\u2019 apart and still the one in the garage I can only get to fair signal. Buyers remorse. It doesn\u2019t live up to what they advertise.Update. So interior devices such as phones, pads, tvs, fire sticks, apple TV, laptops. No problems. It really boils down to \"Iot Devices\" that runs through phone and Apple I pads that utilize apps like Smart Life, Smart Things, Vicohome. Being as the apps communicate via internet and not directly to the device. I constantly have to re-pair devices to network because they show offline in the app. Conversely the show as connected in the DECO app. Some of these devices are not readily accessible as they're installing in electrical boxes etc. Point in case relay modules for light switches. So it's not just the crappy management dropping clients for no reason. It's the extra maintenance to keep devices working on line. This is pricy junk if you are doing device control over mesh. Not worth a dime. However for less complex scenarios like phones and lap tops. It's fair. You would be better off with hard wire. As far as wireless, forget it. With stong signals at the nodes. I've speed checked my provider switch and get upto 56 Mbs download. Checking it through the WAP nodes it drops below 36 Mbs.

{"reviewTitle":"Poor signal, dropped internet","reviewDescription":"Bought these for our home. We have two units upstairs,  one downstairs.  They worked well for about a year. After that our devices started buffering all the time. The internet would drop for two or three minutes. We contacted our provider. No problems on their end. The \"help\" provided by the company was worthless.  The app does not provide real time status.  The app has no trouble shooting capabilities at all. I think I'll go back to the one unit I had before. Avoid these.Update: after emailing tech support several times I was told to do a factory restart. After doing that the mesh system worked for about ten minutes. It then disconnected from the internet. This was time consuming setting up the network all over again. I'm going back to my netgear.Another update.  After trying all the suggestions from the company to get the units working I was offered a new unit. The offer was made after I told the company I was done with their suggestions.  I had to provide proof of purchase and serial numbers after registration of the product. The company provided a free shipping label from Fed Ex.  When the defective unit is returned my new one will be shipped. It's a good thing I have my old router to use until the new unit arrives. The company's help was not too good, suggesting repairs that had already been tried. You have to jump through a few hoops but they finally decided to make it right. I give two stars because of the disruption I had to deal with.Another update. I received a replacement system. I had bought a new one originally, but got a reconditioned system as a replacement.

{"reviewTitle":"NETWORK ENGINEER SAYS: ONLY READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME IN MONEY.","reviewDescription":"First, let me say that I SELDOM write reviews on products because most of them are opinions. This product DOES NOT work as advertised. I'm a network engineer so I know a few things about mesh networks. I bought this to setup a new network in my mother's home. The setup was fairly simple, but you have to use a phone app to do so. I prefer a computer interface, so this is relative to the users. The resulting performance was poor to say the lease. My mother's home is 1700 sq feet total in a \"L\" shape. No special construction or sound proofing in the walls or anything else to limit the wifi signal. In fact the app has a test to tell you if there is interference and it told me that the setup and operation of the network was \"Perfect\". The speed of use was not! Standing next to the primary node I got the expected speeds, 300 mbs from FIOS. The second node is about 30 feet away on the other side of a wall. With my phone in the second location and before I setup the second node, I was still connected to the primary node and speeds were the same. Connected the second node and my phone automatically connected to it, as expected and without having to do any thing. The speed was cut in half, I got 150 - 160 mbs. Turned off the second node and reconnected to the first node automatically and speed went back to 300 mbs, even though I was standing in the same location of the second node. Connected the third node about 30 feet away down a hallway, clear line of sight. Phone automatically connected to the third node, but the speed went down to 60 mbs (at best).Did the firmware update and went to their site to do some troubleshooting. I walked through all of the steps to fix the speed issues that they had listed on their site. Nothing improved the speed. It actually got slower at the second and third nodes.Got on a live chat and after confirming the speed with the tech that connect with me, he suggested that I run an ethernet cable to the second node to increase the speed. Um, sorry, but that's not why I bought a wifi mesh system. The product claims 5,500 sq feet, I just they only meant for that to be an open warehouse or something. There is alway going to be a little drop off from the primary node to the last node at distance from the primary, but the percentage isn't nearing what I was having. I'm returning this product today and will never purchase another TP-link product in the future. I recommend you stay away from this product.

{"reviewTitle":"STAY FAR AWAY FROM TP LINK DECO!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!","reviewDescription":"I cannot emphasize how important it is to STAY AWAY from TP-Link and ANY Deco router!!I am a Software Engineer with experience in networking, and a monkey could have done a better job at developing the the TP-Link mobile app THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO USE. It is terrible for the reasons below:1.When you experience a power outage, or if the routers are disconnected from their power source at any point while they are active, the decos WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY RECONNECT to the internet. The official advice given on the TP-Link forums is to turn your modems and routers off and on again. This will require you to run all over your house after you experience a power outage and this solution will not always work.Ok, so let's say you have a small house or don't mind doing some cardio immediately following a power outage. However, if this solution doesn't work, you will have to completely reset all the units and set them back up again which forces you to use the phone app. Expect to take a MINIMUM OF 30-60 MINUTES immediately following a power outage because the app is trash and extremely slow and unresponsive to use.This is simply unacceptable - every router on the market today that isn't made by the incompetent fools at TP-Link will be able to reconnect to the internet on its own after losing power.But what if you are only looking to use these as wifi extenders? Theoretically the trash DHCP service that causes the above problem could be avoided then because it's not serving as the main router...WRONG!! And if you know something about networking, you will know that only someone incompetent would design the router so that:2. You can never completely turn off the DHCP service, even when it is being used in 'access point' (wifi extender) mode.This is especially egregious because the TP-Link representative on the forums calls this feature 'Smart DHCP' when it is not 'smart' at all. This means that if you have a different main router, and use these decos as wifi extenders, every time you experience a power outage your Deco will reboot and look for a DHCP server on the network. When it doesn't see one because your main router is still rebooting, it will turn its DHCP server back on EVEN WHEN IT IS STILL IN ACCESS POINT MODE. Your router will then see that there is already a DHCP server run by the Deco on your network and therefore assume there is another gateway, and will not reconnect to the internet.If you don't know what this means - if you experience any sort of power outage or power loss to these units, expect to have to completely reset all routers on your network, and expect to spend at least 30-60 minutes fighting with the TP-Link app to get yourself up and running again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"19 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1626998400000}

{"reviewTitle":"FAST, simple setup, cheap mesh solution","reviewDescription":"After doing a lot of comparison shopping, I ended up settling on the TP-Link Deco S4.  My biggest factors were price, reliability, and range.  I have a three floor 4500 sq\/ft house built in 2003.  The Verizon Fios Gateway router worked, but it suffered considerable slow down as I got to the extremes of the house.  With the new three node Deco S4, I get full speed internet at every floor and extreme.  Previously, I was able to get 100mb\/s maxed out at the router with minimal traffic, but dropped down to 10 mb\/s at the extremes of the house, especially the basement and some bedrooms.  With one of these on each floor (main on middle), I range from 95-120 upload and download (paying for 100) on all three floors depending on time of day.  Interestingly enough, I haven't suffered much dropoff in signal strength with each mesh node as opposed to the main wired unit acting as the router.  I've read countless time that unless I'm using a wired backhaul that there would be signal dropoff at the mesh points, but I haven't witnessed any significant drop.  I also purchased this system as it had ethernet ports for backhaul (if I needed to improve speed) and accesspoint use on each node, but I don't use any other than one at the main router for my Phillips hue bridge.The design is simple and clean.  I was debating on saving $10 and getting the M4 (identical internals), but figured I was already scraping the barrel on price point so may as well get one that wasn't as much of an eye sore.  These are clean, simple, modern, and much better to look at then the Fios provided router.The app is simple and intuitive and makes most of the decisions for you.  It ran me through the setup very easily.  It has parental controls and allows me to prioritize devices as well as setting up a guest network. However, what was most essential to me was the ability to turn off 2.4 or 5ghz signals if I needed to set up a product that only worked on one (usually older products that use 2.4 only).  This app is mostly for people that have basic technical skills, but not full on IT networking knowledge.I chose to replace my Fios router entirely and run ethernet from the Verizon modem (optical network terminal) instead of coax so I didn't have to run the Fios router in bridge mode.  I called Fios tech support and the person switched the feed to ethernet in five minutes.  Now I don't have to rent my router and have much faster internet without relying on bridge mode.  If you aren't comfortable with running ethernet and swapping it out at the ONT, you can use the Fios router and connect the Deco S4 to their router instead.  This also allows you to keep your cable box functionality such as guide and on-demand without a MOCA adapter.  I have no such plans as I'm dropping cable for YoutubeTV.On average, my house has around 40 connected devices from Phillips hue bridge\/bulbs, Ecobee thermostat, Ring products, several Nest and Echo devices, five smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, and laptops.  Don't buy into the hype that you need wifi 6e.  This supports gigabit+ speeds and the dualband is more then enough to maximize efficiency.  In addition, you can add or swap out mesh points to this system at any time from any Deco system (E3, M4, M5, P9, etc.).  You can literally improve on this system in the future if desired.  This was one of the best purchases I've made in a while.Update 2.4.21: I recently switched to 200mb\/s from my ISP (it is the lowest package they offer when only purchasing internet).  With this, I've noticed download speeds at the main router at 270-300 and 300+ upload depending on network traffic.  I have seen more noticeable drop-off at the mesh points with this speed, usually 170-230 download and 200+ upload on my first mesh extension node, and 160-200 download on the one in the basement.  I also have the biggest variance in upload speeds with this one at 45-120 upload, depending on time of day and network traffic.  However this was also the location I had the biggest issue with previous to installing my Deco S4 system.  In general, I am still getting amazing speeds, far exceeding what I'm supposedly paying for, extremely stable at every location of my house including the far extremes of my yard.  I have can rely on blazing fast reliable internet throughout my house and not have to have wired backhaul to achieve it.  However, I can now see why some individuals suffer noticeable drop-off with higher internet speeds at the mesh points.  If you figure the drop-off as a percentage and multiply it times the speed, the difference will be more noticeable at the ghz speeds.  Overall, love this device, how much faster my internet is and how I am not paying my ISP for their outdated routers they try to dish on unknowing consumers.  Best purchase I've made in years.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"129 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1611273600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Finally WiFi that doesn't feel compromised","reviewDescription":"I have Verizon FIOS bundled service, so I have my TV, phone and internet all-in-one.  While I do love FIOS, one of the negatives is that I had to use their bundled Gateway modem\/router because of my TV and phone services.  My house does have a wired ethernet network running thru it, which is great for all my desktop PC's and Home Theater setup, but the FIOS Gateway router's WiFi performance didn't adequately cover my three floor house (the FIOS modem is in my garage, next to my home wired-network box).  To help solve this issue,  I tried using the very well reviewed Netgear EX6200 range extender, but I could never get reliable performance out of it...random drops, slow speeds...it just didn't seem to like working with my FIOS router.In looking for a better solution, my research led me to looking into Mesh networking, especially as these systems (supposedly) would not need to bypass my FIOS modem...it would work with it, just taking over the WiFi functions.  I was apprehensive, so I wanted a cost effective product.  Tp-Link's Deco series have gotten rave reviews and their latest S4-series was actually cheaper than the previous M4-series, so I took the plunge.Getting the Deco S4 up and running is so much simpler than traditional WiFi extenders and boosters...download the TP-Link mobile app, launch it, pick your TP-Link product and it guides you through the whole process.  There were some hiccups during installation, mainly where the app failed in finding the S4 devices on the first pass, but hitting the Try Again button solved the issue.  The S4 router unit (all three are identical) simply plugs into any open port on the back of the FIOS modem.  Once the Mesh network is setup on this S4 router, you can now easily add the other units throughout your home using the app.  The app has a lot of functionality...you can set-up usage profiles, \"Blacklist\" devices from using your network, monitor network health and utilization, etc.  Two other benefits with the S4 Deco units are that each includes two auto-sensing Gigabit ethernet ports (useful for network switches\/hubs or plugging in non-WiFi devices, etc.) and that they are compatible with all TP-Link WiFi devices, so expansion and upgrades are easy.Coverage is excellent.  The big benefit to a Mesh network is that all the S4 units are essentially operating as one...so, as you move throughout your house (or even outside!), your devices simply pick-up the strongest signal from the best available S4 router.  You don't need to manually switch from network to network like you would with a traditional WiFi extender.  Speeds are surprisingly fast.  I only have FIOS 100\/100 service, but I am getting WiFi speeds of 100+ Mbps on my ground and third floors (both S4 units are wired) and almost a full 80 Mbps on my second floor with a non-wired S4 unit.  Outside on my back deck, speed drops to \"only\" 60 Mbps...incredible!  I spent about 4 hours stress testing the network and found it to be rock solid...very consistent and dependable WiFi performance.If there were two things I'd list as negatives, they would be the lack of a web-based network tool\/programmer (everything has to be done on the mobile app) and that there was a way to identify\/isolate usage between the 2.4 and 5.0 bands.This is a long review, but to sum it up, the Deco S4 is a great product.  It's simple to set-up, works with your existing modem (a HUGE plus for Verizon FIOS users), doesn't act like a bottleneck and offers a huge area of coverage.  And there's the very nice price.  I finally feel like I'm getting all the WiFi I'm supposed to be getting!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"293 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1592006400000}

Set up your main unit first by hooking it to your main router, then set up each successive pod to connect to the main one. You can name them (Living Room, Basement, Garage, you get the idea). Easy peasey. Nothing about this entire setup, or use, or app, or anything, is difficult. Love the Deco!I love the app. I can see who all is connected, what devices (So-and-so's Samsung Galaxy, X-Box, Chromebook, etc), how much activity\/streaming each connection is using. I can disconnect any of these connected devices if I want to, I can change the WiFi password any time I want to very easily from the phone app too.

From opening it up to testing the internet, it took all about 3 minutes each unit (I got the 3-pack). The instructions couldn't be any clearer and easier. Just install the app while you still got internet and you're set.The three units are set up around a 4 bed, 3500 square ft single story home, total property has 0.8 acres. The first unit is set up next to the modem, one unit set up in the kitchen, and one unit in the detached guest room. Previously, my download speeds in my room, which is on the other side of the house from the room with the router, was about 3-5 Mbps on good days, online gaming was not an option and videos would take a quality hit. Now, I am getting easily 10-12 Mbps, and anywhere between 2-4x the speeds. I was blown away when I first saw it, I couldn't believe that my internet could achieve these speeds.The range is now covering all the way from the mailbox at the start of our very long driveway, which is almost 200 feet from the router. I can watch videos on my phone anywhere on my property now.I'd almost say I want to get more, but these things work so well I don't need any!

{"reviewTitle":"Finally, Wifi in the garage","reviewDescription":"So first let me start by saying, I'm comfortable working with computers.  However I'm not tech savoy and when it comes to networks, routers, modems, extenders, cables, etc....I'm definitely a green horn.  With that, I've had issues for years getting a good signal into our dethatched garage.  I would get spotty service at best, and most of the time just concede to the fact if I was in the garage I'd just run off 4\/5G.  Our router is on one side of the house, and the garage is on the complete opposite side of the house.  I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good 225\u2019-250\u2019 as the crow flies from the router to the area in the garage I was having issues with.  However there is a lot of interior walls, doors, objects, a set of stairs, and two exterior walls (one brick, one hardy plank) the Wifi signal has to travel through.  I tried a few of the cheap extenders and had zero luck with them.  A few months back I heard about a mesh system and looked into it.  After plenty of research and asking around I decided to pull the trigger.  I\u2019m glad I did!!!First, the setup wasn\u2019t hard, however I did encounter a few issues that the app was not helpful on at all.  A quick google search had me back in the right direction.  One issue was that it could not \u201cacquire my internet settings.\u201d  It kept saying the ether net cable may have been plugged into the wrong port on the router.  However the port I had it plugged in, provided internet service to every laptop I plugged into it.  I finally moved the ether net cable from port 1 on the TP Link to port 3 on the TP Link and it gave me the solid white, successfully connected and ready to go status, within seconds.  However the setup in the app was now telling me there was no ether net cable connected to the TP Link.  My phone showed to be connected to the TP Link and I was getting speeds of 500+Mbps.  So I just skipped past that \u201cerror\/warning\u201d and proceeded forward.  I then connected the other two satellite TP Links with absolutely no issue at all.  I now have full signal in my garage and get about 175-200Mbps service out there.  An inadvertent side effect of the mesh system is, we get amazing service on our back patio now as well.  Before it was very weak and would come and go at times.All in all, I am very pleased with the results and would highly suggest this setup to anyone needing\/wanting to extend there signal over a greater distance than your current router can manage.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1716940800000}

I got as far as the configuration only being done by phone app to know this is a fluff product.  When you get to the web interface, you'll learn there's less there to configure.  So this device is supposed to be high power to connect 200+ devices -- yet it won't even let you disable the DHCP service... unless you put it in AP mode where you lose any router capabilities.  I didn't even get to see the QoS or Parental Control features.  But I'd estimate that they too would be fluff if they exist at all.  This made me mad because I wrote to TP-Link sales and asked for pre-sales help.  Black hole.  Now I've got to go through a $500 return\/credit process to buy something that's not a cute fashion statement.  I'm going to venture to say that if you need to connect 200+ devices, you're going to need customization like basic network things such as DHCP, DNS, QoS, Routing, and publishing services.

{"reviewTitle":"Absolutely amazing. Fixed my security cameras live streaming.","reviewDescription":"Well, I've went back and forth for about a year now about setting up a mesh network in my home.  Currently I run 3, so this would in a sense replace one. I like keeping certain aspects separate... security cameras, and system are on a dedicated network. Tvs, computers, laptops, tablets, and cell phones are on one, and then I start sounding like I have more money than I really do, so I'll just stop there... I decided to buy a mesh network to replace my security system network because I was having tons of issues with my outside security cameras having horrible signal strength which made it pretty much useless. Before this, I bought a CPE Booster, and honestly I had and have zero idea what exactly I was doing, needed to do, or was doing wrong. Long story short, I worked alot of Overtime, and literally within 5 minutes of my check hitting my bank account, I had this ordered. It was SAME DAY DELIVERY.... WOW. Unfortunately I was working several hours away at a prison job that is going so bad, you would think it was being performed in a prison..... wait... it was. After the extensively long work week, and driving several hours home, after working 10 hours that day already, all I wanted to do when I got home, was get this bad boy setup and configured... so the next morning when I woke up (lol), I immediately got to work... the app is extremely seamless to use. Theres not very much that I'd change. Setup was very intuitive and straightforward. I bought the 3 pack because honestly, a 2 pack would have worked for my small house, but I needed to get the signal outside to my garage that is anything but right next to my closest wall. I bought the 3 pack hoping I could intact put one of the units on the closest wall to the garage to get adequate signal. Thats exactly what happened,, and its been working great.. i have although noticed that my front door camera seems to have randomly dropped off of the client list on the app. Upon checking the camera. I find that its not connected. This has only happened once that was without a reasonable explanation... hopefully it was an anomaly.  This has been perfect. Literally perfect. My cameras stream comes up within a couple seconds, and I can talk clearly to the person on the other side. Honestly, we are looking to be upgrading our home within the next year, and I can't wait to outfit it with another tplink mesh system... for the price point, you cannot go wrong. I want to add that I was in the corporate  I.T. industry for 8 years... so quality in technology is a huge part of my decision processes when choosing what to buy.

My grandpa and I live in a 10,000 square foot house. Our original router was also a TP Link, but very outdated and is located on one side of the house, so we had to purchase an extender. Unfortunately, the extender didn\u2019t reach the bedroom as much as we had hoped and lot of our smart devices were going in and out of the signal. I had heard a lot about these mesh systems especially while going to college and taking a course on the internet. It always fascinated me that these devices can create a near seamless connection across the whole house. So we ended up purchasing the latest model which is Deco S4 at the time of this review. I had previously opt\u2019ed for Deco M3, but didn\u2019t find much reviews for it and it seemed Spectrum modems may have difficulties with it, hence that is why we opt\u2019ed for Deco S4. The out of the box experience was easy to understand. I loved the fact that these are all router\/node devices so you could technically remove one from your own house and give it to a family member to put in their\u2019s for their modem. We replaced our original router with the first Deco out of the box, placed another in my grandpa\u2019s bedroom which is another corner of the house, and also in the kitchen - the opposite side of the house near our backyard patio. App setup was super convenient and pair the two devices as nodes\/extenders had no problems at all. I love that this router combines the 2.4G\/5G under the same network in the settings, we used to have two separate networks on our old router. After doing tests, our router was finally giving us fast speeds we hadn\u2019t expected - Our outdated router was giving about 80mb\/s when next to the router and 12mb\/s at the furthest part of the house - the backyard next to the kitchen on the opposite side of the house. Now, we are seeing around 200mb\/s next to extenders\/nodes and 60mb\/s in the backyard. I also love that there is a feature within the app to program the Decos to go into \u201cNight Mode\u201d to shut off the light on top of the router itself at a set time of the night and turn on again in the morning or completely turn off the router light. There may be some needs for improvement on how the Deco filters out content on parental controls in the app. Not that we use them, but my curious it\u2019s to understand how it can block explicit materials or create certain restrictions for kids may be lacking or I may need to read more into it - Turning on the preset content filters didn\u2019t seem to do anything, I would actually have to type all the websites that want to be blocked on our network into the \u201cfilter website\u201d section of the app. Overall it is great, especially that the app can inform us when new devices join our network as we\u2019ve had neighbors try to access our internet, haha. Looking forward to continue using this setup and being in our backyard more often!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1613174400000}

This will allow you to fill dead spots in the WiFi with one more of these transmitters. Further, you can walk around the house and these units will negotiate with your device and each other to keep you connected.Note: You'll have to have a smart device with Wifi and Bluetooth to set these up. But if you have any tech knowledge at all, you'll have no problem.  I did find the app a bit confusing though. There are various blinking and color patterns in the top status light, and I couldn't decide if the color was blue or white. Minor things. BUT the point is, once you get the network set up, if you find a dead spot, just add another unit and it's filled.  Do note that these work by having a 'head' unit that is connected to the internet and the others are 'repeaters'. They self-organize to do this. They receive on one frequency and store and repeat the data out on another frequency. If the data goes through several of these on the way to your device, you might notice a lag, especially if you doing something where you would notice it, like a wifi connected phone call.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1719273600000}

As a \u201cmesh\u201d network should.  Unfortunately that was an incorrect assumption.  These units don\u2019t talk to each other.  They only talk to one \u201cmaster\u201d.  And the master has to be connected to the physical network cable.  If your physical network drop is at one end of a large building, you don\u2019t want this solution.  The farthest satellite unit wants to only talk to the master and not the intermediary satellite unit in the middle.  So much for \u201cmesh\u201d network.The parental control features are completely worthless.  They try to enforce rules by mac address of a device.  That assumes that devices don\u2019t change mac addresses.  All modern devices constantly change mac addresses for security and privacy reasons.  This renders parental control on these Decos completely useless.  Deco forums are full of users complaining about this for years.

But you can't run the setup (i.e., you can't use the mesh system), if you don't provide an email address. And why, you ask?

{"reviewTitle":"Caused intermittent connection disconnect","reviewDescription":"I bought this deco mesh s5 system based on great reviews and good price.  It worked for about a month and a half that the WiFi coverage did extend with good wifi signal but once a week there was a slowness or disconnect that I had to restart the modem.  That was ok though until all the sudden I got connection disconnect few times a day. I called Comcast Xfinity to restart modems every time and even came by my house to diagnose the issue.  They replaced optical connectors , ran line checks and assured me from modem side there was no problem .I was skeptical though so I  replaced the own modem with top of the line Comcast modem and wifi,put it in bridge mode and connect it to this to link mesh router.  It did not help.  I feel very frustrated and felt like it was Comcast issue.  Finally Comcast rep told me it gotta be my tplink mesh router issue and suggested me for one last time to replace it with either eero mesh or neatgear mesh which are more expensive but more reliable.I was still skeptical but gave it a try.  I ordered eero  mesh from amazon.  Guess what? It has been working like a champ !!! Strong , Better coverage and no disconnects so far ( 5 weeks now).My lesson always go the better brand usually more expensive than settle with cheap ones and potentially deal with headaches.Brw I could not return  to link mesh router as Amazon said too late.  I think it will dump it rather than resale or give it to somebody elseThat is my personal experience with this tplink mesh router.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1628985600000}

I have a 1 gbps internet connection from Spectrum via cable modem. Using one of the Deco units as a router, the line speeds out of the gigabit ports never exceeded 500mbps. I had Spectrum out to check the line and I'm getting 1.1gbps out of the modem. A laptop connected directly to the modem gets 1.1gbps. I contacted TP-Link tech support on multiple occasions and they asked the same questions over and over, suggested the same fixes multiple times, and asked for screenshots and configurations I had already submitted more than once.

{"reviewTitle":"Great product, but has some issues","reviewDescription":"*** 1 Year Review Update ***I decided to keep the system. After a few firmware updates and once TP-Link fixed the AP only mode such that the main and guest networks are truly separated I switched over from using it as a router to an AP solution. It has worked flawlessly since and without any performance degradation's.I still do not like the app-centric approach for \"management\" (cannot call it that honestly); insight would probably be more appropriate. But, I will be moving in the future to an enterprise grade solution (this solution purchase has just been a stop-gap until that time and I finalize my network architecture). For the average home consumer that is not very tech-savvy (which is the audience this product really targets) it is overall very simple to get up and running with very few issues, especially at this price point.I have submitted over a dozen feature requests to TP-Link and almost all of them have been discarded by the manufacturer (but at least acknowledged); of the ones that were \"accepted\" they were very trivial.As of today, Sep 21 20201, the system via the app is no longer able to check for updates (it receives an error). I believe this is not due to the units themselves but instead TP-Link's update portal that the units use to check for updates. Checking on the main site reveals an update published on July 15 2021 (S4 2.0_en_1.5.0 Build 20210607 Rel. 56436_US_EU_AU_JP_up.bin) that is available which is one update newer than my currently applied firmware published on September 30 2020 (S4 2.0_en_1.4.3 Build 20200918 Rel. 77820_US_EU_AU_JP_up.bin). Looks like I will have to update the units manually using the download links provided by TP-Link and by logging into the web UI (note: each unit will have its own web UI but one - the master - will show a different one by showing you the topology of the mesh; a manual firmward update can be applied using that unit).= SummaryOverall this is a great product.  It definitely addresses the WiFi coverage in our new home.  It has only been a few days since I set them up.  However, a star in my rating had to be knocked off which will become evident shortly.  I may update this review after some more time has passed.  But it is currently appearing I might be returning this.I operate these in access point mode and not router mode.  I have a better router than what these units provide and do not need double NAT'ing on my house wide network.  That, and, I will be replacing the house wide router with a substantially better one anyway in the coming months.This review, however, covers my utilization and experience in both modes.  Also note that I am an IT professional and deal with network infrastructure (along with many other things) day to day for over 20 years.In this review the term \u201csatellite\u201d is used to denote a Deco unit that is not the main Deco unit.I have intentionally saved the worst points of my review as the last section.= Topology SetupI have fiber to the premise gateway, still with the gateways\u2019 Wi-Fi fully enabled on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands.  My home is over 2,650 sqft, single story, built this year, with gigabit Cat5e cables to each room the Deco S4 units are situated.  All Deco units use the Ethernet backhaul.  All Cat5e runs and cables have been tested to support gigabit speeds point-to-point (with of course the obligatory TCP\/IP overhead).  Placement wise each of the Deco units are almost in a straight line, a function of my floor plan and where I need Wi-Fi coverage the most.  Relative distances between Deco units:- 25 linear feet between first satellite and second, main Deco unit with one interior door between.  This I refer to as satellite 1.- 45 linear feet between second satellite and main Deco unit with 3 interior only walls between.  This I refer to as satellite 2.= PerformanceThe throughput performance on these is fantastic, especially at the price point.  I have fiber gigabit Internet service.  I use speedtest.net for all bench marks.  I get the following throughput on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (US), stock firmware, latest software and security patches.  Distance is always the distance between my test device and a specific Deco unit and with line of sight between the test device and the target Deco unit.| Deco  | Distance | Downstream | Upstream |Satellite 1 | 1 ft  | 344  | 392  |Main  | 1 ft  | 446  | 389  |Satellite 2 | 1 ft  | 460  | 392  |Satellite 1 | 3 ft  | 279  | 422  |Main  | 3 ft  | 485  | 409  |Satellite 2 | 3 ft  | 392  | 383  |Satellite 1 | 6 ft  | 355  | 350  |Main  | 6 ft  | 477  | 390  |Satellite 2 | 6 ft  | 483  | 461  |Satellite 1 | 9 ft  | 361  | 475  |Main  | 9 ft  | 482  | 374  |Satellite 2 | 9 ft  | 477  | 466  |Satellite 1 | 12 ft  | 385  | 460  |Main  | 12 ft  | 451  | 458  |Satellite 2 | 12 ft  | 501  | 528  |Satellite 1 | 15 ft  | 445  | 389  |Main  | 15 ft  | 461  | 453  |Satellite 2 | 15 ft  | 500  | 432  |A 15 foot distance between a Deco unit and a connected device is most likely acceptable considering average housing room sizes.  However, in my house floor plan, I have an easy 25 foot line of sight from the main Deco unit to where I did a test.  Results came in as 251 Mbps downstream and 117 Mbps upstream.  Still, highly acceptable.  At my maximum floor plan range to that same Deco unit and still maintaining line of sight of 33 feet I wind up getting an unexpectedly impressive 493 Mbps downstream and 388 Mbps upstream.  While I cannot check in the app to see specifically which Deco unit my test device was connected to due to either app or overall product system issues, I am left with only one avenue of explanation: the Deco system has successfully performed link aggregation for my test device. If, in the first place, I am correct in this very poor conclusion due to the lack of data, then, this is indeed impressive and can very well be THE single most discriminator in overall product performance vs issues vs cost.I realize these performance tests are not representative of real world scenarios.  Fact is, most people do not go to such lengths to test their products and relevant environments, much less describe their environments.When a little more time goes by I will update this review with more realistic real world performance tests in terms of longer distances and obstructions.= The GoodI do not need parental controls, so, access point mode removes that for me, thankfully.  Because I operate this in access point mode not having quality of service on the Deco's is just fine as is not having DHCP handled by the Deco's.  Again, my current infrastructure handles all of these elegantly and more than sufficiently.In order to get a proper pass off while going from one end of the house to the other I had to enable fast roaming.  Without enabling this resulting in unbearably long hand offs from one unit to the other based on proximity to units.  The net result of this was severe performance degradation.  This seems to work without issue and solved the hand off issue.The app is straightforward to use and easy to understand, ranging from initial installation to adding additional Deco's to day to day activities.  The app also provides notifications of new devices when they are added to \/ detected on the network (both in router and access point modes).As expected you can define a main Wi-Fi network and a guest network.  This is standard fare.  You can select if you want both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands active or be more selective.  Again, this is standard fare.You can rename connected devices in the app.  Useful especially when connected devices do not allow you to set their DHCP host name.  The units try to profile a connected device type (e.g., Phone, PC, etc) in which the result of this is also easily accessible via the app.  But, when it cannot or gets it wrong you can override this in the app, very useful feature indeed.  The app will also show you basic information such as allocated IP address, MAC address (wish it was in colon delimited notation and not hypen as the former is the standard representation for MAC addresses), connection type (main or guest network and frequency band) and which Deco unit the device is currently linked to.Unfortunately you cannot get the same level of information regarding devices connected to the guest network.  Having visibility into this is just as important to give you another data point in your connected IoT devices.  Oh, yeah, I suppose that people visiting your home is good too.  Regardless, it is utterly unclear whether or not connected devices on the guest network have visibility to one another (e.g., can see each other), and much less have any reach into the main Wi-Fi or rest of your network.  At a minimum, the default of any guest Wi-Fi network should be nothing can see anything else on the guest Wi-Fi , cannot see the main Wi-Fi, cannot see the rest of your network and can only see the Internet.Any Deco unit can serve as the main.  In router mode, this means that the main unit has routing capabilities.  Likewise, a different unit can be specified as the main via the app.= The BadThere is no white listing of devices, only a black list.  Security best practice is white listing devices that are authorized for access.  Having only a black list is unacceptable.  It is on this ground alone these units may very well be returned.  It escapes me why TP-Link would fail to include the ability to white list.  Since this product seems to be targeted to the less network technologically bound than myself I can understand why only a black list is available (to prevent the less technologically adept folks from effectively locking themselves out).  However, not including a white list capability does an injustice to everyone and is, security wise, shameful and puts consumers\u2019 home networks at additional unnecessary risk of exploitation.  Yes, using a white list to winds up meaning having to go through a little more trouble to allow a new device onto the network.  For me, and every other IT security professional out there, white listing is an essential tool in the security posture arsenal and is one that should never be omitted.The only firmware release is the initial firmware release: Deco S4(US)_V2_191023 from December 25, 2019 (TP-Link support site).  In the Deco app it reports no new updates for the firmware with a current version of 1.1.5 Build 20191023 Rel. 67285.  Unzipping the firmware release on the support site shows the same firmware version as the app shows (specifically: S4 2.0_en_1.1.5 Build 20191023 Rel. 67285_US_EU_AU_JP_up.bin).  Half a year later I would expect at least an additional firmware release.  While not having any could be a good thing, generally, this is never the case.  There are always bugs and vulnerabilities in every piece of software, and, firmware is no exception.  Clearly a firmware update is needed at least to add a white list feature.There is a barely usable web UI for the Deco's beyond that of just using the Deco app.  I have found a landing page for each Deco connected to my router via the IP assigned to each.  All UI's require authentication.  The UI is different depending on which Deco you connect to.  The Deco's that are not the main Deco provide the following features: update the firmware, pull the system log or reboot.  Accessing the system log allows you to save it, email it or clear it.  In contrast, connecting to the UI for the main Deco yields a subset of the features compared to the app but adds visibility into the units' CPU and memory usage.  Said subset of features are mainly read only via the interface, again, not very useful.  Thus there is no real point in using anything but the app if one is looking for access to more robust features.Connected device presence status (online \/ offline) is wholly inaccurate as reported by the app.  The only connected devices that are accurately reported for presence are those that have not left the Wi-Fi range and not power cycled.  For example, all of my Fire TV sticks show as being online but all mobile devices that left the Wi-Fi range now show as offline despite being back within Wi-Fi range of the units for several hours.  Even manually refreshing the view still yields in the app reporting these same mobile devices as being offline.  More testing still needs to be performed, but, there is no reason why the device list status page in the app is this inaccurate.Bandwidth utilization by connected device in the device list is great to have.  The only problem is that it too is completely inaccurate to the same degree as mentioned previously regarding connected device presence status.  For those devices that actually show as being online the bandwidth utilization shown in this same view is always 0Kbps up and downstream.  Since installation of the units I have yet to see this populated and have seen, once, and only once, a single connected device bandwidth utilization being reported if I select the said device in the list.There is no ability to perform a wireless site survey.There is no ability to use 802.11x.From a network management perspective there is no way to rename a specific Deco in terms of the host name that it will present to the rest of your network.  All units show up simply as \"deco-S4\" from DHCP.  Not useful.There is no way to designate the guest network LAN IP address range.= The UglyInitial set up was in router mode, the default.  Setup of main and satellite 1 Deco\u2019s went flawlessly and took but a few minutes per.  Meanwhile, satellite 2 refuses to join the mesh in router mode and always leaves me staring at a red blinking light.  The app reports \u201cUnable to add these Decos\u201d and \u201cMove these Decos closer to a Deco that you\u2019ve already set up, then tap TRY AGAIN.\u201d  Why would anyone have to move a Deco unit closer to another?  They have an Ethernet backhaul, and by definition, can communicate with each other!Meanwhile, the engineer within me takes a different stance: while all Deco units indeed have a gigabit Ethernet backhaul each unit must be able to verify a minimal Wi-Fi signal level from its closest neighbor.  And, since I am a customer facing type of person that voice inside of me would scream: in order to assure the best possible experience please ensure all Deco units have no physical obstructions between them and that none are surrounded by things that can block radio frequencies such as metal and concrete.Point is, I have yet to get all three Deco units online in router mode at all.  It is NOT an option to bring any units closer together.  Satellite 2 Deco has been power cycled and reset (via the reset button on the bottom of the unit) half a dozen times per with precisely the same results.Now, putting the system into access point mode results in a perfectly usable system without any of these problems.  Wish I knew why.  Regardless, this is a telltale sign to me of poor engineering.  Of course, switching system modes from router to access point (or vice versa) results in the system rebooting all Deco\u2019s.  The majority of most modern residential Wi-Fi capable routers do not require a reboot when making this change.This is so problematic that it is cause, alone, for me to return the product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"296 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1593561600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Solid solution for multi level home","reviewDescription":"This is a nice solution for mesh wifi.  However non technical users may have some difficulty setting this up unless they follow the directions very closely.  Also you should search the web for the deco S4 product and review the information found there as well before buying.  I actually set up my 3 S4 Deco mesh in access point mode.  To do that I needed to first run through the app as if I were connecting the first deco to my DSL router but I did not, then I accessed the settings (under the More button on the bottom of the app) then the Advanced for the first deco and set the Operating mode to Access Point.  After that setting up the other 2 was a breeze.  as they automatically configured.  The instructions from the app advise you to upgrade firmware for each deco if used as an accesspoint.  The app prompts were easy to follow and this upgrade was easy to do.  Next was the placement moment.  I decided to connect my \"Main Deco\" (this is what the first one is named) through a ethernet cable from my DSL modem to another switch in my living room and then connected the deco to that gigabit switch.  This worked great.  Then I tried to connect the other two deco's using a ethernet powerline adapter however this did not work so well, at first I thought there was a problem but after experimentation I found that the best way to use these as access points is to direct wire the first deco and then use the other two wirelessly.  That took off immediately and all mesh points worked fine.  Wifi signal expectations.  Your Deco that is direct connected to the DSL modem\/router (in access point mode) will pull the same speed as your home wired connection (in my case about 67mb)  the other wirelessly connected decos will pull in the High 30mb-45mb so you will expect to see about a 40% loss of bandwidth connecting as I did.  However the wireless connected decos deliver a solid signal and I can still browse, and stream with multiple computers\/ipads\/TV's with no issue.  Also I have ring cameras and their signal improved after the installation of these deco units.  At first you may find many components connecting to your \"main deco\" but that seems to be related to the order that you power up the units.  After about a day all my wifi connected components sought out the deco closest to them and connected to the mesh there.  This is one nice feature about the app, it is easy to see what devices are connected to each deco.  If you accidentally \/(or on purpose) switch off the mesh feature for a device it will stay on the deco it is currently on.  I thought I was going to have to do that but it does not seem to be an issue.  I am considering running a wire to the remote units if at some point I increase my service from the 70mb it is currently at but at present everything is working fine.Regarding tech support,  I did access the live chat of the tech support but they primarily feed you the same answers that you can get off the web or by reading the support pages.  So I would not rate them too high, maybe 6 out of 10 for service.  But they did respond and they did attempt to answer my questions.Another small point but one I like is that the LED's that show the unit state are not overly bright but they are easy to see and you can easily tell the state of the unit (yellow during reboot, Red if there is an issue, or Red blinks a few times before going to white which means its all good!) and are not distracting in anyway.The app could be a bit better, there are some not so intuitive points to it and you will need spend some time figuring it out.Overall I am quite happy with my purchase.  Now I will run them for a while and if any significant discoveries pop up I will update this review.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1616112000000}

This deco system covers my entire 2 story house out to my garage. BUT I only get my full 100mbps when I\u2019m in the same area as my base router. My connected routers upstairs only get me about 55-60. I still have a \u201cdead zone\u201d in my son\u2019s room where it is down to like 40mbps. With that said, I\u2019ve tried multiple systems under $200 and this one is the best.2. If you are are the type of person that needs tech support to walk you through set-up, Tp-Link products are not for you. There tech support is non-existent. You will never talk to someone that can actually help. The only time I ever called this line a guy told me it was my fault it wasn\u2019t working and the product was fine. If you aren\u2019t comfortable setting this up by yourself, don\u2019t get it.3. Red Light Problem Solved: I had some major issues connecting my third router with the base. I finally decided to manually reset all 3, delete the network, and start over again with the defective router as my base. Fixed all of my issues. If you are having problems connecting one, I suggest you do the same. ALSO, be patient. Sometimes I would get red lights that after 30secs or so would turn blue and be working.All in all, good product for the money.

{"reviewTitle":"Frustrating to Setup and Administer","reviewDescription":"The lack of a full-featured web interface makes upgrading from one mesh network to this one frustrating at best.  At first, the app is easy to use until you want to do real administration.  I was replacing a Nighthawk mesh network and wanted this to be a drop-in replacement.  Three hours later, I was still futzing with the administration.Adding the satellites could have been more intuitive.  Instead of saying, \"hey, I see another Deco that's not on the network yet, do you want to include it?\" you have to know to plug it in then find some part of the app that lets you press a plus sign and then conduct your search.  For the average user, who would think you just plug them all in and they'll all find each other, the instructions should be clearer (or the app smarter).The lack of a main router with an Internet\/WAN vs. LAN port is confusing at first, but the software seems to figure it out from ports 1 & 2 on each tower (the one that's plugged into a router that gets to the Internet must be the WAN connection).Annoying also is the light in each tower is visible from the top only.  I couldn't tell what its disposition was having it on a high shelf.Finally, and the biggest reason for returning the pack of three, is the fact that I could not get the router to allow connections from my wired LAN back to devices on the wireless LAN.  I have various devices (printers, other computers, etc.).  I use a static IP for the router, and I have a static route on my firewall\/router to allow  routing from wired to wireless.  This has worked with all my wireless routers, but there was no setting on the Deco administration that would allow (or stop blocking) that communication.I stopped troubleshooting it after a few hours.  I did not call TP-Link support, as I've had poor experience with them in the past.  Online forums didn't have an answer.  I simply gave up and plugged my Nighthawk back in.I recommend this, however, for folks who have simple setups (like a cable modem whose only client is the Deco network).  I do not recommend it for folks who have more advanced networking with multiple subnets, and need a web-based administration interface rather than futzing with some mobile app.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670457600000}

I have one in the office which is the hub and wired and the second is in the den wired. The third is at the other end of the house in the laundry room which picks it up wirelessly and repeats it. Eventually I plan to run a wire to the third unit through the attic. But normally at the end of the house the signal is very weak and sometimes zero. Now the signal is 100% throughout the house and you can walk from one end of the house to the den in the kitchen and get the full speed which I have a 1 gig connection. My phone is only capable apparently of 555 megabytes but I get that full amount. The wired connection I get the full 1 gig speed to my computer. So far they have been fairly flawless I've had to reboot it one time for some unknown reason. And when I use the function where it optimizes the wireless network that third unit in the laundry room will not come back online unless I unplug it and plug it back in. Some kind of bug in the software I guess. But it's pretty neat you can walk anywhere in the house or even outside and it seamlessly switches between the units. They do seem sometimes a bit slow to switch especially if you're in between a unit such as I am when I'm sitting on the carport. I'm between the office unit and the laundry room unit. Sometimes they it doesn't want to switch and then I lose total connection. But for the price I'm very happy with the unit. Much better than spending three or $400 and I don't know if those are any better. The switching between the units could be improved but it's pretty darn good.

{"reviewTitle":"Works great most of the time, app needs major improvement","reviewDescription":"UPDATE 5\/5\/2021 - After some additional Spectrum service calls and more time with the Deco, I can upgrade this review from 2 to 4 stars. The regular intermittent internet outages have largely discontinued, occurring only about once every 60 days. Also, speed figures are now solid at a consistent 230Mbps. While the app still leaves a lot to be desired, I have concluded that a lot of our previous issues were related to Spectrum or their modem. Therefore while I can\u2019t give the Deco 5 stars, if they updated their app it would be more like 4.75.\u2014When it works, it\u2019s fine. Not great, just fine. The wifi is on, the kids can stream as much video as they want while their parents use Webex and Zoom. But when it fails, it\u2019s super annoying. And this happens several times a week. After ruling out Spectrum as the problem, I\u2019ve started considering a different solution.I purchased the 3-piece mesh Deco system to replace a 5-year old OnHub Google router that was having trouble getting the signal to all corners of our new house. For wide-area signal strength it\u2019s great. But when there\u2019s a great signal but no internet, it\u2019s bupkis.Now the Google router has been turned back on so that my wife work from home and do video calls without weekly interruption of the wifi signal that always seem to happen in the middle of a call. And the rest of the house who\u2019s only using the wifi to stream kids shows can simply wait the several minutes it takes to come back on. No need to reset, I learned the hard way that if you just wait, it will come back on.Less important to me but also very troublesome is that the Deco will show vastly different speed signals (according to Speedtest.net) that swing wildly from minute to minute anywhere from 70Mbps to 140Mbps (see photos). But during the same time, the Google router shows a solid 200Mbps every time. I don\u2019t particularly care what the speed number is because I haven\u2019t suffered any ill-effects, but this indicates to me that the outlook for future reliability is grim.Finally, the Deco iOs app is poor. Testing the speed within the app at the same time as Speedtest.net results in nonsensical figures (6Mbps down, 66Mbps up). And forget about attempting to connect to the system to fix these weekly connection problems, it won\u2019t even connect most of the time. And when you do finally connect, there\u2019s no way to find out what is wrong or even attempt a fix. There are also no automatic system updates like with the Google, you have to do it manually and usually lose the wifi during the entire update. Not good.If I had it to do all over again.

{"reviewTitle":"So flawed I actually had time to return it","reviewDescription":"I purchased the TP link deco whole home mesh Wi-Fi system based on a recommendation from Wirecutter on the New York Times website. They recommended it as the budget solution to weak Wi-Fi signals in your home.I've had the system for four days. In those four days I spent a total of 12 hours trying to get it to work for longer than 10 hours. I've been unsuccessful in that effort.The deco system sporadically cuts itself off from my router, leaving me with no Wi-Fi signal. And I don't have more time to dedicate to finding out exactly what the problem is. I did contact the company\u2019s tech support and they offered to help me via e-mail. The turn around for questions and answers is 24 to 48 hours. Again I don't have time to spend precious hours going back and forth. I feel the system should be more automated and robust with its User Interface than it is currently. (Yes, I updated the latest firmware updates from the company.What is my skill level? I am a former IT coordinator for a small company and know my way around windows and apple. I am currently using windows 11 and a fifth generation IPad Air with iOS version 15.7. I've been running cellular based Wi-Fi routers for eight years. This is my first defeat in my home network. incidentally I used the IPad to download the TP link app that runs the deco system. Because of issues with connecting the deco system to my Netgear Ethernet port I had to use two different email addresses to download the deco app two different times under two different account names. Even that did not solve the issue.The AC 1200 deco S4 system cost about $120 through Amazon. It's not a lot of money for a whole home mesh system. I bought the system that has one main base station and two satellite stations as the company calls them. I was able to successfully connect the system numerous times and get it operating properly. But for unknown reasons the satellite stations would drop their connection from the base station. Reconfiguring, rebooting, reconnecting, and everything else I could think of did not stabilize the platform. I feared that after the Amazon return window closed that I would be stuck with a system that would be unstable over the long term. And I don't have unlimited time to figure get out. I also read many of the more detailed customer reviews on Amazon about the system. Apparently Amazon has pooled all the TP link products together under one massive thread with 24,000 customer reviews so I was unable to find exactly what my problem was.I agree with the New York Times review that this is a budget system in terms of dollars but in terms of your time it's a massive expenditure.I'm giving the product five stars because the flaws in the system are so extensive that they became apparent very quickly and are allowing me to return the product before I'm stuck with three little plastic boat anchors.TP-Link challenge: send me three new little boat anchors, help me stabilize the platform and I\u2019ll revise this review to one star where no one will read it, and I\u2019ll throw in the 20 million user errors that I no doubt made.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"60 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666569600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Complete coverage and more yard coverage.","reviewDescription":"New 2800sq foot house had dead spots all over even only being a ranch. Never had this problem did a lot of research on very high end routers and the best solution seemed to be a mesh system.This was the only high quality fair priced option.It works amazing! Even just 2 routers would of been great but all 3 just makes it easy better even in the yard front back driveway I get WiFi! Which is huge because we have little to no cell signal here! It solved all the issues TVs upstairs stream much faster now. It allows you to easily prioritize devices. It shows what devices are using for bandwidth. It switches you to whatever router is nearest seamlessly without messing with downloads or streams all automatically you won\u2019t even notice. You can see it if u monitor the deco app. My only minor issue is the main router has the best band width. I kind of tapers off to the rest but with 200Mbs download the last furthest router still has more than enough to stream on multiple devices. I would suggest connecting the 1st router to the 2nd via Ethernet cable if possible. It will assure full speed is transmitted from those routers and with the 2nd bing hardliners the 3rd will be that much faster. Our 1st main router is in basement by modem. So the 2 upstairs loose a bit through the thick ceiling. If they were all on same floor it would work they use dual band to transmit. Still no issues at all it would be perfect if I connected 2 of them via cat 6 cable but it really does not matter I still get over 90Mbs download off upstairs routers and even like 25 in the yard. If I walk way to the back of the yard it drips to like 3Mbs before loading it all together but I can go a way. Maybe 100yd from the house before it starts to cut out.in the back yard in the front it is about 35yds the way the house is the routers are more towards the back of the house. All in all it was the best purchase I made all year! WiFi is everything here it is our TV, internet, phone and smart devices. Having this kind of coverage is awesome. It was such a pain when first moved here using charters sucky router. Save $5 per month since we returned that to them. So over 30 months it pays for itself!! Over 6 years it is making you money all while giving you about triple the WiFi coverage. The dual band is great also it allows 5G and 2.4 g. 5G is much faster but only works good if you are close. 2.4g is still fast and has much more range. It actually uses both bands to transmit to the other satellite routers. So if you have a real big house you can buy extras. The close you keep them together the better they transmit to each other and the more bandwidth you get at the furthest away router. I am so glad I do not a 300 solo 8 antenna router. From what I read they don\u2019t work that much better range wise. They are more for speed but not range. Mesh WiFi is range with great speed as well. It may not be wired speed like a $300 router may be closer to but it is still very fast.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1616284800000}

However, Google's prices have gone up. So, I bought this TP Link Deco S4 mesh network. The first device, i.e. my phone, connected easily. My Samsung TV also connected easily. However, connecting additional televisions, tablets, computers, and other devices has proved to be very difficult.The devices see the network, and after inputting the network password, they attempt to connect, but they fail to acquire an ip address. After a full day, I have been able to get some of my devices connected by disconnecting, then reconnecting with the same network password. However, this must be done repeatedly, sometimes for an hour or more. The good news is that if you can get a device to connect once, it has no difficulty reconnecting in the future.I got one device to connect by setting up a guest network and connecting to the guest network. However, that method has worked for only one device. My HP laptop simply will not connect to the network. So, it looks like I'm going to have to toss the TP Link mesh network, and buy another Google.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1713571200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Risky buy","reviewDescription":"This is my second set of 3 for total of 6.  As a mesh it works great.  My speed from provider was 500Mbps.  When I did a speed test on them (wired) it got around 350Mbps give or take a few. Thought it was a bit low but figure others on the network on the time so it was ok.  Then upgraded to 1Gbps and speed at the deco wired still around 350mbps.  Turns out in AP mode, at least on the 6 that I have, that is maxed out even when it is supposed to be 1Gbps.  Reset and reboot all devices, still same speed.  Tested the speed that is wired to the deco and got 950Mbps.  Contacted TP link and they tried very hard, even tech support got on the phone and loaded debug firmware on the decos to run tests.  I had 2 sessions with the tech and they could not figure out... and they gave up.  Basically said too bad we really tied and cannot find out the issue.  Support is great, they really tried, but result is not.  I paid a lot for 6 Mesh deco and in AP mode I only get 350Mbps is not acceptable.  Now I am stuck with 6 deco S4R that only outputs max on the cat 5 at 350mbps.  Wireless is about the same or slower still at 350Mbps.Honestly I am disappointed that they cannot find a solution and just said sorry.  I think if you run these in Router mode they will be fine.

{"reviewTitle":"Easy setup but terrible WiFi performance and feature poor","reviewDescription":"First of all, setup is easy and the app is easy to use even though this exact system isn't listed, you have to pick another Deco system. Secondly, the mesh does work, mostly, though sometimes devices will not connect to the closest node unless you get on top of it and restart. Finally, this system is inexpensive for a 3 node setup.  But you get what you pay for and that is about as positive as it gets.I have this setup with ethernet backhaul connections and the speeds are really bad. Even with data priority turned on I max out at maybe 400 Mbs downloads, usually far less while I should be able to hit 800+ Mbs download speeds. Upload speeds are also bad and without priority it is very intermittent. Pings can also go up into the 400+ ms range. Not good for my son's Fortnite sessions.There are no advanced setups available with no ability to set static IP addresses. I get that this is a budget setup, but this is purely software and would cost nothing to add. I would prefer to have my NAS and printer on static IPs, this makes them far more reliable and faster responding, but that isn't an option.I can't say that I am happy with it and I am only staying with it until I can find a deal on a better option. It is just not very good.For point of reference, I have worked in IT for 30 years and I have a degree in Network and Security.Update:  You can reserve static IP addresses for certain devices. This helps printers be more reliably available. However I still can't change my star rating. Performance is still awful.

Changing from 5 stars to 2 after Tech Support Call.I had issues with the Network.  While using VPN to connect to my company,  I experienced repeated dropped connection, something I never had problems with while using my old router.  Also, TVs on both satellite routers intermittently reported \"No Internet Connection\" in the evening.  Using TP-Link's web browser admin page for the router, I could see that the main router was experiencing 100% CPU loads during these \"outages\".You cannot call Tech Support.  There is no phone number. You can only  chat by joining a queue and waiting.  I had 3 people ahead of me, and it took tech support over an hour to get to me.The Level 1 Tech that answered me was not able to help.  In addition, he asked a long list of questions several of which he repeated two and sometimes three times.  OK, this was probably some low paid guy reading from a checklist.  (I googled him and found he is in the Philippines).The real kicker was, after spending over an hour answering questions, he told me that he could not solve my problem.  He was going to refer me to Level II Tech Support, but that there was a holiday from the 9th to the 17th, and they would not be back until after that.  I called on the 16th.I am a Senior Software Engineer with 45 years of experience, and am Level II Tech Support myself at my company.  I solved the problem on my own by removing everything on the main router except my desktop - which was hard-wired to the main router via a 5 port gigabyte Ethernet Switch, shared with 3 other devices. I then added devices back to the switch until I saw the problem again.It turns out I had two cloud storage devices on the ether switch, which for some reason \"chattered\" when they were both online\".  I left one offline and had no further problems.If TP-Link wants to be a world class player of Network Devices, they need to come up with a tech support system that doesn't send all of its product engineers on Holidays for 10 days while its customers are left without support.Ultimately, this product DOES NOT work with hard-wired computers or Network Drives on the network.

My \"man cave\" office is in the garage because I am too loud with the new baby and playing computer games lol so I got kicked to the garage. There is no Ethernet line in there so I was having to use WIFI which wasn't strong enough to run the game without some sort of latency issue and\/or packet loss. I called my internet provider to see about running an Ethernet line in there but this house has one Ethernet line for some reason in the upstairs master bedroom and I cannot get the line to the garage. I then tried a power line adapter to allow the Ethernet to go through the power cable and bring it to the garage that way. This worked for a month (maybe) but then gave me worse internet for some reason where it would just kick me from the server.I now have setup this mesh system (I got the 5,500 sqft version) and my house is only 1800 sqft and have doubled the speed in the garage with no packet loss or latency (at least so far). This may be early to tell but has done even better than the power line adapter. I went from struggling to get 60mb\/s download and maybe up to 40mb\/s upload to now getting 180mb\/s download and 80-118mb\/s upload with no lag.I have been mainly playing COD DMZ and MW3 multiplayer which demands a lot of bandwidth and I dabble in streaming with Spotify and OBS playing in the background and no issues.Hope this system helps you out too.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1713312000000}

Long story short, I put one Deco downstairs by the modem, the other Deco upstairs at the other end of the house, by a window nearest the outbuilding apartment. I asked my Daughter how it was working, and she replied \"it's working amazing!!\"  I had planned to install the 3rd Deco in her apartment to increase the coverage, but I didn't even need to!I am a software engineer by profession, so I will speak to a couple other critical reviews I've seen:For security, the day I plugged in my system, I was notified I had a firmware update.  After updating the Decos' firmware, my system now has WPA2-PSK [AES], which is an up-to-date security protocol, though admittedly not the (still fairly new) WPA3 standard.  The WPA2 AES will get you much better security encryption than the older TPIK protocol.  As for speed, I can easily get 110 Mbps download, and 14 Mbps upload over wifi, which is just under the 120\/20 Mbs promised by my cable provider, which is to be expected with other devices also using my network.  I'm confident this system could go faster if you had a faster provider.As for drawbacks, yet, it is true you can't select the channel(s) used by the system.  So if you are in a dense apartment building, urban area, or close-together houses, you might want to find a more expensive system that has customizable channels in order to avoid interference from neighbors' WiFi (hence only 4 stars).  But who knows, a future firmware update could fix that too (I'll update the review if it does).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1616198400000}
{"reviewTitle":"I should have gotten these long ago","reviewDescription":"I have been using a wifi router for a while to cover my whole house, but because if placement (a stone fireplace next to it and in the way) it wasn't able to cover the whole house well and I had to use a TP-Link extender with it.  The extender worked well, but the combo only covered 2\/3 of the house.After a bunch of research, I finally narrowed it down to the TP-Link Deco and one or two others (including Google's mesh system).  Since trust Google with my privacy only slightly more than I trust Facebook (which would be ZERO), that narrowed my search down and I decided to pull the trigger on the TP-Link after reading and watching more reviews from reputable computer websites.Setup was super easy and the phone app is clean and easy to use (could be a bit better, but it is good).  The thing I absolutely love about these is how I was able to tuck the devices behind plants and in out of the way areas so you didn't really even notice them.  Once set up, the coverage was excellent.  Mobile devices will switch between the mesh devices if one has a better signal than the other as you roam the house and outside.  I've even noticed that one of my TV's is on the 1st floor in a corner office area is connected to the mesh device in my basement instead of the one on the same floor.  The TV's placement found that the signal was stronger coming from the mesh device below it vs. the device across the house so it tied to that automatically.  BTW... the phone app allows you to see which devices are tied to which mesh unit.  You can custom name each mesh device (ie: living room, 2nd floor hall, basement, etc...) and custom name each device connecting to it - which comes in handy if you are running multiple Alexas and want to name them so you know which is which.I've waited to write this review until I have used these for a couple of months and after that time - I am very pleased and happy with my decision.  The TP-Link Deco has some good controls in the app, but if you need more custom controls like deep logs and parental filters - you will want to go with a more expensive setup.  But if you are just looking to maximize wifi coverage for your house without the need for a ton of extra toys - this is a great buy!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"88 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1603411200000}

I am not a techie but I do have some knowledge and experience setting up my home network. The included instructions are useless in my opinion.  I had to call my cable company for help as there was no way that i could get these extenders to work right out of the box. They did find my existing network and connected to it with no problem using the instructions but I could not get the WiFi to work. After two calls to optimum tech support and a very patient tech we finally got the first unit (the main one where the other 2 piggy back off of)  to connect to the network and deliver WiFi. The other 2 units were easy after that.As far as performance they accomplished the main task of bringing WiFi to parts of the house that I did not have reliable WiFi. The only issue is that the speed is slower than the optimum router. Given that I now have WiFi in places of the house that did not have WiFi before that is a win. The other issue that you should know about is that they connect to the provider\u2019s router and when that unit goes down these units also go down ! Would I buy these again , that is hard to say as the optimum provider offers a similar solution but is way more expensive and requires a tech to install. So as they say you get what you pay for.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1662768000000}

If you have a basic network (modem and basic firewall only), and you can stand to configure with a phone app, then this is a great product for you.  My wifi would never go past my garage door with the Unifi products.  With this in place, I was connecting to my wifi from the sidewalk across the street.  While the speed across the street was not as fast as within my house, it was STILL faster than my current Unifi access points.The App:For having to use an app to setup, it's not that bad.  I have used other products that required a phone app to setup (Helm e-mail) and it was not a great experience.  It is very easy to configure and setup with the app, but in my opinion it should be backed up by a web portal on the access points directly.The reason I am returning is that I have 3 VLANs in my house, main LAN, IoT and Cameras.  I do not want or need it to be the router\/firewall\/core of my network and wanted to run it in AP mode.  When this device is placed into AP mode there is ZERO support for VLANs.  And it's not documented on every page that talks about AP mode, it's in a help page a few clicks into the vendors support pages.  This should be more clear on every page that talks about AP mode.  I did contact support about this and they were very responsive.Honestly after the huge range and increase in performance I'm disappointed to have to return these however VLANs support is a requirement for me.  If you need advanced features, look at the Netgear Orbi Pro.

{"reviewTitle":"Went from TP-Link Router to the 3 - DECO S4's","reviewDescription":"These installed super easy.  Loaded the DECO application and added the Main Deco, which is connected to my cable modem.  Then added the other 2 Deco's.  We have a 2670 sq. foot home, 2 stories.  Placed one unit on the lower level, south-end of house.  The second one upstairs in my office (that used to be a bedroom), also south-end of house.  The third one is upstairs in the Master Bathroom\/Bedroom, north end.  The issue we have is the lower level Deco main unit hosts almost every wireless device in the house.  We have Echo Dots, Smart Switches, Ring, Smart Plugs, Firesticks, 3 - Laptops, and 2 - Tablets.  If I walk about the house with my HP Laptop, it stays connected to the same Deco, even if I'm next to a different one.  Using my Tablet or Cell Phone wireless, I roam from one Deco to the next.  It almost seems like a waste to see 19 devices hosted by the Main Deco and the other 2 doing very little.  The Office Deco is used for work so I have a Company Laptop and a Cisco IP Phone into the Ethernet ports.  It has yet to host a wireless device, even though a Echo Dot is sitting next to it.  Another oddity is sometimes the Echo Dots disconnect.  We've had a couple of instances of smart devices turning on\/off at night while in bed.  Gets your attention when lights come on. I don't know if anyone has answers to these issues?Performance:  When I first installed the Deco's, my wireless Laptop ran a speed test of 201 Mbps down and up is lousy at 6Mbps (Comcast).  Ran it several times and consistent.  Ever since the initial speed tests, it's never even come close again.  Typically, I get between 45 and 95 Mbps now.  It's OK as we are not power-users.The main reason we purchased a new Router is because the old one couldn't support all of the wireless devices we have.

Other than the relatively clean look, I don\u2019t know if I would recommend much about this product. Placement and spacing of the decks seems to be key, yet that\u2019s not emphasized enough in the instructions or the app. My house is fairly small - ~1200 that's rectangular (length is about 2x width). Thought we could have the first deco in the living room, the second in the office at the back of the house and then a third in the garage that's between the house and the backyard where I work sometimes. But the signal from the first deco wouldn't reach that far back even though the set is supposed to cover 5500 sq ft and that's about the size of the entire lot. Had to put an additional one in between living and office, but on the opposite side of the house to get the right signal so now we'd have to purchase another one to reach the backyard. So the \"triangle\" placement seems to be nearly mandatory for this mesh to work and it doesn't cover 5500 sq ft.Nothing about it feels state of the art. Set up takes forever, particularly if you need to rearrange the decos, because it take like 10 minutes on each deco to remove, power up, reset, start up. It take a long time to sync between app and hardware.

{"reviewTitle":"Solid Wi-Fi Signal on All Three Floors of My House.","reviewDescription":"This was pretty simple to set up, although you need to be able to access your router's internet (home) page in order to turn off your router's antenna or broadcasting signal. Once that's done, the TP-Link mesh system can be programmed to the same name and password of your (now) master router. That way, you don't have to reprogram all of your smart technology (phones, Alexa, lights, switches, plugs, lap tops and tablets, etc.). The mobile app is easy to navigate with lots of information. I found it very similar to my FiOS router's app.My only issue with this mesh system is the reduced up\/download speeds. From my FiOS router, I was getting the 100 Mbps that they promised. With the TP-Link, the best I can get is 70 Mbps. Of course, that's everywhere throughout my house. Prior to installation, my average speed for the FiOS router dropped the farther away from it that you got. I expected my speed to be near 100 Mbps through the mesh. It is a mixed blessing because it's solid throughout the entire house now. The bonus is the Ethernet connections on each mesh unit. I set up my wife's home office with her work station connected to the mesh. She has a solid, uninterrupted signal to work with. I also set up my PS4 to a mesh unit for that same uninterrupted signal.As for Tech Support, I didn't need to call or text them. Perhaps in the future I will to see about getting closer to 100 Mbps all through the house.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1621900800000}

As advertised, installation was a snap and I had installed three of the connection boxes in about 40 minutes total.  My main router (xFinity broadband) is located in my basement; I installed each of the boxes successively further away up to the top floor of my house.  Where I once got \"nothing\" to 2 or 3 mps, I can now consistently get close to 100 mps download.The only reason that I gave a 4-star rating was that my installation required a support ticket to get it to perform exactly as I wanted.  Accepting the default installation on every step of the process left me with excellent internet access, but I could not access shared printers and files.  The default installation sets up the wireless devices as a subnetwork for which I could not figure out how to get outside to access other devices plugged directly into the same xFinity router.  An email to tech support pointed me to a support document which had a one-click solution: change default to an \"access point\"  .... this change was accomplished with literally one click on my mobile ap and a reboot of the main router.  All is well now.  I would have liked to see something like this mentioned in the setup; perhaps it was and I just didn't realize it.The TP-Link has now been running perfectly for three weeks and I still do a daily speedtest all the way up in the farthest corner of my  house just to remind me how good it's working.

They boot slow so it takes a few minutes to set each up but you are good there after.  I do not like the fact that you must connect a Deco to the rest of the system via WiFi before you can hardwire it in.

WiFi speeds have increased in my house compared to my old mesh system.  I was running on a dated Luma system and this is much much better.

You have to turn it OFF before to start the setup because it can interfere with mesh causing drops and glitches, unless that your old device is compatible with mesh system but that's another story.PROS:- Fast and stable.- Alexa and Google Home compatibility.- Guest WiFi mode.- Night mode (turn off and on the led lights  by schedule or manually)- Set amount of bandwidth in certain Decos.- Good parental control with individual profiles.- Great app tools to boost, admin and check your network health.- Option to work with 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz or both at the same time.CONS:- Alexa skill is not available in certain countries but you can solve that by changing your region in your Amazon account e.g. US.

{"reviewTitle":"WIFI everywhere in my house now!","reviewDescription":"The Deco S4 Mesh system fixed the issue I was having with bad WIFI around my home.  My Verizon fios router was constantly dropping WIFI, and even when it was working the WIFI speeds were horrible.  This is unacceptable in todays world of everyone working and doing their school work from home.  We needed a solution that was affordable and could cover our entire house with good strong WIFI.  I searched a long time and finally found the Deco S4 Mesh system here on Amazon, and I am glad I did.I purchased the three router Deco S4 Mesh system for my 2000 square foot house as we have two floors, a full basement, a breezeway, a patio and a garage that I wanted to cover with WIFI.  I have one S4 hard wired into the fios ONT in my basement via a Cat5 Ethernet cable, and the other two S4 routers are set up wirelessly.  The hard wired S4 going to my computer is located at one end of the house on the first floor.  One wireless S4 is in the basement, and the other wireless S4 is on the opposite side of the house on the first floor.  The set-up was very easy, and the Deco app made connecting all three S4 routers quick and painless.  Thankfully I get a decent cellular signal at my house, so I was able to set up the Deco S4 Mesh system using my cell phone.  You have to remember that once you disconnect your existing internet from your old router, you can't use the Deco app unless you have a good cellular signal and a device like a cell phone or cell tablet to do the set up.One other thing I especially liked is that I could name the S4 network whatever I wanted.  This makes it easier for me to remember what the network is called as I no longer have to remember the very long alpha-numeric name of the old router.  This makes connecting devices much easier and a lot less painful.The only negative I would give the Deco S4 Mesh system is that there are only two Cat5 Ethernet connections on each S4 unit.  I have three Ethernet connections at my computer and I had to re-route one connection to one of the other S4 units, but I did not deduct a star for this because I knew about this before I purchased the Deco S4 system.The whole S4 Mesh system took about 30 minutes to setup, and I now have super fast WIFI everywhere, even in my garage, back yard and shed!  With this new Deco S4 setup, I am now getting the full upload and download speeds via WIFI that I get with the hard wired Ethernet connection to my computer.  This never happened with the fios router, even when it was new.With everyone now in the house all day long working from home and doing school work, bad WIFI is NOT an option.  The Deco S4 Mesh system solved all of the issues with poor WIFI we were getting from the fios router.  I would highly recommend the S4 Mesh system to anyone, especially if you have problems with your current WIFI around your house.The other great thing about the Deco S4 Mesh system is that with more and more devices all needing to attach to a home network, it says it can handle up to 100 devices!  My fios router, even when it was working, was having trouble keeping up with the devices we have.  It is amazing how many things we have now that require a good WIFI network.  There are Echo devices, smart outlets, smart switches, smart bulbs, camera's, cell phones, tablets, lap top computers and on and on.  It did not take long for us to go beyond 50 or more devices in our home that need WIFI, and this Deco S4 Mesh system has been able to keep up with all of them!  At last count, we now have 59 devices and there are more on the way I am sure!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1605225600000}

I spent hours trying to recreate my wifi network with the app many, many times. It was all to no avail; it simply wouldn't connect.That all sounds bad enough, but when I contacted customer service, at first they didn't believe me, which delayed getting any replacement.

No one should have to pay for a replacement of faulty equipment under a warranty.They send me a refurbished set, which seemed fine at first. But a few months in, I've started to have problems again.

Overall this mesh network didn\u2019t work very well in my home. It dropped wifi often and some devices couldn\u2019t sign onto the network. My computer has a VPN and the speed wouldn\u2019t go above 10 Mbps.I\u2019m not an IT professional but have more experience than most with networking and set up. I went from having the modem with two extenders. Wifi speeds were great above 100 Mbps. The challenge was going from one side of my 2,700 southwest ft home to the other side the device (phones mostly) wouldn\u2019t switch network and remain on the old network.I was hoping that would solve that issue and it did, however I never got speeds above 70mbps in any case. I tried different locations and figurations but it just didn\u2019t transfer the speeds like it was suppose to do. This made it difficult to say whether the range was good enough as the speed was already poor from 30-60mbps when standing on top of the unit then going far away to test the range. I just never had the consistency to test the distance.The user face\/app looked very clean and easy to use, but the more I toyed with it the more I became frustrated because there weren\u2019t limits like you can do on other networks like net gear or wav-link. There was no way of making these connections more secured network.It was easy set up as it came with three units with power chords and one Ethernet cable. Basically plug and play. But it showed 50+ devices connecting to it and I could only account for 20-30 devices. I was able to rename those devices but some I was still unsure. I place them on the blacklist which was a nice feature, and also did have parental controls including setting limits and time restrictions for gaming systems, phones and other devices. Kids quickly complained about time limit. But now with covid and homeschooling, kids need to be on these devices more than 2 hours a day. I was unable to block just Roblox or minecraft. But our PS4 lost connection immediately at 2 hour limit, but PS4 can still be played on some games without internet; so that requires its own limitation management.Pros: home had wifi with no changing of network names.Cons: lost wifi, poor speeds, some devices couldn\u2019t connect.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1611619200000}

I am an xFinity customer with their 1GbE Docis Cable Modem\/Router\/WiFi and the service I pay for to xFinity is their 200Mbps service.  Due to competition, xFinity gives me about 400Mbps to 500Mbps throughput most of the time.  My old WiFi router needed updating and I needed WiFi coverage for a large 4 story house and this product seemed to be perfect for my needs.  I noticed right away that my WiFi performance was less than it was.  I average 90Mbps to 100Mbps on a good day with most times offering me much less overall bandwidth.  At first, I thought it was due to the backhaul channel taking away bandwidth due to it talking to the Master Deco X90 in the WiFi Mesh network.  If I disconnect the Mesh Deco X90 and stand right to the Master X90 and run a speedtest, I still only see about 90Mbps throughput.  If I attach to the xFinity WiFi, I consistently see 500Mbps throughput.

I was pleased to find that setup was relatively easy. However, I wasn't able to get the system completely setup before I found my first issue. There was also an unfortunate lack of ports, feature-poor software, slow performance, and unexpected shutdowns. After about a week of use, I replaced the routers with my old routers.More details on the issues mentioned above:SETUP: one of the three routers wouldn\u2019t start up right away (gave me a red light). I tried resetting it, and that didn\u2019t work. After a few restarts it eventually seemed to work. Not sure what changed, but clearly there were some reliability issues.PORTS: only one output ethernet port on each router meant I needed to reconfigure my wired network setup since my other routers had three output ports. Not a deal-breaker, but annoying nonetheless.FEATURE-POOR. The software is very simple. The features included are very basic.PERFORMANCE, APP: The app is incredibly bad. Switching to different pages in the app would result in waiting 20-60 seconds for information to populate. Sometimes it would just fail to load properly.PERFORMANCE, ROUTER: Changing settings seemed to take a strange amount of time to take effect. For example, I once disabled 5 GHz to see how performance would be affected. It was much worse, so I re-enabled it. It took a full 30 minutes before performance was back to normal. This may be related to CPU usage, which, as reported by the router software, was railed at 100% at least 50% of the time.UNEXPECTED SHUTDOWNS: the last straw for me was when the router would unexpectedly just stop working. I would suddenly find that I had no access to the internet. When I investigated the main router, it showed a red status light, indicated a major problem. Restart the router, and I\u2019m back at it. But this happened three times in the first week after setup \u2013 totally unacceptable.I bought this router system to try mesh networking (which admittedly worked better than my previous router setup), but the issues were too numerous to stand.

Since my modem\/router and the main Deco are on a shelf about 8 foot high I suggested to Tech Support that I do this on my own needing a ladder, screw driver, etc.  I tried the suspect  unit as the main Deco unit and had the same problems so I am thinking it is a bad satellite unit.  (My suspicion all along.) I will call TP-Link tomorrow and give them an option to send me a new unit or I will return the entire system and buy a more reliable system.UPDATE:  On Sept 30, 2021 I called TP-Link and was on hold for 20+ minutes with no customer support.  I am 75 years of age so I really not sure I have an additional 20+ minutes to hold?  As a result I returned the items to Amazon, identifying it as a defective product.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1632873600000}

I talked with them the first night because I was struggling to get my router set up. We were interrupted so I called back the second night. Again, I Googled TP-Link for the customer service #. Unfortunately, I didn't realize the number wasn't the same.To condense a very long story: the helpful technician I was talking to asked for remote access to my laptop, which I provided to the nice man who was helping me. (He told me what a good job I was doing with the technology as he was trying to rob me blind. Really added salt to the injury after it was all over with.) By the time he started asking for my credit card number it was too late. He already had access to my laptop. I started Identity Lock immediately, froze our credit, cancelled our bank card, etc. What was supposed to be a simple router setup turned into a complete mess. Not really TP-Link's fault - but I felt like I needed to pass the word along to others who might get scammed. Don't allow REMOTE ACCESS unless you are positive you have the right company.One more point - I'm not an idiot when it comes to computers\/identity theft. This 'technician' had studied the product and the call-in center. He asked me the same set of questions I had been asked the day before by the legitimate tech.

It gave me the coverage I needed throughout my home, as well as outside the home for things like ring cameras.It continued to work great for a while, but then the reboots started. The router will work fine for a week or two, and then it goes on a spell of rebooting itself multiple times per day for a week or so. Then back to no issues for a week or two. Those brief outages would be annoying enough, but even worse, sometimes it doesn't recover from its own reboots and has to be manually power cycled to resuscitate it. If this happens when I'm out of town, I have to ask my neighbor to come over and power cycle all the units for me to regain remote access to my smart devices in my home.The units are all on the latest software version, and this problem continues to occur.I'm also not a fan of the app. I like having an app that lets me control most functions, but I would also like to have control of everything over a web interface.

{"reviewTitle":"There Are So Many Great Things About It, But the Bad Things are Pretty Bad","reviewDescription":"I moved from my apartment into a house, and suddenly the router\/modem combo my cable company gave me wasn't giving me a connection anywhere in the house. I ordered the X90 because it was one of the newest AX6600 mesh systems with Tri-Band. I wanted to \"future-proof\" my setup.The biggest advantage this model has over the competition is the range. The range on this is unlike anything I've ever seen on a consumer device. I can be at the edge of my backyard, at least 75 feet from the Deco, and on the other side of a brick wall and I still get excellent coverage. I also love that they will \"mesh\" with other Deco devices, so if you have older Decos or need to expand your coverage, you can add other Deco devices to your network, not just other X90s.The Decos themselves are fairly attractive and look good sitting on a tabletop. I like that they are both identical and you can simply designate which one you want to be the \"main\" Deco (the one connected to your modem). Each Deco has a 1gb and a 2.5gb ethernet port. The ports will auto-configure, which is pretty handy. You can use either as your WAN port. If you connect the Decos together, it will create a wired backhaul. You can connect an unmanaged switch to a port if you need more hardwired connections. Its all very simple and the end user doesn't have to worry about configuration. It would have been nice to have a USB port though, to connect a printer or hard drive.This ends up being one of my biggest gripes though: the lack of customization. TPLink has put a great deal of effort into their Deco app, and it shows. Compared to other mesh network apps (Orbi, ASUS, etc.) this app is by far the most polished. The interface is responsive, and they put common options in multiple places, so no matter what logic you apply to your menu selections, you can still end up finding what you need. That said, you're pretty limited on what you can do. QoS was one of the features I was looking forward to the most, and I was incredibly disappointed with TPLink's offerings. All you can do is set devices to be \"high priority.\" It's either regular priority or \"high\" priority. You can set certain types of device (like multimedia) to be high priority without setting them all individually. You can't order the devices by priority. You can't assign certain traffic to be high priority. For example, Zoom calls use ports 80, 443, 3478, 3479, 5090, 5091, 8801-8810. It would be awesome to be able to set a rule that, between 7am and 5pm and these ports would get priority, but there's no option for that.The app is just seems incredibly limited if you know a bit about networking. For example, I wanted to put all my smart home devices on their own VLAN. This is possible, but incredibly difficult to setup because of the way these Decos handle DHCP. Its like they don't expect anyone to actually segregate their internet traffic, so you have to use some meandering methods to achieve the results you want. I wish they had an \"advanced\" mode that you could enter if you feel comfortable getting into the weeds.Annoyingly, TPLink doesn't provide all the features out of the box. They want you to subscribe to their pro service which is around $5 a month depending on if you pay month to month or yearly. Either way, its a huge disappointment. You get a month long trial, so I tried it and it was worthless for me. I hoped it would offer more QoS features, but all I can really tell that it does is unlock more Parental Control features. The features themselves are actually pretty good. You can assign devices to different \"profiles\" and then set rules for that profile. Its pretty well done. Like you can set \"Johnny's\" devices to stop connecting to the internet after 10 pm on week nights, or create a white list or black list of websites. You can even set bandwidth limits for certain users. Its just hard to justify having to pay extra money for features, especially when you're paying $500 for the hardware, and other brands offer similar features for free.My biggest issue with this mesh system is that is continuously drops connections with some of my devices, especially newer iPhones and Mac laptops. This seems to only affect mobile devices. I have a desktop computer hardwired into one Deco and my Xbox hardwired into the other, and neither have had any connection issues, but multiple iPhones and MacBooks have had issues maintaining a connection as they move through the house. I've experimented with the Fast Roaming and other settings, but no luck. My firmware is up to date. I even manually installed a newer firmware that wasn't showing up in the Update feature on the app. I've tried everything. I've rebooted the devices. Nothing could fix this. I'd carry my laptop upstairs and I'd lose internet. This happened multiple times per day, and TPLink Support couldn't provide anything other than \"make sure your firmware is up to date.\"I ended up returning it and getting an ASUS mesh system. I like the ASUS more. It has so many more options for customization and my connection doesn't drop. It does, however, have much worse range and its not as fast. The app is also pretty ugly and hard to use, but maybe that comes with having so many more functions. I love that I can schedule reboots on the ASUS and customize exactly what each channel gets used for.Overall, if you want\/need long range connectivity, and you can live with the connection dropping momentarily through the day, then the X90 will probably make you very happy. Its range is incredible. Its speed is awesome. And its app is very nice to use. If you don't handing the reigns over to the device to basically control itself, then you will probably like this product. I think there is a lot of overlap between the non-technical consumer who wants good Wifi with easy setup, and the consumer who can tolerate a little lag when watching YouTube because their device's connection dropped for 30 seconds.If you expect rock solid reliability then you should look into Orbi. If you want to customize settings all day, then get ASUS. If you want an easy to use but kind of stripped down mesh WiFi experience, TPLink seems great, but I'd consider one of their cheaper systems, like the Deco X68 which is half the price. For what TPLink is charging for the X90, it just doesn't deliver.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"171 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1623801600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Love it. Had Unit Since 2021 - But Gigabit Port Issues Lately","reviewDescription":"I really love my S4 Decos. It\u2019s hard for me to give it 3 stars. But I will explain why in just a moment.My usage: online gaming (WiFi, not hardwired), uploading large data (abt 1TB every month solely from File Sharing), total monthly usage including streaming is avg 2TB. Single living but have about 16 devices connected in a 2-story residence (no concrete\/plaster walls). Im very satisfied with the coverage and seamless handoff between decos as I walk up and down the stairs.Positives:Well designed. Alerts me if devices that connect to my network. The app allows me to also manage my parents WiFi network from the other side of the state! The app is great in the sense you can be admin for your own network and then switch over to your parents\u2019 or other house network easily for quick trouble shooting. Can connect with other models of Deco devices. Easy to add more decos to expand coverage as needed. App is very simple but you are able to set QOS settings, create guest networks, and WPS (for quick connection to wireless printers and such). Works with Frontier FIOS (fiber optics) ONT box. Have Gigabit ports. All of the units are routers, not satellites\/wifi repeaters (like the Netgear Nighthawk package). So if one of the Decos dies, you don\u2019t have to buy a new 3-pack. You can use the other to directly replace and connect to the modem. Brilliant design and more expensive to manufacture this way. In 2023 you would probably be better suited to check out a couple of their newer lines for WiFi 6\/6E and the enhanced wireless speed capabilities. But this should be enough for most people.Negatives:I hear from more IT centric people that the network setup security options are subpar. I know all my neighbors (60+ yo), rarely have guests and am not too concerned abt the latest cutting edge security standards.Switching your main deco (the one plugged into the modem) can take some time to setup in the app. Sometimes the app doesn\u2019t recognize it until 20 mins later.Lately I\u2019ve had an odd thing happen. I cannot get my main S4 deco that\u2019s connected to the modem\/Frontier ONT box to give me the hardwired gigabit speeds claimed it can give. I paid for the 500Mbps up\/down. And recently upgraded to 1Gbps up\/down. No matter what I try, my hardwired speed is capped at around 250Mbps! With and without VPN. When I plugged my desktop directly to the ONT box, I got an immediate 995Mbps up\/down. So the Frontier equipment is ok. My CAT network cable is ok. My network card is capable of the speed. The bottleneck is the S4 Deco gigabit ports. Something is happening there that is limiting the speed. I\u2019ve set the QOS settings in my app. I\u2019ve assigned highest priority to the desktop. Still nada. I will swap it with another S4 and test if this deco is bad. But it\u2019s just unusual.Other than that I\u2019ve been extremely happy with this. Back in 2021 it cost me $134. So the price now at $109 is still good (better than paying $300 on the newer models).

{"reviewTitle":"Fantastic coverage but lower speeds and no control over settings","reviewDescription":"I was on the basic Verizon Fios 100\/100 plan for the longest time. This included their terrible, old, and 2.4 GHz only Actiontec router. I ended up getting a TP-Link Archer A9 so I could get better coverage along with a 5 GHz wifi signal but the coverage in this house (basement + 2 floors) was still terrible in some areas. I ended up pairing it with a TP-Link RE450 extender and all was well.However, I ended up upgrading my Fios plan to gigabit a few years later. This required the techs to come and upgrade the ONT and run an ethernet cable. The coax cable was still used for TV services. This also included a new fancy big white Verizon Fios router (G3100). Since we have TV service as well, we kinda need the router for the coax input and I figured this new $300 wifi 6 tri-band device would be better than the TP-Link router I was using.Well, it wasn't. Their SON didn't work. TVs and printers wouldn't connect. Disabling that and splitting the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands like I was previously doing with the TP-Link router solved the problem. The coverage and speed were better than the TP-Link router as well but the coverage was still not good enough so I continued using the RE450 extender. But, that extender just didn't play well with this new Verizon router and it became a big problem during the pandemic with everyone working from home. I would have to reset the extender at least once a week and during the workday when it would suddenly stop connecting to the Verizon router, I'd have to tell my household to switch over to the Verizon router despite them having a weaker signal to it since they're on the 2nd floor and the Verizon router is in the basement.So I ended up buying this. I've been wanting to go mesh for a while but didn't want to spend too much money. This was in my price range and I could always return it if it didn't work out well.Well, guess what? It works great. The main unit is in the basement and is connected to the Verizon router, one is on the first floor, and the third is on the second floor.There's one SSID for the single house and everything connects to it seamlessly including older 2.4 GHz only legacy devices that previously failed to work with Verizon's SON implementation. I've also had 5 GHz devices fail to work properly on Verizon's SON but no issues here.The wifi speed is lower than the Verizon router. I get 350\/250 speedtest results with this whereas with the Verizon router it would be around 500\/400. Wired is slightly slower as well (850 down vs 950 down) but not enough for me to care.I no longer have to worry about having 4 SSIDs in the house (2 from the Verizon router + 2 from the extender since using the same one wouldn't hand things off properly) and remind non-tech people to switch networks when they'd move floors. And the fact that everything connects to it while we're all still working from home is also a blessing.But the software on it is complete and utter junk. You literally cannot do anything from the web GUI aside from check the status. The entire thing runs on a phone app with extremely limited settings. You can't even change channels for the wireless bands. You can control the LEDs, control the guest network, and....... that's about it. It's pathetic really.I've set the Deco to run in access point mode so at least the Verizon router retains some control. Also, this way I don't get double NAT.Overall, I like the device. I'm just giving it 3 stars instead of 5 because the wifi speeds are slower and I hate the fact that TP-Link thinks it's a good idea to sacrifice security for the sake of simplicity and that they think it's a good idea to give the user \"administrative\" control over the network via a terrible phone app.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1617408000000}

So that became the routine turn off and back on between the two secondary mesh switch\/routers for the next couple of days.Day 9: My annoyance level had peaked to max capacity of the constant reset. In my haste I completely removed the mesh switch\/router from the livingroom.- It's been 7 days now since removing the device and I've had no issues, \"knock on wood.\" Not gonna call tech support and set an hour on the phone just to go through the same steps I've been performing.

{"reviewTitle":"READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE","reviewDescription":"1 of 2 units has failed in less than a year:  FREQUENT dropping on random days (sometimes 3-4x weekly).  With tech support assist, I was able to uninstall the defective unit and reinstall it.  Got it working until it dropped a few days later, and has continued dropping.  The 2-year warranty, at first blush, looks good .... until you read the fine print:  If you ask TP-Link to honor its warranty, UNLESS you reside in the continguous 48 states, it will NOT ship a replacement unit until you first return the defective unit (leaving you WITHOUT WIFI at TP-Link's mercy due to postal delays).  Since we live in Hawaii, TP-Link will NOT send a replacement until it receives the defective unit.  Ethically, it should not sell to Hawaii residents unless, in large print, it advises those who reside outside of the 48 states of this prohibition.  Next, even if you reside in the 48 states, TP-Link will replace your defective unit with a REFURBISHED unit, NOT new, at its sole discretion.  Next, TP-Link will charge your credit card $14.99, plus the full price of the replacement, before it ships it to you.  Although the terms of its warranty language are extremely OPAQUE (even to this attorney), it is clear to me that you will pay a non-refundable \"convenience fee\" of $14.99 to return a defective unit, which ought to be free prepaid shipping because it is TP-Link's fault, NOT yours, that the unit failed.  (The other charge for the replacement unit falls off your credit card assuming you return it within the required 25 days.)I have written numerous emails to TP-Link's tech support group that has yet to answer my above-stated concerns.  I will update this review if they do.UPDATE:  TP-Link advised me yesterday that it will NOT send a replacement until it receives my defective unit.  Since I cannot afford to forego wifi while I await a replacement, this back-and-forth with TP-Link could take many weeks.  I am stuck with a defective, unreliable unit that I no longer want to use, that is still under warranty, BUT, a warranty that TP-Link will not reasonably honor.UPDATE 9\/5\/2023: This update is limited solely to the performance of TP's mesh wifi system.  (My remaining comments are unchanged concerning TP's poor customer service and unreasonable return policy. )We have now owned this system for two years.  Initially, it dropped constantly.  Indeed, the only reliable thing about it was how regularly it dropped.  TP's customer service did not offer any expertise as to why it was dropping so frequently, often 2 to 3 times weekly.  On our own we decided to install DEDICATED outlets for the TP system.  Amazingly, once we removed other electronic devices which competed with the TP system for power, the dropping stopped in its tracks.  We have not experienced a single incident since installing dedicated outlets for the TP system.  It has performed reliably ever since and returning it to TP is no longer an issue.However, we took 2 stars off an otherwise 5-star product due to TP's unreasonable and unrealistic customer service policies should you ever need to return the product under warranty.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1667952000000}

I thought this would be simply setting up the base and 2 satellites and all would be fine. Didn\u2019t quite work out that way.First Attempt: once configured as a router and 2 satellites, ethernet backhaul I was getting 90 mbps on the wireless devices and only 240 mbps on the wired desktop.  Wireless problem eventually tracked to an older 100mbps ethernet hub (hadn\u2019t shown up before because my previous mesh router (Jetstream ~$90) did not have wired backhaul.  Once I switched out the 100mbps hub the wireless speed went to 200+ speed & is the best my laptops have ever done - don\u2019t support 5GHz.Second Attempt: there are LOTS of complaints on TP-LINK\u2019s forums complaining about how slow the routers are. Someone suggested changing them to Access Point (AP) mode - use a different router as the DHCP server and configure the TP-LINKS as \u201cslaves\u201d or APs only. When I did that (with my old D-LINK router  as DHCP server and connected my home network to ithe D-LINK the wired desktop went back to 500\/500 speed. One difference in AP mode is that \u201cfeatures\u201d like parental control, QoS, etc don\u2019t work and the thought on the forums is that those features are what\u2019s killing the wired speed. Not sure what the maximum speed is on the wireless devices - my laptops are too old to get maximum speed. A iPad Pro (several years old) gets 260 mbps.  I checked the laptop wireless speed as a router (without ethernet backhaul) and got about 120.Verdict: - I\u2019m not returning them because they\u2019re \u201cfine\u201d in AP mode - If you can use them that way they may be fine for you - if you don\u2019t want the potential hassle of yet another piece of  equipment you might want to consider something else.NOTE:  the forums on TP-Link\u2019s website mostly have this complaint about Deco M4 units - not this one which is S4R so it apparently affects other DECO models.Disappointed that there is so many complaints on their site over multiple years and they have not fixed the problem.My firmware says it\u2019s most current.And as always - maybe I'm missing something and it works fine in Router Mode... But I could not figure out anything else to try.

I received the product, got the app, the set-up was easy but, the performance was awful.  The signal was very weak at every point and each device was moved to optimal locations.So get some help from Customer Service....it is clear to me that TP-Link doesn't want a direct live phone interaction.  I called 3 different times over 2 days.  The biggest issue was the quality of the phone line, which was crackly and dropped out.  The tech promised to call back on 2 of those calls but never did.  All three calls were from completely different phones with the same connection problem.  So it appears TP is purposely discouraging people from calling. The problem with the line is with TP.I spent 4 hours on chat (2.5 one day and 1.5 hours another day) trying to get a strong signal.  I jumped through a LOT OF HOOPS for the tech with no positive results.  I was very hopeful of this product but in the end, it was a DUD.  After all of this effort and 6-7 hours to resolve the issue, it was returned to Amazon for a refund.Buying a product like this should not require the customer to spend so much time just trying to make it work properly.

This is typically a huge no-no especially in congested areas. On top of this, the center channel is 8 which I can not change!  This is 110% redicuolous and shows that they didn't have anyone who knows networking create the UI!  I am contending for unused capacity across the ENTIRE 2.4GHz range!!!It's' counter intuitive but because of WiFi congestion a 20MHz channel centered on 1, 6, or 11 is going to be significantly faster for me.  Best I can get because of congestion is 30~45Mbps on a 20MHz channel.  Because this Deco S4 is 40MHz on Channel 8 it has a hard time breaking 10Mbps. Shoot, even a 40MHz channel on 1, 6, or 11 would be faster.Im giving it one star because of this. Once an update gives us an \"advance wifi settings\" page that lets us tweak these settings I'd give it a solid 4 stars.Also, if you use it in router mode, Im still not sure what CPU is in the thing, but it seems pretty weak.  I'd be concerned with it bogging down if you have too many sessions going on.Luckily my client doesn't have neighboring wifi so 40MHz on whatever channel doesn't matter.

I tried a bunch of things, rearranging, updating firmware (auto upgrades seem to break once you have different S4 hardware versions), and disabling 2.4 GHz band (which broke my Ring doorbell that doesn't have 5GHz).Ultimately I used the web interface - not the mobile app - and saw that my main unit's CPU was running at 99 - 100% constantly. This isn't good...regardless of what Deco says.  After removing 1 of the 5 units and and going back down to 4, it stabilized at 20 - 30%. Also, I made sure the newest of the S4 hardware models (v4) was the main unit where all traffic gets hubbed through, for no other reason other than that it likely has the most modern (and fastest) hardware.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1697414400000}

I had two of their access points, a UAP-AC-Pro and a AP-AC-Lite, set up with their controller app to make it all one happy network.  Mostly it was, though difficult to set up and the controller kept crashing.  Then the AC-Pro failed, and I entered the support maelstrom.  Weeks of emails, and we haven't even \"understood\" the problem yet.  I bought the TP-Link Deco product, 3-AP pack, and was shocked and how easy and quickly it set up.  No controller app to fuss with, and when you add another AP the app just basically says, \"Hey, I found a new one, want to add it?\".  Yeah.  That's how it should work.  No idea how long it will last, and no experience with their support, but 3 APs for the cost of one Ubiquiti?  How bad could it be?UPDATE:Two the three units work flawlessly,  but the third repeadedly disconnects from the LAN, meaning it acts like a valid AP, but provides no Internet or DHCP services, and it's like turns red.  A power-cycle fixes it for a while, but it goes off-line again.Now the real problem: TP-Line Support. I understand you love your products and think they can't possibly ever break.  But the level of local \"troubleshooting\" requests are just silly now.  I've had to supply them with the make\/model of my routher (that's the same router that the other units work fine with), replace the cable (done before contacting them), then the intimate details of my network (not going to happen).  The point fingers at everything in the network, I mean EVERYTHING, except their own stuff.  I've been going back and forth in about 24 hour cycles with them form a week and a half, no joy.I've not set up an Amazon exchange.  When the new units come, I'll try one or more of them, and send the rest back.  Or all of them back if that doesn't work.

After about a month, my torrent stops working, then i realize some how port forwarding is not working but it is resolved after i restart the main S4 unit, this problem happened again after a month so it seems to be a recurring issue. Today i receive notification for firmwar update, this is where the fun starts, i select update on my phone app, come back after 20 mins, and found that my main deco's light is off and wifi is not back, i then did a power cycle and found that the main unit stays on redlight, so basically its bricked, i tried to reset (press the reset button for 15 mins), did not work, confirm its bricked. Luckily, i have the other two decos, i basically had to renew my network set up using the other two decos (which evidentally was updated successfully) and my wifi network is back after i factory reset the two good decos. Now, back to the bricked one, I googled firmware recovery, took a computer with ethernet adapter, connect the bricked deco, downloaded the suggest firmware, flashed it via ethernet cable, finally revived the bricked deco. After adding the revived deco back to network, i was prompted with firmware update again, this time it was succesful. So after about 2 hours of \"fun\", my 3 deco S4 are working again. My suggestion, if you are tech savy, S4 may work for you, if you don't like to deal with issues that I've experienced, stay away and pick another brand\/model.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1644278400000}

I ran my Xfinity box as router with wireless off to multigigabit switch with MoCA and main X90 unit coming off the switch. X90 system is in AP mode. Unit downstairs had MoCA into the 2.5Gb port and a gigabit switch coming off the gigabit port (nothing down there runs faster than gigabit).

I also had a TP Link extender in the living room about 100 ft away from the main router. Internet Speeds near both routers were a good 300 MBps, but dropped at the most distant parts of the house to around 100 MBps. I thought a mesh network would improve speed and coverage.  The actual result with the new TP-Link Deco  S4 mesh with 3 nodes was better and worse than my current configuration. Near the main node, speeds were over 300 MBps but right next to the satellites, they dropped to around 180 MBps, which was an improvement over the existing network, but  at distances of over 25 feet from the satellites, speeds dropped dramatically. At the far end of the house about 100 ft from the main node and satellites, speeds dropped to a pathetic 10 MBps, a mere 10 % of what I was getting with my old network. So that was considerably worse than my existing network. I tried distributing the satellites more evenly across the home but that seemed to make all nodes worse. My sense is that the advertised claim that the mess provides 5500 sq ft of coverage is not exactly accurate if the coverage provides a very slow connection. It is possible that adding one or more nodes will give me true full house coverage, but the 3 node set does not cut it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1636934400000}

The original station just sits there next to your modem\/router, both using power.Compliment: Online tech support was responsive, clarifying the situation.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1690156800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Really poor directions to set up","reviewDescription":"It took me over an hour to set these plus an outdoor one up. You have to download an app  and then follow the directions on it\u2014sounds fairly simple. But no where does it tell you that you have to leave the first one hooked up to your modem and then the other two can be used in satellite positions. Not really part of this review but if you get an outdoor version it does not tell you anywhere that you have to use a screwdriver and take off the bottom plate to find the connections  I have only just set them up now so have no idea how well they work. But I only gave it 3 stars just because of how frustrating the set up was","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1693267200000}

Unfortunately, after a week of testing one issue kept popping up pretty frequently: poor streaming quality and dropped vpn connections. Between streaming content needs and work-from-home requirements, this proved a deal-breaker. Could be something with our house or something with the device...it's hard to say because there's very little visibility into the config, or ability to change settings with this product.

{"reviewTitle":"If you are looking for speed keep looking","reviewDescription":"I bought this unit to replace an older TP-Link product in order to improve wireless speed. I pay for a 1GB connection and typically see about 150 - 200Mbps with my older system (which was expected) and wanted to take advantage of newer unit with better speeds.  Hard wired to my modem I get 808Mbps down and 909Mbps up.  Wired to the Deco unit (which the tech support had me do) I get about the same speed. Wireless through my Verizon modem I get 436 down and 575 up. Through the new and improved Deco I got 172Mbps down and 16Mbps up.  Keeping in mind that I'm a network engineer by profession. I turned off radios, interference, moved the devices, etc. This was my average after days of testing. The tech support suggested turning off the 2.4Ghz band, which the device I was testing with was clearly not connected to per the app. I told them that the whole reason I purchased the tri-band device was to have the speeds while still having connectivity for my Smart Home devices which require 2.4.  Disappointing but I'm returning the produce.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1676592000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Requires you to replace your router","reviewDescription":"These TP-Link DECO OneMesh routers are advertised as allowing you to easily extend your WiFi net work if you are using a OneMesh router. I am using a TP-Link Archer AX6000 wireless router, which supports OneMesh. However, the Deco S4s won't extend the WiFi network using the Archer router. Instead, they require me replace my existing router with a Deco router. This is not clearly disclosed in the website description.I was ultimately able to extend my WiFi network using OneMesh technology by using non-Deco models, namely TP-Link's AC750 and AC1200 OneMesh extenders.I hope this review helps save you the time I wasted.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1693008000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great function, questionable privacy","reviewDescription":"So, the mesh feature of this product is fantastic. I live in a multistory plac, and I have no hiccups or breaks in service when I go from on story to the next. Absolutely no complaints when it comes to the functionality of the product.  You can do WPA2, WPS, all that. 5 stars all around for thatMy problem is with the app and the setup. You have to register through their cloud service in order to setup or use the router, which raises several privacy concerns. Setting up through their app is great for controlling your network when you're away, but... I can do that with a static IP and a DMZ. My point is, if that's something I was concerned about, I could do it without having to register through their services. As a result of having to do that, you also can't setup the router to forward traffic through a VPN; you instead have to setup each device to route to the VPN individually.By and large, the product is great for what it says it does; it sets up a mesh network for you. But the idea that your private network HAS to be connected to their cloud service in order to use it has my very concerned. My advice is if you get this, and you're worried about privacy, get a VPN service","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1621814400000}

So I move one closer, to 50', still doesn't work.  Only time it works is if it is within 10' of the main Deco, shich is ludicrous. Tech support then claims it is \"interference\" but since there are no other devices in the room itself or in the rest of the house other than a LG TV, DishTV control box and a microwave (and they aren't in the bedroom I put the Deco into) that is BS.

Nope. There is no way around signing up for their app and cloud BS and the web interface is a joke. It's little more than a status display. It may sound tinfoil hat'ish but I am an IT guy so I am always concerned about my network security at home and this cloud service is likely based in China meaning that they have access to any information I put in which is not my idea of secure.

{"reviewTitle":"Company does not honor warranty","reviewDescription":"So these TP-Link wifi mesh network devices worked fairly well when first installed.  When we began experiencing brown-outs, brief power outages, the issues began.  The first couple times the devices never came back online and I realized I was forced to power-cycle them individually starting with my cable modem, and then the main unit.  Quite irritating since they were all three at opposite ends of the house.  I dealt with it though. About the 3rd time into doing this they never came back online so I did a hard reset and reconfigured them.  Annoying, but I was still fine.  A couple brownouts later and power cycling them all each time...  Then the latest brownout I had to power cycle, but they didn't come back online, so I had to hard reset again, and re-setup.  Still no luck, the units failed to come back online at all.  They looked like they were online, but would never fully connect.  Worked with my ISP who said it's an issue with the routers.  So I call TP-Link for a warranty replacement (only had them 2 months), they said that a power outage voids the warranty.  Also thanks to Amazon for telling me to deal with TP-Link and I'm out of luck returning to them there too.  Well there's $200.00 down the drain.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1605139200000}
