{"reviewTitle":"\"UPDATE 3\" - It has some downsides but good overall.","reviewDescription":"FINAL UPDATE!!!If you have a dot already and you're not in a rush to update you're not missing out. The sound quality is better. Like most people I connect my dot to a Bluetooth speaker. So the updated sound quality is mute.The Eero installed mesh wifi is cool if you need to kill a dead zone. Definitely worth it ONLY IF you already have and Eero or plan on getting one. Tech support isn't the best in this department. Read below. When I did get the tech support in the U.S. the knowledge of the Eero wifi was much better. The Tech Support they out source to foreign countries is terrible. They told me the Dot and the Eero don't work together because I didn't buy them together. Amazon was quick to give me a phone call after my review so know that they do read reviews and in good faith will do everything to rectify the problem (A huge plus for Amazon.)So the problem I had was not with the Echo Dot, but with the Eero wifi mesh extender.With the Eero it's all about placement when it comes to these Echo dots. You want your Echo to be in the 5ghz range and NOT the 2.5Ghz. range. Do what you can to get the hub closer. It makes a HUGE difference. I did some digging online and found out that the Eero does well and placed up high also. I purchased a 100 foot cat5 network cable ($17). I Moved the Eero hub to the center of the house. I set it on top of a cabinet. The back room, where I was pulling 5-20mps is up to 432mps download. That's without using the Eero extension on the Echo Dot.The dot has a motion sensor and tempurature sensor that works with my Smartthings Hub. I have not used them because I already have motion and temp sensors in this room that have active scenarios working.I'm going to keep this one and test the sensors a bit more and compare them to ones I have set up already.I would give this four stars but I can't overlook the comedy of foreign tech support. This would've been a frustrating experience if I was pressed to get things working.ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!This junk is going back to the pit of hell it came from. Both of them. It's a good idea but fails in its execution.The Eero built into these are random. Sometimes you connect, sometimes you don't. I could stand a foot away from it and it will not connect to the Eero.This is a BRAND NEW product. If you buy this know that you are part of the BETA TEST crowd. You are the guinea pigs that Amazon is perfecting this on. So you pay your money so they can test this out.On one of my many calls to tech support they told me they only had very little training on these.The old wifi worked better than this.IT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME!!!!!!!!  WAIT TILL THEY WORK THE KINKS OUT!!!!New update!!!They don\u2019t know what the hell they are doing at tech support.Stupid stuff I was told.1. It will only work when you buy them together. (The Eero and Echo dot with Eero installed.)Firmware needs to update. \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d I ask. \u201cI escalated the ticket to a higher level tech support.\u201d I hung up. Called back and got a different tech. They told me to update simply tell Alexa,\u201dAlexa, update firmware.\u201d Like I told the other tech, the firmware is updated. Two tech calls ago the guy did it.So now they say they gotta call me back because they need to figure it out. LOL!!!!!STOOOOPID!This gets worse and worse. So now I\u2019m on the phone AGAIN with tech support. This idiot told me the Echo Dot with EERO won\u2019t work with the Eero mesh I purchased because ,\u201dI did not buy them together.\u201d What special kind of stupid is this!! So Eero is putting their name on products that do NOT work with other EERO products. I asked to speak to someone else. I\u2019ve been on hold for 20min.Amazon got something\u2019s right but this is a mess.Tech support has no clue on how to fix this. I\u2019m going to return this crap. But now I want to see how dumb tech support is.They asked which model do I have.There\u2019s only one with EERO in it.She didn\u2019t know that.Ten minutes later and I\u2019m back on the phone with tech support. Signal drops constantly. Tech support no help on this one hot piece of garbage!!!!I spent some time on the phone with tech support. This had to be configured so the Eero would work. I\u2019m getting good download speeds now. I hope it lasts. The sound is a bit of an improvement. More bass and highs. It\u2019s not easy to set up the Eero. They had to. Get inside and configure it to work. A hassle but it works. Tech support for Amazon can\u2019t help. Call the Eero hot line.This won\u2019t even hold the wi-fi signal. My router is the the living-room. The download speeds standing next to the Eero mesh wifi is great. 550mps.In the office I installed the New Echo dot with eero installed for mesh. Without the Echo dot I\u2019m getting 91mps. That\u2019s just off the Eero transmitting from the living room. Better than I expected.Now when I hook the Echo Dot up and I run the test.I get a whopping 0.14 mbps download. I\u2019m sitting a foot away from it.Total garbage.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"664 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1666310400000}
{"reviewTitle":"It's fine - but audio has not improved","reviewDescription":"Just set up a new Gen 5 to replace an older Echo Dot. Set up was automatic in my case; I plugged the device in, it booted up, and was immediately ready to use; I recall having to manually connect to my home WiFi with older devices.It seems to work just fine, exactly as I'm accustomed to with Echo devices. And I have to say, the new spherical design is appealing and attractive. Fifty dollars seems quite a reasonable price for this device.However, based on other reviews here, I was looking forward to improved sound for the music I play on the device, but unfortunately, I don't hear any improvement at all. I've never considered the Echo Dot to produce very good audio quality, and haven't expected sound any better than that of an old-fashioned table radio - I have other equipment to use for serious listening - but I'd hoped the new Dot might live up to the claims for better sound I saw in reviews and marketing text. It doesn't.Otherwise, it's a perfectly serviceable device.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1709510400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Works pretty good","reviewDescription":"The most upsetting thing for me was getting it set up. I had to toggle between my phone, my computer, and the Dot. Just when I thought I finally got it set up, the connection to the internet failed and I had to start over. I do admit that I'm not the most techy person, but I've worked with computers daily since 1994, so I'm not illiterate either. I was instructed that I could set up things before the Echo Dot arrived, which I did. I got the app on my phone and went through all those instructions. But when the Dot finally arrived, I got a message stating that all of my previous setup had to be reset. So I had to start over again with that. I waited so long for it to find something to pair with that I gave up on that completely. So at this moment, it's not really paired with anything except my phone. Maybe one day I'll try that again. I did ask Alexa if she could turn on my phone, and the response was that she wasn't paired with anything. So I don't know what that means. The bottom line for me is that it's not always that easy to get this thing up and running. I did purchase this because I'm starting to have some irritating memory problems. I am hoping that Alexa can help keep me in the know on where I put things. LOL I did test that out by using the command \"remember\" as this is what the internet recommended. She changed that to \"Do you want a new stickie note?\" Ok, so the command is 'new stickie note', but it works. I found that I can't whisper her name either because her hearing is far better than mine!! I think in the end I will be happy with it, but it was a royal pain to get it set up and the set up still is not finished.

First of all, you can only set it up with one Amazon account so other members of your family would have to get their own.  You can still ask it questions but it answers to the registered account holder.  Also, adding 3rd party smart devices like smart light bulbs, door locks, cameras, etc. is not straight forward.  You still have to create an account with the 3rd party product before Alexia can connect to it.  There are many other quirks, but this is not the venue to express them all.

{"reviewTitle":"Did Alexa get stupider or is it just me?","reviewDescription":"The product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music\/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto \"I'm sorry I can't do that\" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a \"clap-on\/clap off\" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a \"privacy mode\" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this.  Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it.  How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a \"parent\" or \"owner\" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your \"smart house\", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better.

{"reviewTitle":"Good concept, but wish the execution was more consistent","reviewDescription":"This is my second echo, and while it seems to have more issues than the first, it's probably my imagination.I'm going to focus on the negatives because the positives are just part of its basic functionality listed on the product page.Alexa cannot hear you over fans and music.  Must be placed away from any noise source.Alexa is inconsistent in taking action when it comes to stopping an alarm, timer, or reminder.  She'll wake up when you call her, but she'll then ignore your command and keep right on ringing.  This happens even in a silent room.  I'd say her success rate is only about 70%.Alexa is inconsistent in remembering what she did last.  It's about 50\/50 whether she'll be able to repeat what she just said or did.Alexa is inconsistent in understanding certain commands.  For example, if I set a timer and immediately realize I need it shorter or longer, it's about 50\/50 odds whether she'll understand the command \"Remove x minutes\/add x minutes\" refers to the timer I literally just set.  I have to explicitly say \"timer\" for her to understand.  This is even with only one active timer.And the biggest gripe I have with everything Alexa\/Echo - it's dead in the water without internet.  Can't even turn on a stinkin' light.  With all the programming and space you can jam into a Firestick, it can't remember its home network without \"calling home\" to Amazon?

{"reviewTitle":"The most infuriating product ever, and I don't want to live without it.","reviewDescription":"When you buy an Amazon Alexa device, you are essentially buying a dedicated access device to talk to Amazon's computers over the internet. The device typically only has enough processing power to scan for it's wake word, and then relay what it hears afterwards to Amazon's servers, which then relays the server's response back to your Echo. Even older units like my 2nd gen dot aren't obsolete because they access the same server software as this new model, and won't become obsolete unless Amazon decides to shut those servers down or exclude an older model from service due to a hardware specific security issue.Out of the box, and after linking to an amazon account and punching in some settings, you can set alarms, timers, ask math questions, ask it to spell words for you, ask the time, check the weather, temperature (Indoors and outdoor temps with this model) and quite a bit more. Sometimes I think to myself \"I wonder if it can tell do this for me?\" and a quick question later, I discover a new function. You can further expand it's abilities by linking \"skills\" to your amazon account, which are it's equivalent of a phone app. There are also thousands of gag answers and Easter egg responses, like asking it to beam you up, or fire the torpedos, complete with matching star trek sound effects. It even has the option of asking it to answer to the name \"Computer\" (Ziggy, Echo, Amazon, and Alexa are other names you can ask it to go by at this time).Some skills are as simple as activating them from your phone, or telling the Alexa itself to enable it if you know the skill's name. Some skills need more work and account linking on the PC to set up. Skills can include audio adventure games, podcasts, specific news outlets, music streaming services you've subscribed to. My most used skill is Logitech Harmony, which links it to my Harmony hub IR blaster, a separate device I bought on sale and which allows me to turn my TV on, control it's volume, change input, mute sound, etc.For all that I enjoy about this product, Amazon makes it do SO MANY STUPID IRRITATING THINGS, and many of these issues could be resolved by adding a simple setting to turn it off. Most notable of these irritations, is the inability to turn off it's \"By the way\" messages. Imagine it's 3 am and your having trouble sleeping, and ask it what the time is. All you want is the time, but then Amazon wants you to know that \"Its 3:31pm, by the way Shaquel O'neal thinks-\" and your either issuing an order to shut it up which is itself distracting and annoying, or forced to listen to it further distract you and anyone around you from sleep. Mind you, this is with it's \"brief mode\" turned on, which is supposed to make it less talkative. Amazon also sometimes takes the liberty of adding skills to your account, like some kind of Samuel L Jackson app, and I heart Radio, which makes it fudge the details on some commands like \"Turn off Tron Bulb Delta\" (All my stuff is under the \"Tron\" name, including light bulbs) and mistakes it for a command to \"Play Trombone music\". Until I figured this out and disabled the radio skill, it was a 50\/50 nightly occurrence that turning off my light groups to sleep would result in less than helpful music. Although I imagine some of these are intended to train you on it's functionality over time, if I want it to do something, Ill ask it. I don't need it telling me to \" by the way, try saying-\". Whats even more annoying is the fact it will tell you the same suggestions over and over. No Amazon, I don't want you to play white noise for me. You've told me no less than 10 times. I'm sure your proud of your white noise recordings, but I heard you the first time. STOP ASKING ME. DONT ASK ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. And mind you, these are just the annoying issues related to trying to SLEEP with the thing in operation.

{"reviewTitle":"Microphone Feels Like a Big Downgrade","reviewDescription":"Let me start by saying that I love Alexa devices and am all in on the service with devices throughout the house and in my car. They give tremendous bang for the buck and generally make life easier...except when you have to repeatedly yell at the device to get it to activate and properly understand voice commands. I purchased this to replace an aging 2nd generation Echo Dot and really couldn't be more disappointed in the performance. The microphone is a huge downgrade and is generally more frustrating than useful. Maybe they had to downgrade the microphone to add the other new features to it like motion and temperature sensing while still keeping the price down, but since my primary use for it is voice commands for my smart devices, it is a disappointment.There are times when my echo studio pair up in the bedroom (up the stairs, around a corner, through walls and a ceiling 20+ feet away) will respond to my queries instead of this 5th gen echo dot in the same room 10 feet away (with complete silence in the background).

The Echo studio may be quite a bit more pricey, but it runs circles around the dot in terms of microphone sensitivity and accuracy, plus the echo studios, when run in stereo mode with the echo sub, blow this out of the water in terms of sound quality that is excellent in a small area.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1702857600000}

But I\u2019ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.Back story:\u00a0Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I\u2019ll live a blended tech life. I\u2019ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory:\u00a0Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn\u2019t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products.\u00a0I knew it had to be something small I was missing.\u00a0Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn\u2019t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.\u00a0\u00a0Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too farIn interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn\u2019t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before \u201cSomething went wrong\u201d message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5\u2019s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks.\u00a0The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don\u2019t have \u201cpeer-to-peer connection\u201d allowed on my network.Now, I\u2019m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It\u2019s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.I had to deselect \u201cEnable Wireless Isolation.\u201dThat was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I\u2019d share with ppl.\u00a0Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.I\u2019m not sure what this will do for my\/your internet security. But I\u2019m going with it for now. And I\u2019ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I\u2019ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it\u2019s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I\u2019ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead.\u00a0Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)Echo 4are my favorite for Amazon EchoEcho Studioseems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with itEcho Show 8Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements.

The smart plug is turned on randomly when unrelated commands are given via Echo Dot devices that are not connected to the smart plug. Amazon's desire to get new features out the door fast have resulted in inadequate testing of current Echo Dot features.

{"reviewTitle":"Wish I would have kept my second generation dots","reviewDescription":"I have been an Alexa user ever since 2015; got an invitation to buy the 1st generation echo, and that device is still at my parents' house. For many years, I was very happy with the three white 2nd generation Echo dots I had here in my apartment. Thanks to their built in  headphone jacks, I had each of them connected to a pair of Bose mediamate speakers, and they sounded awesome! Everything was working beautifully, but when I heard that the 5th generation dots not only had built in temperature sensors, but also that they came in blue, I couldn't resist. So, I found a new home for my three faithful 2nd generation dots and bought the new deep sea blue ones as soon as they were released this past October.I was disappointed to discover that Amazon had removed the headphone jack on the new dots, but it wasn't the end of the world by any means. After all, these new dots do have significantly better sound. If the loss of the headphone jack was the only issue, I wouldn't be writing this review. I sometimes feel that my old echo dots understood me more clearly and made fewer mistakes, but even that, I can deal with for the most part.My biggest issue with these new dots is an admittedly weird, possibly even eunique one, but it's enough to make me seriously regret my purchase. On my old dots, I used a morning routine from the gallery; I believe it was called \"weather after alarm.\" When I dismissed my alarm at 5:00 each weekday, Alexa would say good morning and then tell me the weather. It was a great way to start my day, but unfortunately, it hasn't worked even once since I got these new dots. I've tried every trouble-shooting method under the sun: most of them multiple times, and no matter what, I cannot get a routine to trigger when I dismiss my alarm. I've tried contacting Amazon technical support on numerous occasions, and have only been advised to perform the same trouble shooting steps I've already tried. I know it's a minor issue in the grand scheme of life but it boggles my mind that I can't seem to get anyone at Amazon to help investigate more thoroughly and maybe determine whether or not there's a software bug with the new dots that is causing this issue. I've tried researching this issue on google and youtube, and there just aren't any answers out there, so maybe it is user error, although I have no clue how that's possible at this point.Bottom line: as much as I make use of the feature that will allow Alexa to tell me the indoor temperature, if I had it to do over again, I would have just kept my old dots until they stopped working. My advice would be that if you already have echo devices that are meeting your needs, give the 5th generation dots a hard pass.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673827200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Devices disappeared from Alexa app bug!!!","reviewDescription":"This is not a review for the product per se. This a review on the horrible, frustrating, lack of competence from Amazon and their team. Also a review on how crap their Alexa service and ecosystem is. I invested into the ecosystem with speakers and smart devices that can be controlled through Alexa. I added a ton of speakers and smart devices with routines that help me run my household conveniently. Unfortunately I replaced my phone as it had broken. When I received my new phone, I signed into my account only to find that I had no devices on my account. No routines. Nothing. I checked my wife\u2019s phone to see if she still had the routines and devices and she did. Here is where the incompetence comes in with Amazon. Amazon tried to convince me that the devices were registered with my wife\u2019s account without checking anything on my account. I told the representative that my wife doesn\u2019t have an account. My wife doesn\u2019t even know how to email. She doesn\u2019t even know her own email because I set everything up for her. She is technically challenged lol. I then told the representative that she was a liar and was trying to get off the phone with me as to not deal with me and the issue because according to a bunch of sub Reddit's and internet articles, this is an ongoing problem that\u2019s lasted for more than 5 years now. I then proceeded to ask my echo which account she was connected to and she clearly said my first and last name and said that it was my account that she was connected to. The representative then had no choice but to check the serial numbers on my echos to see which account they were registered to. The greatest part was that the representative said that they are not connected to that account. That they don\u2019t have an account that they are registered to.  She then asked me if I had another account that it can be connected to. What?! It\u2019s not registered with any account yet I am being asked if they are registered on another account? Whatever, so I played along. I only have one account I said, and I literally sign in for my wife with my credentials. I then told the representative that having another account would be impossible as my iPhone stores passwords and emails. So I proceeded to checked my passwords in settings and lo and behold, one account, one username and one password. She then told me that I can simply setup my devices again and will return to normal. I told her that in order for that to happen, you would have to come to my house and do it for me because for free because I absolutely refuse to. I did it once already and it was time consuming. I would have to reset a ton of devices, spend about an hour setting up routines and devices frustrating myself, all for a f*** up that has been ongoing for years by the not so great and powerful Amazon. I will be finding ways and will dedicate my time to write negative reviews and will use my influence to make sure people do not invest in such a crap, amateur, buggy excuse for a service. Google Nest and even apples home is much more stable and a hell of a lot more reliable.P.S. I had a dinner party today and wanted to put some music with my guest and ended up spending literally an hour and ten minutes on the phone with them and an additional 45 minutes just trying to figure it out on my own. Stay away! Please believe me it will frustrate you if you accidentally sign out or delete the app. Just do a quick google search and see thousands of people experiencing the same problem.

Since then I have accumulated an Echo Dot, Echo Tap, Echo Dot (2nd generation), Echo Dot (3rd generation), Echo (2nd generation), 2 Echo Autos, Echo Plus (2nd generation), Echo Dot (5th generation) and a large number of Echo smart plugs.Until recently I would call \"Alexa...\" multiple times a day as part of my daily routine - what's the weather, how's the traffic on my route to work, play my Audible book, play my news flash, turn on the lights, turn off the lights, play a radio station. Nothing spectacular, but significantly improved my quality of life by eliminating the need to run around and manually turn appliances, lights and stereos on and off. Over the years it became integrated into my daily life. Very useful on a daily level.And then came \"By the way...\". Amazon's Echo team has created an ANGER TRIGGER PHRASE with those 3 words. My blood pressure spikes 20 points when I hear \"By the way...\". I have now stopped using the Echos because of those d&*ned 3 words. If I want to turn on the lights, I do NOT want to have a conversation with the damned light switch. If I want to know today's weather, I do NOT want to know that Amazon can sell me a weather station. If I want to listen to a song from my music library, I do NOT want to know that I can get a subscription to Amazon Music for only $99.But, most critically and so mind-blowing that someone at Amazon actually green-lighted this as a feature, I do NOT in any way want to tell Alexa to play music and suddenly have it announce - LOUDLY and AUDIBLY for everyone in the house to hear - \"By the way, based on your past purchase history, we would recommend that you buy....\". OMFG. Seriously, what unsocialized person sitting their basement thought it would possibly be a good idea to audibly announce recommendations based on past purchase histories? I didn't know what it was going to recommend because I strained my throat shouting at it to \"Alexa, cancel!\" Is it going to announce a recommendation based on the gifts purchased for a baby shower? Romantic gifts purchased for my spouse? Gag gifts purchased for old drinking buddies? Tools purchased for work? Books purchased for client research work? With absolutely no idea what would be uttered by Alexa based on my \"past purchase history\", having it announced in front of guests at a dinner party was ... horrific? Moronic? Absolutely irresponsible on the part of Amazon?While I get the fact that Amazon wants to monetize the Echo eco-system. The problem is, audibly forcing me to engage in a sales conversation first thing in the morning when I simply want to turn on the bleeping lights is foolish.My take-away at this point is that some executive at Amazon made the decision to make the Echo eco-system so user-hostile (the exact opposite of user-friendly) so that users will stop using it, and thereby provide a \"business reason\" for killing the Echo product line.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"161 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691539200000}

To my horror- three times now I have woke up and had to spend the day in bed because the plug that controls my charger for my wheelchair turns itself off during the night automatically- and without my permission!I can set the timer, but Alexa still turns it off during the night for a power saving thing!My wheelchair is dead the next day and I end up having to spend the day in bed unable to get about!  This is extremely dangerous for my health-  risky for safety- and is not at all a reliable aid for elderly people!I highly recommend not purchasing this! In addition as of today the casa light bulbs no longer turn on or off with the Alexa app or at least not with this DOT.  Perhaps it's because I'm generating a one-star review that everything I'm starting to glitch on it I don't know.......At any rate, nI don't know how to override the power saving Alexa thing.This is simply an expensive experimental toy and a giant waste of money and time!  I have the pictured !ot in my bedroom which spends most of its time as you see it- unplugged so it doesn't do things I don't want.

{"reviewTitle":"Avoid! Absolutely horrible customer service!","reviewDescription":"I had 13 of these spread through my home as I wanted music throughout my home.  One day only some worked, so I called customer service to help.  SEVEN hours later, being disconnected 3 times and going through the same \u201cproblem solving\u201d tricks sometimes 4 times, I had fewer working than when I started.  7 no longer did more than tell time.  I asked for them to be replaced given Amazon took 7 hours and made the situation much worse.  I was sent an email that said once I ordered and received 7 new ones (nearly $400) I would be issued a refund.When I didn\u2019t get my refund I called to obtain it.  Amazon refused to honor the email that they themselves sent and could read.  In that sequence I was disconnected and LAUGHED at over my insistence that Amazon honor the email I received.  They refused and weren\u2019t even polite about it.  That series of calls was utterly horrible as they were snotty, arrogant thought this was funny and rude and took and additional hour and a half to get no where.  I would NOT have ordered 7 more of these but for the email saying I was going to be refunded the cost of them.Now they want me to return the ones that don\u2019t work or the new ones though the email makes no notice of my obligation to do more than buy more of them in order to get a refund.  Again the email did not obligate me to return anything.  Nor should I have to after 7 exhausting hours on the phone and I was left worse off after dealing with \u201ccustomer service.\u201dIt will take me 2 hours plus gas to get to a place to return either the new Echos or the damaged ones.  Plus they will keep my money for 2+weeks before refunding my $400.So now I own 20 of these things.  7 don\u2019t work.  7 in a box and I already know that customer support likely will not (given I was worse off having called them) make them function nor will they support their products.  Either in actuality or even politely.  So basically 14 of the 20 I have are useless to me ballpark $800.  Plus by the time I get to returning them IF I can as I don\u2019t have time to get to a UPS store I will have nearly 12 hours in this process and I still will not only have fewer working Echos than when I started but the grief, aggravation and rude treatment I have been subjected to.And given they refuse to honor their own emails on this I have zero hope that they will honor any refund I\u2019m due whether I send the new ones back or the 7 I have that don\u2019t work.  I\u2019ve asked that they contact me to resolve this and they have not!At all times I did EVERYTHING Amazon asked me to do.  Whether it was how to fix what I had or get new ones to fix the problem.  Their support staff is incapable of fixing problems and they DO NOT HONOR their OWN emails.

{"reviewTitle":"Amazon\u2019s products becoming bad quality and lagging in tech","reviewDescription":"This is the second time I am trying to post this review. Funny that it disappeared after support contacted me to follow up. Amazon, you will have to ban my account if you think you can keep me from leaving my negative review. For this, you are losing the second star that I originally gave you.There are a few reasons to not purchase this device, as I am returning this one. First, be aware that I am the owner of three other dots of varying older generations, including gen 1. Here we go.1. As stated in another review, Alexa has been growing stupider for the last year or so, but the last six months have seen an even more rapid degradation to where I find myself cussing her out more often than I am receiving what I request. For example, she asked me when setting up this device if I wanted to set up a morning routine to which I very clearly stated \u201cno\u201d standing right next to her. She replied with creating the routine. I have no idea what time she planned to wake me uo but she\u2019s back in the box. If you are new to home automation, I would look at Google\u2019s devices first due to what Bard could bring to the table in the future.2.  I ordered a black device. It came with white power cable and adapter. Amazon\u2019s solution from was that I order one of the random Chinese power adapters on here that claim to be compatible. I\u2019m sure the original is manufactured in China too, but I want Amazon\u2019s guarantee and support. That\u2019s whatI paid for.3. They claim the sound is better, but that is true only if your goal is for Spotify HD music to sound like an FM radio station playing on an 80s jambox radio. If you know, you know. It sounds BAD. It\u2019s sad my generation 1 dot sounds better.Back it goes. I\u2019m going to be ditching the entire ecosystem. Poor sound quality was the last straw after Alexa becoming less useful. Not just because upgrades are actually downgrades now, but development on improving your products is piss poor. You keep buying brands and such to integrate them but then neglect delivering on features and a good user experience. I\u2019m even going to replace my Ring cameras later this year.Amazon, get out of the device market. You\u2019ve proven that you can\u2019t keep up and now you\u2019re delivering just bad quality.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"64 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1686355200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Worst Echo Device Ever","reviewDescription":"The most critical flaw of this thing: the mic is absolutely terrible. Rarely if ever hears me correctly - yet my Echo from several generations ago in a completely different room hears me every time. I have had this thing actually respond in its whispering tone, as its mic is SO bad it thinks I am whispering at it. I am not a quiet person; no other Echo device has done this (had them since 2014). I have given it \u201cfeedback\u201d on its incorrect hearing, but zero improvement had occurred.The buttons are also totally inconsistent - in all the wrong ways. The volume buttons require a very aggressive press, and often need two presses just to respond. In contrast, the \u201ccancel\/mute\u201d button is activated every time your hand is even NEAR it. Thus, 90% of the time when you just want to adjust your volume a notch or two, you hit this button (likely due to the fact that all are in an immediate, tiny cluster and are nearly indistinguishable except at extreme close range) and end up stopping your music\/media\/whatever immediately. One thing is certain, it\u2019s great for killing the vibe!This device\u2019s only redeeming feature is a reasonable sound quality for the price, but when combined with the totally dysfunctional mic and button array, it is overall a huge step backward.Have never been so disappointed in an Echo product. I have the new Echo Pop in one room, an older gen Echo Dot (the rounded disc-shaped one), and this in my living room. It is by far the least reliable and most annoying of the three.Huge miss from the Echo hardware team.

{"reviewTitle":"Major connectivity issues","reviewDescription":"-Update 12\/9\/22I thought the issue may be with that particular speaker. After getting nowhere with Amazon support I decided to return the speaker and get another one, hoping that would work better. Still the same issue. When I paired this with the Echo Studio it caused both devices to constantly skip songs, or just shut off entirely. Not just every once in a while, but every other song! When I play music on the Studio alone there is no issue. When I try playing the group with the Dot and the Studio together the Dot messes up both of them. This is obviously an issue with the new Echo Dot that needs to be fixed. Does anyone know of any other device I can pair with my Studio to have surround sound in my clinic? I am giving up on this new Dot. I would not recommend it at all if you plan on pairing it with another device because it will cause both of them to have an issue.I bought this speaker on Black Friday to pair with the echo studio I have at work. I have been attempting to use it for the past three days. It constantly disconnects from the Internet and will stop playing music, then randomly start playing another song. I have performed a factory reset on both devices at least three times, disconnected and reconnected to the Internet, contacted tech-support, and still nothing. It continues to stop playing songs randomly, or skips to another song.I contacted Amazon support, which was abysmal. After spending an hour talking to someone I finally gave up. I want to return this device and get a replacement. They told me they canceled the replacement and cannot send a new echo for some reason. I told them I wanted to return the original and get a replacement product for it. And they told me they canceled the replacement product and could not send one to me. I am very frustrated because I had high hopes for this new model. The sound quality was decent, but the connectivity was terrible. It disconnected from the Internet every 5 to 10 minutes and I would have to go back into the Alexa app to start playing music again. Even though I paired it with the studio, it would not let me control the devices in the group that I created. I was hoping that maybe there was just a glitch with the one I received and a new one would work better. But apparently the replacement was canceled and they cannot send a new one for some unknown reason. So I will have to go back and buy it at double the price because it is no longer black Friday.

I thought it'd be nice to wake the kids to a certain song.  Since its alarms don't let you select a certain song, I decided to use routines.  I spent a good bit of time making sure I owned the song I wanted and then set up a routine listing that song in the 'Morning Music routine'.  I thought it would play the song and stop.  The fact that it continues to play music if fine.  What is NOT fine is that it does not even play the song I selected.  It just plays songs with a somewhat similar sound.Which reminds me.... I recall an evening when I asked it if it could play some soft relaxing music.  It started with a nice musical.  Then a song or two later, it was not so relaxing AND contained the F-WORD... because obviously Alexa thought that would be a good way to chillax my kiddos before bedtime.I did like what I'd found of the celebrity voices - only to discover they've been discontinued.  And we've tried out some of the fun stuff such as 'talk like Yoda'.  So far those features have been fair at best.  They work inconsistently.

{"reviewTitle":"Temperature sensor totally useless with Alexa routines.  Unreliable and erratic.","reviewDescription":"Overall, this is a much improved version of the Echo Dot and some nice enhancements.  This review is on the functionality of the new temperature sensor.  I have a small greenhouse corner in my basement where I over winter cuttings prior to planting them in the spring.  Sadly, my wife insists that I keep her ferns down there as well.  <sigh> Since apparently there are no stand alone temperature sensors that work reliably with Alexa, I purchased the new Dot specifically for the temperature sensor to control a small electric heater down there and keep the temperature between 55 and 60 degrees.  Turns out it is totally worthless for this purpose.  It works fine when you ask Alexa for the temperature, but the response when used in a routine is totally useless. I set up two routines to control the heater.  The first was \"When the temperature is below 55 degrees, turn on \"Heater\".  Announce \"Basement is at 55 degrees and heater has been turned on\".  The second was \"When the temperature is above 60 degrees, turn off the heater\". Announce \"Basement is at 60 degrees and heater has been turned off\".  After determining that this produced all kinds of results as to when the routines triggered, I ran an experiment.  When the routines announced that the heater was off or on, I asked Alexa for the temperature at the Dot.  Here are 5 examples of the results When I asked Alexa for the temperature at the dot right after the routine triggered.  OFF routine ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 65 degrees.  ON routine ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 54.1 degrees.  Off ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 55 degrees.  ON ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 54.1 degrees.  OFF ran when Alexa reported the temperature at 55 degrees.  The results were all over the place.  In some cases, the routines would run until some time of day then just not trigger at all. I researched this and found numerous problems reported on this issue.  Amazon Support stated that for the routines to work the temperature must \"pass through\" the specified temperature for the routines to trigger.....not \"at\" the specified temperature. Really?  That's ridiculous! However, that is obviously not all the problem. The results above appear to be related to when the Amazon servers poll the Dot for the temperature.  Routines are stored on the Amazon servers. Sensors such as the ones for motion in a camera, send an \"interrupt\" to the servers saying motion has occurred, triggering associated routines.  In the case of the temperature sensor on the Dot,  obviously the sensor does not send interrupts.  The routines are triggered when the servers poll the sensor and get a value that triggers the routines.  This is speculation on my part, but the wildly erratic results seem to indicate this is the case and obviously the polling is not at a specific interval.  This is exacerbated by the \"pass through\" issue. I have a thermometer down there and it appears that the sensor is pretty accurate as to the existing temperature so when you ask Alexa for the temperature, that works just fine.  If you are purchasing the new Dot to use the temperature sensor to control routines, don't waste your money.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705449600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Glad I got it on sale","reviewDescription":"This is basically a review of Alexa, because otherwise the function of this device is accomplished with a Bluetooth speaker.Pros - as others have mentioned, sound quality is pretty great for the price.Set up was also decently easy.I\u2019m sure there are more ways I could be leveraging Alexa, but given spotty performance on really basic \u201cresume play\u201d requests, I\u2019m going to be sure to set my expectations accordingly.Cons- I\u2019m generally underwhelmed with Alexa functionality.I held out for a long time hoping my later adoption would allow some of the issues to be worked out, but there\u2019s very little of what I\u2019d like the Dots to do that I can get them to do with Alexa.I\u2019m in about 800 sq feet with 3 Dots and they seem to figure out which device to play on based on my actual proximity to the one I want about 50% of the time.For context, I primarily got them tooperate smart light bulbslisten to music + podcasts  andset alarms + timers(Obviously the second 2 of these can easily be accomplished without Dots, so they were a bit of a bonus\/reason to go for more than just the one Dot to manage my bulbs.)Operate smart light bulbs:This was the biggest reason I got the Dot- to more easily turn on a light fixture with no switch. Generally works ok, although sometimes I have to repeat \u201cAlexa\u201d wake command. I also only have one lighting setup so can\u2019t speak to how this might differ operating multiple smart bulbs and\/or plugs.Music and podcast:Music-Spotify seems to work fine, although I\u2019m not sure how effective the shuffle is and wonder if it might be restarting the playlist whenever I \u201cpause\/resume\u201d based on hearing a lot of the same songs.I don\u2019t use other music services so can\u2019t speak to thosePodcasts-TL;DR: If you primarily want to use Alexa\/an Echo Dot to listen to the latest episode(s) of your favorite pod(s), you\u2019ll be fine.Otherwise, podcasts are a nightmare, and I\u2019m not even getting to the level of complexity of \u201cplay [Podcast name] [podcast episode]\u201d here.I\u2019m talking \u201cresume my podcast [on _______ service].\u201d Sometimes you get a resumed podcast you\u2019ve long since moved out of the queue, sometimes you get the latest episode. I even tried using Amazon music assuming at least their own service would be more seamless, but Amazon music podcasts are a JOKE if you want to do anything other than listen to the latest episode. I get that I may be in the minority, but Apple and Spotify make it perfectly easy to start from the beginning of a pod with a back catalog and move forward through episodes oldest to newest\/in release order.Alarms + timers: No real issue here, but I definitely didn\u2019t NEED a Dot to be able to perform this function- it\u2019s just handy to have without having to carry my phone around.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1702944000000}

Finally they admit defeat to themselves then they do their best to get you off the phone; by hanging up or just not talking or, giving you some BS about something irrelevant (eg Firestick, ITunes etc.)  They have \u201cno supervisor\u201d or, they claim to be \u201ca supervisor\u201d which is very doubtful when they didn\u2019t even know there even is a 5th generation or do not know that Alexa can turn lights on \/off.Back to the hardware, the 5th Gen constantly turns my IPhone Bluetooth off even though it needs it to work.  An unmentioned  \u201cupgrade\u201d I found on the 5th Gen is when you turn the device on you are forced to hear random music from Amazon music which you can not stop or pause until at least 15-20 seconds elapse.  BTW the \u201cupgrade\u201d to the music occurs every time it turns your Bluetooth off and you must turn it back on, which like I said, mine is doing all the time.The 5th Gen also doesn\u2019t seem to hear as well as the 4th Gen did.  At least 50% of the time when asking Alexa a question I get the response  \u201cI\u2019m having trouble hearing\u201d and I\u2019m only 3 feet from her with no background noise.Regarding sound quality, I am a huge music fan and I only hear a very slight improvement over my 4th Gen, not enough to justify upgrading if music quality is your deciding factor IMO; however; my partner hears a big difference so maybe it depends on music genre (Our preferred genres are polar opposites,)I considered that I may have gotten a \u201cdud\u201d or a \u201clemon\u201d device but Amazon refuses to even consider that because they can \u2018see\u2019 the device online, however to me that only shows the WiFi on the Gen 5 works, but not necessarily all the other functions (ie Bluetooth etc.) but it\u2019s my theory vs Amazon.I really want my 5th Gen to work and to love it as I did my Gen 4 but after 3 days and many frustrating calls I think I may return it and go back to my 4th Gen.I think the 5th Gen could be great but it needs more time in beta testing and\/or a complete \u201cdo-over\u201d.  IMO I would advise others to wait until a new version of Gen 5 is available or even Gen 6 is available.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1668297600000}

I\u2019d return this crap but I am outside the country and it would cost me more to get rid of the Echoes than to eat the loss.1. I want to be able to EASILY switch my stream from playing on speaker to another or to play on all of them at once. Alexa offers instructions for how to do this by creating a group. The instructions work about 25% of the time. Mostly they do not work. When their instructions are inadequate or wrong, Amazon offers NO  seems like a super basic 101:function, and instead it is crap.2. I want to be able to choose a podcast episode and play it. Alexa will either randomly pick some podcast I could care less about (who on earth wants to listen to random podcast episodes? That is useless). She MIGHT play the podcast I want, but she will not let me choose the episode. I can see that people have been writing to Amazon to fix this since at least 2000 in the help section. None of these people seem get any help from Amazon as their posts remain unanswered and the problem is still a problem, even after all these years they have had to address it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1706832000000}

My goal was to have an echo in every room...I have a 2nd generation in the kitchen, two third generations in master and guest bedroom, and this in the living plus the Pop in the Den.  My main issue with this one, unlike all the others that I have, is that it has trouble hearing me.  Which is surprising as it has a much bigger speaker area and, presumably, microphone.  I'm constantly screaming at it to hear me, at which point the OTHER dots wake up and think I'm talking to them while this one keeps quiet.  It's actually pretty frustrating to use.  The sound quality on this is also...ok.  But, compared to my third generation dots, I'd say that those are better, and certainly louder, which is also surprising considering the size difference.

Noticable improvement with sounds quality however I use this one connected to Bluetooth so I don't get to really experience it. Bought this one to replace a 2nd generation dot I've had for a while to sadly discover the aux head phone port had been removed so I'm forced to connect now via Bluetooth. Wouldn't be a huge problem bc it connected to my sound system just fine, however there's an audio lag. I use my sound system for playing music when I'm home (obviously) and usually I'm playing on an everywhere set up. Having Alexa in every room in my home I have all devices paired and out put to all the speakers but those one is fraction of a second off with the sound I'm assuming bc of the Bluetooth connection. Frustrating bc it's connected to the main system so you hear this audio the most so it messes up the audio if you're in any other room. Also not every time but frequently enough to become an issue, if I attempt to skip a song or go back and replay a song the music will just stop. It's actually even happened when I wasn't skipping a song. I'll try everything to fix it, closing the Alexa app reopening it playing something else reconnecting Bluetooth nothing!  It doesn't matter it won't come back on.  In fact the only thing that will work is unplugging Alexa all together and then reconnecting again. I've checked and it's not my sound system other Bluetooth devices don't cause this and I never had this issue with the 2nd generation dot from before. But every time I've listened to music this happens. Also when I'm using the group speaker feature now I've the Alexa app when it out put is set to the speaker group the app is terrible and laggy beyond tolerable, makes me want to throw my phone.  And I have a very high end phone. If I disconnect the group it will work fine.  This is a big issue if you pair your Alexa devices together.

(updated 1\/12\/2023)","reviewDescription":"We've been using Alexa for years for controlling lights, garage door opener, video doorbell, thermostat, television and streaming!  We are constantly asking Alexa to turn on or off certain lights, or changing light colors, etc.The new gen of Echo Dot has Ultrasound Motion Detection which is a game changer here!  That detection capability can be used to detect motion with adjustable sensitivity and range.  Combined with two new Routines per Echo Dot, one to turn on the lights when motion is sensed and one to turn off lights when there is no motion sensed, we've completely automated lighting in the house.  In the past week I've made the Routines time-based so we can have a brighter white light color during daytimes and a software off white light color as it gets darker outside.So far the only issue with Echo Dot was the placement of all of the Echo Dots.  Here it is very important so we can avoid unnecessary lights going on and off.  It took a week or so to get the combination of placement, motion-detection sensitivity and range dialed in and we are very happy with the results!Now there will be no more fumbling around for light switches when needing a glass of water at night, and no more wasted electric when lights are left on :)  I'm very happy with the Motion Detection features, and it makes a great addition to all of the other features of Alexa's that we use.The one con I've personally faced is now that there are some rooms with more than one Alexa device, the language I used prior with Alexa is ambiguous and she points that out.  That's why I deducted a star.Update 1\/12\/2023 - One room in the house has a dehumidifier and air purifier and they are running quite often this time of year which generates a constant background noise.  Even with Echo's Ultrasound Motion Detection set to high Sensitivity and Range, I'm finding that I have to snap my fingers or make another noise that is louder than the background noise before the lights are turned on.  However, even with the background noise Echo is able to detect when we leave the room and turns the lights off as expected.  I'm not going to deduct anything from the rating because this makes sense to me, and I believe they'll work this out with a near future updated.Overall I'm still happy with the new generation Echo Dots!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"35 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673049600000}

There are times where I must repeat myself several times, or even yell close to the device for it to respond. The responsiveness and ability to properly understand my instructions is actually worse than the 3rd generation Echo Dot.The other significant issue is that the volume level radically changes from barely being able to hear, to being way too loud.  This is particularly noticable when playing my \"Flash Briefing\" where there are many skills in a sequence, going from one news feed or podcast to another.I know that each streaming service may have slight differences in volume levels but this speaker only makes it worse compared to the 3rd generation Echo dot I was using.I suggest Amazon make audio or volume normalizing a priority.  This problem is becoming a huge annoyance as more audio streaming services are being added to the platform.Despite having to delete my voice profile and retrain it several times, voice recognition is more of an issue, being misunderstood, or not heard at all.  My old echo dot 3rd gen was much better in terms of recognition and ability to keep the volume levels more or less at a consistent level.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1682208000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Another great smart home purchase, to say the least.","reviewDescription":"My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.So, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 \u2013 aside from familiarity with the brand \u2013 was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room \u2013 the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action\/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say \u2013 though I may be wrong about this \u2013 that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only \u2013 at this point anyway \u2013 required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter \u2013 I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal \u2013 also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important \u2013 add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections \u2013 they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.Once again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome \"drop-in\" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"142 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1691971200000}

Had a 5th generation dot die last month and Amazon refuses to replace it. Gone through all their steps and just now spoke with someone in their support team. Despite the fact that the 5th generation dot gradually dying as well as following all their troubleshooting steps, echo support is blaming the issue on my phone failing to set up the device.

I have this many echo devices setup and running, have a bit of a history with this tech, jumped through every hope you want me to jump through and the issue is with my phone failing to setup the device after the factory reset you told me to do? You can't be serious? Ok so you claim to have a one year warranty on a 5th generation dot, but when it dies after 9 months, you won't replace it. I see.Above and beyond this warranty issue, the voice response of all devices is dropping off a cliff. Two years ago we would have no issues with simple commands such as \"play\" now we receive responses like \"video cannot be played on this device\"... Who asked for video? I just paused Spotify 3 minutes ago. What are you trying to \"play\"? Ok, fine, work around, \"Alexa resume Spotify\" that did the trick for awhile. Yesterday I tried the same command, \"Alexa resume Spotify\". The result? Alexa started playing an app called \"Sleep sounds\" we use in the kids room as night. Hey, Alexa, I even said \"Spotify\".All in all, I think Amazon isn't making the money they wanted to on these and they are quiet quitting the entire endeavor.

I turned off the extender function so now I just have an over priced Dot.  The reason I turned off the extender is that I discovered that the speed limitation on the extender is 100mb.  I have 1g service and the extender was causing my Eero system to lag and grind.  C\u2019mon Amazon\u2026..This is a bad deal.  You can and should do better, both in tech and in disclosure.Previous review-When I saw Amazon was coming out with a Dot that could serve as an extender for my Eero setup I jumped on it.  What a great idea.  Amazon has done a great job with Alexa products.  They have gotten easier and easier to set up, and in general they work really well.  This 5th Gen Dot also works well but the extender feature had a few wrinkles.  First, when I initially tried to activate the extender feature it immediately popped up an error message which told me I needed to download and update.  That was odd given I preordered the device and have to believe I am one of the first shipments to go out.  No big thing.  I asked Alexa to update the software and in about 30 minutes it was done.  But then, it still balked when I tried to activate the extender.  Same error message.  I asked Alexa to check for updates again, but she said it was up to date.  I tried a few more times, waited a little while, and it finally connected to the Eero system.  However, it then kept cutting in and out.  It was really unstable.  For whatever tech gremlin reason, it finally seems to have settled in and has been holding on to a WiFi signal for a while.  As is often the case with tech, I expect there will be some additional updates.  We'll see.  We'll also wait and see if this thing does, in fact, work well with the Eero system.  If it doesn't, no big thing.  You can turn that feature off and just use it as a normal Dot.

It works OK for alarms, but sometimes they turn off randomly, it works GREAT as an intercom, and it works lousy with the stories. If you have Amazon music there are some stories you can find that work ok, but you have to go in and turn them off. You can't set it to only play one. I really wish you could connect other apps to play through a set of speakers you have grouped (like a Bluetooth speaker, but several speakers), but that only works if Alexa knows that skill. Alexa knows Audible, so we bought a subscription. Unfortunately, again, it will not stop after a set number of chapters. What's worse, it does not show you what chapter it is currently playing.

It basically just tells me everything that I've done on Amazon shopping.

That quickly wore off, and you can always do that from the cell phone app without spending a dime.I definitely would recommend a different device if you are looking for an intercom. For example, the ring cameras work better than the Alexa. The only challenge there is a little bit of lag on the audio, especially when you're trying to have a conversation.

However, despite multiple attempts, the Echo Dot simply refused to connect to the eero device. I tried various troubleshooting steps, including resetting both devices, checking for firmware updates, and even contacting customer support, but none of these efforts yielded any positive results. It's incredibly frustrating to spend money on devices that claim to work together seamlessly, only to encounter such a fundamental compatibility issue.Moreover, one of the primary reasons I chose the Echo Dot was its advertised ability to act as a Wi-Fi extender. I have areas in my home where the Wi-Fi signal is weak, and I was counting on the Echo Dot to extend the network coverage. However, to my disappointment, the Echo Dot failed to improve the Wi-Fi signal strength in those areas. It didn't make any noticeable difference in terms of network reach or signal quality, rendering its purported Wi-Fi extender functionality useless.As a consumer, I expect products to deliver on their advertised features, and unfortunately, the Amazon Echo Dot has failed on multiple fronts. The inability to connect with the eero device and its ineffectiveness as a Wi-Fi extender have left me thoroughly dissatisfied. I was hopeful that this combination of devices would enhance my home network experience, but instead, I find myself dealing with connectivity issues and subpar performance.I hope Amazon takes notice of these issues and addresses them promptly.

{"reviewTitle":"Power Outages Suck","reviewDescription":"These devices are okay. Unfortunately when the power goes out your entire house will light up if you happen to have Alexa devices such as light bulbs. I like being able to change the lights different colors but it is not worth having the house light up bright white every time the power goes out. These devices are built so cheaply they don't even have a chip to remember their last set. This means if the power goes out all the lights turn back on and you have to get up and manually turn them off. Defeats the purpose of having the Alexa device which is kind of a pain. She only listens half the time and very rarely responds correctly. I think the line of Alexa devices are as much of a failure as the Amazon Halo was. I feel they deceptively market this product not letting people know the amount of stress it will cause them and hopefully somebody with enough money will bring this to their attention legally one day. I'm considering removing every one of my devices. Very disappointed Amazon, you could do better. Add a chip to let the devices removed their last setting, it really won't break the bank.

{"reviewTitle":"Moving from Gen4 to Gen5: A touch disappointing for Team Cheap ancient people.","reviewDescription":"I couldn't pass up the introductory price that included a Philips smart LED bulb. We're Alexa-fying our house as a means for dealing with reduced mobility and increased age-related incidents and needs.Yeah, we're really old. And that tempers our overall response to the Gen5 Echo Dot, which could be summed up as \"Meh.\"We were perfectly happy with the basic Gen4 Echo Dot but found that when we wanted to add another unit, G4s are no longer sold except as 'refurbished' or 'open box' - plus the G5 intro bundle was really low cost.The Echo platform is exceptionally useful for our applications, which are out of the ordinary if you're young. For example, we've used \"Alexa, turn on all lights\" a couple of times for dark-of-night incidents where light has been a boon backdrop for noodling out various solutions. Light (literally) brightens up your mood when your mood is under you-just-awoke-suddenly pressures.Plus, while our house is quite modest, it's well built and pretty sound-proof, so yelling from the bedroom to the basement office just doesn't cut it. We now have Echos in every key room, so 'Alexa, drop in on everybody' gives us quick access to a house-wide intercom.But now for our disappointment. We actually have some usage for decent music reproduction, and the 3.5mm headphone output on the Gen4 Echo allows us to plug through to ancient but high-quality computer speakers scavenged from local thrift stores.No such plug is on the Gen5. Our cheap music solution is no longer possible. Sure, we could use Bluetooth speakers, but units with sound quality comparable to quality, vintage computer speakers are (a) a lot more expensive and (b) require pairing, which I've always found quirky\/intermittent\/frustrating with Bluetooth. Because we are really old, simply plugging a stereo jack into a Gen4 receptacle just seems easier and more reliable.And, while I kind of wanted to taste the new, higher Gen5 sound with increased bass, what I'm hearing is clearly designed for boom-a-boom thumpity thump popular music. It probably won't surprise you to find that sounds eagerly sucked up by 15-30 year olds isn't really what ancient folks like us want. Jazz, classical, (dare I say) Enya, even \"Eres Tu\" with its really nice descant at the end -- this is more our range, and it's stuff that requires reined-in bass, un-tinny midrange, and balanced treble.So, between audio engineering decisions and the audio-output de-contenting, for us, Gen5 is not a step up from Gen4.Like all Echos, build quality is outstanding, software capabilities are outstanding -- in fact, incredibly exciting and clearly with few limits -- and the spherical design is minimalistic and very pleasing. It was great that it took nothing more than plugging it in to marry our new G5 unit to all the other Echos dotted around our house. I'm not sorry we added a Gen5 unit, just not jumping for joy.I find myself pigeon-holing it with all the other recent New! New! Product stuff floating out there that offers less, removes wanted accessories, and otherwise pumps up corporate bottom lines at the expense of what (some) owners want.I may come back and add some more praise for the new temperature monitoring some day, but at the moment, we are years away from an Alexa-compatible thermostat...","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"250 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669075200000}

After Amazon laid off 10k people, most of whom were on the Alexa team, the quality of Alexa has dropped enormously!

I have searched the internet and have found that a lot of people are having the same issues as me in the last month. Most of the issues that have recently popped up are:1. Roughly half of the time, Alexa can take a very long time to answer. It is somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds.2. Many times I have to ask Alexa multiple times for it to actually respond.3. Most of the time, the response has nothing at all to do with the question asked so I have to rephrase the question. Sometimes it takes three to five times to rephrase the question. If after the fifth time it doesn't work, I just give up.4. If you own multiple Alexas, there has always been a problem of asking Alexa a question, and it responds on a completely different Alexa. It seems to have gotten much worse lately.I feel like Amazon has given up on Alexa, so it is a sinking ship. I am looking at what other product I can use to replace it with, but am hesitant to go with the other two major brands because they could decide to do the same thing at any point.

Only problem is, the new speakers will not let you play other music apps, you must play Amazon prime music.

For prime members Amazon unlimited music was supposed to be $8.99 a month, then I got notification that it was going up to $13.99 a month. So I canceled Amazon prime music. They have become too greedy, it's not like we don't spend enough to begin with buying their products and yes we do get free shipping but that is a benefit of membership of any company.

This company is not what it used to be.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1702771200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Impossible to set up","reviewDescription":"I purchased this for my mother who is 93.  I also purchased an \"Echo Connect\" on EBay as it's no longer manufactured but \"supported\".  She has a land line and limited bandwidth WiFi.  So the Echo Dot plus Echo Connect seemed like an ideal solution.  Boy was I wrong.Setting up the basic connection was relatively painless.  But sound quality is crap out of the box.  It was designed for EDM or hip hop music and not voice.  So to understand Alexa, you need to reduce the bass level in the equalizer setting.  This is especially important with anyone that is hard of hearing.Here is the most annoying experience:  there is really no support to set up an Echo Dot on a PC.  There is a legacy program that sort of works.  Otherwise, you have to have yet another \"app\" for your phone.Fine, I can use either one.  But it's IMPOSSIBLE to set up the Echo Connect even though it's listed as a supported device.  Each time I click on Echo Connect, it takes me right back to the add device menu.I just wasted $100.  So I wouldn't feel cheated, I tried to use it myself despite my discomfort with the entire creepy nature of this system.  But it seems if I want to listen to music or anything else I can get on YouTube for free, I can't.  I must purchase subscriptions to both Amazon Music and Audible.  F*** that!  Hopefully I can dump this thing on Craigs List.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1690848000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Amazon themselves have made this thing useless...","reviewDescription":"This thing is a great upgrade over the previous v2\/3 we have. The sound is way better for one, BUT it is also a totally redundant piece of junk at the same time, unless you want to invest $120\/year to make it worthwhile, which also makes it one of the worst investments you can make.Allow me to explain something which many people already have already realised: A lot of people use this for kitchen timers, weather reports and maybe the occasional fact from Wikipedia, but most people who buy this will want it for an upgrade for sound quality for Amazon Music, and this is where I consider this thing junk.Without any consultation, Amazon have decided to allow normal Prime users full access to the WHOLE 10 (or is it 100?) million song library, with a small catch. You can no longer listen to what you ACTUALLY want to listen to, you have to listen to a shuffle of 1 or 2 songs you want to hear, plus all the random junk in that 10\/100 million playlist, and that's a lot of junk.You can no longer listen to your albums you bought WITHOUT shuffle, you can no longer listen to ANY album without shuffle, and you now have to listen to totally random nonsense too. If you used to use Alexa to give your kids a lullaby to go to sleep, they might also get some Sex Pistols mixed in. Sweet Dreams !!UNLESS, you upgrade to unlimited - only $120\/year - some would consider that a bargain for a peaceful nights sleep, but considering it was part of Prime but is now locked behind a paywall, I personally have a different view.1 star is all you're getting for this blatant money-grab and betrayal of customer trust !","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"43 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1669334400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Sound SUCKS! very disappointed","reviewDescription":"So, I have a house full of the prior generation  ( 3rd Gen) puck-shaped echodot devices, and have found that they provide impressive sound.  Unfortunately, they seem to have a propensity to blow the speakers.  I recently bought this 5th gen to replace a blown 3rd gen and WOW, what a disappointment.  The sound never attains the full. rich quality I am used to.  A bigger problem is that there seems to be some kind of excessive shaping\/processing going on because there is a very noticeable surge in the volume and tone while playing music.  It's like there's a mischievous kid turning the tone or balance knob from one limit to the other about 1x\/second.  Between this surge and the weak\/thin tone it is very distracting to try to enjoy music.  At first I thought perhaps it was an issue with the power supply, so I swapped with another echodot, but no improvement.  I suspect a firmware update might fix this but Amazon provides no easy way to force-update any of their devices.  If this is the future of what Amazon device quality is going to be like, I am OUT.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1701475200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Randomly plays Spotify in the early morning-even when do not disturb is set","reviewDescription":"Got this as a replacement for a first generation Alexa, and it is going right in the trash. For the past two weeks, it has woken me up in the early morning playing Spotify. My Spotify is not shared. My wifi is not shared. I live alone. No one requested this thing wake me up before dawn, and no activity shows in the Alexa app. After the first time and wasting two hours with Amazon's useless overseas reps, I decided, oh, maybe my Spotify account was hacked (even though I recognized all the devices using it). So, I changed the password. I also disabled and then reenabled the Spotify skill. The next weekend-the same thing: Woken before dawn by Spotify music I didn't request (which doesn't even show in Spotify, proving it is an Amazon issue).Look it up; many people have had this issue. Take this piece of crap back, Amazon, and thanks for ruining two weekends in a row.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1705708800000}
