{"reviewTitle":"Poor manufacturing process (lacks correctly sized drill holes for mount) poor service","reviewDescription":"This is the most frustrating purchase I made. As work demands for growing for a dual monitor system upgrade, I proceeded to buy this Samsung product. Upon arrival I noticed something was off, the drill holes were not correctly sized, I nonetheless figured it was minor and the mount \"set in place\" , but felt wobbly\/off. Over time this only got worse, the monitors side by side would not form uniform line, one leaning out forward and curving, obstructing the other. It didn't help that I had an insanely busy work schedule where it was hard to immediately address this, I figured I'll very soon exercise the 1 year warranty. I call Amazon first (since I'm Prime, thinking they can help me), and the first chat rep says he will help me, but then lies and gives up says they are closed (Samsungsupport is 24\/7 so not true) and then asks \"do you want me to follow up w\/ rep\", only to shortly retract their statement saying I need to. I get busy again,  a few days go bye, and I try the Amazon again who does the same tactic (initially offers to help, and pretend to contact Samsung, but then retracts and says and then says I can call Samsung my self. Fine, no issue, I call Samsung, and immediately he gets defensive and vents his frustration about prior experience with Amazon about this and how they handle these situations saying this is on Amazon who damaged it during delivery. He demands I get an Amazon rep on the call, which we do (by now 1 hour has passed on call), amazon rep comes on and they go briefly at it, until amazon says they'll refund it. Initially I am relieved, but then I'm told I got to pay 2 restocking fees for both monitors which were damaged before they got to me (likely during production).  The 1 star review is for both Samsung and Amazon service in this particular order and being bounced around by both with neither party willing to help each other. Until I can get rid of these horrendous dual mounts, my neck will continue to strain, wish me luck and will try again to take this up with customer service.

Got progressively worse and there was no troubleshooting fix.  Samsung's response:  'you should have bought the extended  warranty.'  They gave us the name of a repair shop that 'may or may not be able to fix it' and it would certainly cost almost as much or more as we paid for it to begin with.

{"reviewTitle":"DO NOT BUY, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.","reviewDescription":"So, I was so excited to get this monitor! I know Samsung makes some good phones, so their other products should be peachy too, right?Wrong. I got this in the mail and set it up before I had to leave for work. I had the HDMI and everything working. Then I turned the monitor off and left for work.I got back 4-5 hours later (shorter shift that day at a local restaurant) and turned the monitor back on. It knew there was an HDMI in there, but the screen would blank and then turn off. I tested different HDMI cords and even a separate monitor to make sure it wasn't something like my GPU, which would've been a whole lot worse if that had been the problem instead of the monitor. Couldn't find a proper way to reset it, and the power\/joystick thing was tripping out. So, I disassembled the monitor, repackaged it, and the day after I got it, I returned it.I'm going with a different brand this next time around. I don't normally leave reviews, but ever since I started heavily using Amazon a year ago, this is the first product that was so horrible that I felt the need to take the time of day to repackage everything and ship it back immediately after getting it.I've seen reviews for other Samsung monitors, and if there's one takeaway I have from this experience, Samsung's monitors are not worth any money and are total garbage. If you want a monitor that will last and the Amazon return window is still open, get that thing sent back immediately. The other reviewers say Samsung's customer service\/PR department will be no help, and after this experience, I'm just gonna take their word for it.Ciao!M.

{"reviewTitle":"I'm sorry, my dear old friends.","reviewDescription":"I feel terrible to have to give my Korean friends a bad review, but... Samsung has finally let me down. It was bound to happen sooner or later. This 27 inch curved monitor came in and it worked for about... a week.Then, one night, I was playing some DOOM and I noticed that there was a slight discoloration on the bottom of the screen with a flickering thin white line at the very bottom. I closed the game and ctrl+alt+deleted into the lock screen for it's solid blue background. I was heartbroken to see there was a discolored bar across the bottom of the screen about 2 inches (5 cm) tall. It looked like low resolution masking tape.I shut down my whole system and after about 10 minutes I turned it back on. The bar was gone. Great! 5 minutes later while watching some YouTube, the bar comes back! Depression. I couldn't even finish my sandwich. Depression.At this point, I was in disbelief. Is this happening? Me? Product defect? Samsung? Is my monitor going to explode now?! I did not want to believe that the monitor was the problem. It HAD to be something else. Maybe its the cable! Swapped out HDMI. Tried it on DisplayPort! No! Maybe its my graphics card!! Pulled it out!! Plugged into the onboard. Noo!!! Maybe its my power outlet! Break out the multimeter! Nooo!!! Software! Settings! I even disconnected the monitor from the PC and turned it on without anything connected to it and the bar was still there on the cold, lonely, dimly lit black screen. I never seen discolored blackness before, it was like an off...black. Flickering...off-blackness!I'm writing this review while waiting for a response for my return request. I never had good experiences returning anything online. And I'm not one of those butt-hurt reviewers that will totally alienate an entire company over one tiny defect! I think Samsung does \"flat\" pretty well, but definitely not \"curved\". At least not yet (Jan 2017). I wouldn't recommend this particular monitor to anyone I like. Not this model. Nope.

{"reviewTitle":"Amazing Picture very reasonable price!","reviewDescription":"After finally purchasing a couple MiniPC's for both business and personal use, and using an old LCD 21\" Wide Screen Monitor I had, I was finding that I must be spoiled by my 4K TV because the picture on that monitor which I thought was wonderful, just seemed so dull and it did not support 4K which I have come to love to watch 4K videos etc.I wasn't really sure what monitor to get, but I wanted something much larger, supported 4K, and that was at a very reasonable price. I did a lot of searching Amazon's product lists for monitors, and I came across this monitor, and I noticed that it was a curved screen. While I have never owned a curved screen anything, I had seen them at the local electronics store and was darn impressed. So I was very curious about this monitor because it had all the specs I was looking for, at least 27\", Wide Screen, Support for 4K, Native Resolution of 1920 x 1080, LED, and had a curved screen. When I also noticed that it was a Samsung, I was pretty excited to learn more because I have always had very good luck with Samsung products and in fact, I have only had one Samsung product ever fail, and that was a mobile phone that should have stopped working years ago with what It went through.Not knowing much about monitors these days, I started reading the reviews that were written on this monitor and I asked the community a couple questions. The answers I got back to my questions sealed the deal for me. Everyone who responded had nothing but great things to say about this monitor and provided me in info I needed. So I decided to go for it.When it got here, unfortunately the first one had a broken screen. It appeared that it was packaged that way since the packaging was factory sealed but the packing was broken on the inside. Needless to say I returned it but Amazon really stepped up to the plate and sent me a replacement next day, so I was only delayed by 1 day getting to use it. Because the first monitor came with a broken screen, I am going to assume that the screen may be a bit on the frgile side as my old monitor has been dropped, and the LCD screen never had any issues, I don't know jf the screens on LED monitors are more easily broken, or If this was something that someone really dropped hard before packaging, for this reason I gave the durability 4 stars)Setup was a breeze! Just had to put 1 screw to put the base stand together, and that was it. The stand is about the only thing I really don't like because the base that sits on the desk is an upside down chevron shape, which sticks out in front of the monitor a few inches. This makes putting it on a small desk where your keyboard would be in front of it a bit of a pain because the keyboard has to be pulled closer to me and just gets in the way to me. I managed to get around that by putting the monitor up on a little shelf I made out of a box and an old Laptop lap desk that I had. It perfectly raises the monitor by about 4-5 inches, and let's me push the keyboard further back to where I now have more room on my desk.  (Images added to show the base and how I worked around the chevron styled base to give me more room).The monitor has one HDMI port and one Display Port. Now I am not familiar with the Display Port, but all my devices are HDMI, so plugging in a PC is simple. In fact, I have 3 MiniPC's that I need to connect to this monitor so I bought a 5 port HDMI switch. This allows me to easily switch between each MiniPC with just a click of a button.The picture on this monitor is absolutely phenomenal!  Once I plugged in the HDMI plug, turned on the monitor, it automatically scanned for the signal which it found right away and WOW! What a gorgeous picture. The colors are very bright and vibrant. The dynamics between the Black and White colors are stunning and the color definition is very vivid. For never using a curved screen before on a computer monitor, I am very impressed. It almost immerses you in to the picture and almost gives it a extra dimensional view, almost 3D in nature... The thing I worried most about with a curved screen was is there going to be any distortion with a curved screen and I am happy to say. \"Absolutely Not!\". The images looks perfectly flat, but because of the curve, it pulls the outer edges our of your peripheral vision and closer to your focused view when looking straight forward.Learning how to use the toggle button on the back for adjusting the settings van take a bit of getting used to, however, at this point, I haven't really needed to use any of the options other then Sleep and Shut Down as the defaults seem to be perfect for my setup.Unfortunately this monitor does not have built in speakers however, if you have speakers connected to you computer or use a set of Bluetooth Speakers you will be just fine.Overall my impression of this monitor is fantastic! The picture quality is stunning, and the size with the curves screen is awesome. I would recommend this monitor to anyone who wants an excellent monitor for home or office at a more then reasonable price. While I have not used the monitor for gaming, I have used a monitor that has the same 4ms refresh rate and that has the same native resolution  of1920 x 1080 and that monitor is over 10 years old and still holds up today, so I can only imagine that this monitor would be perfectly fine for today's games.  I am definitely glad that I went ahead and purchased this monitor, and should I need to replace the monitor that I amusing as  a secondary monitor, I will likely purchase another one of this model!  Again, Highly recommended and over all this monitor gets a full 5 Stars from me! ~","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"120 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1539993600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Oh boy where to begin...","reviewDescription":"It's been awhile since I've left an Amazon review but this monitor is worthy of my time for sure. I've been staring at pc monitors since the mid 80's and I have never experienced anything like this Samsung, which I might also add, Samsung-oh how far you've fallen. Back in the day Samsung was pretty reliable and pretty good quality, I've owned several over the years. This is my first 'curved' monitor so I was intrigued and excited, especially after spending hours reading reviews on monitors in general, it always seemed like the 'most recent' negative review wiped out the tons of prior positive ones so it took some time to decide. First, I agree with one review here stating the off-color in the corners, yes mine has it as well in three out of four corners, not a huge factor once something starts to play. Second, yep it's ALL shiny plastic, wasn't sure if it's considered Sleekly Cheap or Cheaply Sleek. Third, and this is the Most Annoying 'defect' I've Ever experienced with a monitor and I will try to explain it accurately...I currently have three monitors and the pc that this Samsung is connected to is used primarily for streaming Live TV in the background while I work. The main channel I'm viewing is CourtTV, I mention this in case anyone else has the same issue. CourtTV has Alot of commercial breaks, almost Every Single Time the commercial starts, the sound cuts out, And, half the time the video screen will freeze. You might think this is a good thing, But, whenever CourtTV comes back on after ad-break, I need to Refresh my screen to get the sound back! Every Single Time! Now, considering I'm usually on the opposite side of the room working, I need to go back to the pc to do this! Once in awhile, after refreshing often, it will perk up on its own, but this is a rare occurrence! This is Not a pc issue, as I've simply changed monitors, not pcs. I've never experienced anything like this and as mentioned, it's Incredibly annoying! And finally fourth, and this is the zinger here...it Won't Turn Off! Yes, I've no idea why turning off a monitor now requires a Two-Step process! Really? So once you press the button in the back, a little pop up appears onscreen along with brightness and etc, problem? They don't do anything! I can't 'press' it, I can't move my mouse or use my keyboard, so either it stays on 24\/7 or it requires a manual unplug Every Single Time. So, anything good about this monitor? Well, it looks nice. Would I have purchased it? Nope. Am I disappointed? Yep. Would I recommend this for anyone else? Only if you plan on watching non-interrupted programs\/movies, NOT streaming w\/commercials. Video gaming? Possibly, I did try a quick game from my Steam and it 'looks' good if not the same as a typical monitor. Final thoughts, I was excited then disappointed w\/ incredibly tedious issues i never expected from just a monitor, I certainly hope other people have better luck with this if the decision to buy is made, although I will suggest maybe spending another 50 bucks or more and shoot for better quality in the price range, you DO get what you PAY for, and Samsung is just not what they used to be.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1642982400000}

It has made working from home SO much more bearable.As for picture quality, I have no complaints. Everything seems nice and clear. It's not 4k, but I've watched movies on this plenty of times and been very happy with the image quality.Finally, brightness. It's very bright, and bright white at that. I've turned on the \"eye saver\" mode since I'm staring at excel all day. The eye save mode is very nice, and tones things down appropriately. That reminds me, the little know system to control menu options is actually really nice. It's a little joystick sort of thing on the back, so you've got left, right, up, and down, and you click it to select. Really simple, works perfectly.Anyway, I'm really happy with this, and I'm thinking about getting a second one, which is why I came back to this product page.OH!

I had ordered two of these months ago, and they were delivered in a timely fashion. However, even though they came together, the packaging was so different, and I didn't quite understand why. One had foam, one had bubble wrap. One came with instructions\/setup guide, one without. One had everything needed to assemble, one did not.For the longest time I thought one of them was just missing a necessary screw to put it all together. After talking to Samsung a few times, and waiting many weeks for the delivery, I was finally able to receive the screw needed, only to then realize the whole base is wrong. Granted, I probably could have realized this earlier had I checked more thoroughly, but this also wouldn't have been an issue if it was packaged correctly in the first place. The only reason I was really able to figure anything out was because I had ordered two. At this point after waiting so long for the delivery of the screw, it's too late to return (and I don't have the packaging anyway) so I guess I gotta go make some more calls to Samsung. Needless to say, I'm pretty frustrated. So yes, if you are lucky and get everything packaged correctly, then it's a wonderful monitor.

Recently I got some new furniture for my office that required rearranging and I decided my wildly cluttered desktop needed to be cleaned up. I purchased a floating monitor setup to help declutter everything and today rearranged and mounted up my two monitors.Here's the problem - to remove the last part of the base stand you have to REMOVE THE COVER of the monitor, which means when you're using a flathead to pop open everything you're about 1\/4\" away from touching the innards of the monitor. Inside there are two screws that connect the base to the monitor, which is about the dumbest design decision you can imagine.One of my monitors made it out unscathed, the other is toast now with the right side of the screen apparently having been compromised.Long story short, if you're going to use the stands this comes with, you'll be fine.

So, if you need a monitor, it certainly works, but if you have any expectation that it will behave with anything like what the TVs or other monitors do, then keep looking. Maybe Samsung has a better one, but now there are SO MANY models it is hard to sort through what is what.SAMSUNG, if you are reading this, why do you need to have so many models? Just make a few good ones and make it easy for us to choose. And don't make dumb versions of stuff.

{"reviewTitle":"Great right out of the box","reviewDescription":"I had bought an Acer KG1 Series monitor during Prime Day this year because it had a 144hz refresh rate. However, out of the box, the colors were all sorts of terrible. Despite trying over and over to get the colors right, the thing was just plain bad. So I returned it for this Samsung. Right out of the box the Samsung's colors were fantastic. It helps that it's an IPS monitor, so the color accuracy is much better - but seeing them side-by-side was striking. The Acer had a weird tint to it, either too blue, too green or too red. I couldn't find a setting to make the whites actually look white. The Samsung is super crisp, just the right level of brightness, and the whites actually look white - which is really important when creating graphics.The curve on the monitor is slight, so things don't look too weird curving around the screen. It's too bad IPS monitors get so expensive when you go to higher refresh rates. If this monitor had a 144hz refresh rate it would be perfect. But the 60hz is still smooth enough for most work applications and many games. I'm not a FPS player, so having the slower refresh rate isn't really all that noticeable.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1565136000000}

{"reviewTitle":"So far, so good...","reviewDescription":"Needed to pick up a quick monitor replacement due to one of my two (flat) 24\" Samsungs suddenly dying on me (have had them for a few years and typically use them 8-10 hrs\/day). Was already thinking about upgrading my WFH set up to 27\" curved monitors - so given the replacement situation I found myself in, I decided to go ahead and pull the trigger on one of these inexpensive Samsung options. Delivery was same day with Prime, which is always a huge bonus.After installing it and dialing in the screen settings a bit, I'm generally happy with the performance and use I'm getting out of it...at least so far. I typically don't do any gaming or heavy movie\/content watching from this particular set up, so the screen and picture quality are fine for my general work needs - I'm not in need of high dollar\/high performance monitors. As long as this thing holds up over some time, I'll be purchasing another one to swap with the other 24\" I'm still using.One note worth mentioning (not sure if others may have mentioned this), but if you're looking to mount this monitor on adjustable arms (not using the provided desk stand), you can do this; however, you'll need to pick up some spacers (not provided with monitor) so you can get the separation of space needed from the mounting bracket to the backside of the monitor - I used 1\/2\" spacers that I already had on-hand and they work fine. Some may see this as a pain in the neck, but it's an easy solution. It'd also be ideal if the portion of the desk stand on the back side wasn't permanently installed and was able to be removed, but is what it is - not a make or break for me...as long as the monitor functions properly, that's all I care about.Again, I can't speak to quality\/performance when it comes to gaming or watching movies, but if you're looking for an cost friendly option to upgrade or if you find yourself in a similar situation that I did, I'd recommend this monitor.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1703980800000}

With this very large monitor, the pixels are noticeable, and the text is simply blurry. I have played with all the various adjustment menus, but it did not make a noticeable improvement. I checked on line to see if the settings were wrong, but there's nothing.  I went through the usual ClearType adjustments, but it did not help much.I have a Samsung TV, which I love. I hoped the quality would come through on a computer monitor - FAIL!NOTE - I returned the monitor for a refund already","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1497830400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Best monitor I have ever owned!","reviewDescription":"Have you ever sat in front of your computer and realized that your monitor is just not quite right and that it is time for an upgrade but the last few times you spent very little and got some nice monitors but now... it's time to pamper yourself? This is what happened to me. The monitor that i was using wasn't cutting it for me anymore. I wanted to upgrade and I remember earlier this year at one of the major electronic stores, I saw for the first time a curved monitor that was huge and was approx. $800 and I was going buy that monitor when the right time to upgrade came!The other day, I did some amazon research on the monitors and it was surprising to see such a wide price variance between model to model and brand to brand. Thankfully the reviews help. I came across one review that said these monitors are not good for spreadsheets and when I read that, I then changed my mind and decided to go with purely flat and looked to see if I could find any good deals.Yet, something was telling me... I have to have the curved monitor. I do spreadsheets, yes... but I also work with photos and videos and for the price, why not? It would be worth it and if it doesn't work out, then I could easily buy a cheap flat screen just for spreadsheets and documents or send this monitor back.I ordered this very monitor, Samsung, and curved! The shipping box was very light and I loved the fact that you could tilt the box on it's short end and carry it that way. When I got the monitor home, unboxing was a breeze and assembling the stand was very simple. The screen does tilt, which is nice. This monitor does have an external power supply, but it is very small and lightweight and would rather have it external in order to keep the monitor ergonomic and light. Within 12 minutes, I had the monitor assembled, plugged in and turned on and receiving a signal.I am blown away by the sharpness, quality, and how my photos and videos look on screen, no matter what angle I am at. The curve helps me to keep focus on the center and it is a very cinematic and interesting view. I did test out a spreadsheet and actually like it curved! I am so glad I didn't abide by the other review and not get this curved monitor.This monitor hooked up nicely to my Mac Mini. The Windows 10 VM opens up nicely as well. I do love this perspective and thankful for the cost and for all the other reviewers that helped. If I ever wanted a monitor side by side, or for another pc, I would certainly get this one. I am used to buying cheap 32\" tv's and using those as monitors but having a dedicated monitor at 27\"  offers so much more clarity in the text and photos. I feel like 27\" is the perfect size.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"14 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1477440000000}
{"reviewTitle":"Good Monitor","reviewDescription":"I wanted a wide monitor so I could work with two or three windows open at the same time without having to go with multiple monitors at a single workstation.  I know that this is touted as a \"gaming\" monitor, but I am not a gamer.  I am a writer, so mostly I use LibreOffice and\/or FocusWriter to compose stories and set up the book's layout.  I also manage my home library from this station and it is useful to be able to display information on, say, a hundred-year-old German language adventure story and the fields of Library Thing at the same time when I am entering information.  It is also useful when entering data into a spreadsheet from online bank statements and\/or mutual fund reports.  The monitor fits into the space available on my desk and does not crowd the other items there.  Assembly was simple, and though there is an owner's manual, I did not use it.  The back of the monitor has standard VGA and HDMI interfaces and perhaps others.  I used the VGA interface with my \"antique\".  The Fedora Core 33 OS had no trouble adapting to the new monitor.  The curvature of the screen took a few minutes to get used to, but after that initial adjustment period, I no longer really noticed it.  All in all, I am glad that I bought this monitor, saving myself the difference in the cost of a television with an HDMI interface which I really did not need in the first place.  I've been using Samsung devices for some years now and never had one that failed to perform well.  The only one of their products that I've ever had to replace was the television that my adult severely autistic son put his fist into during a tantrum.... and even that one COULD have been repaired I suppose as only the screen was broken.  I don't think you could go wrong with this one and while you can get perfectly serviceable monitors these days at second hand stores for five bucks, this one will outclass them by a wide margin.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1619049600000}

Once it arrived, I unboxed it, everything was wrapped up really well and I could tell that there would be no room for damage in transit, this is a key detail of buying anything with a screen from online!A few of the key features that I personally love:Design:The base is minimal and matches the curve of the screen. It isn't large or clunky, and blends well with the curve. The edges and back\/side of the monitor are very slim, it can blend in with most surroundings while still feeling immersive. The curvature is perfect if you have it elevated about 8inches off of your desk like I do.Quality:The pixel resolution is perfect. I sit around two feet away from the monitor and I can't see a single pixel. For the size of the display, that is very impressive.Overall:I love everything about this monitor. The only thing I would change, is that when my computer is off, the power light on the monitor flashes, which can be fairly annoying at night. Otherwise everything is perfect!

All cables were included and it came with some written material that was completely not needed to get it set up and turned on. Once on the monitor is stunning! The size is a bit larger than my old one but I didn't want to go to big so 27\" seems just right. I really lose myself in it. It's bright, and has a brilliant picture. The curve is also just right. Too much would be too much. It brings the edges of the screen in closer. The settings are via a toggle button on the back that's very easy to use.

When I first got it, it was straining my eyes pretty fiercely and I actually processed a returns order for it.  I decided to take a few days before boxing it back up to see if I could solve the problem, and I think I found a combination of things that work just fine.First, I increased the scale of my display to 125% in Windows' display settings.  Icons and text were too small at 100%, and increasing size seems to have helped a lot.Second, the \"eye saver\" feature is great if you'll be staring at text or websites for an extended period of time.  I don't use it while watching movies or playing games, and don't need to.Third, I picked up some bias lighting by Antec and stuck it on the back of the monitor and together these three things appear to have eliminated the issues I was having with eye strain.It's a sturdy, excellent display that looks beautiful and works wonderfully.

{"reviewTitle":"Entry level curved monitor. Good browsing, computing and casual gaming screen.","reviewDescription":"Easy to set up, came in a comically large box. Took some getting used to visually, and the color isn't as nice as it would be on a more expensive monitor. It wasn't an expensive monitor though and I'm very happy for the price I paid. Probably should have bought two, but then I'd have to buy a display cable.The controls being on the back, a staple of Samsung's television design, is a bit annoying. The little directional control works just fine, but having to reach around the back of the monitor just to mess with the menu is somehow more cumbersome than having buttons and (God forbid) a bezel to hold them.Freesync is nice if you've got a compatible card. I don't, but the feature is there when I make the inevitable shift back to AMD GPUs.It's big, it's nice.

The monitor does come with freesync, but the response time of the monitor isn't great and leaves contrast trails. I believe that this monitor is good, but not great, some more reinforcement on the back button or a higher quality switch would have been better and would make this monitor get a 5 star from me.

{"reviewTitle":"best curved monitor for home office","reviewDescription":"Bought two of these 24 inch curved samsungs and I am in LOVE. Before I say anything else if you are a SERIOUS gamer maybe get something slightly more expensive.. If you are working from home, making music, or want to have a bad ass new set up for once get these.. I know im slightly biased because I'm a galaxy nut, but they are exactly what I was looking for. They are 1080p so the picture quality is perfect and exactly as advertised as far as I'm concerned. If you're a picky gamer pay 3 times as much for slightly better resolution and a higher frame rate and stop crying. Read the description its 60 hz which is all I need. I bought a type c docking station, connected it to my samsung galaxy flex alpha, and if you have two extra monitors make sure that it supports triple display, so double check that unless you only plan on connecting one monitor. Or double check if you use Mac, I know those are weird. One hdmi cord from each monitor into the docking station and you're rolling! No speakers, but I use a jbl flip via aux cord to laptop if im not wearing headphones anyways. Was not planning on mounting them when I originally purchased, but the way the stands are, it makes the monitors look like they're slightly off center when side by side, making a seamless connection between the two nearly impossible. My desk is not able to have a C-clamp mount so I bought a free standing mount and now they line up PERFECTLY. Very happy with the picture. Settings aren't complicated, i.e. my dad could figure out how to make it look good and he can barely send a text. Game mode automatically changes the settings to a great picture but has the brightness all the way up. I love it because next time you go to use your computer it's back to normal.. unless you choose game mode always on.

I do not have an AMD GPU, so I can't speak on the sync for smoother gaming. However, combined with the EVGA 1070 and some settings tweaking, my games look good and feel good on the eyes. For the work aspect: I work in spreadsheets, Engage LiveOps (Serenova) and am web browsing all day doing customer service as part of a digital team. The monitors are run through a Lenovo dock powered from my company work laptop. As before, taking the time to tweak settings made the monitor shine. It was fine right out of  the box, but was most satisfied after settings tweaks. The eye saver mode is actually coming in handy for long work shifts. I noticed a difference at the end of shifts compared to when I didn't use it, but obviously it throws off the color, so won't be handy for photo editing or anything color oriented. I use this monitor as my main monitor and a smaller flatscreen 21\" as secondary. I just ordered another one of these 27\" curved as I realized I grabbed all windows from the 21\" and brought them over, making myself less productive.I'm very happy with my purchase and with Samsung on this monitor.

There is a bracket type thing for the stand to connect into on the backside of the monitor that looks like it should come off but I found no way to remove it this leaving it sticking out from the back an inch or so. This allowed ZERO room to be able to tilt the screen down once it was mounted in the space of the other monitor I had. I made something out of a block of wood that cannot be seen so that it protrudes out from the wall enough so that the screen can tilt down and allow that bracket to be out of the way.

The stand is easy to snap together without tools while still feeling solid and sturdy.

The white is bright, the black is dark, and picture quality is wonderful. This monitor replaced my 23\" Vizio TV that I'd been using as a monitor for seven years, and it could only do 720p, so upgrading to full 1080 was a big jump for me. That being said, if you're looking for a high-performance gaming monitor, this ain't it. Good luck finding one for 200 bucks. It's not 4K and it's only got a 60hz refresh rate, so anyone who insists that 144hz+ is the only \"real\" way to game is gonna have to look elsewhere. But that isn't the fault of this monitor, thus the 5-star review. It doesn't claim to be high-performance gaming equipment, and it's not priced as such.

They were not wrong. But there is some adjustment needed to get an outstanding picture. My solution, that took awhile to discover, was to put the monitors in cinema mode and use the Nvidia control panel to make the adjustments. I do not play any 3D games that require AMD freesync so I cannot comment on that. The games that I do play though are so much more fun to play on this monitor because when setup correctly they just pop of off the screen. I also see more detail in the darker areas because of the 3,000 to 1 contrast ratio. The continuous curve of having three of these monitors side by side is also very pleasant compared to having three monitors angled together. They have no internal speaker though so I had to buy speakers. I ended up getting a 32 inch sound bar and connecting it to one monitor with an auxiliary cable and placing it just behind the monitors. I was worried that the sound might not be so good however the sound is great. Also there were no bad pixels!

{"reviewTitle":"My first curved screen","reviewDescription":"I work from my home office as a software engineer so I'm in front of my screens practically all day. I bought 3, two for me and one for my wife. I replaced two 24\" HP flat screens with these bad boys. These being my first curved screens, I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't like the curved effect (it seemed a bit gimmicky to me), however, I couldn't be happier. The brightness and clarity of these screens are also superior to my previous screens. I fiddled with brightness, sharpness, contrast but, in the end, I didn't have to tweak them all that much. The default settings are pretty nice. While these screens are larger, they still have a max resolution of 1920 x 1080 so don't expect a super fine HD quality image.They were a breeze to assemble. Just snap the base into the slot in the monitor. I like the stand itself. It's very low profile and leaves more space on my desk for my keyboard (wireless, illuminated, Logitech K800 - I suggest picking one up) and mouse (Microsoft wireless laser mouse 5000 - nothing fancy, gets the job done). When I bump my desk there is a bit of a wobble to the screens but it's not bad or very noticeable. Sometimes when I'm vigorously typing away, I will get a little wobble, but, again, I remain unperturbed. I was crossing my fingers (figuratively of course) when I pulled the screens from the box and examined them for damage. The surface of each of the three screens I purchased was in flawless shape and after getting them hooked up, I looked for any dead pixels, color lines, etc. that would be a no-go. I'm pleased to say that all three screens were in top shape.I primarily use Visual Studio and I found that I had to change the font from the default Consolas to another, finer, monotype font (I found a free one called Monofur that works perfectly at 12pt) in order to optimize font clarity and lines of code on the screen. With these screens Consolas at 12pt was way too big. And simply reducing the font made it ugly (pixelated, blocky, etc.) so I wanted something better. I'm not sure how well the screenshot will translate to your current screen but I've captured a little snippet to share how clear my screen looks to me.As for the curved effect, I was a bit concerned after reading other reviews, some of which go on about how terrible they are for spreadsheets. I'm not sure what that's all about since I find that these screens are ideal for looking at long lines of text across the screen for extended periods. When these screens are in front of you the curve itself is almost imperceptible. As I mentioned, I use two screens sitting side-by-side and I find that these perfectly wrap my work area in a more immersive way that my previous non-curved screens. My wife works on the other computer as an editor (so again lots of text and spreadsheets) and she absolutely loves it.The ONLY complaint I have at the moment is that when I sit these two screens adjacent to each other, the tops\/bottoms don't line up perfectly. One edge is raised about 1\/4\" over the other. I haven't fiddled with the monitor positions too much to see if I can correct it since I don't really notice it while I'm working. I have a few thoughts on how to remedy it if it actually starts bothering me so I really can't complain.Overall, if you're looking for a nice upgrade to your current screen without breaking the bank, these screens will do the job nicely.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"331 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1536278400000}

I put a lot of effort on trying to calibrate the monitor before I do a print run. Which highlights the issues below.MAJOR CONS:- You have to hunt on the Samsung website to ascertain that the gamma adjustments are Mode1 = Gamma 2.2, Mode2 = Gamma 2.0 & Mode3 = Gamma 2.4- There is no information on the \"Color Tone\" (which is really color temperature). Settings are Cool 2, Cool 1, Normal, Warm 1, Warm 2 & Custom. Samsung needs to at least make the color temperatures for each of these settings available on their website. Better yet, do what my Viewsonic monitors do and just state the color temperature on the display as you scroll through these settings. (Same with the gamma settings.)- Have yet to get it to actually meet the NTSC color gamut specs on a chromaticity diagram.OTHER CONS:- As many have pointed out, this monitor has no speakers.

When installing Windows the screen is just blank even though there is actually is an image being sent out from the integrated graphics or video card during windows setup. Sure this isn't completely unusable but this is just basic functionality a monitor should just stick to whatever input you set it.

I then looked around the frame and saw that at the bottom part, the bezel\/frame and back plate were not flushed and I could not simply flush them into place by pushing them together. All I could think about was how light was going to emanate from the bottom edge of the screen and annoy me. At that point, I decided to test the monitor, and lo and behold, 2 ugly solid dead pixel lines ran vertically through the screen.Being from Guam, I'm quite disappointed in receiving a defective product because returning items and waiting for a replacement is quite a hassle here.

I have watched YouTube videos of this conundrum, but refused to believe Samsung could have produced such a flawed product. So I studied the user manual, which clearly shows exactly how to remove the stand. However, the external screws they say should be removed do not exist. So I reached out to a very kind and patient support person at Samsung, who tried to step me through the same process outlined in the user guide. I sent photos of the actual monitor, which he and other support team members studied and compared to the user guide. No luck.

{"reviewTitle":"DO NOT PURCHASE -- Backlight Bleeding","reviewDescription":"Bought this monitor with very high expectations, I've been a long-time fan of Samsung products but was extremely disappointed with the quality of this monitor. I purchased this monitor only 2 months ago and have barely used it at all. This week I started noticing backlight bleeding spots on the screen. Spots are starting to appear on the monitor and are very noticeable when the screen is dark. A shame that this product would do this after only 2 MONTHS of use.

Should\u2019ve returned it when I first bought it because now I have to go get a new one. At least I know not to get another Samsung. This picture does not do it justice. It also leans forward.

One is fine, but one of them has a section down the entire left side of the screen that waves and shakes.  It's difficult to look at.  The eye saver mode works well but discolors everything, so screenshots will not look the same as they do when the eye saver is turned off.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1698537600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Worth it when it works.","reviewDescription":"This 27\" curved monitor looks great, it is lightweight, and the picture quality is great for my application. I used it as a double monitor setup for work, and as my main monitor when I play my Xbox One at my desk. I have no complaints with what I just mentioned, I am a satisfied customer.However, the reason for the low Star rating is that this monitor randomly turns off on me and before people start asking the basic \"have you??\" questions, I have done the following:I checked all connections, HDMI at both ports; I tried different HMDI connections; power supply connection at outlet, monitor, and the block itself. I have made sure that there is plenty of air space behind the monitor so that heat doesn't built up behind it. The Energy Saver mode is off.Like I said before, the monitor turns off random and the picture does not come back. I have to turn off the power and turn the monitor back on. This is a huge inconvenience during my work hours as it tends to turn off during meetings, specially when I am presenting. I used to have a cheaper Dell monitor in its place and I never had this issue.Also, there is a few dead pixels, but I am not concerned with that since most of the time I am working with Microsoft office applications that have white background. This just adds to the questionable quality of this product.Everything else is great, except this huge inconvenience. Perhaps I received a bad batch, I don't know. I tried everything possible minus adding drivers, though I doubt that is the reason because my Asus 27\" monitor does not have this issue and I have never had to install additional drivers.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1612483200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Came DEFINITELY used. Not \"like new\"","reviewDescription":"I ordered two of these monitors. One came packaged well, the second not so much. The plastic frame had to be snapped shut. It was already on when I plugged it in, and the cord they send with it was not an HDMI cord like the other one. The picture quality is also more dingy and noticibly different than the other even when both are set to factory default.The one that came in is a solid monitor for the price. If you're going to buy these for general use, don't go for the \"used like new\" option because it'll be a gamble.

Rather than just attaching it with a screw, you have to lay it face down and brute force the thing off. Even having cushion supporting the screen I still ended up messing up the monitor to where it is now unusable.

{"reviewTitle":"OK for movies, but look at a different solution for work.","reviewDescription":"I purchased several Samsung C27F398 monitors for a multi-monitor setup.  The picture quality of these displays is inferior to the 6 year old ASUS 24\" they were meant to replace, and the buyers should be aware of what they are.  First of all, just like many other monitors, \"LED\" only refers to the back lighting source.  It is still an LCD panel, which can be manufactured with a number of processes:  TN, IPS, VA, etc...  TN is the worst in terms of color accuracy and contrast ratio, and is exactly what this monitor uses.  As such, if you really spend a lot of time working with graphic design, modeling, or editing videos, this monitor is not for you.  Specifics below.PROs:1. Stylish2. Curve feature is interesting after you get used to it...CONs:WHITE BALANCEAbsolutely awful.  All three monitors, configured with the same settings, were displaying different hues of white - ranging from cool to warm.  Settings were manually applied with all dynamic features turned off, yet I was unable to make them look the same.CONTRAST RATIO3,000:1 static, and MEGA:1 dynamic.  While claimed numbers may seem inspiring at first, there's a significant amount of light leakage from backlighting, and the panels glow at night, something that you won't be able to fix in lieu of the LCD panel being a TN type.PANEL TYPEAs mentioned earlier, this is a TN panel.  IPS and VA are far superior in terms of how they manage light gating, which is direclty responsible for color accuracy and improved contrast.  Discard everythign Samsung claims and invest into an IPS or VA type panel.Photo below shows two monitors displaying different hues of white - which is unforgiving.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1511913600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Angled Downward - Requires Separate Mount","reviewDescription":"I'm trying not to be extremely disappointed with this monitor but it has a major flaw - it's angled downwards and unable to tilt in any direction. Reading reviews, most people who wrote good reviews seem to have replaced the mount, which is what I'll have to do I guess.Right now I have it set up on a shoe box riser so it's not as bad but already my neck and eyes hurt from having to view at a weird angle. I really don't understand the point of this position and why they made it as such except to get you to purchase a new mount. It's so stupid.The same time I got this screen I got a Sceptre curved monitor for $100. That one actually seems better, having a straight-on angle. So if you are looking at this and are not an extremely sort person who looks up at their screen anyway... you'll have to get a second mount.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1667779200000}

This display, is absolute junk for me.1) it\u2019s angled so that it\u2019s always pointing down. This might be fine if you have a desk where you can place it up high, I don\u2019t have one.2) #1 wouldn\u2019t be a big deal except the display isn\u2019t adjustable! I\u2019m very tall so this display is constantly pointing at my navel.3) the stand is awkward for small desks.4) and this is the worst part\u2026 I know it\u2019s a 1080p display which means it\u2019s going to run at 1920 x 1080, but images and fonts have kerning. That\u2019s the rough looking to fonts that makes them look like steps rather than being smooth. And font smoothing is already on. That means the 1080p stretched across this display is working against the quality your OS is trying to push.I could have dealt with 1-3 with a little woodworking and jankification, but I cannot take poor image quality.Returned.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1643500800000}
