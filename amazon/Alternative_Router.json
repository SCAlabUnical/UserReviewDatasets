{"reviewTitle":"Very good for better range, speeds over wifi, but TP-Link needs to revamp their config app\/browser","reviewDescription":"The coverage on this router is incredible, I used to have cat6 cables running everywhere in my house up and down, room to room... But the dogs, they'd take down our internet and TV with one bite. Also the router I had been using was a Tri-Band gaming router, not the best for coverage of a 3,000sqft multi-story home, that's nowhere close to being open concept.All the wires had to go, not only were we running out but having wires all over the floors is dangerous, trust me I tripped on one and fell head first down 11 flights of stairs, not fun.It was time to take my fiber service to the max and go all wifi. Although I do want to state that I do still have a cat8 cable running to my desktop because no matter how great your wifi router is you're not going to beat a wired connection. But i talk a little bit about that in one of my other reviews for the cat8 cables I am currently using for gateway >router >desktop.I must admit I had troubles setting this new wifi 6 router up with my ISPs outdated gateway\/modem. But that was all on the ISP and eventually got the proper gateway (ax support) for the service I've been paying for years now.Once that mess was handled it was not too difficult to set up, I still had to do some advanced configuration but that was just an annoyance.So how fast is it? For a MU-MIMO wifi router having almost 20 devices running off of it at the same time, it's unbelievable. One caveat, this is not a great wifi gaming router (talking mostly FPS), so if that's what you're looking for look elsewhere, ASUS has an incredible one or right now, yet if your house needs to run on mostly, if not all, wifi like mine, you won't be disappointed. Another caveat, don't expect ax capabilities on all your devices, it's fairly new so the chances your older and even newer devices support ax are pretty slim. But it is backwards compatible so your other devices should have no problem with their older standards.I mostly bought this Archer AX6000 for its range, MU-MIMO and future proofing my home.I've tested the speeds I'm getting on the Archer x6000 on all my devices and I was amazed, sure most of them don't support ax but because of the extended range and MU-MIMO capabilities, I'm definitely seeing higher speeds and such an extended range, it's crazy. For example, I ran a speed test on my phone using the older AC3200 gaming router and compared that to the Archer x6000.The AC3200 was giving me around 330+\/-Mbps, which really isn't bad but then I ran the Archer x6000 and it blew that number away reaching over 800Mbps... That's amazing for a phone. Then I ran my ASUS gaming laptop, with the AC3200 I was averaging around 650+\/- Mbps, the Archer made it up to 890Mbps ON WI-FI (just to note, I tested all devices the same distance away from the routers, had the routers in the same place in the house, same set-up, only one router connected to the gateway\/modem at a time using the same cat8 cable)So that sounds great right? Well it is, but unfortunately just because the range is much better, does not mean you're speeds won't drop the further you get from the router. The good news is that I can still get 350+\/-Mbps on my phone and 550-600+\/- Mbps on my laptop way out in the backyard. Something the AC3200 was NEVER able to do even when I moved it downstairs as close to the door as possible.As for their app for setting up the router on your phone or tablet, you really can't do anything, especially after their latest update. The GUI is pretty basic, on both the app and using a web browser. The web browser is definitely the way to go to set this thing up, Tether their app just basically shows you connected devices and has a speed test option but it's far from perfect. When I first set up the router I was able to configure the router on the app, why they dumbed it down is beyond me, but the browser is always the way to go anyway.So yeah I had to take a couple stars away for that. Also they make this huge deal about the RGB lighting, when in reality it just lights up a tiny square in the top of the device and is not bright at all, so pushing this feature about being able to turn it on or off for \"sleeping\" is moot.Even though the configuration is disappointing and the features are nothing compared to D-Link or Acer's configurations, I'd definitely still recommend this product to anyone who's got a large home, multiple devices requiring wifi, and isn't bothered by the lack of config options.If you need a gaming router and have a bigger house just create an AP or get some extenders for the floors you don't need blazing speeds on.Hopefully in the future there'll be more and better updates to the config system. I'm sure once ax starts becoming standard TP-Link will get on it. One can hope.Overall B+","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"20 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620432000000}
{"reviewTitle":"VPN\u2019s and questions about security and privacy","reviewDescription":"If I were rating this router on its most basic functions, then I would give it five stars:  (1) It gave me strong and fast Wifi in most rooms.  (It is somewhat weak in my most distant room, but the 2017 TP-Link router I used previously did not even reach that room.) The Ethernet is also good.  (2) It took me just five minutes to set up.  (3) The website and app are easy enough for basic router functions.Nevertheless I am disappointed in this router, the company, and their tech assistance on questions of security and privacy.  One of my motivations for upgrading to this router was to be security-conscious. (I don\u2018t know too much about routers, but I know that the first piece of conventional wisdom is to always replace routers that are no longer supported by regular firmware updates, and this was true for the 2017 TP-Link that I had had\u2014with their last firmware update in 2017!)As part of my security-consciousness, I was also on the market for a new (VPN-compatible) router in order to add a VPN (NordVPN) to my router.  I now feel misled by this TP-Link product because both their website and this Amazon page suggest that it is possible to add a VPN to the router itself (as a Free Agent or whatever it\u2018s called\u2014as opposed to merely using a VPN for individual devices like a laptop).  It turns out that TP-Link decided to remove the option of adding a VPN for this model of router, and it didn\u2018t bother to make this change apparent.  At least as of last week, TP-Link still posts instructions about how to add a VPN, but these instructions refer to an interface that does not exist on this new model..  The TP-Link tech personnel I was in contact with were very emphatic and clear that there is no way now to add a VPN to the router.  (I do not have the knowledge to know for sure there isn\u2019t some technique or work-around, but they sounded convincing enough, and there is no longer a place in the firmware interface to add a server.)If the company had been transparent up-front that this is not VPN-compatible, that might be a different matter.  For sure, I would not have chosen to buy this router. And I would not waste time knocking them in this review.But I also wonder about the company\u2018s possible motives for deciding to change from a practice of permitting a VPN to disallowing them.  Perhaps there is some advantage for a router company to be anti-VPN that I am not knowledgeable enough to guess?  Myself, I can\u2018t help worrying about the fact that this company is based in an authoritarian country that goes very far to make the internet un-free (including making VPN\u2018s illegal for its citizens).  I would never assume all Chinese companies or individuals are in sync  their government, but this no-VPN policy actually looks exactly in sync!I take it that a router like this has access to all our traffic.. I guess this means we are placing a fair  amount of trust into the router company, and now this particular company has chosen to make it harder to keep our traffic private by preventing a VPN?  I don\u2018t know enough to know if this worry is reasonable or not.  (I find it weird that I could not find any online information or debate about such questions.)  My  own activities are too boring to be of specific interest to a bad actor, but I wonder if there could be more general risks to consumers in the future?  Should the political\/digital system in the home country of one\u2018s router company be a factor in whether to trust the router?  I am clueless.  But I can\u2018t help feeling a little uneasy about the fact that this company that just prevented me from putting a VPN on my new router is a company based in a country that does not want its citizens to have digital privacy. ):","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"169 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1663804800000}
{"reviewTitle":"You Get What You Pay For","reviewDescription":"A lesson in buying smart. Yes, it works, has nice features, and was very easy to setup (one minor exception being that the web interface didn't allow scrolling and some setup options were out of sight until I zoomed out). Throughput, though, is not its strong suit. I was replacing an older Netgear Orbi RBK50 mesh system (Wi-Fi 5\/802.11ac) hoping to take advantage of Wi-Fi 6 and the 802.11ax adapters in my newer computer. I also thought I had a problem with the Ethernet hub on the ORBI, but that turned out to be a problem with the BluRay player that was connected and\/or the cable it was connected with (disconnected for testing). That said, with gigabit Internet service that measures very close to that connected directly via Ethernet, and with devices verified to have an 802.11ax connection with the TP-Link AX1800 (802.11ac with the Orbi), both bandwidth and latency measures were consistently better with the Orbi: typically, 50-75 mbps faster both peak and sustained, and greater than 1 ms less latency over the course of 10 attempts. The Orbi also attained maximum velocity more quickly and sustained it through the duration of the test. In contrast, while the TP-Link attained maximum velocity fairly quickly, it consistently dropped to about 60% of that after a few seconds before slowly returning to near its max velocity by the end of the test. I believe this was as close to an apples-to-apples comparison as can be performed without being in a lab and testing with only one connected device. Both routers (in access point mode) were in exactly the same configuration, physical location, and antenna orientation, and the test devices were the same distance from the router - 4 feet away, direct line of sight. Only one other device was connected (Ethernet) at the time - an Ooma Telo IP phone device. While I predicted less total throughput for the TP-Link with more devices connected, since the Orbis are rated at 3000 mbps and the TP-Link just 1800 mbps, I still expected better results over Wi-Fi 6 with minimal devices attached. It just didn't happen, even under the most favorable conditions I could provide. Of course, the ORBI with one satellite (tested with the satellite disconnected) cost >$250 and this TP-Link AX1800 only cost around $75, so it's probably appropriate to say that you get what you pay for. If you want a reasonable Wi-Fi 6 router, don't have a lot of devices to connect to it, or (especially) have a more typical 300-400 mbps Internet connection, the TP-Link isn't a bad option, especially given the price. If you have a lot of devices and an Internet connection that can do it justice, though, spend the bucks on something like the current Orbi mesh system. My rhetorical question would be whether Wi-Fi 6, 6e, or 7 is really worth the investment for the vast majority of us anyway. Even with 1 gbps Internet service and a relatively small living area to serve, it wasn't worth it for me. Meanwhile, the TP-Link AX1800 is back in the box, sitting in a closet, and ready to be my pre-configured backup device in case my now almost 5-year-old Orbi fails.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"11 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1706227200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Fiber Ready? Not for Me.","reviewDescription":"My town recently installed a new fiber network, and so I excitedly signed up for the speed of 2 gigs per second. Knowing I'd need a new router capable of such high speeds, I went hunting for a router that was capable of bandwidth of at least two. Ideally, it would also have parental controls.Well, the TP Link AX6000 looked perfect, the reviews were great, and it indicated it was capable of 2.5 gps - that's a whole half a gig above what my service was even offering. Perfect! I watched a few online reviews first to verify, and they all insisted the speed of the device was as advertised. I've connected multiple home Wi-Fi networks in my lifetime, so I wasn't worried about any of the setup involved, and sure enough, setup was easy and painless. So far so good.Then I ran the first internal router speed test. It measured 1.1 gps up and down. Not horrible but . . . not really what I was hoping for on a new fiber connection. Still, I figured it might be a fluke, or any number of other factors. Then I noticed some nights my connection would slow to a near crawl. It would often come back, but there was still that period of time where it wasn't very impressive. I then did another internal speed test . . . after one week of 1.1 suddenly it dropped to below .5 gps. What in blazes? It's stayed there for weeks now. Never again hitting the awesome 1.1 and certainly nowhere close to the 2 gps. This thing is supposed to be able to go up to 2.5 gps . . . what gives?So I brought in some other routers. One was a loaner from the ISP - theirs tested at 1.9 gps right out of the box and over and OVER again. Never before have I been so envious of people leasing their routers. Then I brought in a few that some friends were using . . . they were also in the 1.8 - 1.9 range. This one? Still stuck below .5 gps.The parental control features are awesome. I REALLY want to like this router, and yet, I just can't feel good in my mind using my new fiber connection at speeds largely slower than my old cable connection. Most of the time things function okay . . . but then they'll suddenly slow down for a while. I reached out to TP-Link's support center and I think I got an android, and not a particularly intelligent one at that.Buyer, beware. At least from my experience, if it's blazingly fast internet you are after, that's not really what you're going to get with this model.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"10 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1714348800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Great at first, followed by declining performance","reviewDescription":"I guess I'm just done with TP Link. The last router I had from them was a mid tier AC router and it was an excellent value at first. I do pretty extensive testing with a router and I was getting excellent speeds outside, down the street, etc. As time wore on, this degraded to the point that it was useless unless I reset it every day.So I assumed, okay, it probably is due to the performance of the cpu and memory capacity. If I get a higher end TP Link router, with a superior chipset, it will likely take much more to ever reach that point, thereby increasing the longevity of the router's \"brand new peak performance\" by a long time.Unfortunately, that has not been the case. I did the same kind of testing, and this AX6000 exceeded my expectations in that regard, so I was very hopeful about the future with this router. It ended up being a lot of the same, though. As time wore on, I began noticing that I no longer am getting 400-500 mbit in the bedroom, to the eventual decline where now I can barely get a signal in the same spot. It isn't a case of wireless interference either. 1) There are no strong nearby 5 ghz signals to interfere 2) I can fit it on to exclusive channel ranges with no interfering routers and still experience the trouble 3) If I channel hop, still same issues 4) even at 160hz on DFS channels, still the same issue 5) I can enable the 5 ghz wireless signal directly from my modem, which is sitting next to the router (normally disabled) and even with the interference from my router, works perfectly.I don't get it really, I'm not sure if there is poor quality hardware in tp link devices that doesn't stand up to the heat of a high performance router, or if their firmware updates make them progressively worse, but whatever it is, I have had bad results with TP Link and unfortunately will have to look elsewhere to find a router that suits my needs.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1704153600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Lacks Luster in the details","reviewDescription":"I'd probably give less stars solely based on what I'd consider a poor, lacking interface (when comparing with other routers)  but the great signal strength keept me from giving fewer.  I really want to like this router, especially since I had a huge coupon on it, but the lacking luster may have me return it.  Here's some shot & long...* The thing is freaking huge.* Antenna aren't detachable, and tilt out ONE direction.  What you see in the pics is what you get.* Throughput speed (hardwire and wifi) is good I guess.  We get some dropouts time to time (hardwire & wifi)* Speed tests are all relative to your service, and your own hardware & network. We have 1gig service, and all CAT6 LAN.  Average speeds: 850 down, 550 up, but speed tests aren't real world.* WiFi signal throughout our small (2100 sq ft) three level house is REALLY strong.  No need with MESH with this model.  We have ALL bars everywhere.* LED is BRIGHT or off.  At least it has scheduling ability: only an off\/on time schedule.  No multiple times.* Used chat tech support for some info.  Like most - not thorough with reading questions or info, and slow to answer with the \"correct\" info.  I found they completely miss the mark, again, because they're not thorough.You can read the rest of the LONG... but in short - I may be returning this router for one short coming I discovered (mentioned next) It may not be important to some, but it's on the edge of being a deal breaker.THE LONG:We have devices that only ride the 2.4ghz frequency.  One of the reasons we purchased this router was to have the ability to split up 2.4 and 5ghz frequencies instead of just combining them like a lot of routers do now.  This router can split or combine.  However, I discovered while you can split the frequency SSID's - there is no separate list of wireless clients in the user interface.  Just one big list, and no way of telling which device is on what.While our 2.4ghz devices will automatically go to that frequency - your brand new iPhone may also be sitting on 2.4 as well, instead of 5ghz and not ever know.  Where today's router technology is now - this should be a given capability.  We currently have around 55 wireless devices (and growing) so this is an important option to have.Maybe I've been spoiled by other routers today.  Another user interface pet peeve -- the device icons are really generic, and unlike other of our routers, it doesn't catch 90% of the devices listed names.  I mean... the interface doesn't EVEN seem to try to guess what device is.If a device is a camera - you'd expect to see some kind of icon for a camera.  You get a generic (*) asterix.  We've had older Linksys routers that even show manufacturer specific device icons.  Nope, not with this one.  I don't even think you can change the icons (like some routers allow) at least I've not seen the option yet if it does.It just kind of chaps my hide when you spend $300 on a near top of the line router -- you kind of expect to have more (specific) control, or more abilities.  Not everyone wants it, but at least provide the option to users who do. might update this later.

My old Netgear R6020 worked as expected , No issues other than the fact that I was mislead that it would be faster than 100mb. Recently , I added a lot of devices to my home network. Running speed tests I could get as high as 90mb...Research told me that this Netgear router was in fact a 100mb router... I am paying for a 150mb internet speed...I searched many routers and decided on this one. Setup was fairly easy ...And making a TPLINK account lets me control this router from anywhere. That's a pretty awesome feature to have . So , I used the same Network logins as my previous router , Enabled the smart device , and let the router do its job. Some people had issues with the smart network feature , but I updated the firmware , let it boot up , and all 13 of my devices were instantly connected. They are a mix of wired , 2.4 , and 5g devices. All 5g devices connected properly. Now , the test I was waiting for . The speed test...All speed tests now result in over 160mb ...I am a happy camper . The phone.  Computer , video cams , are all faster and the signal strength is great. I am so glad I chose this router , and I think you will be happy with it also !UPDATE : After playing with all the settings for a couple weeks , I chose to disable \" smart connect \" and run the same name and password SSIDs for the 2.4 and 5g . Enabling Smart with multiple devices let's the router control the network...With it off it lets the device control it . Some of my dual frequency devices were dropping to the 2.4 network ( which my security cameras are on ) with smart connect enabled....A flick of the switch and now that the devices choose the network , 5g devices tend to stay on the 5g network all the time.

{"reviewTitle":"It works and is secure!","reviewDescription":"I wanted a more secure WiFi router while also saving money on the rental from my cable provider, so I was suggested to purchase this by a very experienced tech and cyber security wiz. Now, I personally don't feel that I know much about anything technical these days, but I have really enjoyed this so far. Performance wise, but more than anything I REALLY love the security of the back-office type of controls the TP-Link gives you.PERFORMANCENow, my current home is 1500 sq ft and a split level home, so most of the areas I use WiFi at home are never too far from the router. I placed the router right on the TV stand underneath the TV so that certainly is as close as it gets. When I'm upstairs (technically 1.5 levels up from the router) I still seem to get fine enough WiFi when I'm browsing on my phone. I will say that the WiFi randomly cuts out for me, but, this is definitely an issue I had with my previous equipment so I don't blame the router itself, it is my provider. Or the wiring outside my house.. not really sure. I have noticed however that when the service does go out, ever since changing to the TP-Link, the service returns much faster and I never have to reset it. With my old provider-provided router, it would be out for hours and I always seemed to have to manually reset the equipment. So in summary, the service and performance for me has been exemplary!SOFTWAREThe primary reason I got this was to make sure nobody could hack into my WiFi. With other routers, I am not sure if the same service is available, but this was the first I've ever seen it. Yes... we all know that WiFi is password protected. BUT. Someone can easily hack into it, right? Well not with the TP-Link! You can access the router security through the routers IP address, and you set a password for that as well. The user interface is pretty simple for even a dolt like myself to understand. You can control who can access your WiFi by using a blacklist or a whitelist. A blacklist means that all who have the login details *except* for specific IP addresses you've blocked can access. A whitelist means that ONLY the IP addresses you have added to your list can access the WiFi. I am using the whitelist, since I do not want anyone random or unwanted accessing my service. Let me tell you, it works perfectly! Sometimes I forget that I have this setup, and I have tried many times with many different devices to try and access the wifi... heck, even the guest network, that I thought was specifically setup for this, doesn't seem to let random users access it. It also shows you who is currently accessing it, although I find that feature doesn't seem to be totally accurate sometimes. I give the software 5 stars for the simple fact that it is so easy to control access through it.SUMMARYOverall I am very happy with this purchase. It does what I want it to do, very securely. Setup was a little confusing because if I recall correctly, nobody could access it until we were able to get into the back-office software and setup password first. Other than that I really have had no issues and enjoy using it. When I need to change a setting it is super easy to get in and make any adjustments.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"61 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1652313600000}

{"reviewTitle":"A Spectrum Internet Customer's Point-Of-View","reviewDescription":"As A Spectrum Internet CustomerI had a Spectrum Advanced WiFi router that does 2G and 5G on the same WiFi network. There is not a way to split the networks in two. If you have a cell phone that is compatible with device steering and you use to connect your 2G devices to, you can call or chat with their Internet Repair support team to set up a feature on your cell phone that may allow the 2G devices to connect but it can be a hit or a miss and it's too much of a hassle to keep calling\/chatting to set this up with as the feature is enabled for only sixty minutes. If the 2G device is connected before the hour is over, it will remain connected but if it's not, you'll need to reach back out to try again and you'll also need to reach back out for other new 2G devices only that don't automatically connect to the 2G network.This is a major flaw for an \"Advanced\" WiFi router. Customers paying a monthly $5 fee to lease their routers should be able to either split the networks in two or leave them as a single network for band steering. Outside of this, the Spectrum routers are fine. However, it's just better to get your own router.It would be great if they offered more advanced routers with more features such as VPN's, hiding network SSID, splitting the 2G and 5G networks, guest network and more. I'd pay $5 more a month on top of the already $5 charge for this. This way customers can select which router they need for their home and still get customer support for it.As A New Customer For Echo Dot'sThis is the reason why I purchased my own router. I purchased four Echo Dot's, 5th generation, '22 release. All of them connected to the Spectrum WiFi router without issue and individually they operated great. However, the Echo Dot's have a \"multi-room audio\" feature where you can play music all throughout your home. This was my entire reason for getting these in the first place. This feature was a hit or miss. Sometimes it would work but most of the time only one or two would work and trying to get them all re-paired so I could say, \"Alexa, play Discover Weekly from Spotify everywhere,\" was a huge inconvenience and took too much time.After going online and reviewing forums such as Quora and Reddit, I could see what the issue was. The Spectrum WiFi router would switch them between 2G and 5G based off of interference and signal strength throughout the day and if even just one Echo Dot was on a different network than the others, it would throw off the multi-room audio so that it wouldn't work. So the hunt for a dual band router began.TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX21) ReviewThe TP-Link AX1800 Router has been amazing so far. It arrived on the same day that I ordered (Thank you Amazon and of course, most of all, the delivery drivers). When it first came in, the first thing I noticed was how ridiculously light it was which kind of made me nervous about the purchase. The router itself came very nicely packaged, nothing was damaged.I followed the instructions to the letter but the router was not showing any lights on there after plugging it in once the Internet modem came back online. I re-read the steps again and re-checked the power connections and tried unplugging from both ends but not luck. I honestly thought I got a dud. I looked on the back of the router and saw a button and pressed it in; all the lights began to show and I could begin the setup process.I use an iPhone and when I pulled up the TP-Link App to set up the router I couldn't help but notice its low star rating so I opted not to download the app and instead login using the IP address (the instructions provide you with this information and how-to as well). This is my first time ever logging into a WiFi router without the use of a mobile app and I have to say, it is significantly better and heavily preferred. I was able to turn off TP-Link Smart Connect so that I could have two separate SSID's for the 2G and 5G network. I could also see there was a whole new host of features that I did not have prior such as hiding your WiFi networks from neighbors and having a guest network.I also did a speed test and they all came back higher than normal and my computer noticeably moves faster when browsing the Internet and streaming video despite being roughly around the same speeds (before it was around 310mbps download\/9mbps upload; now it is at around 360mbps\/13mbps upload). Maybe the 50mbps DL and 4mbps UL makes a huge difference. I'm not entirely sure. I believe the difference really comes from the router provider a more stable\/stronger connection than the Spectrum router. The signals itself are just healthier now.I also like that the TP-Link router has antennas, four of them to be exact, that you can see. The Spectrum routers don't have these and if they do, they're within the router itself. I believe routers with antennas that you can visibly see operate better and send stronger signals.Did This Resolve My Issue With The Echo Dot's?It absolutely did. I re-connected all four Echo Dot's to the 2G network, which was kind of a pain as well to do (but well worth the time and effort; it would've been significantly easier to do if I originally connected them to a dual band router in the first place) and ever since then I have had no issues with multi-room audio. Anytime I want to play music from all four Echo Dot's at the same time, they all play without issue. Which is great because I plan on purchasing more for a more surround system environment.Final NotesIf you need a dual band WiFi router that is able to split the networks in two so that you can sign into them separately, this is it. And honestly, if you have a Spectrum router, this is a major upgrade for a fraction of the cost. Just make sure you keep it clean of dust, and keep it in a well-ventilated and cool area of the home and this will easily last you 2+ years. It saves you money and it works better. It's honestly a no-brainer.There is also a common misconception with spotty\/slow Internet speeds. The majority of signal issues do not come from cable lines (confirm with your ISP provider first though that the signal levels look healthy coming into and from your Internet modem) but come from the equipment itself (modem and\/or router) or from the devices you are using (assuming it is only occurring on one or two devices). Which is why upgrading your WiFi router and\/or Internet modem can resolve the issues.I honestly don't have any issues with the Spectrum Internet modems. I think they're fine. They all come pre-built, meaning, you can't change any settings on them. Not a deal breaker for me. However, honestly, if I didn't have a Landline service with them, I would've purchased my own modem as well and long-term wise I will definitely consider it. The Spectrum Internet equipment are fine for the majority of homes. However, there is no one size fits all and if you're having issues with your equipment whether due to the lack of features available or signal issues (and confirmed with their Internet Repair team that there are no signal issues coming from the lines), this TP-Link router is an exceptional purchase.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"202 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1698019200000}

{"reviewTitle":"An Excellent Router; Highly Configurable","reviewDescription":"After two months of use, I have come to the conclusion that this is an excellent router.A couple of months ago, I placed the order to upgrade our home internet to AT&T gigabit fiber and knew that I wanted a solid, configurable WIFI router as the only device plugged into the AT&T equipment.  This way, I could setup a Raspberry Pi as Pihole to block ads on my entire network and use MAC IDs to allow\/deny access to any devices that tried to connect.There are videos on YouTube that review this router and give you a view into the the setup\/config screens so, I won\u2019t go into describing all of that.  However, I will say that I feel the setup screens are intuitive and even if I did not have 20+ years\u2019 experience in IT (programming, DBA, sys admin, etc.) I believe I could figure out how to make this router fit my needs.  Whether you have that kind of background or not, the YouTube videos can be very helpful.Wired ConnectionsThe previous owner of my house had it wired with CAT6 cable (thank you!) and I added a couple of CAT8 cable runs so, I am currently using 6 of this routers\u2019 8 gigabit ports.  Those cables give me wired connections to multiple gigabit switches throughout the house (bedroom, office, man cave, living room, etc.) where I have wired connections to multiple computers or smart TVs or gaming systems, etc.I could bore you with upload\/download numbers but, instead, I will just say that everything runs faster or better now than it did before all my upgrades.My smart TV connects to YouTube (Pihole blocks the ads) and videos play smoothly.  My PS4 used to take an hour to download free games and now takes a couple of minutes and my Xbox is the same.  System patches take a minute to download.  Online streaming services run smoothly and I have yet to see any \u201cspinning wheels\u201d as a video buffers in the middle of an action scene.WIFIBefore AT&T fiber, I had an AT&T Airties 4921 WIFI booster that did a great job improving the signal to a \u201cdead spot\u201d in the back of the house.  I tried and failed to get the 4921 to work on my new equipment then realized the AX6000 had already solved the dead spot problem.  I have WIFI cameras pointing towards the woods behind my house or from the woods back to the house and am getting a strong signal to all devices.The router is capable of WIFI 6 but currently none of our iPhones, iPads, MacBooks or laptops can use it.  Nevertheless, I have not noticed any connectivity issues with any of our wireless devices.I do have one wireless, multifunction HP printer that will go to \u201csleep\u201d after several hours of inactivity and may not wake up when I send a document to it from my smart phone.  All I do is punch a button on it, it wakes up, accepts the document and everything is fine.  This is probably a setup issue within the printer, and certainly not a WIFI problem, but has not been a big enough hassle for me to worry about it.Network MonitoringOne of the major things I wanted from this router is the ability to easily block devices on my network.  I have a teenager who only needs occasional Internet access and I used both of the MAC IDs from their laptop (wired and wireless) to setup a weekly schedule for when it could\/could not reach the Internet.I can see all wired\/wireless devices on my network in the routers\u2019 Basic or Advanced screens and this allows me to keep an eye on who is in my network.Overall, I have been very pleased with this router and highly recommend it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"67 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1621036800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Archer A7\/AX21 2.4G speed for iPhone 11 from 300M Verizon Fios","reviewDescription":"Archer A7\/AX21 2.4G speed for iPhone 11 from 300M Verizon Fios5* review for successfully resolved my low 2.4G speed problem, excellent support from TP Link and fast 5G speed that exceeds Verizon Fios max speed of 300Mbps.The purpose of this review is to compare the 2.4G and 5G speeds of the TP Link Archer A7(AC1700) WiFi 5 router and AX21(AX1800) WiFi 6 router using an iPhone 11 which supports WiFi 6. The highest speed I can test is 300Mbps limited by my Verizon Internet plan.  Measurement results using show that using the WiFi 5 router, the 2.4G speed is 60M\/80M (UL\/DL) and the 5G speed is 307M\/330M, whereas using the WiFi 6 router, the 2.4G speed is 110M\/120M and the 5G speed is about same.Newer routers\u2019 real life 5G speed is very high and normally is not a problem, but  real life 2.4G speed could be slow. It is not entirely sure which part of the wireless link is limiting the 2.4G speed. Below examines the speed limit of the WiFi standards involved, the router and iPhone 11. The routers are TP Link\u2019s Archer A7(AC1700) and AX21(AX1800).  Measured speeds at 2.4G and 5G will also be given.Router (TP Link) Specs and Supported WiFi Standards1) Archer A7(AC1700) has has 3 antennas is a WiFi 5 router2.4G : 450Mbps5G: 1300M bpsSupported Standards: AX21(AX1800) : 802.11ac(Wi-Fi 5), 802.11b, 802.11ax(Wi-Fi 6), 802.11n(Wi-Fi 4), 802.11g802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax are also called Wi-Fi 4, WiFi 5 and WiFi 6 respectively.2)  AX21(AX1800) has 4 antennas is a WiFi 6 router2.4G: 574M bps5G: 1200M bps.Supported Standards: AX7 (AC1700) 802.11b, 802.11n, 802.11g, 802.11acA7 (AX1800) is a low cost ($60) popular (listed as \u201cAmazon Choice\u201d) WiFi 5 router which supports 802.11 ac whereas AX 21 is a low cost ($90) WiFi 6 router which supports 802.11 ax. WiFi 6 (max speed 9.6G) not only has higher speed than WiFi 5 (max speed 3.5G) but also can support more devices using orthogonal frequency division multiple access. The main differences are given in picture 1. (Picture 1 from : https:\/\/www.mwrf.com\/technologies\/systems\/article\/21849959\/whats-the-difference-between-wifi-5-and-wifi-6)Comparing the specs of these two routers, one has a higher 2.4G speed while the other has a higher 5G speed. But in real life, according to my measurements, at 2.4G, the WiFi 6 router has almost twice the speed than the WiFi 5 router. I don\u2019t have a high enough wireless speed plan to test the 5G speed. In my house both routers have the same speed of 310M, limited by the max speed allowed by Verizon Fios 300M.Speeds specified by the WiFi standards are speeds the router manufacturers trying to meet and they are not the limit, but speeds advertised by the router are the speeds that customers want the router to be able to reach. They become upset if they are unable to get the speeds advertised by the router.Routers often do not specified under what link conditions these seemingly advertised high speeds could be realized. For example what is the required bandwidth, the number of antennas (the so called MIMO) and how pure the signal has to be (the signal to noise ratio). Is the bandwidth 20, 40, 80 or 160M? Is the signal to noise ratio has to be greater than 10dB?In real life, link speed depends on how far from the router (the signal strength) and radio interference which falls in band (the signal to noise ratio). The former can be solved by doing the speed test right next to the router, where the transmit signal from the router is at maximum. But for the latter, unless one has a so called Faraday Cage, there is no way to block in-band  interference especially at 2.4G, which are used by microwave ovens, Bluetooth and many household devices. Interference is hard to quantify without using a spectrum analyzer and could become an excuse if one calls the router support line complaining low speed.Another limit is the device itself, and in this case iPhone 11. It\u2019s specs are given below.Wi-Fi specifications for iPhone 11802.11 standard, name, frequency Maximum PHY data rate Maximum channel bandwidth Maximum MCS index Maximum spatial streamsax@5 GHz 1200 Mbps 80 MHz 11 (HE) 2\/MIMOac@5 GHz 866 Mbps 80 MHz 9 (VHT) 2\/MIMOa\/n@5 GHz 300 Mbps 40 MHz 7 (HT) 2\/MIMOax@2.4 GHz 195 Mbps 20 MHz 9 (HE) 2\/MIMOb\/g\/n@2.4 GHz 144 Mbps 20 MHz 7 (HT) 2\/MIMO(From: https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/deployment\/iphone-wi-fi-specification-details-dep268652e6c\/web)https:\/\/mcsindex.com gives more details about how the speed on each band is affected by modulation scheme, number of antennas, bandwidth and WiFi standards used, not only for iPhones but for routers as well.From the iPhone 11 specs, only \u201cn\u201d and \u201cax\u201d support 2.4GHz if we ignore the older standards \u201cb\u201d and \u201cg\u201d. At 2.4G, The maximum speeds for \u201cn\u201d is 144M whereas for \u201cax\u201d is 195M. The max bandwidth for both is 20MHz which needs to be set in the router. Setting the bandwidth to 40MHz could lower the speed as the noise power will be doubled.However, at 5GHz the speed for ac (WiFi 5) is 866M with 80M max bandwidth whereas for ax (WiFi 6) is 1200M also with 80M max bandwidth. These bandwidths should also be specified in the router. Setting the bandwidth too high or too low could lower the speed.From the iPhone 11 max speeds, it is clear that the wireless link\u2019s speed is not limited by both the A7 and AX21 routers and the standards, but by the iPhone 11 at 2.4G and by Verizon Fios at 5G.I have Verizon Fios 300M download and upload. Initially, I used an A7, thinking that at 2.4GHz, the router speed is 450M which is higher than iPhone\u2019s 144M(\u201cn\u201d) and 195M(\u201cax), surely shouldn\u2019t be a problem. But speed test showed that I got only 60M download and 80M upload from the best channel and 20M bandwidth (I tested all the channels and bandwidth combinations).60M is too slow for me because I have several devices (such as security cameras) using 2.4G. So I called TP Link support line to see what I had done wrong. Most customer supports didn\u2019t know what the problem was the and finally I was connected to a high level support. She said that in real life, I had to multiply the speed by 30-50% and guided me through the various specs of the wireless link.  I don\u2019t know where the 30-50% comes from, perhaps it was her empirical experience. If I use the average of 40% and assume that applies to the lower speed of the router and the iPhone, which is 144MHz. 40%x144M is 57M. This was about what I got at 2.4G using the A7 router.But she also said something about WiFi 6 router and got me thinking perhaps a WiFi 6 router could improve the speed. (I must say that I got excellent support from TP Link, I had gotten calls twice from the specialist unsolicited and many followup emails. All trying to help me solve the low speed problem.)I then change the A7(AC1700) to an AX21(AX1800), which does support WiFi 6 \u201cax\u201d.The main advantage of using AX21 is that it raised the iPhone 11 max speed at 2.4G from 144M to 195M, a gain of 51M. And as a result, in real life, the 2.4G link speed seemed to have increased by about the same amount. Speed test showed that at 2.4G, I now got ~90-110M(download, previously 60M when using A7) and 100-120M(upload) with the channel and bandwidth set on auto. Though the download speed is still less than 195M, the link speed has increased by changing to a router that supports ax and has 4 antennas. Have no idea if a more expensive router will further increase the 2.4G speed.However, at 5GHz, both routers give 307M download and 330M upload, limited by Verizon Fios max speed of 300M.When doing speed test, I shut off all 2.4G emitters. I live in a rural area and I suspect there is little interference.A7 has 3 antennas whereas AX21 has four. Is the speed improvement at 2.4G due to the additional antenna or the support of WiFi 6 or both?","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"214 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1646956800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Great for Oculus Quest 2","reviewDescription":"Long review but hopefully helpful:Bought this to replace an aged Airport Extreme and give my Oculus Quest 2 a better WiFi connection. So far so good.Set up was okay but I had some trouble getting the Ethernet light to go green despite all the others being green and I was unable to get online via wired or wireless connection. If you reboot your modem and this device, go make coffee or something when it is starting back up because the router takes a while to restart. The light finally went green but it did feel like it took an inordinate amount of time.I understand the frustration that comes with setting up these new things and the rage factor sometimes enters the picture. If it does: unplug the cable modem and the router, leave everything unplugged for 5 minutes, plug in the cable modem and wait until it is fully booted up, plug in this router and walk away for a bit. Give it 5-10 minutes and hopefully you'll be good to go.The interface looks a bit dated and clonky but most do. Seems the least priority is given to creating a clean, attractive interface for all these things, but coming from an Airport Extreme where you have essentially no features to work with, this is a dream. The ability to edit the names of the clients is something I was never able to do before and it really makes a difference.I wanted something with the ability to kick clients off the network while I am using the Quest to ensure it has no bandwidth competition with devices that are not in use at the time the Quest is being used, but then put them back on without having to jump through hoops, re-entering passwords and such. I have a lot of devices on my network and while they may not be in use, they are still hovering around and eating up some bandwidth even while idling.This router allows that in an easy peasy way but the icons used are confusing. First, if you go to the Network map, clients section, you will see a list of all the clients on your network. You can click the pencil next to the name of the device and change it to make life easier. On the right side, if you click Block, that client gets blacklisted and cannot connect to the network. If you click View Blacklist, you will see all of the blocked clients and there is a garbage can icon on the right. This is a confusing and poor icon choice because most people would think that this will remove the client entirely. It doesn't. It simply puts the client back on the whitelist. It's a great thing to have, for example:Let's say you have a Zoom meeting and want to ensure that there's as little connection issues as possible. You can block all other clients on the network that are not needed and have all the bandwidth to yourself for your meeting and when it's over, just click the garbage can on each device in the blacklist and poof! they are all able to connect again.I am not really understanding the point of the QoS feature on this device because in the past when I've set up QoS in a work environment, you are able to directly allocate bandwidth to devices. Ideally, this would be what you would use if you had a Zoom call rather than kicking clients off for a time. With this router's QoS, you have two choices: On or Off. Each device listed has a Priority switch that is turned on or off. You can turn on the Priority switch for one, some or all devices, but there's nothing else, so you have no idea how bandwidth allocation is implemented here.Under the On\/Off switch for QoS, there is a bandwidth allocation box for both upload and download with each  set at 1000. You can change this number, but again, it doesn't tell you how it will divvy out that bandwidth to the clients. If you only have one device with the Priority turned on, you are left to wonder what that client is getting as opposed to other devices on the network. That's kind of a shame because you can prioritize a device for Always or for a couple of hours. Would seem the perfect set up for a Zoom meeting as you can give Priority to your device for a set amount of time and the router will release that restriction at the end of the hour or two or whatever you chose without you having to interact with the admin page at all. Unfortunately, you cannot enter times: i.e,. Priority from 10 a.m. to noon. You can choose Always, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 4 hours.I'm not sure what people are talking about regarding monthly fees for Parent Controls. I don't have kids, but opened it up and you can add a child's computer as a device, block certain keywords from being searched online and limit the days\/times that your child can get online. I didn't see anything about fees or payment for those features.I have noticed more zip in my Quest 2 since setting up this router and am quite pleased with it so far. I set up a 5ghz network set to AX only for the Quest's exclusive use, a 2.4ghz Guest Network for all the Echos, Kindles, switches for lights, etc., and a 2.4ghz network for laptops, iPads, etc.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"160 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1610064000000}

{"reviewTitle":"Intermittent Slow 5GHz Download Speeds","reviewDescription":"I just bought this TP-Link AX1800 Archer AX21 on sale to replace my aging (~5 years old) TP-Link Archer C7 V2 WiFi router. The Archer C7 was starting to drop 2.4GHz connections every few weeks requiring a reboot.I have 200Mbps fiber internet and was able to hit those speeds reliably with my old Archer C7 almost everywhere inside my home.Everything was going smoothly until I ran some speed tests on my Pixel 3A XL phone.With the new router, sometimes the download speeds are capped at 35-50Mbps on the 5GHz network. Strangely, the upload speeds are fairly consistent at ~180Mbps. This even occurs when I put the phone only a couple of feet away from the router and the reported connection link rate is greater than 600Mbps. I don't see this issue when running a speed test from wired PC.I have tried updating the firmware, disabling AX mode (as frequently suggested in TP-Link support forums because there are some incompatibilities still being ironed out) and the issue remains. I have tried all sort of channels and channel widths and it seems that auto modes give the most \"consistent\" slow speeds.I'm going to try to factory reset and test it out for a couple more days.

I do not like the user interface - I downloaded the app to get it set up - which should have made things easy - nope. It was a challenge. Between the instructions from the box and the app, it still was way more difficult than it should have been. Not user friendly.

{"reviewTitle":"affordable, customizable, intuitive, great app, what's not to like?","reviewDescription":"I would consider myself a novice when it comes to routers and networking. I can do simple tasks (network set up) adding removing devices..etc changing passwords etc.  For the past few months, i have been on the fence about replacing my ISP provided router, so i took the plunge and orderd this model (archer ax21).my old netgear router (supplied by my ISP (charter spectrum) died back in november and I called customer service and they sent me a new \"advanced wifi\" router. that router was complete garbage, ISP's don't even let customers go in and modify their own home wi-fi networks. if you type the ip address for the router, it directs you to a page that says \"login using the spectrum app\". well, their app only allows you to change the SSID name and password..NOTHING ELSE. very frustrating. ISP provided routers now combine the 2.5ghz and 5ghz bands, and many of my devices are older and ONLY use the 2.5 ghz band. so, natrually there were conflicts and frequent disconnects. I also own a accurite iris 5 and 1 weather station. in all my years of using a pc and wireless networks.. I have never seen or had a device that is so tempermental. I needed to be able to isolate the 2.5ghz and 5ghz bands so that i could assign specific devices to each band.  the older things go on the 2.5ghz, and newer things like ipad, smart tv, xbox one..go on the 5ghz band.setting this up was very straight forward. simply power down your ISP modem, and reboot. wait for everything to reboot and ensure you have internet connectivity through the modem. then plug ethernet cable from back of modem into the WAN port on the Archer X21 router. then power up the router and wait for all the lights to turn green. takes about 1-3 minutes tops.you can set up either via APP (which is what i did), or you can set up using pc with ethernet cable.I have a chromebook, so it has no eithernet jack. i actually ordered one on amazon, it's a usb to ethernet adapter. works like champ. but for most people you should be able to set up just using the app.. if you want to do more advanced things (dchp customizations, etc) i would set it up on the webpage through the ethernet connection.simply follow the instructions from the app, enter your new network name and new password and you will be good to go.the app shows each device connected on each network as well as real time uploads\/downloads so you can see if there is a issue with a particular device. if you are having issues with devices disconnecting\/reconnecting\/slow speeds etc. i would suggest at the start that you DISABLE the 5ghz band. after you get everything connected and confirm that the devices are working, then go ahead and re-enable the 5ghz band. for some reason, (not sure why) on inital setup there can be conflicts.there are tons of options for this router, far to many to get into much detail for this review. go ahead and download the manual prior to purchase, so you can read up on what this router can\/can't do before you purchase.you can actually update the firmware over the air by hitting the update button, or you can speciify a certain time of day for the updates to be installed. a good rule of thumb would be set it to sometime after midnight that way, you will be asleep more than likely when the updates happen. out of the box, mine needed a firmware update. took less than 5 minutes.i've had\/currently have other tp-link products (smart bulbs\/cameras) and they all work as expected.the app is very intuitive and straight forward. i didn't have to have any special settings from my ISP, i just plugged in the router, went  through the setup, and everything connnected flawslessly on the FIRST attempt.  no errors\/timeouts etc that i was getting with my ISP supplied router.the router is sleek and has 4 antennas. my range is about the same as with my previous isp supplied router. currently have a linksys re6300 extender out here in the living room to boost the 5ghz band. my house isn't that big but is very old. (its a single wide from early 70's with A-Frame roof). so i think my signal loss has alot to do with the aluminum siding on my house. your range\/results will obviously vary.I currently have 16 devices on my network and all are staying connected flawlessly and seem faster than with the ISP supplied router.there is also a option for guest network. I'm using that for guests and my accurite weather station.hoping this will help me troubleshoot the accurite when the inevitable disconnects start.also wanted to mention that the accurite iris 5-1 weather stations are full of problems. if your considering one, go with another brand. it's not worth the headache.the only reason i took a star off was becase the antennas on the back of the router were wrapped in plastic that was hard to take off. other than that, i think this router is perfect. it's affordable, has tons of options and doesn't have performance issues that ISP supplied routers do. pick one up today, i'm sure glad I did.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"241 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673827200000}
{"reviewTitle":"So far, so good (and better than the AC5400)","reviewDescription":"I bought the TP-Link AC5400 Tri Band WiFi Gaming Router in August 2020. It's been not great with erratic dropouts (somewhat improved with a scheduled nightly reboot). The 2.4 GHz band finally gave out entirely in just two years.Our home is two stories plus a basement. We have the router in our home office on the top floor, and use it for Ethernet and WiFi around the house including a number of smart devices (Echos, smart plug) dependent on the 2.4 Ghz level of service and then 5 Ghz for tablets and laptops that aren't plugged in. Plus a number of gaming devices in the living room wired to a cheap aging switch to share a long Ethernet cable that snakes down the stairs.I looked around at the competition but wasn't seeing a clear winner, particularly in the 8-port Ethernet category, which seems to have narrowed in the past few years. On paper, this model looked like a good choice with some potentially great features, but I'm wary of the TP-Link name and reports of spotty support and similar issues with this model.Bottom line, I needed a new router and I needed it same day. I sprung for the Asurion 4-year replacement plan for peace of mind in case there are problems down the road (normally I skip these sorts of plans). The unit arrived in a few hours, and it was basically a quick swap and a few quick config choices - and all of our devices reconnected and all was good. As a bonus, the mesh extender I bought earlier this year works natively with the router (it didn't with the 5400). It took me awhile to figure out how to reset it (required a paperclip) but then I was able to reconfigure it to use the same network name.Also, based on one of the other reviews I read here, I went through the Ethernet cables and eliminated 3 that aren't in active use, bringing the total down to 5 (where the reviewer found the best performance). I may try plugging some of the other cables back in and testing the result when I have the time and inclination. For now, 5 ports actually suits us though I could see going back up to 6-7 eventually and I hope that wouldn't cause problems.I'm less than a week in, so posting my first impressions now and will update if\/when things go south. Overall the router is fast and easy to setup and use. No issues with devices on either 2.4 or 5 Ghz wireless bands so far. I did set a middle-of-the-night daily reboot just in case, as I think this is a best practice and served us well before. I had hoped to use the mesh extender with the WiFi gaming 5 Ghz band but it doesn't support this natively (just the default 5 Ghz network), so we're basically not using the gaming optimized WiFi - which seems a shame as we are all gamers, and this would be a good choice for extending WiFi to our son's room in the basement where he has an Xbox One and a gaming laptop.But that's a minor gripe. I also noticed that there's only one USB 3 port (which I use for a media library that I access via Xbox Series X), and the other is USB-C which I don't know that we'll ever use. We had stopped using the second USB port on the 5400 as it's documented to interfere with 2.4 GHz WiFi so that was a deal breaker for us. Would have preferred a second USB 3 port that actually works but that's another minor gripe.BOTTOM LINE (for now): It's a solid router, assuming it holds up. With the extended warranty, I'm hoping we get at least 4 years from the AX10000 (vs 2 years for the AC5400).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661990400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Product is good, but don't use the phone app Tether to set it up","reviewDescription":"This was supposed to be delivered to me on the 2nd, I just received it today, but that's not why I'm complaining. I did some research and came to find out that I have been living with throttled internet speeds for years due to false advertisements on my old router manufacturer's part. I was only getting about 12MB a second when I should have been getting over 90MB. I'm pretty angry at myself for not catching this sooner, but at any rate, that is what drove me to buy this product. It is stated to be able to handle about 574mbps, and my plan is only for 500. From the reviews and the price, especially with the price being slashed, I decided to go for it despite never hearing of the brand before. The router itself is fine and has some nice tech and features. What is terrible, however, is the phone app Tether they tell you to download to set it up. I don't know if this app is 3rd party, but if it is, they need to get away as fast as possible. I created my account, set my local account password, did the usual phone things like 2-factor auth and fingerprint access. This all originated from using the routers default password of course. I then created my wifi password, which is separate. I did all this through the phone app, got the confirmation email, opened it and clicked the button to authorize, and yay my account was created. It reset and put me back at the local password login. Ok, no problem, I just set that. Type it in. Incorrect. Delete it, show password, type it in again just to make sure I had no errors. No dice. I try my router password, no dice. I try the default password on the router itself, no dice. I'm about to get locked out at this point. The only options are to \"Forget Password?\" or contact customer service. I try forget password, \"Please hold the reset button on the router for 10 seconds to restore to default settings.\" Well, guess that's the only way. So I do. Hold it for 20 just to be safe. Let the router do its thing. Try again with the app. Set my passwords up again and it looks like I'm connected. When I'm done going through the motions again, it sends me back to the main login, yet again, for the same screen I just created another password for. I type it in. No good. Try again, no good. Try the router password, the default password, nothing. There's an option to connect to it anyway so I try it. It appears my phone and computer are on the network with full bars, but there's not actually an outside internet connection. I'd been messing with this for about an hour at this point so I was getting frustrated. I decide to reset it again, held it for 30 seconds just to be sure, and it just sat there with a single solid light. I unplug the thing after this for 60 seconds. I plug it back in and my PC finally has internet again, at least enough to get to their website. (Hardwired btw for the PC) So I decide to take the second approach suggested in the instructions and set it up online. Flawless. Actually remembered all of the passwords I created and gave me several more options and screens than the phone application did. I can finally log all the devices in my house onto the network. I just tested my download speed and I went from 12MB to about 80MB with that particular platform. So, to summarize, the product works, just don't use the janky phone app at all.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1715040000000}

Now, since I am using a whitelist if a guest should want to use my guest network I have to add them to the whitelist or they can't use the guest wifi. Never had this problems with the older models. All TP-Link support would tell me is they would submit feedback to their team.

{"reviewTitle":"Works Very Well with TP-Link RE600X OneMesh Range Extender","reviewDescription":"Functions as advertised.  Being advanced user I would prefer a little more granularity in the advanced configuration menus but the bottom line for this router is that is the best bang-for-the buck (i.e. value for your money) you are going to find in a WiFi 6 dual band router, taking into account stability of operation.  There may be some competitors in the price range but check the reviews for user comments about stability such as need for rebooting every so often.  This AX21 has gone over 30 days without reboot and is performing as perfectly as it did right after that last reboot.  Now, I did have an issue initially that caused me to down rate this router initially, but that turned out to be a rather dumb error in configuring it right out of the box. Once I caught that I meant to update my review but got sidetracked and so am now just updating it to give this router the credit it deserves.  House is a single level 1800 sq ft living space plus approx 800 sq ft three and half car attached garage.  The garage floor is sealed and the exterior walls and overhead doors insulated to make the garage usable as extra space for the home in add'n to containing vehicle and motorcycle (seal coated floor).  My point here is the AX21\/600X combo covers the entire structure both living space and the garage with garage featuring a streaming client (4K TV).  The signal strength admittedly is down to approximately half at farthest point in garage but that is still impressive at the price point of this Wifi 6 mesh network setup using only one extender (the RE600X).  Other side of the kitchen wall (exterior wall) that the 600X is plugged into is a small in-ground pool area and the AX21\/RE600X mesh network signal is no less that about 75% strength out there.  These results are nothing short of phenomenal in my opinion at the price point, but admittedly I got both for around 20% off each during Holiday season discounts by the TP-Link Store here on Amazon.  And again, the stability is commendable-- these two devices working together in the OneMesh configuration just keep on keeping on, with no throughput or latency issues in over 30 days on un-rebooted use.  If you saw my RE600X review you may note comment on long reboot time and think my statements are not consistent, but take heart: that observation was during the initial setup of the RE600X and is not relevant to my statement that the pair have not required a reboot since.  One caveat:  The household consists of just two persons, and device load on the network is rarely more than 3 or 4 devices actively using wifi data at same time.  Your mileage may vary with higher device load on this same setup.One final note about the AX21 WiFi 6 router.  It accepts prime number Beacon Intervals without issue.  I am currently using a Beacon Interval of 167 and DTIM of 1 and have found this to be the sweet spot between throughput, latency, and client battery drain for this router.  My previous router was a TP-Link Archer C7 Wifi 5 and 127 was it's sweet spot for Beacon Interval.  I utilize a prime number Beacon due to local crowding on the 2.4ghz medium in my neighborhood.Hard to go wrong with the AX21\/RE600X combo if you have a small to medium living space !!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"23 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1671494400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Affordable upgrade to Wifi 6 and WPA3","reviewDescription":"This router replaced one a few years older that was having issues with multiple streams during the pandemic. The price of the AX21 was very fair, but especially for all the technological upgrades this model includes. Wifi 6 and advanced WPA3 security are nice to have for future proofing, and the beamforming, MU-MIMO and OFDMA protocols for handling multiple devices at once have all made an appreciable difference in our WiFi quality. This model also supports TP-Link's \"OneMesh\" feature, allowing you to create your own mesh WiFi network for poor coverage areas in larger homes. Also of note is that the AX21 can be enabled to automatically update its firmware, which is a very convenient feature if you want to keep your network secure without having to manually check for and apply updates every few weeks or months. The settings menu is easy to navigate and has many options to customize this device for your needs.About our coverage:Despite its central location on the second floor, our older router had trouble fully covering the edges of our ~3,000 square foot two story home. Streaming video in those areas often buffered, cut out, or simply failed to load at times. Since replacing the older router with the AX21 in the exact same location, there are absolutely no dead zones at all inside our home. In fact, our speeds in those areas have gone up substantially when compared to our previous router and it has solved our streaming issues completely. We also get a strong signal throughout our yard.We specifically purchased this model because we were skeptical, given our past struggles with WiFi coverage, that any router by itself would completely cover our house. Having the ability to purchase other OneMesh compatible devices to expand coverage to the fringes of our home was a very attractive proposition for us and influenced our purchase of this model over others without mesh support. We fully expected to eventually purchase another device or two in order to expand our network to the edges of our home. After setting up the AX21 and testing it out, we realized that purchasing additional devices would be unnecessary for us, which makes me even more pleased about the price we paid to upgrade!Summary:The AX21 is a very nice and affordable upgrade if you are currently using a router that is more than a few years old. It has many of the newest high end features and should remain relevant for years to come. The price is very fair based on the tremendous increase in quality we've experienced since upgrading. The support of the OneMesh system to build your own mesh network is also a great benefit for those with large homes that currently suffer from WiFi coverage problems. However, based on our experiences, I would recommend trying just this router first and purchasing additional OneMesh compatible devices after testing. You may find that this router alone provides all the coverage you need, we did!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1633910400000}

With each time, my router would require a reboot in order for the internet to work again. Prior to this, I never had any issues with the provided gateway or linksys router. After a couple months calling TP link Tech support and looking at logs and trying to figure out what was wrong, if it was my modem, router or switch, I had come to the realization that my modem and switch were both netgear and the TP link router just not compatible with them. I went out and just bought a netgear router on sale one day to try and take the router out of the equation and everything has been rock solid ever since. Now I have a $380 paper weight that I am hoping to use a possible access point if somone doesnt want to buy it off of me at a step discount.TL:DRGreat router but wasnt compatible with my modem and switch.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"4 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673481600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Old stock. Shipped old v1 hardware from last year","reviewDescription":"Had an issue during setup and while talking to support they asked me twice if it was new and then said its an older model and there is a \"fixed\" V2, felt bummed about it.  The latest firmware is a year old for a wifi 6 router not good at all.Its also very watered down feature wise.  Link aggregation for example only works for port 2 and 3 on an 8 port switch?  Not cool.  I do regret buying this as I was going to use the link aggregation on a par of NAS with 2x1GB links.  Cant do that.I ideally wanted something like this but with 2.5GB managed port and was willing to pay double.  In hindsight I should have got a separate PF sense router, switch and WAP.  There is no solid all in one out there and the high end gaming ones look like an upside down stool for a toddler.  For someone with an engineering background and likes to tinker, this isn't for you.  This is for your folks house, something you can walk them through setting up over the phone.  Again, this is for a no technical person that wants something that is plug and play.I still have to test VPN, if the bw is crap or has issues even with the quad core CPU, Id say its an overpriced basic router with a couple high end features available but very poorly implemented to justify charging about 100 more than its worth.

{"reviewTitle":"Almost sent back due to poor tech support...!","reviewDescription":"I had a very hard time setting up this router due to extremely poor tech support. I was put on a 20 minute wait on the online chat support, with the option to type in useful information while I waited. So I did so, putting down my router model, my ISP, and the nature of my problem, explaining what I had tried already.When \"Alberto\" finally came on, he started asking me the very questions I had taken time to answer; \"What is the model # of your router? What ISP do you have?\" and so on. When he asked if I plugged my router directly into the modem, I said \"No, I use a 5 port switch, which should not be a problem, because the router I am upgrading from, the TP-Link AC 1900, works fine using the same Ethernet port I am trying to use now. Yet with the AX6000 I get a 'WAN port is not connected' error message.\"So the tech guy immediately sees a way to get out of helping me, and says: \"It will only work connected directly to the modem.\" And then he hangs up!I knew he was wrong because I have used the other router that way for years. So, I spent about 3 more hours figuring out the problem myself...!Turns out I needed to Clone the MAC address of my previous PC (I copied the previously cloned MAC address still present in the firmware settings of my previous router), and, when misteriously that did not solve the problem, even though based on my online research it should, unplugging the 5 port switch for a couple of minutes and then turning it back on, miraculously fixed the problem...!I honestly think both steps were needed, as I could not get things previously working even when connecting directly to the modem, unless I put the cloned MAC settings in.Once I solved these issues, I have to say this is an EXCELLENT router...! Blazing fast speeds, amazing range, and great stability, so far, on this first day testing it.I hope anyone experiencing the problems I had is helped by my post, because you certainly will not get any decent help from the morons they have doing tech support at TP-Link (or whoever they outsource to, if that is the case).","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1599523200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Performs better than the AC4000 for a 2 story home","reviewDescription":"We have a two story home with the modem upstairs in a room over the garage.  Many devices downstairs would struggle in the afternoon (Ring doorbell, Samsung TV, etc).  With about 30 wireless devices  total my my TP-Link AC40000 worked pretty well and was way better than anything else at the time including more expensive Asus.The range and speed are better, hands down no question.  Haven't had any issues with the older devices either as this allows 2.4g, where other makes don't.  SO my older amcrest camera and my older Ring doorbell.I had to disable the QOS as my Samsung Q series and Vizio M series TVs would freeze up periodically.  I haven't noticed any issues since then and most of my heavy traffic is ethernet so hopefully that stays stable.  Speeds are better of course without QoS, but we're working with about 500mbs Spectrum.I thought the interface was fine, a little goofy with gamer page that didn't make sense, but it let me do whatever I needed to and explained a couple features I didn't see before.  If you forget the IP you used, it also helps with finding your way with a built in sniffer that directs to the proper page.Another nice thing was after initial testing, I just used the same SSID and password and all but one device used it successfully, which was a huge time saver.Side note.  I actually ran this plugged into one of the LAN ports of the AC4000 which didn't work at first, but after some tinkering with settings.  It assigned 192.168.1.1 vs 192.168.0.1 which is default and what the older router uses.  So it allowed me to test devices and login to the portal without having to commit fully and change everything, just wired devices wouldn't work.  Just an FYI as I was using it as an access point at first just to see how it performed, which was good too, then switched to normal mode.  It would NOT grab an IP through a switch, it had to be plugged into one of the ports of the older router.8 ports vs 4 on most routers is also nice as I'm using a switch for all the other stuff that I may be able to get rid of now.  Link aggregation is available as well.The price seems high, as all these do frankly, but for me it seems to work the way I need it to so far and reach further, run faster and hopefully avoid freezes as the AC4000 was starting to do a couple times a week (which could be the modem, so can't knock it).  The faster processor should help too.Depending on your situation, this is a luxury choice as the AC4000 really did a great job for a long time reaching further out than any other router I tried, which were several including high line ASUS that were 4x the cost and performed worse with no 2.4 for older devices.So far I'm happy with performance, ease of setup and using same SSID connected most things automatically so I'd recommend this router if your budget allows it and it tests out ok on your network.UPDATE: So after a year, I noticed a new wireless cam, and all my downstairs devices having issues losing connections for a few minutes to an hour.  I changed ONE setting from AUTO to manual channel selection (they give you 1-5 and no indication of what they actually are) for wireless and they all immediately did better.  I knew this because 1 camera was literally 1 foot away from another and was barely working before the change.  Now they both work well and the finicky TVs are more stable .. so farUPDATE 2: This router has problems with Samsung TVs.  TV shows full signal strength, but no data flow.  everything else seems to work fine.  Qseries.  It drops everything once in a while and if i had to do over again, I'd buy a different brand because I'd like to NEVER be bothered by this again and spending this kind of money should buy you that.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"16 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1699142400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not a gaming router - performance ruined by the software. Do not recommend.","reviewDescription":"**Edit** I'm waiting return, and have swapped back to my TP Link Archer AX50 (AX3000). I thought I'd be able to see an obvious difference in performance on my network. I am very surprised to say that on all my wired LAN connections, using Cat8, not even a measurable difference. On the wifi devices in my home, no consistent difference in speed, however the range is slightly better (slight, like about 10ish feet) where that speed extends to. That said, AX50 costs $109, this router cost me $349. The software on the AX10000 is far worse than that of the AX50 as well. The only disadvantages to the AX50 that would matter in price is that although TP-Link said they were going to release Onemesh for the AX50, instead they released the AX55 with that feature. No mesh for AX50. Also dual vs tri band, even though for most ppl this will not significantly be missed. For anyone not using Mesh...the AX50 will go toe to toe with the AX10000 for 99% of all of us that use simple networks in their home. Pass on this router, the AX10000 is without a doubt a marketing wonder but overall an overhyped mess of gaming buzzwords that mean little to nothing.Not a gaming router, identical to the AX11000. TP-Link just literally put the word \"Gaming\" in front of normal router functions like firewall services, network diagnostics, QOS, etc. This router for being a high end router, has less overall software features than my older TPLink AX50 this was supposed to replace. At the very least the same but more obscured in the software than their non-gaming routers. And some important things you need to, but Cannot disable. I've reviewed all this below.Bought this router little over a week ago, and it was a legitimate upgrade over the TPLink AX50 (AX3000) router we had before. Had been running very well for the time I used it, until it started having issues suddenly after running perfectly well.  I and my wife both work IT from home full-time. Seemed good until 2 days ago we started having total meltdowns of our upload speed. Called my internet provider and spent an hour on the phone two days in a row because at about 2:30-3p each day my upload speed would crash but not download speed. Upload averages 38Mbps, we were suddenly getting .6Mbps if not zero. Download speeds while this happen were still over 900, but fluctuating constantly 400s-500s-800s..etc. After doing testing at the wall and outside, at the modem, and at the router we found the router to have the issue.This is a KNOWN issue with TP-Link, they have entire posts on their community site addressing it. But these steps do NOT resolve the issue.Worst problem and the reason this is my LAST TP-Link device purchase.. the issue seems to revolve around the software. You CANNOT turn off QOS as you can in my other TP-Link router. And the QOS determines its capacity on the connection from doing it's own internal speed test of your internet connection. The test is faulty, and will read very low upload and inaccurately. QOS then uses this faulty speed test measurement to set your connection speeds and its the default config. You can set it manually and bypass the speed test setting the Up\/Download speed at 1000Mbps for both. But this causes its own issues with QOS. 2nd issue is that even with Antivirus on the router turned off it is STILL actively using the firewall services to block incoming traffic. There is no way to turn it completely off, and it contacts AVIRA 80k+ times a day for updates. This slows the CPU of the router and uses quite a lot of the router's memory reducing the efficiency and causing you to get slightly diminished overall.Bottom line, yesterday I setup a return with Amazon. My family's livelihood is on the line and this router caused us a lot of downtime. If TP-Link would just create a firmware release where you are not Forced into keeping QOS and Antivirus\/Firewall services enabled full-time even when AV shows off. With this router and the AX11000 they are identical and all have this issue identically. People have complained for what looks like a very long time and TPLink is not resolving this issue in their firmware.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"27 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1657843200000}
{"reviewTitle":"It's great out of the gate, but slows down after the first lap ...","reviewDescription":"Review title says it all really (short version).This router has good range and is capable of fast throughput, but it doesn't seem to be able to maintain that throughput. Smart connect \/ auto select for channels and channel width appears to be not too smart. I recently changed Internet providers from ATT Uverse fiber optic to Astound Internet (ATT jacked up their monthly rate). I ordered the  TP-Link Archer AX21 a week prior to the switch. I disabled the ATT Gateways router (Arris BGW210-700) and connected the Archer AX21 in IP passthrough mode (similar to Bridge mode) in it's place for a baseline comparison, and it compared well in range\/signal strength and with speed tests (Ookla Speedtest.net) to the BGW210's WiFi speed and range. However, the speedtests wouldn't hold up over time whereas the ATT all-in-one Gateway held fairly constant WiFi speeds over the year I had it. I measured these speed tests with my laptop and router in the exact same locations. Direct ethernet connection to one of the router's ethernet ports confirmed my cable modem (Arris SB8200) and Astound Internet weren't the bottleneck and were consistently supplying advertised speed of 400 Mbps (in excess of 400 Mbps actually).Since Smart connect\/auto channel select wouldn't maintain speeds, I switched channels manually and increased channel width to 40 MHz (from 20 MHz). That would usually boost the link speeds and speed tests back to par. But it wouldn't sustain speeds. TP-Link support never really offered any solutions or even anything to try. They'll respond, and will go through the motions, but they had nothing substantive to offer. So I returned this router and purchased an ASUS RT-AX55 to replace it. Got it two days ago and so far so good. It is on Smart Connect and performing well. A little too early to review it yet but I am pleased with it thus far.Bottom line for me is the TP-Link Archer AX21 didn't consistently meet its advertised performance capabilities. I prefer a horse that doesn't require me to constantly whip it to run. I was logging into the router and switching channels several times a day to speed it back up. As an aside, Amazon made the return process easy overall although I wish they had a better choice in \"reason for returning\". I selected \"Broken or defective\" with defective being closer to the truth, but I would call it \"doesn't meet advertised capabilities\" or \"doesn't meet expectations\". I'm sure from TP-Link's perspective that isn't broken or defective. You plug it in, connect it, and it works. I won't be surprised if it is resold as new or possibly \"renewed\" and most users will be oblivious to its shortcomings.Some might think well, your WiFi speeds are location specific\/walls\/distance\/competing WiFi signals\/Bla Bla\/Etc. The ATT Gateway's router didn't experience any issues with any of that, and the TP-Link was placed in the same location as is\/was it's replacement, the ASUS AX55, and my laptop speedtests for all three located in the same location. What I can't say for sure is if this performance is specific to my particular router, or the model itself. The TP-Link gets good reviews overall, but I did read some reviews stating performance degrades over time, or something to that effect, so at least a few others had a similar issue. Also, I did update the firmware when I first set it up and used the router from Jan 10 - Feb 2, so a sufficient trial period to gauge performance.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1675468800000}

It was nearly flawless in its function and filled its promises with glory. I loved it so much, I bought another for a different network. As I was setting it up, I discovered that the \"New\" one was not New at all. No, it was not a refurbished unit or a returned one. In the pictures, you will notice the hardware versions are not the same. The Hardware Version 2 is my older unit.I contacted the seller (Amazon) and had to speak to them on the phone. Even then, they were vexed by this issue. Another unit was sent out to replace the version 1 hardware unit, but it too was only Version 1. Well, technically it was hardware version of 1.6. Still, not a version 2 as the one I needed.On the bottom of the box, in the same line as the Model Number, the tail end is the version number and is clearly listed as V2. We will get back to this point later.The replacement box, the Hardware Version stated it was 1.6. I was hoping that this was a typo and continued to open the box. Upon inspection of the labels on the bottom of the router, I was met with the same information. A final check of the firmware confirmed the wrong hardware version was again shipped to me. Not Version 2 hardware.Looks like I may be returning both of the recent units purchased from Amazon as soon as I can find the correct version from some place like Office Depot, Staples, Micro Center, NewEgg, TigerDirect Business, Lowes or even Best Buy. The problem is, most will NOT check their stock or even their stock levels if you call them. They literally don't know what they have.  It appears Amazon is no different.Even seeking help from tp-link themselves was fruitless. Most vendors will take their product info directly off of the manufacturers website without any attention to the hardware versions and their differences. So, you end up with a ton of misleading info concerning capabilities that the product they may actually be selling. Essentially, selling old gear that can't match up with the new listed capabilities listed. Last I checked, this is often called Bait and Switch or false advertising.Integrity is evidently a lost art now. It boils down to a fault in communications between the vendors and the manufacturers. Its the consumer who pays the price in more ways than one. Sadly, it appears that nobody cares to do anything about it but report it as \"Feedback.\"There is a decided difference in hardware between versions 1.6 and version 2 concerning chip functionality and expandability. But the biggest thing deals with support for the chipset for updates. Hardware V1 will NEVER get any updates!!Check the hardware version on the outside of the box and on the bottom of the router.

Knowing I had a few WIFI6 devices and a growing list of devices I decided on the AX6000.  On paper it looks great. It looked as if it would fit my needs.  After about a week of testing I have to say I am pretty disappointed.  I placed the AX6000 in the same location as the R7800.  I am on fiber, 1 Gig connection.  As far as speed i see no change at all.Signal strength is pretty much the same so there are no coverage issues.  The R7800 was mount on the wall.  The AX6000 has its indicator on the top but mounting it on the wall was not desirable due to the antenna orientation.  That said it had to go on a shelf in the same location.I thought maybe a firmware update or maybe moving it around would improve things.  Both wired and wireless speeds are basically the same as the previous router.The interface is far better.  The UI is OK, but not stellar.  The application for the phone is OK and much better than Netgear.There are some pretty pathetic options in the UI however.The big one I ran into right away was logging.  You can send the logs via SMTP but you get no options for ports.  That said its not going to work at all unless you are using a super insecure mail server or a mail server locally.  You can't do SSL or TLS.  There are no options to include a port for this and including one causes it to bail out.The only other option is to login and save locally.  There is no syslog, or method to save locally on the device.It is strange that TPLink thinks this is still 2003 and has no updated this to provide a functional secure method for sending logs.  I realize most SOHO routers are designed to be user friendly and hands off but this is a serious lapse. Just because you can't see it does not mean there is not an issue. I don't sit on top of my logs all day but in that instance when there is an issue I am trying to resolve having access to the logs is critical.While over all the UI is pretty good It is lacking in a lot of areas. The Entire concept of management is choked and the advanced options  do not go far enough to be useful IMO.Over all this is a good router but I think its over hyped.

Fast forward to a few days later when my roommate couldn't get some of his apple devices to connect consistently and then random devices got terrible performance.I tweaked some default settings and split the SSIDs for 2.4 and 5GHz bands to see how things went. For a while things were fine, then they were back to the same issues.  I tried smart connect and then oh boy forget about your airplay, Chrome cast, and Amazon smart devices working. Tech support spent about 1 month working with me fixing the issue where devices on the 2.4 and 5GHz bands would just stop communicating (DMZ and AP\/SSID Isolation were off BTW). They came out with a fixed firmware after I worked with suppost staff and one of their software R&D engineers over team viewer. This actually fixed the issue but subsequent firmware upgrades haven't helped the device.USB storage used to randomly disconnect (this was thankfully pretty much fixed since about march of 2021). The device is still randomly slow and not just due to interference from neighbors with similarly configured networks on similar bands. It just decides to not load some pages and doesn't seem to work with wi-fi calling properly on T-Mobile, and Verizon. I wanted to like this router because the feature set offered is great but pretty much all of it doesn't work. You turn on a setting\/function only to find out the router didn't actually make the change and don't get me started on the firmware GUI. It is awful! Settings and lists for your routing table and device list are spread all over the place. I tried manually making adjustments and use port triggers to get wifi calling working but it just switches back to cellular preferred and when it does randomly work my voice cuts out for call recipients every few seconds. I'm not going to bother reporting this issue to TP-link and wait a month for them to figure it out.I bought this unit because the archer c5400 AC model was highly praised but this thing....They've had 2 years to get the firmware straight and it is still garbage. Just save yourself the headache and get something else.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1629849600000}

My purchase came through something called \"Olive Branch Enterprises\" and was initially not accepted for return by TPLink.Giving 3 stars instead of 1 to encourage people to read this.  Too many 1 star reviews are from people who are just inept and cannot follow simple instructions.This has not been a reliable router.  Has good speed and does all the basic things a router should do (port forward, DDNS, etc), but have had two fail on me.  Returned the first on due to a dead ethernet port.  The second one worked for five months but now just shows a spinning blue LED and no internet.  I cannot reach the configuration page via my desktop, and even cannot do a factory reset.  I stick the pin in to press the reset button but the blue LED just continues to spin.  Tech support is clueless about what the spinning LED means.  Very disconcertingThe web interface for configuring the devices uses a pastel blue color scheme which might be difficult to read.  Also, using remote maintenance via my 10\" tablet, I cannot access any of the advanced features because the link containing those features does not open into the submenus.In the interests of fairness, TPLink support has given me an RMA for replacing my currently unresponsive router.  I see that many people have given it 5 stars and I wish them well.

Randomly, in April 2024, the entire 2.4ghz network seemingly died. The router said it was working fine, but no devices could find that network.This is a huge issue as all our smart plugs ran off of the 2.4ghz network, meaning we couldn't control them anymore. We had an attic\/whole-house fan turned on with a smart plug at the time, and the network dying meant that we couldn't turn it off (super hard to reach location), even when temperatures dropped into the 40s F overnight.First thing in the morning we went through the painstaking process of accessing the plug just so we can turn this off manually.2 ENTIRE support sessions later, I am allowed to submit an RMA request.

Received notice on 05\/24\/2023 that product could now be registered. Registered and began the process of obtaining an RMA. Provided all the info requested and was directed to payment necessary for shipping cost. The process provided by TPLink REQUIRED I establish a PayPal account, which I refused to do because of previous experiences with PayPal. TPLink Support informed me to use the CC method (It was what I was attempting to use) and all would be well. Informed them what I was using. TPLink Support then instructed me to use the GUEST method of payment. I sent Screen Shots of each page  of the payment process and there was no GUEST process available, they insisted it existed but could not direct me to it. This led to changing the TYPE OF RMA and issuing a new id for it. I was then able to pay the shipping cost and sent the unit to TPLink on 06\/02\/2023 and was delivered 06\/05\/2023 to the TPLink facility.

{"reviewTitle":"Does NOT work as VPN client with VPN Providers but good as just a wi-fi router","reviewDescription":"This review is about the US version (with firmware version 3.6 ast the time of this writing). This is important because the features of the routers vary wildly depending on the firmware revision and the markets they target (the US version may not have features supported by the Asian version to remain compliant with the local laws, etc).-This does NOT work as a VPN client for VPN service providers like ExpressVPN, NordVPN etc who use OpenVPN, Wireguard, etc.The router DOES connect to the VPN server of the provider but the important thing to note is that it does NOT route any of the network traffic through the VPN tunnel!In simple words, it means that even though you use this router, traffic still goes through the ISP as if the router was not there...- There is full MANUAL for this router. Not even a PDF on the website. You get just a \"Quickstart\" guide which is also available as a PDF on their site.OLD versions of the manual (for firmware revision v1 from 2020-2021) exist but even these do not exist on the official site but have to be downloaded from 3rd party sites. Of course, they are not relevant to the v3 firware now.There is only an \"online\" webpage based \"manual\" which is pretty useless.-There is an online forum and we are supposed to register there and then post our issues there. This is even for features which are supposed to work out of the box!Forums and support should be for edge cases where ADDITIONAL help is required. Not for STANDARD features that the router should be supporting!-There is no KILL SWITCH for the VPN. Although the VPN does not work (as of now) please be aware that without a KILL SWITCH (for cases when the VPN connection drops), all your traffic would get exposed as it would no longer be getting tunneled through the VPN!This is a grave oversight on the part of the developers.-Apart from that, if you are not interested in the VPN features but just want a fast wi-fi router then then is a good choice.But then again, if all you need is a fast router then there is no real need to go for this particular model when there are many others from other vendors with more features!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"6 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1683331200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Half-baked, no recent firmware updates","reviewDescription":"I bought this mainly for the WiFi 6 and the extra Ethernet ports. I was hoping to future-proof my home network but I'm already looking to replace this.It has trend micro built-in, which false flags legitimate services. You can go into the settings to disable the different security \"features\" but the logs show it's still blocking services even when disabled. There is no option to whitelist services.I run Home Assistant and UnRaid on my network so I assign static IPs to most of my devices. Because the signal isn't strong on this router I bought one of their OneMesh extenders. Devices connected to the extender will connect to static IPs I have set for other devices. This causes those devices to be unable to send and receive data until I reboot the router, reboot the devices, or all of the above. I tried turning off the DHCP server for the extender to allow the router to handle DHCP fully but this caused the extender to drop off into purgatory until I reset it.The software is very fragmented. Some features available on the Android app don't show up in the web ui and vice versa. Naming devices on the app doesn't always transfer over to the web ui so identifying devices becomes a chore. Also, the guest network is not truly isolated from the main network. I can still scan all the devices on my main network from the guest network. There are a lot of bugs present for a device that's nearly $300 (when it was released). For that price you would expect a little more effort on ironing out the kinks. The firmware has not been updated since December of 2021.It seems like most of these companies release a new model every year or two, release one or two firmware updates, and then abandon support altogether. I've had several Linksys, Netgear, and TP-Link routers so far and the story is almost always the same. Right now I'm saving all my pennies up to buy a router that runs pfsense (no WiFi). I need something that gives me better control over my home network and doesn't force me to use shoddy services I can't opt out of. I may be able to use this router as a wireless AP with pfsense.

{"reviewTitle":"Poorly Conceived","reviewDescription":"My printer's not that old and it's made by a well-known, reliable brand. When I installed the new router, I kept my old network name and password so the printer would hopefully stay online. What I didn't account for was that some devices get tripped up when the security protocol changes, including my MBP.1st critique. I bought this router primarily for the WPA3 security. Problem is, when that's enabled, the onboard software disables the Wifi Protected Setup (WPS) button. I can't connect my printer and also benefit from WPA3. Apparently many printers aren't compatible with WPA3 and mine is one of them, so why isn't there a clear warning about that? But also to completely disable WPS when WPA3 protocol is active baffles me. It's sloppy.2nd critique. The WPS and Wi-Fi toggle are the same button. It is sooooo hard to hold the button for the right amount of time to tell the router to let my printer online without holding it for too long and turning the network off completely. There was plenty of room for another button. Why in the world would anyone merge these together?3rd critique. It's slow. Oh the internet is fast, but accessing 192.168.0.1 to change settings is a headache. Pages are slow to load, and the router hesitates for a long time when applying new settings--long enough that Chrome thinks the page has frozen and asks me what to do.This is the router I bought to replace another TP-Link router that was more expensive, and had exactly the same features except for WPA3. That router was almost double the price of this one (same production year). I don't know what's going on with TP-link but I'm losing confidence in this brand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"13 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1614988800000}

The basement would be better for this device to effectively target (Mu-MIMO) the signal to the client device (your phone, tablet, computer, TV).New Malware attacks to routers are a new approach taken by foreign government sponsored hackers for corporate spying and intelligence gathering.  This approach allows the hackers to capture all your traffic and send it to servers in China or Russia.  Once that information is gathered they can extract your banking and payment methods along with other useful personal information.  I contacted TP-Link about this issue and they responded to me by saying that they have no plans to address router malware now or anytime in the future.

However, WiFi 6 interested me so I decided to try out Asus and TPLink. Asus was very unreliable and TPLink Archer AX6000 worked right away. Speeds weren't as advertised with WiFi no matter which band I was on but hey, It was far faster than what I had before so I kept it.Then yesterday happened. WiFi suddenly dropped. Both bands. LAN works perfectly though. I could see it, router says its on via lights and config, however not a single device could connect to it. Power cycled, hard reset, even factory reset the device and nothing seemed to work. Contacted tech support via online chat. Waited almost 30mins to get help (which I'm not complaining about) but then the lady attempting to assist with my issue kept disappearing. After an hour of minor chats and a reset, summed up to a total of 5 mins work of convo and work, we have gotten no where and were worse off than when I started.I asked to get the issue escalated, around 1.5 hours in, to someone who knew something as her knowledge was that of a basic call center searching for the answer in the FAQs section. I was denied, so I disconnected. Poor communication skills as well. Repeating questions on answers I gave multiple times 30mins prior. Literally my Saturday afternoon was wasted and she gets paid to toy with my time. Frustrating to say the least.Needless to say, its been 2 months since I have had this and I'm goin to attempt to get this working without the horrible; if you want to call it support then I'm going back to Netgear or try something else from ASUS if theres no resolution.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"One person found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1604707200000}

This makes adding new items easy - you wait for the device to try to log into the SSID, then see that it's been blocked, and you click the box next to it, and hit \"Allow\", and it's in.The TPLink has choice between a Black (disallow) and a White (allow) List.  It requires manual add to the white list, but the add doesn't always workThe only way to get a new item on the white list is to turn access control OFF, let the new device log in, then turn on white list.  Clunky, and not secure.  Make sure to wait at least a minute after turning access control off before logging in a new device, and wait another full minute to allow the new device to show up in your device list.

Once ALG is turned off, it should always be off. Some SIP signalling problems remain which may not be possible to resolve with this router.While there is port teaming for LAN ports, there is no corresponding port teaming capability for WAN ports to take advantage of better cable modems.The Archer AX6000 has a badly lacking traffic monitoring and extremely poor traffic prioritization for real-time interactive voice and video applications. Compared to an older Asus router that the Archer AX6000 was supposed to replace, VoIP quality has dropped significantly.AX6000 antennas which cannot be removed or replaced are also a problem compared to other brands with customizable external antennas.AX6000 guest WiFi options are very poor, and far poorer than other TP-Link WiFi gear, such as the EAP245.Range and performance are no better than less expensive and much older WiFi-4 and WiFi-5 routers. Half of the ethernet ports are very difficult to use due to poor placement under a plastic lip. Lack of Ethernet status LEDs is a big problem when diagnosing Ethernet link problems.At least a couple of the LAN ports should have supported 1\/2.5\/5 Gbps Ethernet. There is no secondary WAN port to attach to a second Internet service provider.TP-Link should have tried much harder to match features of Netgear & AsusLikely to return this router and go for a more expensive Netgear or Asus WiFi-6 router.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"3 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1581724800000}

Initially, the highest speed on my HP Laptop containing a RealTek RTL8821CE (802.11ac\/abgn capable) was a dismal 8Mbps!

The lack of this feature substantially reduces the security for my LAN which is under constant attack (mostly from RU addresses).You can login to the router with HTTP (where you will get a security warning) or HTTPS but the latter has to be explicitly enabled and will also produce a warning from your browser that the address isn't trusted. This is because TP Link uses a self-signed certificate whose trust can't be verified; if TP Link would've just paid for a certificate from a trust agent (for a very minimal cost), you wouldn't get this warning.

I\u2019ve started the return process with TP Link, whose customer service was very responsive, and should get a replacement within a week or 2. Fortunately, I still have my old router that I hope will keep me connected for the short term.

Otherwise, my previous review below is still mostly accurate.I was replacing a 5-year-old NetGear WiFi 5 router that worked great until it started recently and randomly dropping signal to my work and personal computers and was likely at the end of its useful life.Out of the box setup and operation of the AX1800 were very easy with the TP Link app I downloaded to my phone. I followed the directions of powering off my modem, connecting the modem and router via provided ethernet cord, then powering on the modem and router.Once both devices were fully powered, the app guides you through an easy to follow set of steps to get everything connected. All told, it took maybe 15 minutes from opening the box to having a signal to all my devices (hardest part was getting the damn plastic wrap off the antennas!). I have noticeably faster performance with all my devices now with the improved WiFi 6 technology vs. the older WiFi 5.I have a small condo, less than 1,000 sq. ft., with about 8 devices using WiFi, so I'm not in need of the biggest and baddest router that maybe a gamer or multi-person, larger household might want. This one has, so far, worked very well for my needs, and at a very reasonable price of about $70 on sale.One suggestion: This router tends to run hot, especially on the bottom, even though the manufacturer has upgraded the design from the older model to dissipate heat better.

I go to the extender position and look at the signal strength and WOW 5 bars, almost no signal lost (at least i believed) even in my garage where wifi has never reached i got 1 bar. So theoretically this had GREAT range. But no. As soon as my extender connected, the connection dropped and SSID even dissapeared. That was weird, so i pulled out my cellphone thinking the extender was bad. Same result, got 5 bars signal but as soon as i connected, connection dropped and SSID disappeared. Tested 2 more cellphones, 2 laptops, a Nintendo Switch, all to which gave me the exact same result. I closed in to the router with all devices and with a whole day of testing concluded that the signal could be reliably held with ANY device being 5 meters or closer. Thats right, 5 meters. Then i thought, maybe my house is over a iron ore or something. No, i bout a $20 linksys ac1200 and could easily reach the extender 15m away and even more with a stable and reliable signal. Curious is that at about 20m, this router does \"appear\" to have more signal strength than the ac1200, but as soon as connection is attempted, connection drops and SSID dissapears.I would have given it 0 stars, but i guess anything in a 5m radius works well. but totally a BAD ROUTER if what you are looking for is range. If all your devices are 5m o nearer then i guess this is good for that.Tried all firmwares on the support page and nothing fixed this issue.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"396 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1620691200000}

One of the primary purposes of implementing IPv6 is to allow host to host communication access the internet without NAT or other hacks that were used in the IPv4 world. This router simply does not support, in any functional way, IPv6, unless you consider LAN only access as functional. I have tried various ways to access a LAN based server from the WAN side using IPv6 addressing and it simply doesn\u2019t work. I opened a ticket with TP-Link, and after numerous non-responsive replies from their support staff, they finally sent a response saying they don\u2019t support IPv6 firewall rules or DMZ or port mapping for IPv6. So, if you want to use IPv6 to access local resources, forget about it. In my case I use StarLink as my ISP and they use CGNAT which does not functionally support IPv4 based access to local resources. But they are supporting (unofficially at this point) IPv6 addressing. But that only \u201cworks\u201d functionally of your router doesn\u2019t simply block IPv6 inbound traffic at the firewall, and doesn\u2019t support DMZ or other standard features that it should for IPv6 based routing.

I am able to get a solid signal with devices hardwired to the modem or if I use an old router. I worked with their customer support for at least 4 hours. That was all to determine that router just may have and unrecoverable fault. The strange thing is if I slave that router off of my old router it will work just fine. It has been providing internet for the last 3 to 4 weeks as a slave to the old router. That is an unacceptable setup as my old router is almost 10 years old.

I had it up and running in about 5-10 minutes but, for the first 5 days the wifi devices using it were losing their internet connection multiple times a day and the only way to resolve it was to rebooting the modem.  I started to think maybe some of the bad reviews here were true.I started checking settings, reaching out to TP-LINK (great response form them) and to Motorola, for my cable modem\/router combo settings.  Turns out I did not have the Motorola device correctly set for WLAN and Bridge mode (note, the AX21 setup even sees another router and suggest placing the other into Bridge mode, it's just that the Motorola modem required another set to configure the WLAN).  Once that was set the router has been up and running and devices working with it for a week now with no issues.  TP-LINK also had me change some of AX21 internet settings, which I first thought may be part of the issue, but since correctly setting the modem I have changed the AX21 settings back and it still works fine.The wifi coverage on the AX21 is great.  My 100yr old house has plaster walls and large central brick chimney.  The cable modem\/router is set up in a back room\/office but it had weak coverage to the opposite end of the house even with the TP-Link extender I already had.  I ran cabling to place the AX21 in the living room, near the center of the house.  Once set up, the coverage is great.  I like that I was able to change the extender to OneMesh mode and move to another corner of the house to improve outside coverage for some external security cameras and have one wifi ssid throughout;  the dual mode also split out the 2.4ghz (used by the security system) and the 5ghz used by our tablets and phones.  The only wifi version 6 devices we have are our phones and yet on a speed test on all of our wifi devices were able to get the full speed of our cable internet service.  The AX21 and one the one indoor OneMesh extender even covers our entire very large backyard.Note: If I had wanted to keep using the wifi capabilities of my existing modem\/router device, I could left the modem in its default settings and set up the AX21 in access point mode, but I would lose the OneMesh capabilities I wanted for a single network with at least one extender, and my older modem combo only had 2.4ghz, so best for me to use the AX21 as a router and it\u2019s full capabilities.I also like the web admin console and the tether app for the degree of control they provide, from features like checking clients connected and reserving IP addresses to little things like being able to schedule device lights off at night.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":5,"reviewReaction":"32 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1670716800000}

Before this unit I had their tri-band model and was very happy with the performance and feature set in my apartment.

So when my last unit took a direct lightning strike (gotta love Florida even when you have UPS and surge protectors) I decided to look for something with more switch ports.  Before I'd connected a couple of 5-port switches into a couple of the 4 ports on the old SOHO unit.  But this is never as good as going direct to your main switch.  I LOVE the 8 ports on this new unit.I was concerned that the antenna could only be pointed in one direction but that hasn't been a problem and the coverage is very good for my needs.  I have the unit wall mounted since I was concerned about a cat trying to sleep on the warm top of the unit, which is covered with vent holes.  It still runs nice and cool with about 10-12 devices connected via a mix of wired and wireless.  The administrative setup is best done via a web browser (but they do offer a phone app) and I can do things like MAC reservations in DHCP, and a few features that most home users probably never think about.

To make matters worse, tech support is pretty much of no help as they go through their typical checklist which isn\u2019t going to fix the issue.  Because there's something wrong with the routers QoS I have to put it into bridge mode (effectively losing all advanced functionality) just to get it to work right.  It's sad when AT&Ts router works better.In router mode overall DL\/UP speeds aren't greatly impacted, however, QoS is messing with the pipelines (i.e. port throttling).  For example, using speedtest I can get respectable DL\/UP speeds but browsing the web feels sluggish even when changing the DNS server.  Even then my biggest issue isn\u2019t the sluggish browsing but the fact that some apps are being throttled to a significant degree especially on the upload side.  TP-Link heavily caters to Speedtest but they don\u2019t with TestMy.net.  In router mode over bi-directional gigabit fiber testmy.net results in upload speeds of around 30Mbps - SAD.  Now, take Kik Messenger on my Galaxy S10+ as another example.  For some reason I am unable to upload anything.  Literally everything I try uploading fails.  The moment I switch off Wi-Fi or jump on a different Wi-Fi everything works fine again.  I\u2019ve factory reset this router multiple times and even doing the most basic of setups this exact phenomenon occurs.  Now, for giggles I uninstalled kik from my phone and reinstalled it and even installed it on other devices to make sure it wasn\u2019t just my phone and the same symptom occurs.How do I know the issue is with the router still?  Because the moment I switch over to bridge mode NOTHING is throttled or inhibited anymore. In bridge mode the AT&T router is forced to do all the routing, IP address assignments\/routing tables, port forwarding, etc. The TP-Link router functionality is essentially disabled save for the Wi-Fi.  When in bridge mode my phone can connect to the TP-Link router and Kik Messenger works fine \u2013 strange huh?  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the range of the Wi-Fi is fantastic.

{"reviewTitle":"Confusing AX21 Router Versions","reviewDescription":"The router I received from Amazon was the TP-Link Archer AX21 version 4.6, which is the latest hardware version.The Archer AX21 is a confusing router. The TP-Link website shows there have been 7 hardware versions of the AX21. That means that the online reviews at various tech web sites will be discussing features that the latest version may or may not have.For example, the CPU\/processor in v1 & v2 was a 1.5 GHz QUAD-CORE processor, but v3 & v4 have a 1 GHz DUAL-CORE processor. There was a USB port included in v1, v2, & v3, but not v4.To make matters worse, look up the FCC ID number on the label on the bottom of the AX21. The FCC testing documents refer to this router as the \"Archer AX23\".It would be less confusing if review sites would specify exactly what version they were testing. It would also be more honest if TP-Link would just change the model name each time they make a major hardware change.Otherwise, I've been running this router for a week and so far my experience has been positive. I did have to update the firmware. It's a great improvement over my old router.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":4,"reviewReaction":"8 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1708905600000}

Setup was a longer task than I anticipated due to two problems. First I could not use the Tether app on my phone to set it up. I had problems setting up an account to use the app so I gave up and used my laptop to set up wifi. The second problem was extremely frustrating because I couldn't connect to it using the ID and Password from the bottom of the router. After a lot of trial and error I did a hard reset of the router using a paper clip. The problem was the PASSWORD WAS INCORRECT. After the reset it immediately recognized the original password from the bottom of the router and I was in business. I'm wondering if this router was a returned piece of equipment. I purchased what was believed to be a new router but I have to admit I have some doubt.EDIT: I have seen another review where a customer had the same experience as me with the ID and Password on the router not working without a hard reset. They were sure they were shipped a returned router but paid for a brand new one. After reading their comments I realized my router was set up as someone else's and returned to Amazon.

Seems fast, and not much trouble setting it up.  The user interface is very basic, and does not offer access to the advanced features like Netgear, or Cisco.  I did download their app for android, but uninstalled the app after reading and dis-agreeing with their privacy policy.  I don't like the idea of my info being shared with 3rd parties, for whatever reason, excepting as required by law, and to facilitate use and support of the product.  Any, more about the router:  I had a Netgear before, which was a very good router, but was one of the Neatgear routes with the huge security flaw that came out a couple years ago.  When I started to get hacked recently, I decided to get a different router.  So far, it has been more secure.  The features are not as rich as the netgear AC 1750, I had previously, and the build does not seem as robust, but it does work. There is only one light for port connections \/ network instead on a light for each of the 4 ports.  Another thing, the lights are on the front of the router, not the top.  I previously had my router installed with the cables facing out, away from the wall, for easier access.  You can't do that with this one, because the status lights would not be visible that way.  The wi-fi on off switch is a very small button, on the rear of the router, and has combined function of WPA connect button.  The button is depressed for momentary, 1 second to activate the wpa connect feature, or pressed for about 3 seconds to turn wi-fi broadcast and receive on \/ off.  Overall, it is ok, so far, but I have seen better.  The price was low, for a router that does what it does.  Don't know about reliability over the long haul, yet.

Testing  with the router in the same room literally inches away from my computer antenna and with no other devices on the network the wifi speed never topped 650 mbps. I did an identical test with my existing Netgear Nighthawk. Same WiFi speeds and the Netgear actually outran the AX6000 by at least 15% using a wired ethernet connection.This next part I was aware of when I bought it and was not a factor in the decision to buy. I'm just stating it for those who may not be aware. The AX6000 boasts a 2.5Gbs speed WAN port. That's your internet connection. Who needs that even if it were true? My CenturyLink DSL connection runs at a measly 30 Mbps. Even a Cable One connection only runs at 100 Mbps.Bottom line: If you already have an AC router don't waste your money on this. If you're upgrading from an N class-- don't waste your money on this. There are plenty of AC class routers available that are just as fast and less expensive.And for Pete's sake don't fall for the special \"gaming router\" crap with the Star Trek design and a dozen antennas.

However, after watching videos and looking at reviews I figured surely my husband and I can do this.  Just to be safe, though, I asked a former co-worker who worked in my office's IT department to be \"on-call\".  So setting the router up with our modem went well, and I downloaded the app on my phone (with my data on) and proceeded to follow the instructions.  All went well until the step where I was to get an email to continue with the set up - the email never came.  I began to get messages that my server wasn't recognized.  So frustrating!  I could have called the company's tech support but thought I'm not going to wait on-line and deal with the frustration of set up \"from afar\" - been there and done that.  So I called my IT friend who came over and he couldn't understand why my phone couldn't receive an email as he could access the router on his phone.  He then proceeded to set up the router without the use of the app.  We don't have a lot of technology to deal with but the set up of two phones, a TV, two Alexa devices and a Smart Plug was definitely something I doubt I'd have been able to do without assistance.  In hindsight, maybe we just should have rented a router from our cable company - which I'm sure their staff would have installed.  At any rate - won't ever go through this again.  As for how the router works - we've noticed an improvement in speed, less buffering on our TV, and I'm hoping a higher level of security in general than what our aged router was providing.

It's been over 4 months and the router is still going strong as ever!I've searched and compared many routers, so far the 'Archer AX21' (in my opinion) is best in terms of ease of setup, solid performance with connection speed, security, and last but not least - best bang-for-your-buck! Again, solid connection with my new TP-Link AX1800 for over a month now (since Christmas 2022).Upgraded to this new router for my 'legacy' equipment, as such my 12 year-old Dell XPS 17 (L702x) which was connecting anywhere from 12Mbps-144Mbps (sometimes 300Mbps) utilizing an old Apple Airport Extreme 5th Gen router, but now I'm connecting at 867Mbps with the TP-Link! Fast? Yes. Though my current ISP plan only offers 200Mbps so I've got plenty of room to expand.Speedtest showed on average 350-370Mbps connection speed in accordance with the Intel 7260ac WiFi card in my Dell XPS 17 so I'm super happy. Others such as my Apple devices are also connected within speeds. I run dual-band setup on the TP-Link so it can allocate whichever band needed automatically by switching both the 2.4 and 5GHz back and forth for best bandwidth and\/or least congestion to  establish a stable connection. In order to do this you'll need to enable 'Smart Connect' from the TP-Link tether app or browser setup, otherwise you'll only be connecting to one - either 2.4 or 5GHz. I also love how you can monitor every equipment that is connected to your network - complete with name, duration and band\/speed.  Sometimes I do get switched to the 2.4GHz band with speeds of less than 12Mbps but it usually finds itself switching back to higher speeds fairly quickly - which my Airport Extreme fails to do most of the time unless I do a hard reset.That said, this is an exceptional router for the money - it covers dual bands, WiFi 6 capability and the newer WPA3 security feature.

Speeds we're all over the place ranging from 20mbps to over 500mbps. I plugged in my old TP-Link router to make sure it wasn't the modem, and the modem is not the issue. Others have reported connectivity and spend consistency issues in other reviews.  Buyer beware!*Original* Install was a pain as some of the directions were not clear (I had to use Google to change some of the settings I needed to customize) and there was a connectivity issue at first.  I'm wondering if that was due to not logging into my old TP-Link router settings and deleting off the previous router's MAC address. If so, then either the installation information in the box or in the settings menu should warn you ahead of time.That said, once I got things up and running, WiFi speeds went from about 125bps to over 500mbps. I'm on a 900mbps plan, but due to where I live, the shared bandwidth in my neighborhood reduces that speed, which can happen.If you're upgrading from an old router and\/or not very tech savvy, then I can see how install would be a challenge.Five stars once you get it up and running.  Four stars because setup takes WAY longer than it should.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1684454400000}

{"reviewTitle":"Wanted to like it . . .","reviewDescription":"After getting Comcast's gigabit internet, I wanted to upgrade to an AX router for our 2,100 sf single-floor condo. This was the second AX router, of three, that I tried. It was easy to install, had reliable uptime, and put out a nice strong signal in pretty much every corner of our home. There were three problems, though. The first was that I could not - for some reason - get good wireless speeds out of this unit. Holding my iPhone 11 just a couple feet from the router, I maxed out at around 600 Mbs at the most, and in normal use would generally see around 250 to 300 Mbs. That's for a WiFi 6 client, with the wired speed at the modem testing 930 Mbs+. Router speeds seem to really vary based on your individual situation, so YMMV, but that was my experience.  Second, for some reason this unit was really squirrelly when I tried to attach USB hard drives - they would show up in the router interface just fine, would mount on my MacBook Pro, but then would hang when I tried to actually read or write data. USB flash drives would work fine, though. Could be an issue with power at the USB ports, not sure, but the drives I tried all worked fine with my laptop. Finally, and this is the really weird one, my 2-year old HP wireless printer would not work on 2.4 Ghz. It would connect to the network just fine, with a 5-bar signal, but none of my devices could see it, even after going through every network troubleshooting step under the sun. It wouldn't even work via AirPrint with Apple devices - they simply couldn't see the printer even though they were connected to the same network.One problem I can deal with but not three, so had to return it.  That's why I buy from Amazon. It seems that Routers capable of truly handling gigabit wireless speeds are still kind of inconsistent at this point, and you may need to just try a few before you find one that works for your particular situation. Now I'm on the Netgear RAX120, which seems to be working much better for me - at least after 24 hours. We'll see.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":2,"reviewReaction":"","country":"United States","date":1592870400000}

The second concern is the channels that are defaulted for 2.4 and 5.0 GHz bands.  The house lots in my neighborhood are large (3\/4 acre and up).  On my laptop there are 21 WAPs showing in my home. To determine the best channels to set the wifi to I use inSSIDer software (there are several others)  on the laptop to measure the signal level at different locations in my home.  I was able to set the channels to minimize outside WAP interference.  FWIW the 2.4GHz channel only has 1,6,&11 as clear channels and Cisco\/Linksys default to channel 6.  My next neighbor is using channel 11 so I can only use 1 for a camera.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673481600000}

{"reviewTitle":"Initial experience is a mixed bag","reviewDescription":"So let's start out by saying this is an expensive router. At this price, I expect no issues whatsoever. However, here's the experience I've had within the first few days. The first thing I did was downloaded the most recent firmware (as of 9\/20\/20) which is Archer AX6000(US)_V1_200714. I set the Wifi to Smart Wifi, the 5Ghz signal either no longer showed up on my devices or it was not allowing me to log into it. Note that the 2Ghz and 5Ghz SSIDs both have the same password so it wasn't an issue of me hitting the wrong password between the two. Then the 5Ghz SSID simply wouldn't show up. I went back into the router and turned off Smart Wifi which then, in the UI, split the 2Ghz and 5Ghz channels and let me put in settings on each. When using \"Auto\" for channel selection, the 5Ghz SSID still didn't show up in devices. I then chose a manual channel (48) and rebooted. Now 5Ghz SSID did appear on devices. Great. But channel 48 was busy around me, 144 was clear, so I chose 144, saved and rebooted. 5Ghz showed up on 144 for an hour or so but then I noticed I was connecting to 5Ghz on 48 again. I went back into the router UI and now am seeing that in the dashboard the 5Ghz signal is on channel 48 but in the advanced setup on 5Ghz, it's still set to 144.I also notice that a lot of settings can be set and you hit save in the UI and you expect that setting to be working as expected but it actually doesn't get applied until you reboot the router.wtf???I don't have too much time to play with this but if this continues to be an issue for the next week or two, I will probably end up returning this thing.For the price, I really should not be seeing these issues at all.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":3,"reviewReaction":"2 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1600819200000}

{"reviewTitle":"Worked great at first but then became very unstable","reviewDescription":"Upgraded from a 4-year old Asus router due to a gradual increase in devices over the years - I have about 50 devices (including a dozen Chromecasts streaming Hulu Live TV among other things) and although the Asus did fairly well, I noticed some trouble when there was a lot of traffic, especially streaming. Memory and CPU would max out 100% of the time and streaming would be interrupted. I upgraded to this router for the additional processing horsepower, enhanced range, and future WiFi 6 (AX) support. I also considered the Asus equivalent as I have been a long time Asus user but I went with this one for the additional antennas, better processing\/co-processing and overall reputation if TP-Link products. i would love to have both in hand to test but that's a little more buy\/return effort than I wanted to do. I believe Asus also makes great products.The router setup was extremely easy with the Tether app via bluetooth - the best I've seen in fact. I was up and running within minutes and had all my tweaking done in about an hour. Tweaking meaning setting up IPV6, custom DNS servers, etc. I have a single SSID for both 2.4 and 5.0 so that the clients can connect to whichever they find better. Right now it is about half and half. One note about the tether app - it will stay in bluetooth mode (meaning you have to be near the router) unless you enable remote management in the router settings. It is handy for managing the router without logging into the browser page, although I will say that not all options are available in the app and I found the browser setup to work very well.So far the performance and range of the router has been excellent with the exception of one thing. I was experiencing difficulty connecting some of my apple products to the 2.4GHz radio. After an email to TP-Link tech support (which was replied to very quickly), they asked me to turn off AX support in the 2.4GHz radio. I turned it off for 2.4 (and 5.0 simply because there are no AX clients yet for either anyway) and it immediately fixed the problem but I still have trouble connecting on occasion to the 2.4GHz radio. It begs the question why you would have to turn off a feature but I'm trusting there will be a firmware fix down the road before I have any AX clients and to fix the iPhone connectivity issue. If not I would be inclined to come back here and downgrade the rating since a large part of the cost of this router is AX compatibility.I have 115Mb\/s internet service and I get that or very very close everywhere in my two story plus basement home. I'm sure it covers the yard too but I haven't tested it well since it is winter. Using a throughput app I get gigabit speeds near the router and 600-900 on other floors even in the far corners. So overall it should suit my needs as I am hoping 500Mb\/s service or better will be available at some point for my area. All my smart devices (bulbs, plugs, thermostats, vacuum, cameras etc) work perfectly. This is one reason I went with a single router rather than a mesh system - I read reports of smart devices having difficulty with some of the mesh systems. I have not tried them however.Overall I'm pleased with a little more testing to do before my return period is up. I hope they keep up with firmware updates and add some more features such as the ability to have a timed guest network (I used that all the time on my Asus router for parties, it would remove the guest network at a set time so I didn't have to remember to go back in and turn it off) and the ability to set up multiple guest networks (not as important for me). It's an expensive router but hopefully it will last me several years, and that they will enable the WiFi-6\/AX features.UPDATE: After a few weeks with the router, I'm having some more issues. iPhone products are disconnecting and the router is going offline and online about 2-3 times per day, which then disconnects many of my smart home products. Some of those products wouldn't reconnect (especially the cameras) without a full power cycle of the router. I've been working with tech support and I'm still hopeful to get a firmware fix to help. Otherwise, I'm going back to Asus as I have always found those to be extremely robust. Until I figure it all out, I'm downgrading this rating to 3 stars. If I have to return, I'll downgrade it again to 1.UPDATE 2\/11\/19: Unfortunately I'm returning. As I said above, the router has a lot of potential but it's simply not ready for release. I don't know if it is bad hardware or bad firmware but the thing goes offline several times a day. Despite working with tech support (who is very responsive and they do try to help), I can't get this thing to stay online and be stable. I ordered an Asus RT-AX88U and so far it is outstanding. Performance is excellent and it hasn't gone offline or rebooted in a week. I should've never left Asus!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"287 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1548720000000}
{"reviewTitle":"\"UNCLE!\" I quit. Ethernet won't connect - Unknown Network - fix\/break, fix and break - I'm exhausted","reviewDescription":"I didn't WANT a new router, but Norton terminated support for the Norton Core router and even without the software it won't work as a router anymore. I upgraded to this AX6000 - I wanted a router with more ethernet ports and an interface I could use from my PC (I don\u2019t want just an ap or on my phone). I thought the newest option for mesh would be a good option to go with. It\u2019s been nothing but a time-sucking royal pain that is completely unreliable. If I could throw it through the window at this point, I would. But then I wouldn\u2019t be able to write this review, so I\u2019m looking for something that has less bells and whistles and actually works.Issue 1 - ethernet: ethernet doesn't work on at least half my devices. Ethernet - the simplest of connections - just a plug, no drama. Wrong. Days trying to figure out why it won't assign the gateway address, doing all sorts of crap from every website I can find that has some kind of solution. Once I get it fixed, another has the same problem. Every day, and sometimes multiple times a day. I have spent so much time with so many different things, and then only to have to revisit the same problem on other ether connections. Some are win10, some win11, 1 for my solar system (no idea what OS); some directly connected, some thru a hub, some through a switch. All have the same issue at various times, and I cannot figure out ANY kind of commonality, cause, or fix. All worked fine with the old router. I\u2019ve changed the lease time, theIssue 2 \u2013 interface: Nothing in the interface is \u201csortable\u201d and I have to scroll through pages in two different places to see what is connected. There\u2019s a network page that shows some info, but not all the info. So I have to go to the more detailed page, that shows different info. Not sure why all of it can\u2019t be shown on one page (selectable and sortable). Pain to troubleshoot.Issue 3 \u2013 tech support: Mostly useless. I tried chat, and got the standard runaround with the first call. The second call had a good tech \u2013 listened to my problem, asked the right questions, and didn\u2019t waste my time. He determined that the problem was my tp-link switch, and sent me an RMA. That wasn\u2019t the problem \u2013 because eventually on one of the many permutations of changing settings on the PCs, pulling wires, resetting the router, and generally doing everything two or three times (or more, for the upteemth time) I hit the right combo of technical aerobatics and the PC connected. So, as I suspected, the switch was fine. As was the cable. As was the port. As was, as was \u2026 you get the idea. No definable or repeatable circumstances or solution.Right now I have just one PC connected by ethernet. And my solar reconnected (finally) but it no longer knows its name and identifies as \u201cunknown\u201d even though I have edited its name and it has shown up fine, by name, after most of the resets.On wireless - we thought the Range Extender might be confusing things. It\u2019s verified to be compatible with this router. We changed it\u2019s names, its location, it\u2019s pw, connected and not connected - we did discover that everything wireless seemed to find just the router, so we\u2019ve pulled that out completely to make troubleshooting easier.I\u2019ll quit now, so I can go search for a new router. Too late to send this one back, but it\u2019s not going to stay on my network. I don\u2019t have time or energy to babysit the thing. As I sit here my internet connection has dropped in and out at least 5 times. Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, wondering if this is also what\u2019s causing the \u201cspottiness\u201d on our streamed content, too.

I am by no means an expert with all things computing, but I believe (probably my first mistake) that have a bit more knowledge than the typical consumer when it comes to computers and peripherals.I work from home and deal with a lot of research and large data files.  The stay at home order has crippled my  ability to get anything done because of the massive \"streaming\" being done eating up bandwidth by those stuck at home so I paid 3k to have fiber-optic brought to my house and get out from under the local cable internet suppliers.  I did my research and this model came in the top 3 of virtually every review I looked at, some saying it was not as fast as some or possibly had a couple less features but they all pretty much said it was a solid reliable choice that would be able to \"upgrade\" as technology advanced and you did not need to be up on the latest in the techworld to get it up and running. So I chose this model.  Fiber optic gets installed and I make sure to do all the very simple instructions to set up the router, making sure I do them \"in order\", and.... nothing. Bright red light means no internet connectivity. I tried trouble shooting for an hour to no avail.  So I call my fiber optic ISP and ask them why I have no service and they tell me everything checks out and that they see an AX6000 connected to the system with an IP and Mac address of xxx ..... So if they can see my router why is my router not working?  So I go to tech support which by the way is only currently open 4pm to 8am PST due to the pandemic and only available in chat form, but fortunately its 5:30pm and I have a laptop connected to my old internet which I have not cancelled yet. I am now chat queue #16 not bad should not take long. 6:30pm rolls in and \"how may we help you\". I explain the issue, and we work through a couple of things with no resolution. Then a shift change happens at the tech support group and I get a new tech who says unplug the Ethernet cable and plug it directly into your computer's Ethernet port, which I do and suddenly my desktop is screaming on the internet at 700Mbs down and up (tested). Now plug it back into router, reboot the router and voila bright red = no signal.So I know the internet connection is working and the issue is the router......  We try several more attempts to fix it and at 10pm (yes 3.5hrs later) the tech says that this needs to be sent to their senior tech level support and that they will be contacting me by email within 1 business day to get things fixed. I ask what hours the senior techs work and the answer is 6 am to 6pm pst, my time zone. That was Thursday night, its now Saturday. Last I checked Friday is a business day and the tech said they work 6-6 in my time zone so its not like there is a time difference issue.So I still don't have my really expensive WiFi router working and it is past my return date because it took so long for the fiber optic to get installed during the lockdown in my state and I am NOT happy.  Note that not only do I have a brand new fiber optic internet connection that we proved worked, I also upgraded my computer to a gen 10 Intel I-9 with a WiFi 6 enabled motherboard. Not trying to impress, in fact the exact opposite, all of my equipment is brand new and at the high end of the personal computer tech world. So connecting this router should have been plug and play in about 15 minutes.  More than 5 hours of attempting to get it working and I have nothing to show for it.  As of right now I cannot recommend that anyone buy this router.I will update if this gets resolved or if I use it as a paperweight.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"18 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1596844800000}

So much for TP.Initial review of first router which I sent back:I was excited to receive this new router, as my three year old, expensive, Nighthawk gaming router was dropping devices and, at times, losing WIFI entirely. The app is fine to program with if you don't want to do much with the settings, however, it took me several resets to finally get everything going with it. I should have known an issue was lurking within the beast. Once it had the settings I required (I had to use the IP address and program with my laptop), it seemed to function just fine and exhibited lightning fast download and upload numbers. But...The 2.4G is necessary for my security cams, so I cannot utilize the \"smart\" feature which doles out the frequencies. Unfortunately, this particular unit didn't care what I wanted to use. The thing comes with the smart setting turned on, so I turned it off and programmed my bands with names etc. After applying the changes and saving, all looked fine. At least it looked that way! Unfortunately, the smart feature must have been faulty, as it would turn itself back on and the 4G would vanish. Several times I reset the router, each time with high hopes. The fact is, the 4G would not operate at all. Not once did the 2.4 GHZ signal appear, and all of my cameras and certain other  pieces of video equipment were inoperable as well. After several hours of frustration, I packed it up and ordered another, different brand, of equipment.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"9 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1661299200000}
{"reviewTitle":"Horrible signal, Poor USB performance - avoid if you want a network drive","reviewDescription":"The wifi signal is s*** which is most important. I have a small house. It is basically the size of an average 2 bedroom apartment inside (about 1,000 sq ft) and one level. The router is mounted on the wall of my office aligned with the trim of the door. The doorway is in view of the TV in the living room and maybe 10-15 feet away from SHIELD device on tv stand. The wifi signal is about a quarter of the speed of the ethernet even that close. When I connect wifi in the same room as the router on any pc it is about 1\/4 to 1\/3 of the speed of ethernet. Even with router inches away. No settings changes have improved this.That being said, Wifi has mostly been functional enough as my main PC is ethernet connected anyway. But I wanted to transfer the external hard drive for my PLEX server (media server I run from home that has all of my digital movies and music) and plug it into the USB port of the router and add that as a network drive to use on the laptop that controls the PLEX server. It takes about 30 minutes for it to add folders and files when the network drive is mapped to one of my windows PCs. And then it just stops adding files. So in my movies folder there are 1100 movies for example. It only adds 500-900 of them when I do a refresh of the USB device in the router settings. Arbitrarily adding or not adding stuff.In my TV shows folder I have about 20 different series of shows with multiple seasons. It adds absolutely none of these most of the time as it seems it gets tired scanning the drive and just stops at arbitrarily different times when scanning.It often simply does not even show up as a device in windows. I would say it is because it is USB 2.0 and too slow, but it seems the USB port also lacks the proper power to even run it or the router cannot handle so many files while scanning via USB.This router has been a complete disappointment again and again. I bought a new one with USB 3.0 and a better range and I hope it works better.If you have a larger home especially avoid this router. Maybe the more expensive models will work better but they all seem to have USB 2.0 - a network drive is a wonderful thing to have, so even if right now you don't have one you may want one later.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"42 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1648425600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Poor Quality, Poor Service, Poor Corporate Policy","reviewDescription":"The TP-Link Archer AX6000 worked for 4 days before it started intermittently loosing connections on the 2.4G band.  By  day 6 the 2.4G band stopped funtioning at all.  I have three printers and a number of IOT devices that only work on the 3.4G band and none of the are accessable now.  The TP-Link support personnel are friendly and do their best to help but link most consumer electronics support groups, the have little training, especially on diagnosing actual broken products.  Their training, if any, appears based on the assumptions that all problems are user\/configuration problems.  In addition, TP-Link is overly ridged with their policies and have no path to circumvent them when there are unusual circumstances.  I cannot recommend that anyone purchase a TP-Link product.  I purchased two TP-Link products within a couple of days of each other and experienced problems with both.P.S.  TP-Link refused to take a return for refund after only the unit went belly up after only 7 days of use.  They will only replace the unit and for that, you have to pay shipping which in my case was $24+ by FEDEX ground. which was the cheapest.  I hope to good that FEDEX loses it or destroys it as that is the only way I can get my money back and I certainly do not want another TP-Link product.It took 3 more days once TP-Link admitted the unit was defective just to get an RMA number.  The instructions state that it may take upto 5 says after they receive the defective unit to process the return and then they will \"graciously\" ship it free of charge back to you by the economical, \"hence the slowest\", method possible.  However, the will ship it by a faster method if you are willing to pay.I think there is something rotten in Denmark or rather Amazon that this unit is listed as an \"Amazon's choice\".  I also have questions about Amazon's rating system when this unit has a four star rating when there are 12 pages, yes that pages not individual, of 1 star reviews for a WiFi 6 router.  Someone has to be skewing the numbers as WiFi 6 has not been out that long.  Amazon will not help you with this router.  When they say this unit comes with Amazon support, they mean that when you call them, they will conference in TP-Link support and remain silent in the background.  I feel very sorry for anyone who buys a TP-Link product, especially this router.Reading the one star reviews confirms there is a definite problem with the 2.4G band and TP-Link has done nothing to fix it.  I a wandering if there are enough customer's with defective units to start a class action law suite to for TP-Link to either fix the problem or refund our money!!!!!!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"274 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1573344000000}

The QoS on the AX6000 is constantly on and you cannot use basic QoS style rules. Setting something \"On\" in the device priority option actually makes it even worse.

TP-Link put out a firmware release that broke the routers 2.4Ghz band. I have gone back and forth with their support. Since it is out of warranty they told me the best they can do is give me a 10% discount on a new router. My response to them is that no one spends $300 on a router to have it break in 3 years especially when the reason it broke was because of the new Firmware put out by TP-Link. I have the V1 version of this router and their new firmware (although looks very nice) apparently has issues if you have allot of devices connecting to it.They refuse to acknowledge that they broke it and their investigation into the problem is non-existent. Since their support keeps answering me in extremely broken English I decided it was time to buy a different brand.----This router is most definitely future proof. The interface is very easy to manuever. I was able to create static IPs for all the smart devices in my home (over 30 of them) and then limit the DHCP range above those IPs with no issues. It most definitely has a stronger signal than my old router (Linksys WRT3200ACM).Notes----------------------Has no sorting abilities when look at large parts of information, for example when looking at all the devices that are currently in the system there is no order to it so its hard to see whats going on. Hopefully in a future firmware they add the ability to sort. With smart homes become a thing with LOTS of devices this will be imperative.Cons----------------------Media Server (using the USB) does not appear to work properly. I had a My Book Pro with 4tb connected to it (it worked perfectly fine with my old router). I was able to map drives to it from my PC and see everything but when I turned on the media server it would not pick up any of the images, videos or mp3s that I had on the drive. I had 4 main folders on the drive, the first folder was just my shared drive stuff. Lots of random files PDF, Word Documents etc.... the other 3 folders where spread to \"Photos, Music, Videos\". For some reason the Media server would scan the documents folder and find some images in there and put that in the photo section and then stop. It would never find anything else and it did not matter what I did it would not work.I ended up selling the My Book Pro and getting a NAS drive that had the media server built into it.Outside of the Media Server it is a great router, really love it.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"5 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1587686400000}
{"reviewTitle":"worst router ever","reviewDescription":"if you wall mount it it's not ideal. I wish that was made more clear in the description. It is because of the antenna placement. the antennas are awful. they boast 8 antennas but you really can't direct them in any different direction as they will only fold down to the sides. I don't know who thought of this but it's a terrible idea to not be able to make the antennas omnidirectional. the other thing is it's bulky\/heavy. in this day and age there's no need for such a heavy router when they could fit that equipment in a smaller version.

The \"support\" seemed helpful but their lack of knowledge resulted in a great deal of time and effort wasted.  In the end, I had to separate the IoT devices onto a separate router and bingo, all the issues disappeared. These routers are not as capable as advertised, so unless you have less than about 20 TOTAL wifi devices in your home then you have to buy a more expensive router such as the Deco system. This was the admission I finally received from TP-Link support:  \"Unfortunately the Archer AX6000 number of connected clients causes unstable connectivity. Deco system would be better than router.

All the old tp-link devices correctly complain that they cannot find the Internet but will not let you tell the tp-link app what the correct SSID is. This is criminally negligent tp-link kasa device design because uninstalling does not clear the device's persistent connection settings so a re-install will resurrect the old, now non-existent router settings.

{"reviewTitle":"Disappointing product and even more disappointing support","reviewDescription":"The Product:Just over two years after purchase this product is completely useless. A few weeks ago I began having intermittent outages with my internet. After eliminating my isp and modem as the issues I was able to determine my router was causing 100% packet loss making me unable to even load a web page.Support:While talking to support I tried several of their suggested fixes and provided them with the serial number and date I purchased my router from Amazon. Support told me they would like to end the chat, search for a solution on their own and contact me via email. I received an email saying TP would be sending me a replacement after I provided them with my serial number and invoice. I did and the next day I received an email saying I would not receive a replacement because the router was no longer under warranty. I had already provided that information initially, never asked for the replacement, but they told me I was getting on.I responded letting them know I was dissatisfied with the series of interactions and they replied offering me 10% off of a new router of my choosing from an authorized retailer. I sent them a link for an ax80 from Amazon which was listed at $229.99 and currently running a $20 off coupon. They replied saying that since the router was already on sale they could not give me a code for the 10% they offered and I could chose another one. I realize it\u2019s only a few dollars difference, but that\u2019s besides the point. In the end their \u201csolution\u201d to retain a loyal customer who had become dissatisfied with their product and support was to a) take back their 10% offer and have me accept the 8.7% everyone was receiving or b) have me select a product I dont even want to get 10% off.Because of all of this I have been stuck using this unreliable, at best, router for an additional week thinking they would do right by me. Do yourself a favor and avoid this product and company.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"7 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1696636800000}
{"reviewTitle":"Pass it up, Buggy. Maybe I'll get a AX router in a few years","reviewDescription":"I was super excited to get this router, though hesitant. I have bought 1 other TP-Link product, and the quality on that was really lacking I felt. But I figured its been a few years, and this is their HIGH end gear.I love the router I have, but I have a galaxy s10+ and would love to be an early adopter of Wi-Fi 6 and get the full potential speeds of my Gigabit Fiber internet. Well, sadly that didn't work outQuick rundownPros;The most simple and flawless setup I've ever had with a router. The Teather app is super easy to use. I had it up and running the latest firmware in 5 minutes.Wi-Fi Range and speeds are phenomenal on my Gigabit connection*Web interface is very expansive, with lots of options under advanced for those who care.Cons;**please note all of these issues never happened on my other router (Linksys EA9300 Max-Stream) So it is not a hardware issue or issue with my internet service**VERY unstable performance. Works good for 5 minutes then starts to get unstable. If I reboot it works ok again for a bit, etc.Wired connections don't run as well as you'd thinkFile transfers were all over the place, and not consistent. Ping was not as stable as id like, lots of jitter too.Web-pages loaded quickly, but strangely streaming videos I had issues. They buffered a lot, and lots of frames were dropped. Some would glitch out and I'd have to restart the page.Wi-Fi had good speeds but videos also took slightly longer to buffer vs my old router.I dropped frames, which never happened before either. I even had issues when streaming 4k, like some how the packets my phone received were corrupt somehow. (which went away when I switched back to my other router)Like others, my apple products preformed much slower on this router. My iPad mini use to get 550+mbps with my Linksys, with this router it dropped down to 150mbps, and preformed noticeably slower. The backwards comparability was not an improvement or the same as AC routers, but a step back.NO WAY TO DISABLE QOS settings, which I have theorize may be a big cause of the issues. (ever router I've Tried QOS on made performance buggy and unstable. If you know what I mean, you'll totally get it)So all in all, I'm going to have to return this, which is a shame.IDK if its that Wi-Fi 6 needs some more time to mature, If this is a low quality product, or if TP-Link is not a good company (maybe a little of each)...But it appears I should have went with my gut and waited for a brand I trusted more to release gear. But the deal they were running was too tempting...So folks, I would steer clear of this one, even for a good deal, and go with a more stable router.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"69 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1563321600000}
{"reviewTitle":"Not very good if it won't stay powered on","reviewDescription":"This review is for the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX21).  I also have the AC1750 TP-Link router that I bought a few weeks ago and have had no problems with it, which is why when I needed another one I bought this one since it was an upgraded model. It looked good out of the box and I got it booted up and on my network and started going through the set up. While I was doing this I had to move it closer to the network connection so I could plug in the computer I was using on the 192.168.0.1 network to access setup.When I did, it powered off. I only moved it 3 feet and didn't unplug the power or WAN cable. I had to unplug it and plug it back in a couple of times before it powered up. I had to restart the setup sequence again. While going through the setup it powered off a couple more times but finally it stayed up long enough for me to get the setup completed and able to connect my laptop to it over wireless. I was careful not to move any cables while doing this.After I was finished testing the wireless I picked up the router and it powered off again. I wiggled the power connection going into the back of the router and the light finally came back on and it booted up.  After it booted up I lightly pushed against the connector plug and it powered down. It took some wiggling of the connector and pulling the plug out and putting it back in a few time to finally have a light come back on. Obviously there is something wrong with the plug or the connection inside the unit that causes it to lose power when it's moved a little bit. It's being returned tomorrow and I've not decided yet if I'll try another one or look for a different brand.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"26 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1673308800000}

{"reviewTitle":"Unreliable with Horrible Interface","reviewDescription":"After configuring my TP-Link AX1800, the router started rebooting itself by random after only 36 hours of use...tried multiple times to update firmware and factory reset the unit but to no avail. Have been using other TP-Link product for years including an AC1750 router which I absolutely love, so I was a bit surprised at how unreliable this product was.I've initiated a return of this router but I will not be replacing it with the same model. Aside from the reliability issue I found one thing I absolutely hate about it. The web UI.I use DHCP reservation, meaning I assign specific IP addresses to the corresponding MAC addresses on my devices...I keep a separate list of these MAC addresses in plain text.The DHCP reservation section of the TP-Link AX1800 is different from other TP-Link appliances I've used. YOU CAN ONLY CUT AND PASTE MAC ADDRESSES IN TWO DIGITS AT A TIME! Let me repeat that: TWO DIGITS AT A TIME...a MAC address contains TWELVE hexadecimal digits. So I have to break up a single MAC address for cut and paste SIX TIMES. Multiply that for every device you want to reserve DHCP addresses and you're looking at a world of inconvenience.What were these people thinking? It's already cumbersome to manually type in MAC addresses, so why take away full cut and paste functionality from your UI? The TP-Link AC1750 isn't limited like this...entering MAC addresses takes up a single field, not like the TP-Link AX1800 which breaks up MAC address into six two digit fields. Even my much older Netgear N300 allows full cut and paste of MAC addresses.Again, I've used many TP-Link products in the past, and up until today I actually preferred them over other manufacturers. So this AX1800 router surprises me: it is both unreliable and a pain to configure, and as such I don't know if I will be going with TP-Link again.","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"28 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1677888000000}
{"reviewTitle":"TP-Link AX1800 .... Drops internet connection!","reviewDescription":"The bottom line is this .... the Archer AX21 router does not provide a reliable internet connection.At first, everything worked as advertised.  I unboxed the AX1800 router and connected it to my desktop computer using the included ethernet cable. Then I configured the router using the router's webpage interface to set up the SSID & password, and other necessary configuration settings.  After saving the settings, I powered down the router and connected the AX21 to my Spectrum cable modem.  At this point the WiFi connection was solid, and download speed and WiFi signal strength was good.  As recommended by TP-Link, I updated the router firmware successfully, turned off automatic firmware updates, saved the settings and rebooted the router. Everything was still working fine .... at least for a while.After I had been using the AX21 for about two weeks, things took an abrupt turn for the worse!  I was watching Netflix, and suddenly the movie stopped playing and an error message showed up - no internet. So reset the AX21 and continued watching the show. The next day it happened again - three internet disconnects over a wired ethernet connection from the TV to the router!  And two days later, when I was using my desktop computer on a WiFi connection, I had to remotely reset the router several times to re-establish my internet connection. The WiFi signal remained strong, but there was no internet connection. Tried replacing the ethernet cable from the modem to the router, but this didn't resolve the problem.So after this disappointing turn of events, I disconnected the AX21 router and installed an old Netgear router that I used to use 10 years ago .... and the dropped connections stopped happening!  So the problem was definitely caused by the TP-Link router.This prompted me to check the reviews that other people had posted for the AX21, and I found that other people were also having the same random disconnect problems!  So I decided to return the router to Amazon for a refund.If you absolutely have to have a reliable internet connection for your home or business, I suggest that you stay away from this TP-Link router .... it is not trustworthy!","isVerified":true,"ratingScore":1,"reviewReaction":"36 people found this helpful","country":"United States","date":1642118400000}
{"reviewTitle":"Router is continuously going off\/online","reviewDescription":"Purchased this router and an extender hoping it would be better than the rental equipment of big DSL company months ago but life happened and I\u2019m past the return date of course.

{"reviewTitle":"UPDATE: Purchase Twice, Broke Twice. BEWARE.","reviewDescription":"This product stopped working completely after only 6 weeks. The WAN port just stopped receiving internet signal one day. I exhausted all of the troubleshooting that I knew and even worked with my internet service provider to confirm that nothing on their end was wrong. Nope. The router just STOPPED WORKING randomly.I couldn't return it at that point so I tried working with their support to get a replacement or a refund. THEIR SUPPORT IS AWFUL. I have an email chain 10+ messages long back and forth where I repeat over and over all of the things I did to fix their crappy router. After over a week of back and forth we just bought a different router and hoped that they would eventually send a replacement. Life got busy and they were so TERRIBLE at helping that they just closed my ticket.It's a matter of principle at this point that they do the right thing and take responsibility for their bad product. I would chuck the thing in the trash if I could. Seriously, you should consider purchasing from a different company. Just know that if you run into problems with your router...your basically out of luck because their support is miserable.UPDATE: The second router (same model) that I purchased has also stopped working. I am LIVID. It slowly stopped being able to connect with my work laptop, then an Alexa echo. I had IT folks from my work and from Amazon providing assistance. I rebooted these devices. Nope. It was the router. Again. I want to smash this thing with a hammer and set it on fire. I HATE this model of router. I thought TP Link was supposed to be a good brand? I'm so angry. It had cost me DAYS of working time troubleshooting and trying to reconnect.
