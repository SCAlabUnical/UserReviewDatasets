The hotel is well-located at the corner of 77th and Madison Ave, just a short block from Central Park and an easy walk to many museums, including the Frick and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  It is also on one of the nicest stretches of Madison Avenue, so the shopping is fantastic.  The Mark is not a huge hotel, with just about 100 rooms (about half the size of the nearby Carlyle), giving it a boutique, intimate feel. \n\nThe defining feature of The Mark is its service.  The hotel makes you feel like family.  Nothing is too much trouble for the amazing doormen (doorpersons?) and concierge staff, who will get you into the city's best restaurants and arrange almost anything you might need during your stay.  (Thank you, Vinmore, for your supreme patience in booking our various dining experiences, and Gabriela, for going above and beyond to arrange the perfect table for my wife's birthday dinner at the hotel's Jean-Georges restaurant.)   The hotel has a complementary black SUV and driver for guests as well on a first-come basis.  \n\nThe lobby sports The Mark's characteristic black and white striped marble floors, with a seating area and the gorgeous adjacent bar and the restaurant.  We ate twice at Jean-Georges, and the food was really excellent.  The bar and restaurant are lively and packed (lots of very well-dressed people, many of whom look like they are on their way to or from a gala of one kind or another.)  We had adjoining rooms overlooking quiet 77th, with a central door that, once closed, allowed us to go between the rooms in complete privacy.  The rooms are spacious, with a very comfortable king bed, a club chair, and a round table with two chairs.  Many of the hotel's rooms are suites, which are even more luxe.  The bathrooms are black and white marble, with a separate shower (amazing water pressure) and tub.   \n\nBreakfast at the hotel is also excellent, and we also ate a few breakfasts around the corner at Sant Ambroeus, where one can dine indoors (bustling) or in one of their uber-chic sidewalk tents where each table is in its own glass-enclosed, heated room with its own door, where one can sip espresso and eat breakfast in complete privacy while watching well-heeled upper east siders pass by.  The whole experience at the hotel and places like Sant A give off a distinctly European vibe.   \n\nIn short, this is an elegant, warm hotel run seamlessly by consummate professionals who are eager to enhance your NYC experience.  It is not cheap to be sure - but we felt it was worth every penny.  We had a great time there.    ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This is our 2nd stay (same time back in 2019).  One of the other reviewers captured it best with \"old-fashioned luxury!\"  So true.  \n\nWe loved our room.  We were in a suite facing 77th Street; we opted for a slightly bigger room then our last stay.  We were traveling with our boys - 9 and 11.  The boys utilized the pull-out sofa that was promptly made and also turned down each morning and night.     The bathroom is the best part.  They are huge.  The water pressure is amazing (we live in CA \ud83d\ude2c).  The bedding was  luxurious and everything was incredibly clean - important these days!\n\nThe staff was so friendly and welcoming.  The Concierge went above and beyond to help us assemble a toy for my nephew's first birthday.  We used the car service several times, as well.\n\nWe loved ordering coffee and pastries each morning.  We booked through AMEX, so breakfast was included.  We had drinks in the bar several times - such a cozy spot.

My husband was running the NYC marathon and I decided to book a room because I didn't want to travel on public transportation with an unvaccinated baby and toddler. The only reason I booked at the Mark was because there was supposed to be a 48 hour vacancy between guests. However, I found out that morning that the policy had changed. I was really upset because I wanted to keep the kids safe. Hardy was so helpful speaking with a manager to upgrade us to the one room that had no guests leading up to our check in. The 2 bedroom allowed us to have the kids nap separately and my husband was able to get ready without disturbing them. The full kitchen was really helpful as was a small table for us to eat at. The only issue was my toddler had a hard time napping in the smaller bedroom because there was so much light. It was also nice having 2.5 bathrooms. The bellhops were really friendly and so helpful. We ordered out for all our meals, and the bellhop would bring it up to our room. I forgot his name (sorry!) but he even brought me a new cup of tea when the deliveryman spilled my entire cup.\n\nThe location can't be beat. It's right next to Central Park and made it so easy to rush out the door with 2 little ones to catch my husband running by.\n\nAlso, we were on the 11th floor and didn't have long waits for the elevator. It was also very quiet in the bedrooms. I could hear sirens for a minute from the living room but it wasn't bad at all.\n\nThank you to the Mark for a special weekend.

What a GEM. She is so knowledgeable about the City, and particularly the UES. She sent us to amazing restaurants and handled our last minute changes\/reservations needs with elegance and aplomb.  We have always stayed at the Carlyle, but with it basically being at 20% occupancy and no food\/beverage options, and with the Surrey being closed for renovation, we tried the Mark instead.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner available, and again a staff which is truly professional.  The Mark is where we shall return!","travelDate":"2021-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Everything was amazing -- services, amenities, room, lobby (I am obsessed with the art and furniture!) and the Jean Georges restaurant. I stayed a Friday and had a terrific room with a great view, comfortable bed, amazing bathroom (that tub!). Enjoyed the Jean Georges burger for lunch and fusilli for dinner -- perfection. Loved the outdoor dining too with the super comfy (and heated!) tents. Got a haircut at Frederic Fekkai, which was super glamorous. And took in the Upper East Side, Madison Ave and Central Park. I was afraid  it might be clinical given all the COVID restrictions, but the hotel has retained its friendly atmosphere and elegance. Staff all wear masks and take your temperature, but they're all personable and helpful.  Staying in a hotel during the pandemic is hit or miss, but The Mark hits the bull's eye.

Despite this, we were only allowed a $30\/person credit towards breakfast which doesn't even meet the hotel's own price of $44 for The \"Mark Breakfast\" (classic American breakfast comprising two eggs, OJ, Coffee and bacon). But try to order some veggies for your omelette and you're hit with ridiculous surcharges (same for ordering 2 thin slices of tomato and onion for a bagel), adding $6-8 per person to the bill. Just a terrible policy on top of an already over-priced breakfast menu.\n\n* Sheets: personally, I didn't like the sheets. I prefer, smoother, softer sheets. I know the hotel lists the sheets as \"fine Italian linens\" -- I don't doubt them, just not my preference.\n\n* Free bikes, clumsy, hard to ride, and they don't have adult sized bike helmets available.

I had booked a superior courtyard queen room for over $800 through Amex FHR. On the hotel website, there were several King courtyard rooms and suites available, so was a bit surprised at check-in that we didn't receive a complimentary upgrade through FHR (or any mention of it). I understand with COVID protocols, logistics around upgrades can be complicated, but the fact there was no mention was odd. The guest rooms themselves are quite small for the price paid, but the rooms were clean and comfortable with modern amenities. Room service breakfast was OK, and for well over $100 for two people, seemed mediocre (the pastry basket didn't taste fresh). We did get a $60 breakfast credit through FHR, but that doesn't even cover the continental breakfast package. Also on the dining front, we tried to get a table outside for lunch (we aren't comfortable inside due to COVID) and there were no tables. We ordered room service instead and the food was good. I think it's worth mentioning though that in situations like that, it would be nice if the large room service fees were waived during this time.

Whenever I go to NYC for overnight stays, I always choose The Mark.  For those who understand Manhattan and, specifically, the Upper East Side, The Mark provides an experience that closely mirrors that of owning your own, beautiful Carnegie Hill apartment, complete with full service staff and a glorious restaurant.  The rooms are striking, comfortable and thoughtfully designed to provide an environment that lends itself to privacy and self-sufficiency.  Also, they have, hands down, the nicest bathrooms in NY - best shower of my life.  In terms of the neighborhood, you're half a block from Central Park, around the corner from top tier retail on Madison and, if you'd like a taste of a refined, Upper East Side cocktail establishment that is both elegant and fun, the bar is an excellent contrast to its stuffy (and creaky) competitor, Bemelman's, across the street.  Another HUGE plus for The Mark is that they are extraordinarily dog friendly.  Most hotels that claim this have limitations on dog sizes exceeding 35 pounds (come on), but The Mark welcomes, literally, all dogs.  We have an 80 pound Lab and they could not have been more accommodating.  I met a fellow guest with three large dogs on hand.  Amazing.  Lastly, the staff, from the management down to the front of house and back of house personnel are all friendly, attentive and go out of their way to make sure you feel welcome, remembered (I've been several times and they make it clear they know that) and special.  If you want to experience a genuine, uptown Manhattan lifestyle (versus the tourist mirages in midtown and south), you cannot do better than The Mark.

We had stayed at The Mark several times before and, knowing they were pet friendly, called to secure a reservation. I initially spoke with Jennifer, the Director of Revenue, who was working exceedingly hard to accommodate the deluge of reservation requests. She expertly handled all aspects and we were soon checking in. Keep in mind, during this pandemic, most of the top-tier hotels in Manhattan are not even open! (St. Regis, Four Seasons among them). The front door staff were quick to greet us, assisting with not only the luggage but the dogs, as well. They could not have been more pleasant. Once we checked in, we did, however, experience some temperature-related issues with our room and before I could even contact Jennifer about this, she was calling me to see how our room was! Immediately upon hearing our concerns that our AC was not working properly, she quickly connected us with Olivia, a Sales Coordinator, who was simply amazing. She literally worked until 10pm finding us the perfect room, which was not easy considering how busy the hotel was, with so many others like us, affected by this storm that ravaged CT. She personally showed us several rooms and suites, giving her candid assessment on each one. She was simply amazing and in the hospitality business, you don't always get such a gem. Michael, the bellman, transferred our luggage to the new room and could not have been nicer.  Once we got settled in, we realized that not only did they find us the perfect room, but Olivia and Jennifer arranged for some wonderful desserts to be waiting for us, along with a nice note from the GM, Manuel Martinez.

I told the clerk at checkout that the bill was wrong.  I asked that the changes be refunded on my card and I asked for an email with the correct charges.  I was assured that the reservations manager would take care of that, and we left.\n\nWe later received an email from the reservations manager stating that we had booked a different promotion (20% off instead of the fourth night free - which was a worse deal for us), and that the bill already reflected a discount, although none was shown on the bill.  The charges matched the full price we had seen advertised at the time we booked our stay.  In short, the hotel gave us no discount, but claimed that they had, by appearing to play a game of \"gotcha\" instead of providing us with the best available discount.  I complained and have expressed my dissatisfaction to the reservations manager, but have had no response.  \n\nCharacter is revealed when times are tough.  I am left with the impression that the Mark is trying to recoup lost revenue at the expense of guests like me.  I'd expect better from any hotel, let alone one that charges premium prices and claims to provide a first class experience.  The Mark failed us on all fronts, and worse than that, disrespectfully.  We'll never stay there again.","travelDate":"2020-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The location canNOT be beat. Surrounded by some of the best NYC restaurants, shops and close to wonderful art museums, etc., the size of the hotel, though not small, is more intimate than many of the city's other top tier hotels. From Doormen, to Check-in, to Concierge to the FABULOUS Frederik Fekkai salon, the John Lobb shoe shine operation, the contemporary but very comfy and cool rooms, the hotel feels like some private club that only a select few have the pleasure to belong to. But of course it isn't a club. It is open to all. Just its size allows the staff to treat every guest like a returning friend.  The Mark Bar, which is cool and sexy somehow,  and all of the above makes so one really never leave the hotel, or walk beyond a 4 block area, to have a perfect stay. I should know. I just checked out 2 days ago. I am also a client of The Lowell Hotel,The Park Hyatt (if you don't know, do not assume this is like any other Hyatt you have ever seen), The Four Seasons, etc.,etc. and The Mark has become my NYC home away from home.I feel happiest and most cared for there.

The rooms which already are furnished with high quality finishes are maintained to an exacting standard....carpeting, bedding, casegoods, and bathroom fixtures are all meticulously cleaned and cared for.  Also of note there seems to always be ample closet space in the different room levels, which even for a short stay can be useful.  Some rooms are small...but its Manhattan so that is to be expected.  If needed, upgrading to the larger size rooms does make a difference. If staying for a few nights might be worth it.  The location is the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

While back home for the holidays, we decided to switch things up a little and stay at The Mark (until then we were die-hard St Regis fans). We were so happy we did. We were immediately impressed by the professional, but low-key service we received and the luxuriously appointed, modern suite to which we were shown, which had a full kitchen - an absolute perfect perk for us since our friends and family all wanted to stop by and see us and we were looking to have a more \"homey\" feel rather than a typical hotel room. The UES location is perfect for coming home to a quiet neighborhood - not overrun with tourists - which has access to everything your heart desires (shopping at all price ranges, good food, the Park, museums, etc.). \n\nWhen we had to be back in town three months later, there was no debate - we would stay at The Mark.  The level of service and the room were both just as we experienced the first time - impeccable.  \n\nWe're heading back to NY in a couple of days and are delighted to check back into our new home away from home!","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is regrettably one of those hotels that considers itself \"too cool for school\" and therefore over-promises and under-delivers.  I guess one might say their service is far off the mark !\n\nI've no idea where to start with the litany of hospitality schoolboy errors....\n\nPerhaps I should start with telling you how booking two identical rooms (not the cheapest ones in the house, I might add), leads you to receive one decent sized room and one dark and dingy cupboard. No excuse !\n\nOr perhaps I should tell you about the nickel and diming management and how, for example, free internet is a paltry 3Mb, and you have to pay stupid prices for anything higher.  At the rates charged, this is inexcusable, high speed internet should be free for all guests.\n\nOr maybe I should tell you how ordering poached eggs at the extortionate rate of almost $30 per person gives everyone overcooked eggs.  I mean come on.  At $30 a person the chef should be producing perfect poached eggs.\n\nOr maybe its just best summarised that all the staff I encountered at this hotel are either grossly under-trained, completely disinterested in what working in the hospitality industry means \u2026.or, more likely, both.  They prance around trying to look all pretty and cool, but simple service things just don't get done.  Bar staff leave the bar area unattended, customers waiting. Waiters are inattentive, you have to prompt them to bring you the menu,  dirty dishes don't get cleared from the table once everyone has finished eating. You have repeat a question to reception staff three or four times before the lightbulb clicks and they figure out what you're asking for (\u201ccould I have a map ?\u201d \u2026 \u201csorry can I help you ? \u201c \u2026 \u201ccould I have a map, please ?\u201d  \u2026. \u201csorry, can I help you ?\u201d \u2026. its was an experience strait out of an episode of Fawlty Towers  !).\n\nOr the fact the staff seem to spend an awful lot of time chatting and joking with each other.\n\nSingularly unimpressed would be my summary of The Mark.

I would definitely recommend the Mark.  My 17 year old son and I stayed in a junior suite with a courtyard view for the week after Christmas. The suite had a decent sized sitting area with a pull out bed for my son and a king bed in a separate room for me. Most importantly it had two bathrooms, providing an appropriate amount of family togetherness. The rooms are well-appointed and have nicely thought out amenities like a towel warmer and a heated floor in the bathroom. Other nice touches are a premium hair dryer, trash receptacles placed in the bathrooms and in each room, slippers placed at the foot of the bed at turndown service, and current popular magazines scattered on tables. I\u2019ve found the small touches like this matter greatly in your perception of the hotel. Also the bar area, in the morning, is converted to coffee shop area that sells pastries, yogurt and decent coffee. The hotel is smaller which gives it a low key charm. The staff are friendly, without being officious. The location is excellent. I did eat a meal at their restaurant and found it to be tasty, with good service. Overall the Mark is a gem of a hotel with a great location, a place with 5 star amenities without the frequent 5 star attitude of some luxury hotels.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

If one is into star gazing, one will always see on walking in or out.  On my last visit, rubbed shoulders with Sir Paul.  The service and food at the hotel are outstanding.  Two drawbacks:  1.  If one is on the street side, be prepared to hear rubbish pickup at 10:30 PM.  This is easily rectified by requesting a room on the other side or stay very late.  2.  The bathrobes could be of higher quality.  This could be rectified if the property purchasing from Boca Terry.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was surprised, but thought maybe my husband got the midnight munchies.  He was getting a car, so I settled, then asked him....he said \"no, just some peanut m&ms last night\".  So I called back to the hotel, and was told that she'd look into it, but it might take a while...  I wasn't ok with that, so I emailed the hotel to follow-up.  Eventually I received an itemized bill.  The m&ms weren't on it, but 3 other things were - that we did not have.  After a lot of back and forth, I was told \"After further investigation it has been confirmed that these items were consumed in the room. However, as a curtesy, we will adjust the amount off of the bill and send you an updated receipt.\"  - -  We were livid!  I responded of course, and suggested that they further investigate before they insinuate that their customers are lying thief's.  I received no response but did receive a credit.  This employee turned a 5-star rating into a 2-star rating by her lack of basic service skills.  \n\nRegarding the rest of our stay:\nUpon arrival and throughout our stay the front desk (with the exception of above) & concierge were fantastic!\n- we arrived early, so upon our room being ready they phoned us. \n- supplied a kettle upon request for coffee\/tea\n\nThe room was nicely appointed, and very comfortable. \n A few minor issues:\n- mini bar fridge was not turned on when we arrived, so everything in it was warm.  We expressed our concern to the butler, but he wasn't too interested in finding a solution.    We turned it on, and after 4 hours it started cooling down.\n\n- The shower pressure is great, however, it's like someone is pouring a bucket of water on your head, not pleasing at all.  Suggestion:  change the shower heads.\n\n- We had a room overlooking Madison Ave, which was nice until the garbage trucks rolled in early - before 6am. I woke to bottles being dumped. \n\nMy husband and I were planning to bring our 3 kids back to NYC in the Spring, and return to the hotel.  However, after the experience with the one girl at the front desk, we will not return - too many other 5-star hotels in NYC with excellent service to choose from.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It went through a major reno about a decade ago and was a little fresher then.My room was very quiet and very comfortable.I was happy with everything except the breakfasts.\n\n I ate breakfast there both mornings and must say the breakfast was mediocre at best. The first morning I ordered the spinach and gruyere omelette. It was very greasy rendering the omelette inedible (meaning 2-3 Tablespoons of oil was on my plate). The second morning I ordered the Mark breakfast a typical eggs\/ bacon\/ potatoes breakfast w a beverage and orange juice (about $44.00). The scrambled eggs had the taste and consistency of eggs you would find in a sterno pot. The bacon was room temperature and very hard. It tasted like both of these items were cooked hours ago. The breakfast potatoes had been cooked in a deep fat fryer. One of my friend's had a fruit and granola bowl and she said it was very good.

My review would have been 5 stars if not for a terrible interaction with sales directors the week prior to my stay. I had found some descrepancies in my reservation and phoned sales to review it, the sales director said that they could not help me therefore I asked to speak with the superior. Upon speaking with the superior, the other party had not advised them of the conversation prior and the purpose of my call. Therefore there was a lot of confusion during that conversation and I was told that they usually do not like guests like me staying at the hotel. To be spoken in that manner is unacceptable.

I have had countless stays in good and truly great hotels, but only once in a while you find exceptional gems like The Mark.\n\nFrom reservation to departure (and everything in between) this hotel has completely amazed me. This hotel gets everything right: each detail has been thought through.\n\nAthough the hotel is extremely stylish and would cater for even the most demanding business traveller, it is also very family-friendly - but in the most elegant and unique way. \n\nThe examples to subscribe this are countless, I will just highlight a few that really impressed. \n\nWhen the bellman helped us offloading our luggage from our car at arrival: when he asked for my last name on top of his head he was able to match it with my first name. For the record: I am not famous so he must have memorized all arrivals for that day (The Mark is boutique but still 15 stories high so I reckon a bit of an effort to do).\n\nWe immediately concluded that our suite was superb for us as parents: e.g. welcome champagne, fresh fruits, fresh white roses in each room, ladur\u00e9e macarons, fantastic beds and for gadget freaks like me: a single panel to control all devices in the room from TV, aircon, shades etc. \n\nThe kids were jumping with joy as well. Was it the The Mark hot dog cart (very tasty!), the The Mark pedi cab, the The Mark branded bikes, a The Mark branded tent to play in their room, books with bed-time stories about New York, or just the special attention they received from the staff? Probably all of the above. The Mark is clearly also a \u201cplayful\u201d hotel. The kids felt so at home that they made drawings for some of the bell staff when we left. And we only stayed 3 nights...\n\nDefinitely in my top 3 of best hotels I ever stayed in, and for family travel: the very best by far.

The lobby is gorgeous. Just gorgeous. The hotel and rooms are finished and upheld to a very high standard.\n\nThe bathroom. Possibly the most opulent yet modern bathroom ever. If you like marble they\u2019ve got you.\n\nThe location. Upper East Side perfection. A block from Central Park and a block from the shopping on Madison. They also loan out The Mark bikes and have pedal bikes to get you to Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s. Appreciated.\n\nThe details. The Mark is trying to build a brand and it works. Love the monogrammed everything and the consistency of a statement floor. \n\nAs for the areas of improvement...\n\nThe Room. Beautifully built and finished with, as I mentioned, gorgeous bathrooms but the furniture was not to the same standard. Thin curtains, flimsy chairs. The bed was just ok vs other 5star rooms and the toiletries were not great. However the room did smell gorgeous - I didn\u2019t have to light a scented candle once. \n\nRestaurant and Bar. The design of these areas was such a let down. Didn\u2019t maintain the opulence of the rest of the hotel. Everything I had for breakfast\/ lunch\/ drinks was fine just not memorable.\n\nI haven\u2019t mentioned service as it\u2019s neither a love or hate, just good. I stayed here after reading a review comparing it to Claridges - well..... Claridges this IS NOT (best hotel in the world) but it\u2019s definitely a beautiful gem on the Upper East Side.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

The Service and food historically have been excellent and I have always been treated very well with all my requests being met with a smile (which is why I keep returning to this lovely place).\n\nThis time around however they were off to a slow start. While check-inn is usually 3pm, historically the front desk has been very forthcoming and I had no issues getting my room well ahead of that time. This time unfortunately I had to wait to almost 4pm before the room was ready - which after a long journey is sub optimal. \n\nOnce checked into the room I wanted to grab a snack from the minibar, only to discover that half the items in the minibar were off by weeks if not months. Additionally, my luggage was not delivered until I called and asked for it. When leaving the hotel later that night, none of the guys at the doors bothered to ask if we wanted a taxi and only after I walked to the corner to get one one helped us out.\n\nTo their defense I received a room upgrade, free minibar items and generally great service thereafter including a late check-out on the day I was leaving.\n\nI still love this property and shall be returning but hope these issues in the beginning will not be repeated.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were in a Junior Courtyard Suite, which has a sofa bed in the living room and two full bathrooms.  The room was great - very quite and the layout was exactly what we were looking for.\n\nThe location is good - just a block from Central Park, two blocks from the Met, and a 20 minute walk through Central Park to the Natural History Museum.\n\nHowever the service was really hit or miss.  I'd say 30% hit and 70% miss.  At check-in the agent gave us that look and tone that suggested we just weren't worthy of her time.  No confirmation of the room type, etc., and when I asked I got this huge sigh.  \n\nSame experience at breakfast: The hostess looked at us like she's rather have us arrested than seated, and then gave us a table that was practically in the kitchen, even though there were only about 8 tables occupied in the entire restaurant.  Wait staff just dropped items off on the table without confirming what they were or who was to get them.  And check your bill carefully; they overcharged us, and then, when I called out the mistake, tried to claim that the price on all the menus was wrong.  We were there for four days and the price on the menu remained \"wrong\" the entire time.  I'd bet it's still \"wrong.\"\n\nThe same was true of room service - they just drop the tray and hand you the bill.  And you really need to confirm what they've brought, as it was wrong about 50% of the time).\n\nAnd their phone system doesn't work reliably.  One morning I called for 15 minutes straight to get through to room service or the operator to no avail (the \"zoomie zoom\" hold music will send you over the edge). When I walked down to the front desk to ask about what was going on, the four of them (only one of them doing anything) treated me like I was this huge imposition, telling me they were sure there was nothing wrong with the phones, and patronizing the insane guest that someone from room service would call right away.  So I go back up to the room, but there is no call, and I have to go back down with the menu to order the food, which they then get wrong.\n\nAfter all that, I did get a call from the front desk explaining that I had been right and their IP phone system had been malfunctioning and had to be reset. And to their credit, they did comp the breakfast - a nice gesture, but the package we had \"included\" breakfast.  I use quotes around \"included\" because what they really do is give you a $30 credit per person for breakfast, but this is New York, the cheapest breakfast on the menu (the continental breakfast) is $40 per person.\n\nThere were some bright spots.  Helen, at the concierge desk, was wonderful - so helpful and friendly, and we had a nice guy take us to Bergdorf's in the pedi-cab.\n\nBut overall, the service was a significant disappointment.  New York is filled with great hotels that really understand top-notch service. The Mark could learn a lot from them.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Additionally, my general experiences with hotels in New York have not been memorable, and I often tell myself that the folks who rave about the luxury hotels of New York do so as they haven't experienced luxury hotels in Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong or even India.\n\nMy conclusion was wholly dispelled upon my first visit to the Mark.\n\nFrom the moment of arrival, my expectations were surpassed. The bell boys were smart sharp and attentive. The check-in experience was swift and enjoyable. The rooms were huge by New York standards. The decor is modern and the \"right\" kind of luxury, to my mind - attention to detail and to what the customer would experience.  As we had booked using the Amex concierge, we received USEFUL free benefits such as a credit towards F&B at the hotel.\n\nThe room was very comfortable. The bathroom was luxurious, however a tad smaller than expected. All typical amenities were provided, especially an adequate number of water bottles. While our flight out was during the early afternoon, I asked for a late checkout and decided to check how late they could go, given that I was a first-time visitor - without disclosing the specific time, I would say that I was surprised at their leniency.\n\nThe minibar selection has to be seen to be believed, its stocked like a corner store.\n\nThe staff were ultra-nice and seemed to have great memories as many of them knew my name within a day of my arrival.\n\nWhile the location is not precisely on Central Park, it's close enough, and I would say that it's well located.\n\nThe Jean Georges back restaurant serves a scrumptious breakfast, and my favourite feature about it is the natural light and tables that are not packed like sardines in a can.\n\nI would definitely like like to stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Beautiful location; lovely, lush design in the lobby and the rooms. All manner of upscale extras. Both the beds and the tubs are my new favorites of any NY hotel, including the St. Regis, which previously held the title for me. \n\nHowever, when it comes to five star boutique hotels in specific... The Mark falls behind with a pretty serious service deficit.\n\nI stayed five days, four nights. Full freight. The man who checked me in was friendly and thorough, but after that the service was consistently hassled or nonexistent until the second I was walking out for the last time. Only then did one of the six employees in the lobby acknowledge my existence. \n\nNot once before that moment - Not once! In five days! - was I greeted entering or leaving the hotel. The doormen were always either talking amongst themselves or other staff or otherwise engaged. Concierge never made eye contact. Reception ignored me. \n\nTried to get room service for dessert on a weeknight at about 8:30 pm; both of the things I tried to order (a piece of cake, a piece of pie) were out. This turn of events was met with a shrug. Ordered breakfast to my room on my departure day and it arrived with a broken coffee pot and half the order missing. Same response. \n\nAnd both times, on the phone, I was interrupted, mid-order, by an annoyed voice.\n\nME: Hi, I\u2019d like to place an order for break\u2014\nVOICE (annoyed, loud): How many guests?\nME: 2.\nVOICE (annoyed, distracted, rather DMV-like): Ok, go ahead. \n\nService in the bar was chilly, perfunctory. It was busy on a Monday night, so I sat on the edge of a couch occupied by another couple. Placed my order. Then another couch three feet away opened up, so I moved. When the waitress returned to see I\u2019d moved *three feet away* she literally rolled her eyes. I actually laughed in surprise at that particular cherry on top of the overall ice cold service at this hotel. \n\nAfter years in NY I had to move away for work, and have long considered the ONLY benefit of leaving my home here was that I could indulge the city\u2019s great hotels every time I come back (four\/five times a year). I\u2019d somehow never tried the Mark up to this point, but after seeing some particularly great reviews and rankings, I was excited to try it. \n\nWhat a disappointment. There are obviously other things in the world to worry about, but when I\u2019m dropping over $500 a night on a hotel experience, I\u2019m looking for just that \u2014 an experience. Not just posh furnishings, but warm, attentive people; smart attention to details; an overall sense of being welcome and feeling taken care of. There are hotels in this town that make it an actual art form. The Mark doesn\u2019t. \n\n","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I personally travel for a living and stay in 30 properties a year, around the globe \/ all 4-5 star properties for at least 3-5 days at a time, so I am aware of comparisons to other properties and services. I do not write this in hopes of deterring anyone from this property - it is lovely. \n\nFirstly, it's a wonderful location and that cannot be argued.  It's beautiful, it's quiet and comfortable; however, what makes a 5-star hotel a 5 star hotel, is always the staff.  With the exception of one specific doorman \/ porter, The staff at this hotel were less than friendly, and not very welcoming or helpful. Never did I receive a hello as we walked in, welcome back, or anything for that matter, as we passed the front desk or concierge. For a 5 star boutique hotel, the staff should be familiar with you. When you are spending this type of money, you are spending for an \"experience\" and you should feel more welcomed.  I hate to say this, however if we were more stylish, I think we'd be a bit more tended to. \n\nThe room was very nice. We stayed in a 77 Jr. Suite. It was nice, the bed was comfortable and the shower \/ bath was truly the highlight of the room. Simply amazing showers in the main and guest. I didn't want to get out, ever. \n\nThe room service was quite good, expensive, but good. Get the ice cream. \n\nThe maid service was very good, they do a very good job of cleaning and keeping the room in order so you can enjoy your stay. \n\nThe location at Central Park and the MET, was absolutely perfect.  Couldn't be better. \n\nRegardless of the under trained staff, this is a nice property, it just needs a more well rounded and accommodating staff.  They were quite average unfortunately and that's why I can only give it 3 stars, as this is so important to the overall experience.  \n\nI'd recommend this hotel, if you are in the city for a couple of days and want to be near the park.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Not worth the money","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-05-13","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"I have stayed at the Mark for the last 8 years. I come about 3-4x per year for a week at a time. Over the past 2 years I have been increasingly disappointed each time. I come back only due to the location. I have held off from writing a review as I keep thinking maybe this was a one off, let me give it another chance. Last time the service was so bad I met with the general manager and spoke to him about it. However, each time the Mark continues to disappoint. We have many friends who have the same issue and have decided to stay elsewhere. There is huge turnover in staff. Each time we come there are different people. The only consistency is the concierge team and they are great. The rooms are average - tired\u2014but I am ok with that- although I spend an average of $1200\/ night. However, the service is increasingly poor.  On Sunday my husband and I went down to have breakfast in the breakfast room  ( which is included with our room since we booked through Amex centurion fine hotels and resorts)- we were told by the manager they don\u2019t accept walk ins! I didn\u2019t realize that being a hotel guest paying $1200\/ night we would be considered walk ins. We were told we should have made a reservation as it was mother\u2019s day. We spoke to the hotel guest relations Minela and she was not able to help us get a table. We informed her\/ front desk that we should have been informed by email or in person at check in if we needed to make a reservation for breakfast. That would have been the very simple thing to do to inform hotel guests that they would need to make breakfast reservations because otherwise they could not be accommodated. Or better they should block tables for hotel guests. Not accommodating your hotel guests for breakfast is probably not something a hotel such as the Mark should do. We stay at Aman resorts, Cheval Blanc, mandarin oriental, four seasons throughout the world and we have never experienced a hotel that does not accommodate its own guests for breakfast.\n\nWe stay at the Mark because we prefer being on the upper east side and we prefer a boutique hotel feel. However, after all these years and the many chances we have given it\u2014there are always consistent service issues\u2014 We will be looking at other options such as the Carlyle and the Surrey.  I suggest you do the same if you are a discerning traveler and don\u2019t want to be disappointed.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They have high staff turnover, exceptionally poor service, they don\u2019t feel the need to be accountable and do the minimal work. Example: we checked into the hotel Friday night. Sunday morning we go down for breakfast and they tell us that even though breakfast is included in our US$1,200 room rate, they cannot accommodate us for breakfast because the restaurant is full for Mother\u2019s Day! Nobody bothered to inform us at any point during our stay that we need to book in advance for breakfast (which frankly we shouldn\u2019t need to do given the amount we are paying per night), nor do they block tables for any of their hotel guests (nor do they inform us we need to book a table, even though we were there for breakfast on Saturday), the restaurant manager makes zero effort to accommodate or find a cancellation (and says, \u201c no walk-ins accepted!\u201d), the front office manager is completely apathetic and defers to the guest relations manager who says \u201cI  understand you are frustrated\u201d and proceeds to do...nothing! \n\nExample 2, I order an espresso to the room, the bill says $7.00 for the coffee and $7.50 \u201cdelivery charge\u201d plus tax and service!  I have never seen a 5 star hotel charge for delivering an espresso to the room - and the delivery charge is more than the espresso charge!  \n\nThe staff at the front desk is poorly trained, they obviously have an outdated software system that doesn\u2019t recognize repeat guest or regulars.

Never before has a person from the front desk taken the time and offered to show us to our room! She is very gracious and a great asset to the hotel!              We had dinner in the hotel restaurant-delicious food -attentive service! Our room ( a king on the third floor) was beautifully decorated and had gorgeous marble bath and every amenity one could need!\nRoom service was so quick and efficient and housekeeping did an awesome job of keeping everything spotless and a terrific turn down service!\nThe bell captain and car valets were so friendly and helpful!\nWe loved this hotel and hope to return again soon!","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Beautiful hotel, amazing location... and then my wife got sick. \nWe decided to continue into the city as it was too late to cancel but I called the hotel asking for a room with a second bed or a cot. I was informed a cot would be an extra $50 plus tax or I could \"upgrade to a room with two smaller beds\". I had originally booked the Madison room- This room seems exactly the same but with two beds so I am not sure why it was an upgrade. I requested a courtesy of the hotel to waive the $75 upgrade fee plus tax but to no avail. They were polite but firm. Policy was Policy.\n\nThe room is nice, clean, dimly lit and overall fine. We had a few issues with the room that were not related to any of the previously mentioned. \n\n1. The room was FREEZING. The windows had cold air pouring in. Not leaking but POURING. Clearly there was no insulation or weather guarding on that windows so the second the heat went off the room was cold.  I had to turn the heat to 76 just to get it to warm up as the thermostat was on the other side of the room. This led to super warm moments followed by cold etc. \n\n2. Pigeons. We were on the 4th floor right above the entrace of the hotel. I heard pigeons the entire day and night. The window and window sill were covered in pigeon poop. Not exactly the view you want from a fancy hotel. \n\n3. House Car- This one is not something that is their fault perse, just something I noticed. We parked out car and did not want to move it. The hotel says they have a house car. We asked for it 3 different times. In advance and at the moment. Each time it was unavailable. Maybe I was not an important enough guest? I dont know. Would have been nice for them to take me a couple of blocks. \n\nThe inside of the hotel really was beautiful. Bathrooms were nice but functions need to be updated. Towel warms didnt work and you can tell toilets were old and slightly discolored. \n\nShoutout to the woman whose name I cant recall but worked the inside of the front door lobby. She was the only person friendly to us and not only opened the door for us in the lobby but also came to the rescue when our key didnt work. This woman did it all!\n\nIn summary: from my experience and their pettiness about charging me extra, I would go elsewhere. Beautiful hotel but my experience was simply severly lacking.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was crowded and we asked to be seated in the restaurant. The coat check girl was rude and condescending. She would  not seat us. We found room on a crowded banquet. The waiter ignored us. I finally wen to the bar and was rudely informed the bar had closed. However, i saw a table being served shots. My sister and i decided to have a drink in our room. Our room was a super king facing the courtyard which is very quiet. The bed, pillows and duvet was extremely comfortable. I was disappointed in the bathrobes as I was hoping for something more plush. The robes were stiff terry cloth. The next day, I approached the concierge to help book a table for breakfast and lunch. The concierge was very helpful. We stayed 2 nights. It is a lovely hotel in a great location. Madison avenue is perfect for window shopping and close to the park.  Despite some of the staff were rude, our stay was enjoyable.

It has been revamped in years past, and I think it has a very welcoming though minimalist vibe.  Black and white checkered floors, subdued lightning, comfy lobby sofas.  Nouveau French, bien sur!\n  What I particularly like about the hotel is the buzzy bar scene.  No, it will not be inexpensive, but you can linger on the animal skin ottomans  and enjoy the stellar people watching.  If you are so inclined, you can head over to the Jean Georges restaurant, steps away, under the same roof and have dinner.  Again, expensive.  Not bad, when we were there, but not great.  Service was not up to par for such a place.\n   Lastly, if your hair needs a whoosh to head out into the New York scene, Freddrick\nFekkai has a beautiful salon upstairs.  Of course, that coiffure will cost, but, hey, it is the Upper  East Side and the land of the beautiful physically enhanced crowd.

During our second stay, we brought along our 2 Scottish terriers, for The Mark is famous by its incredibly friendly pet policy. Not only every possible comfort component was accorded to our four-legged companions, such as plushy soft dog beds by Molly Mutt, designer water bowls and placemats, but even the room service menu included pet gourmet dishes, prepared by the world famous Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.\nThe Mark restaurant offers a terrific breakfast, priced quite moderately. The John Loen shoe shine service is complimentary. \nWe were upgraded to a corner suite, even without asking. The Reservation Agent ANASTASIA BELOUSKO provided an exemplary service, a true epitome of 'above and beyond'.  \nAll-in-all, a unique experience.

The hot dog cart on the sidewalk at the entrance, surrounded by hotel staff, was the first weird note. The bar, a wavy aluminum monstrosity with just six seats, had one open where I faced a huge display of bananas, of all things (they go great with wine and liquor, right?), which forced me to put my glass of wine off to the side, where there was about 8 inches of space. The wine was refreshing -- at $20, it should have been. The restroom? Up a steep flight of stairs nearby, with a gentlemen standing outside holding a stack of hand towels. Why outside? Well, the men's room was too small for him to stay inside. And both of the two stalls had locks that needed keys. I decided not to ask the guy outside for the key, which no doubt was attached to a huge wooden block to avert theft. Having a drink at a hotel's bar is just one of the ways I assess whether or not I'd stay at a hotel, or recommend it to friends. Based on this visit, I think the hotel's attitude toward guests fits the Urban Dictionary definition of \"A Mark\": \"A person identified as an easy target, or \"sucker\". A mark is always the short end of a joke or scam, and is never let in on whats going on. A mark is usually being cheated out of money.\" You can be sure I'm not going back.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

The bell staff greeting was friendly and welcoming. \nOur room was not ready at 4PM and we were offered a drink at the lobby bar, which is hosted by a bartender right out of a Noel Coward play, who entertained us while we waited. \nThe place is packed with folks who appear to be on an expense account, with their entourage in tow, trickling in for dinner and drinks. The restaurant is beautiful, and the menu is well thought out. Aesthetic of the public rooms and the guest room is tightly planned, but deco chic, with caramel colored overstuffed mohair seating and gleaming nickel lighting throughout the reception area. \nThe hotel room had a gorgeous marble bathroom, with deco cabinetry and nickel finishes. The hotel and room was designed to convey whimsy, high style and comfort. \nThe one complaint about the check-in was the unmonitored wait - we went back to the front desk after an hour plus at the bar to see if the room was ready. The front desk should have retrieved us when the room was ready instead of leaving us in the bar to fend for ourselves. That said, when we were finally taken to our room, we were moved almost immediately when I showed concern of potential noise from Madison Ave. The room faced an interior courtyard, and was small, but it was serene, which fit the bill. Technology was well planned in the room as was the mini bar and closets. I would guess the hotel gets a great many business guests and would recommend it to my traveling professional friends who aren't tethered to a budget.\nThe only misstep was room service dinner, handed over to the Morton's Salt rep, and darned near inedible (and I'm a gal that likes my salt). However, brunch in the restaurant for us and friends the following day, albeit expensive, was very tasty (try the avocado toast). I've eaten dinner at the restaurant with friends before, and it's an entertaining scene with great food, so maybe the room service\/kitchen was just off their game one night.\nBreakfast through room service delivered perfectly poached eggs, and a perk for me: real coffee mugs instead of those tiny little tea cups that don't hold any coffee.\nThe exercise room is adequately equipped, and immaculate. Housekeeping is well managed because the room was spotless, as was the exercise area and public spaces.\nOverall, management gets the joke here, and there's a \"ricksaw\" to Bergdorf's as well as a hotdog cart outside for the welcome pooches. I'd go back to this hotel, given it's competition in the neighborhood, but would opt into an upgraded room with FH&R or Virtuoso, and get the accompanying perks.

The only comparison that comes to mind is Claridge's in London. \nTo be honest and unbiased, first, after walking in our room (Madison Suite on the 12th floor), we felt a bit disappointed. Is that the famous Mark Hotel? Nothing special from the first glance, some other of thirty-plus hotels in Manhattan we stayed at, even those rated at 4-stars, offered more opulent room decor and more impressive room layout. The first impression has completely disappeared after a few moments, when one gets to realize that a hotel stay is all about comfort and convenience, which is a key to a great hospitality, not the amount of mahogany and gild or a size of a TV screen. \nAnd The Mark delivers on its promises. As a matter of fact, our positive experience started 3 weeks or so prior to our physical arrival, when our request to be lodged on a higher floor wasn't met with a customary 'per availability' brushoff. Anastasia B., the reservation agent, went above and beyond to assure our request was fulfilled. And then, the little things, that always have been a part of a stay in a reputable hotel but gradually disappeared - like being shown to your room by the hotel staff, complimentary overnight shoeshine by John Lobb The Bootmaker, turn-down service, welcoming fruits and chocolates and mineral water, everything had one master-plan behind it - attention paid to guest's comfort and satisfaction. \nNow a few practical advises. The Madison Suite, i.e. rooms facing Madison Ave as opposed to either 77th St or even courtyard - the view is not worth extra money. The huge apartment building on the north-eastern corner of 77th and Madison takes up the entire window. \nThe location is otherwise more than envious. The Central Park is right behind the corner. The calm and relaxing solitude of the Upper East Side is a welcomed contrast to the hustle and bustle of the Midtown. \nA few little things that need attention - the electrical outlets\/USB ports are available only on one night table, the other one needs a longer than usual cord to reach to the outlets in the opposite wall. In our day and age of smartphones with rapidly dying batteries that is an inconvenience. \nThe Juice Bar in the lobby is great, highly recommended. Jean Georges' The Mark doesn't need any recommendations; refer to our dedicated review of the restaurant. \nThe minibar choices, both liquids and solids, are more than numerous. The soundproof quality of the room - thanks to a long hallway leading from the door to the room - is excellent. The bedding is chic and the sleep quality is great. The number of elevators and thus waiting times are average. \nThere are bicycle-driven Bergdorf-Goodman cabs available for all your shopping needs, right at the hotel's entrance.  \nOne thing we would like to emphasize is the amazing pet-friendly policy of the hotel. Not Surrey neither Plaza Athenee - The Mark's two closest competitors - even come close to the comfort and welcome pets get at The Mark. We were so impressed with it, that we are planning to book another stay at The Mark specifically to bring two of our dogs to spend a weekend in the Central Park.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We travel to New York very frequently and had become a bit disenchanted with our previous \"go-to,\" hotel and wanted to remain uptown so decided to try The Mark.\n\nFirst the basics:  the rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean and functional.  The bathrooms are gorgeous and quite large especially for New York.  The mini-bar is well stocked and beautiful  (sub-zero drawers filled with whatever you could want plus an empty drawer for things you may want to grab on your own).\n\nThere is a Fekkai Salon in the hotel.  It is phenomenal.  I had two services here and everyone was excellent.  \n\nThe Jean-Georges restaurant is one of my favorites in the city.\n\nThe scene is sophisticated.  This isn't a super \"touristy,\" place which is a plus for me.\n\nNow, in my opinion, it's not that hard to get the rooms, bathrooms and dining right.  I found out my mother had passed while staying here.  There are not words to explain the compassion and attention the staff gave my family during this time.  I had my young kids with me and was managing the immediate demands of a sudden death and the hotel, without even being asked, sent food up to the room every hour to make sure they were fed.  They sent a concierge to the store with a list of ingredients to make slime to bring back to my kids.  They literally carried me to a front office after I was delivered the news.  \n\nThis is something that only happens at a hotel where the people are kind.  Staff members who were off duty approached me on the street to express their condolences.\n\nThis hotel has earned my life long loyalty and if you are wavering between this and the other Upper East side hotels, I can tell you, having stayed at them all, this is really your hands down best option.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

De lobby is buitengewoon mooi met een hele elegante zwart witte marmer vloer die meteen de toon aangeeft voor de gezellige ervaring die je in dit hotel meemaakt. Toen ik aankwam was de check in super efficient geregeld zonder dat ik 5 minuten papieren zat in te vullen en gelijktijdig heb ik ook nog meteen wat leuke lokale tips voor brooklyn gekregen van het team aan de front desk. Mijn wens was altijd om bij Eleven Madison Park te eten, maar als we allemaal wel weten is het vrijwel onmogelijk om daar een tafel te krijgen. De concierge had binnen 10 minuten een tafel kunnen regelen door hun ongelooflijk netwerk waarover zij in NYC beschikken. Door hun is het mij ook gelukt om bij Jean-Georges te eten wat echt een bijzonder belevenis was, de service team van het restaurant behoort echt tot de top 5 van de wereld als je het mij vraagt (en ik ben al bij best wat 3* geweest). \n\nDaarnaast heb ik ook gebruik gemaakt van de Frederic Fekkai Haar salon. Dat was ook een super fijne ervaring, ik zag er bijna zo goed uit als harvey specter toen ik weg liep ;) \n\nIk was door mijn bedrijf hier ingeboekt dus kon ik van de \"premier studio\" genieten. Je merkt gewoon dat er over alles mogelijk was nagedacht en voor de prijsklasse kan ik mij slecht voorstellen hoe dit te overtreffen is. Ik ga niet eens over de douche beginnen, ik zou daar uren onder kunnen staan. \n\nIk kan echt alleen maar complimenten geven aan dit hotel, elk detail van je ervaring is iets dat je voor de rest van je leven meeneemt. Ik weet verder niet hoe ik dit hoog genoeg kan aanschrijven, maar als hotelier is dit de eerste keer dat een hotel zo bijzonder was dat ik een account moest aanmaken om een review te schrijven. Dankjewel voor deze bijzondere ervaring!!","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Once you fight your way into the dining room, service was indifferent and very slow.  The busboy seemed to be challenged by the difference between still and sparkling water.  The poorly trained waiter was unable to put bread on the table because \"that's not how we do it.\"  Then he  managed to confuse my medium rare steak with the medium one that my friend ordered. The beef was tough.  Another friend's lamb chops were cooked to a cinder. There was a glacial quality to the meal.  And all of this did not come cheaply.

Great hotels are very detail oriented.\n\nI've stayed at the Mark in the past and found it to be a well run operation at that time.\n\nWe arrived around 9 pm, and the hotel very nicely left out a tray of fruit in the room. Unfortunately it must have spent the day sitting out and the fruits were getting a bid brown. Well intentioned but a lack of detail.\n\nI booked this hotel as it was close to where my son was to give his Doctoral dissertation on Friday. We obviously didn't want to be late. I got up in the morning and ordered a bowl of cheerios from room service. I also asked that someone bring the individual serving cups for the coffee maker. It took a total of 4 calls and an hour to get the coffee. I had to call the manager to get them.  The bowl of cereal took 2 calls and an hour. I never received the the sugar that I called down for to put in the coffee. I was told that the room had the coffee and sugar but I'm afraid it didn't. \n\nThis all may seem minor but my wife is a coffee addict and has trouble getting up without the coffee and something (cereal) to buffer it in her stomach. The added stress before the days events were a huge negative. \n\nI will say that the staff was otherwise polite and helpful. The manager was very sweet and she truly seemed to care about the issues. When we left something in the room after checkout, they were nice enough to go and retrieve it for us. The room was nice and the soaking tub looked great. The pillows and mattress were hard in case it matters to you. Some folks like that. \n\nThe only other complaint was in regard to the room service. I'm willing to pay $750\/night for a hotel but I truly resent room service that is insanely priced. I was hungry on arrival and the Caesar salad with shrimp would have been over $55 with delivery etc. Instead I ordered a delivery meal via Yelp from a nearby restaurant and a lovely salad arrived within 20 minutes for around $18.00 all inclusive. \n\nAll in all, the small lapses in service create a significant downgrade of a rating at this price.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Double sinks.  Only drawback:  the toilet is located across from the shower door and not in a separate enclosure.\n\nOur Madison Avenue facing room was very quiet and the climate control system was excellent.\n\nThe hotel restaurant is operated by Jean-George Vongerichten and serves good breakfasts and excellent dinners (although the meat dishes skew to the grilled variety), with a very good wine list.\n\nService was excellent and exceedingly friendly.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Although not quite as exceptional as some five star properties stayed at elsewhere in the world, the Mark is certainly one of the top that we've stayed at thus far in NYC. Pros are excellent location close to Central Park and amidst the upscale upper east side (with the great shopping that goes with it!), and a close walk to many other main attractions but without the busy traffic and noise. The rooms were well appointed with spacious bathrooms and good technology. We liked the decor - modern and warm - although the furnishings etc were nothing spectacular. Nice fitness centre and hair salon on site were big pros, and we had room service a few times and it was very good. In-room massage arranged by the concierge was excellent, as was their service. Areas for improvement were very minor - a bit of a snafu with the check-in with a wait and no adjoining rooms as requested (although we were offered an upgrade in one of the rooms), very dark lighting in the main restaurant at lunchtime, turn down service that was far too early (although we did not give the hotel the opportunity to correct - confident they would), and the smell of smoke from the room across the hall (which we appreciate is not the hotels fault and was an anomaly given smoking is not permitted). Overall, a very nice stay and one of the best combinations of location, rooms, service and amenities that we've stayed at in NYC over the past few years.

We ate in the Jean George restaurant downstairs for breakfast each morning, which was equally delightful. The hotel is near some amazing restaurants to explore for dinner. Our room was large (we had the two bathroom suite.) On our wedding day it rained all day and The Mark loaned us their awesome umbrellas to use, which made for really cool wedding photos. The staff was extremely friendly and tended to our every need. On check out day, they let me relax in the room a little later than our checkout time and even stored our wedding cake in their restaurant fridge for us to take with us when we left. The housekeeping staff was incredibly accommodating and couldn't have been more friendly.

We booked last minute to see a show and were graciously put into a large 2 bedroom suite as the UN meeting was ready to take place. The room was really a nice apartment, kitchen and laundry facility included.\n\nUnfortunately, a certain delegation including the Emir of XXX (I use xxx to protect the privacy of the Emir) had over 40 rooms of the hotel, and while the hotel is a Non Smoking property, they chose to smoke. We even had a lady ( not sure if she was with The Mark or the delegation) tell us it was the sweet smell of hookahs. Security was stationed by the elevator of the floor, and when my wife mistakenly thought he was a guest and stated that the smell of the smoke was terrible, the agent replied \" are you telling me.\" And the next day we encountered the same agent in the elevator on a different floor and he asked if it had gotten any better?\n\nIt is obvious that this is standard behavior which we have previously encountered at other hotels ( see my Leela Palace, New Delhi Review) and hotels are willing to break the law, turn their head, and inconvenience guests for the large sums that these people spend. This went on day and night and sleeping was difficult since the AC did not run as much due to the cooler night time weather. \n\nHad this situation not occurred, I would give this property a 5 star review because that is what it truly deserves. But when management accepts this type of behavior in return for the large sums of money and states that they try to stop the smoking but they are not successful, I cannot accept this.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our overall experience was very good although there were a few small annoyances.\n\nTo start with ... the reception and concierge staff were a mixed bag with some being very friendly and helpful while others were verging on the rude - one conversation I was having with a concierge about taking the subway was interrupted by his apparent preference to greet and briefly chat with someone over my shoulder. Very disrespectful.  Given that the Mark is frequented by many businessmen and (I assume) local personalities I got the strong impression more than once that anyone on holiday here - and dressed in teeshirt, shorts and trainers - was definitely treated as second best.  And yet presumably we pay the same ... if not so often.\n\nOur room wasn't available until 3.30pm after a journey from Dubai but on the other hand we were allowed a late check out at 2pm.   So maybe they balance out.\n\nThe room was excellent - good size bathroom, comfortable bed, well-stocked minibar and nice view over Madison Avenue.  Kept very clean throughout our stay.\n\nBreakfast was of good quality but was generally quite slow - so much so that I assumed there to be only one chef but apparently there were two sous-chefs as well.  Even though we weren't in any particular hurry it did become a little frustrating. Also a few times smaller orders like juices or milk were forgotten and staff had to be reminded.  The waiting staff were on the whole really friendly and efficient themselves - so, maybe the supply chain from the kitchen could be improved.  The breakfast is generally a la carte although a Mark breakfast and Continental do group some items together.  I loved the over-easy eggs, the fried potato and the bacon!  By the time we'd ordered a cereal\/granola and maybe an extra juice or coffee our bill often came to $120 excluding tip.  So, if you're into full breakfasts like we are, then be prepared for the bill!\n\nWe had lunch (day of arrival) and dinner (day of departure) in the restaurant - it was perfectly OK but nothing really special - either on the menu or in the presented dishes.\n\nI had previously checked the location - and yes it is a few stops on the subway to downtown and, although it has a few shops close by, it is not in the main shopping area.  On the other hand it is just a few steps from Central Park which I enjoyed walking round nearly every day.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our stay but I just felt - as mentioned above - that we weren't afforded the same welcome and treatment as the suits and well-dressed females at their business breakfasts, power lunches or whatever.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The best thing about it is it's location on Madison Ave. You definitely do not get what you pay for. It is under renovation so you have scaffolding to walk through to enter the hotel. I called ahead to request early check in by 1:30pm instead of their usual 3:00pm, and our room was not ready until 4:30pm...unprofessional! We had to wait for hours so we had lunch at their Mark restaurant. It was supposed to be great given that it's by Jean Georges, but that was a huge disappointment, very average nothing special at all. The room I got was also disappointing for $650 no breakfast per night. They told me they had given me an upgrade but our room had a blocked view. All views are appearantly not nice. After being in the room another half hour, our bags were not yet sent up. They said they couldn't locate them. I had emailed ahead to request a hair appointment at their Frederic Fekkai salon in the hotel, they gave me an appointment and asked me to send them my room number which I said I will send as soon as I check in. Once I checked in, I asked the concierge to notify them of my room number and he told me it was done. The next morning before my business meeting I went to do my hair and they told me that I don't have an appointment, that I never sent them my room number! They were now full, I was stranded! Who didn't do their job and why didn't the salon simply call down to get my room number...unprofessional! They ended up sending me a couple of blocks away to another salon, where I ended up paying a rediculous $360 and was 20 min late to my meeting! Later, after housekeeping cleaned our room nicely, we went to shower and the shower gel was out and not replenished. I had to call to request it & wait again! Manager did give us a credit for our lunch & sent us a bottle of wine which was nice, but not enough for all our troubles and waste of money by staying at The Mark.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We waited and waited and had to remind them twice, each time they said it would be inspected right away \" supervisor on the way\".\nFinally after 45 minutes we got the room keys and went up to the room by ourselves . We asked for the luggage to be sent right away and after 20 mins still nothing , had to call twice the reception to get it. Finally the bell man came up and apologised for the delay, I said \"you must be very busy\" but he told me that actually he was never told to bring our luggage up.\n\nWe booked a courtyard room, when we checked in they told us that they gave us an upgrade so we were happy. I mentioned that I had booked with a special mention for a quiet room, hence my booking for a courtyard room and they told no worries even though it is a Madison avenue room it is a high floor and won't be noisy.\nThe next day after an almost sleepless night, we told them it was not what we booked and they said they were running on 100% occupancy and could not change us to courtyard room, however the next time we would come back they would put a special comment to make sure we got a quiet room. I was very surprised and still wondered why they didn't give us the room we booked in the first place.\n\nThey didn't offer anything to us to make us digest this problem , just nice smiles . Really not professional.\n\nDo not book the rooms on Madison Avenue as they are very noisy unless you are not sensitive to noise.\n\nOn their website, they advertise the size of the queen beds between 150 and 180 cm. All the rooms we stayed in had 150 cm beds.\nAlso important to mention that the room was very tiny as the configuration was weird . Half of the size of the room was in fact the entrance and corridor area , the room was only half the size of what it was advertised for (400 sq. feet).\nAlso on their website they advertise best rate guaranteed but that's not the case as their rates are at 20% higher than booking.com\n\nNice decoration although too much electronics and many useless gadgets: TV didn't work first, we could not get past the welcome guest message on the TV screen. A technician came and had to reboot a box in the closet under the TV. The remote for the electricity and domotic didn't work.\n\nBedside table lamp was blinking as we entered the room, so much for the inspection of the room by a supervisor. We had to call again a technician to replace the light bulb.\n\nShower door could not close fully when inside the shower (no inside handle).\nTower rack on top of the bathtub looked like about to fall off soon (check photo.\n\nTV size too small and too far from bed. Limited number of TV channels compared to same standard hotel. \n\nHard mattress and pillows were not comfortable. This needs to be improved to justify for the high price of the rooms.\nNo coffee machine in the room but instead a giant mini bar, being trendy doesn't mean being not practical ...\n\nComplimentary Shoe shine service not served: I left a pair of shoes outside the door as indicated (it was 10 pm) and the next morning the shoes were still there but not cleaned).\nComplimentary newspapers didn't come on the first morning ?\n\nIn a nutshell : Great location, nicely decorated hotel, friendly staff . This hotel could easily become a real great boutique hotel if all the problems\/issues encountered were fixed. So much miscommunication between various departments of the hotel . Overall the staff seems friendly and professional but they need a proper management and more guidance.\n\nBack a second time a week later to try one last time the hotel and overall a much better experience this time. Better service, they provided the room we booked. The room on the courtyard was much more quiet. The room cleaning service was ok this time but the room service was very slow. Still many room fixtures were out of order. \nAir con has a molded smell. They need to maintain better the air con.\n\nOverall definitely a totally different experience this time. We are thinking to come back.\n\nA special mention for the concierge: he was very professional & helpful.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This time, upon arrival, we were greeted by a chic Hot Dog Cart outside of the hotel, serving Jean-Georges' gourmet organic chicken and grass fed beef hot dogs accompanied by unique condiments.   While I often try to talk my daughters out of a street hot dog in the City, this delicious haute dog is not to be missed!  [During our winter visits, the cart serves Gourmet Hot Chocolate, which is also a seasonal favorite.] This time, we also enjoyed a lovely ride through Central Park to the New York Historical Society in a Pedicab ridden by Bobby, who was a fantastic guide.  It was a fun and memorable way to see the Park, and the Mark pedicab, with its black, white and orange motif, was by far the most stylish.   We can't wait to see what the Mark has in store for the Fall and Spring . . . .\n\nThe location of this gem of a hotel simply can't be beat!  It is steps away from Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, incredible shopping and some of the best restaurants in the City, including its very own (and one of our favorites) the Mark Restaurant by Jean Georges.  But what sets this hotel miles above the rest is its superb level of service.  From the moment we arrive, our girls are warmly greeted by name, and they love catching up with everyone, from housekeeping to the concierge.  It truly feels like home! The fact that most of the staff has been there for the years that we have been coming speaks volumes for the Mark and the way they treat their employees, as well as their guests.\n\nHaving traveled and enjoyed luxurious hotels around the world, the Mark is at the top of our list, and we would not dream of staying anywhere else during our trips to the City.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. A couple of points that knocked the hotel back was the concierge service which was not particularly helpful prior to our arrival and the breakfast arrangements are a little too rigid for our European tastes in that the choice of dishes was extensive but getting what we wanted was a struggle with the staff who really did not understand our peculiar requests such as identifying the difference between camomile and English Breakfast tea!

Its free internet for 3 Mbps which is extremely slow in today's standards. They had an upgrade to 80 Mbps for an extra $19.99 a day which is about the speed I have at my house and comparable to the speeds at hotels I've stayed at in the last couple of years.

However, the bathrooms and suites are very comfortable with obscenely fantastic water pressure... The hotel was nice the bar was a bit euro.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The Mark is better described as an apartment than a hotel because it has all of the conveniences of an apartment with all of the quality of a hotel.  Our room was wonderful, clean, planned very well and made excellent use of space - there was not a wasted piece of furniture or a wasted use of space. Sometimes a luxury hotel will fill a room with furniture that is unnecessary or stuffy (or just plain uncomfortable), but The Mark made great use of space and understands well that people are using their rooms and not showing it off to people.\n\nThe staff could not have been more friendly and was quick to respond to every request. Additionally, every request was met with a YES or ABSOLUTELY and that is the mark (I did it again) of a great group of people who take great pride in their careers.  I say careers because unlikely some other properties in NYC, the folks at The Mark truly seemed to care about their jobs because the hotel was just small enough to be better than the larger hotels.\n\nI don't give 5-star reviews, but the issue here was whether to give 4 stars or 5 because my reviewed star level would have really been 4.5 (there is ALWAYS) room to improve. Given the pleasant stay, proximity to everything, quiet, residential feel and staying true to tradition (the place has been updated since my last stay, but was still quite obviously The Mark), I give The Mark a 5 out of 5 and wish it and her employees many happy years in making travelers happy in the future.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Well We waited and waited and I believe we got the downgraded room anyway-2nd floor a view of the front door where we heard doormen and Guests yelling Taxi-guests talking, car alarms until 2-3 am and on Easter Sunday the Garbage Trucks tossing in bottles for an hour-5:30-6:30 am. \n I can't believe there is a worse room then the one we had.\n The shower in our room goes from cold to scalding hot- there really is no In between. Well for a few minutes you get warm then scalding hot again.\n Before you come, the hotel emails you a list of preferences-which I checked off extra pillows, towels, and for a microwave. None of which we received. \n When the bell hop came up with our luggage we mentioned it and he said he would tell housekeeping. Still nothing...called downstairs twice and got extra towels and pillows. The microwave took several phone calls and when we came back to the room there was a toaster oven, so again we asked and were told they gave them out to other guests but they were purchasing another one. So at 10:45 pm they showed up to the room with a brand new one in the box ready to leave it for us to unpack, etc...rather comical. \n After we laughed in disbelief the woman did unpack it. \n My husband ordered room service for himself-breakfast for one-and the next morning received the wrong breakfast but they did come up with the bacon. However the bill he signed was for $34 plus tax, gratuity, room service and he added another $10 tip so the bill was $58. Then on our portfolio it showed 2 pages of charges for breakfast totaling approximately $140. \n We had to call down for that-again everyone is ALWAYS POLITE and Very ACCOMMODATING, but it's not an enjoyable experience knowing we will have to deal with this for 6 days. Very disappointed in the room especially, .since...we always love coming in to the restaurant and bar. \nBarTenders are so unfriendly at both bars.  They talk with one another, but never interact with the customers at all.\nIt would have been nice to know that the hotel has a hair\/nail salon-but nothing is even in the rooms advertising it.\n","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Even when I messed up an open table reservation to the Mark Restaurant our first night, the host found us a table despite a full room.

Rooms small, that's NY. Major problem: breakfast coffee was always cold and not strong. Every other place we went brought coffee in insulated thermal pitchers or filter presses. We were there a week...on the first morning, I ran into another long- time guest coming back from the coffee shop on Lexington carrying his tray of coffees...he said he does that every time he stays there. What a simple thing to fix- serve strong, and warm coffee in insulated coffee pots. It is already lukewarm when they bring it to the table due to the pots they use. In one week, I never got a fresh pot of coffee or any of my refills that had steam to indicate warmth. I am not a complainer, and there was too much inherently wrong with their process for me to say anything- each of us had two or three pots of coffee every morning, and it was always the same.\n\nOther than the coffee issue, it's a great hotel!

Doubts arose even before arrival: little things, like an e-mail enquiry left unanswered and technical glitches with the guest preference form. \n\nImpressions weren\u2019t improved when, on our first night, my wife and I ordered cocktails and a cheese plate after 11 p.m. from room service and the clerk told us that, while the cocktails were no problem, he\u2019d need to check with the kitchen if our cheese request could be accommodated since they were now serving only the overnight menu (meanwhile, \u201cArtisanal Cheese Plate\u201d stared up at us from the \u201cOvernight\u201d section of the menu), and also since there was only one chef on duty (didn\u2019t know slicing cheese was such a daunting prospect). Then we\u2019re told that chef says the cheese plate can be done, just not right away, so the drinks will be sent up first, cheese plate to follow. In the end, everything arrived together, though indeed not right away. First World problems, true, but not having to sweat the details is a major reason I choose to stay at luxury hotels.\n\nPhotos of the bathrooms at The Mark were what sealed the deal for me, and the soaker tub was even deeper than I\u2019d hoped. On the other hand, the toilet was surely designed by the Marquis de Sade. It was mounted so high on the wall that anyone shorter than 6\u20196\u201d who sat thereupon would have their legs dangling in space like a toddler, blood circulation painfully cut off. Take care of business fast, or you\u2019ll be walking on pins and needles. And I\u2019ve never encountered a more inefficient and ineffective flushing mechanism in a hotel bathroom anywhere; even though the high-volume button sends Iguazu Falls cascading down that bowl, nothing solid ever vanished on first flush during our entire stay.\n\nOn the plus side, the bed was comfy and very little street noise made it up to our seventh-floor room overlooking 77th Street. I also appreciated the complimentary standard shoeshine, and treated one pair of boots to the more intensive John Lobb treatment, which was well worth the charge\u2014they came back gleaming.\n\nFor the most part our room was in good condition, the major surfaces clean, but the carpet could have used a good de-scuffing, and the TV remote was so grimy I was reluctant to touch it.\n\nOverall, then, a mixed bag. My memories of our stay haven\u2019t been made rosier by additional charges appearing on my credit card after our check-out invoice with no follow-up itemised bill to identify which incidentals these cover, nor by the fact that nearly 3 weeks ago I gave less-than-glowing ratings to several aspects of our stay on the hotel\u2019s online comment form but have received no follow-up.\n\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf Sleep Quality\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cb Rooms\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cb\u25cb Value","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The area is so much nicer than being right in the middle of Manhattan where it is more crowded and can seem a little dark because of all the tall buildings.   I would definitely recommend this area - and this hotel","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is trendy, with an elegant modern ambiance, the staff extremely friendly and professional. Francisco, the bell captain who handled our luggage and car, realized that we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary, so he arranged for a little surprise for us when we came back to our room from dinner: a chilled champagne bottle with a delicious cupcake! Such a sweet gesture!\nWe reserved a courtyard room, but were upgraded to the bigger Madison Ave room. The room is clean, with lots of closets, a nice view of Madison Ave and very comfortable king-size bed. The bathroom was absolutely amazing, clean, bright and spacious, and the shower head better than a real message. The bar is well-stocked and were asked upon checking in about our preferred Sunday newspaper. \nFor brunch, we headed to The Mark Restaurant by Jean George, a great restaurant, though a bit pricy for the portions we received. \nAll in all, we loved our stay at The Mark and would love to go back.

They offered us a free drink in the bar but quite frankly if your check in time is 2 you should be ready we had to wait an hour and half after 2 to get access to our room.

Controlling the air conditioning was complicated and the room was either freezing or too hot. \n\nThere was plenty of wardrobe space however they did what every hotel does and leave about three hangers in there when you have the room booked for 4 nights and three guests are booked in there should be a wardrobe full of hangers. \n\nConcierge was not great when asking for suggestions of places to go all they seem to recommend were the local ones to the hotel as if New York doesn't have other areas. For a hotel of this caliber they didn't appear to have a great deal of knowledge.\n\nWe had room service a few times and most of the food was good however avoid the hot chocolate as it was more like water very unpleasant. \n\nOverall a pleasant stay but I have stayed at better hotels in New York, ones that actually supply you with your hotel room when they should!

With a 20% off summer rate for multiple night stays, we were able to get a $400\/night rate for a courtyard view room, which was a decent rate for a 5 star property, but at the upper end of our price range. They upgraded us to a 4th floor Madison Ave view room at check in, so a nice surprise. Beautifully laid out room, with a bathroom (2 sinks, incredible water pressure, big tub, heated towel racks) that was exceptional.\n\nFood and drink prices are 5 star high, so we had to pick our spots. In the morning, we carried in BLTs and coffee from Pick a Bagel at Lexington and 77th rather than face a $100 room service breakfast, but splurged on room service dinner one night (pizza mainly) and ate a late dinner in their first class restaurant after Broadway show, and while both were very pricey, service and food both were first rate.\n\nI'm an old-fashioned fan of the mini bar, even if I don't use it much, and The Mark's is the best you will ever see. Full selection of sweets, room temperature booze, ice cold fine wine and soft drinks, and then a deep freeze drawer with ice. And total flexibility to stock your own in the fridge or freezer.    \n\nGreat front desk, but the only weak link was the concierge service, which was definitely functional and responsive, but seemed too lack a real focus in finding out what you were really interested in (hard to explain, just that feeling that they wanted to get you an answer and move you on).\n\nBut those are small complaints. The location is exceptional -- close to Central Park -- and the service is generally first rate, with some great food right at your doorstep, so we'll return in a heartbeat if we can get a room rate that doesn't break the bank.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":112052,"title":"Five star hotel at four star (or less!) prices","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-08-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I stumbled upon this hotel as I culled through the countless options available when looking for a place to stay in NYC. We typically stay on the Upper East side because it is quiet. The Mark is a little gem nestled in the heart of the Upper East side. I'm so glad I found it.\n\nThe pros: It was definitely quiet. Our room was a courtyard king and we didn't hear a thing. No street noise at all. The room itself was on the small side, but it was adequate. The luxurious bathroom more than made up for it. It was huge by any standard, gigantic by New York standards. It had double sinks, a lovely shower with amazing water pressure (Speakman) and a soaking tub that we joked my husband could have swum laps in. The entire bath was marble - beautiful flooring and amazing slabs on the walls. The towel warmer and heated floor were nice touches, as well.\n\nThere was plenty of storage in the closet and built-ins.We were able to stow away luggage so that it was not in our way - very convenient. The room contained refrigerator drawers and a full bar that were above and beyond what is typically found in most luxury hotels. \n\nWe ordered room service several times. It was delicious and timely. Not a surprise since the hotel is connected to Jean-Georges. \n\nI felt like we were greeted and sent off by our own host each day. Francisco was warm and gracious, so friendly. I never got his title, so I am not completely sure what his position is, but that part he did perfectly. There were a couple of others who stood out, as well, I hate that I never learned their names. \n\nThe hotel is only a block off Central Park and offers complimentary bikes and pedi-cabs. The Hotel (Jean-Georges) will pack you a lunch for a reasonable fee. Madison Ave is on the other side of the hotel, so stellar shopping is just a stroll away.\n\nThe cons for the hotel overall is that it is a good bit uptown, so it takes time (and money) to get to midtown or lower Manhatten. Even the subway can be time consuming. So, you just have to go in with that expectation and know that it is a trade-off for the serenity of the neighborhood. \n\nMy one and only disappointment with our room was that it did not have black out shades. We were out late several nights and the last thing I wanted was to know it was dawn already! An eye mask could remedy that. Or take my husband's approach and be thankful, otherwise you won't want to leave the room!\n\nThere are very few places we stay that are as luxurious and comfortable as our own home. The Mark met the mark. We are thankful we found it and that it made our weekend so wonderful. We will treasure our memories of NYC and our time at this lovely hotel.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From the first step you feel the style of this place: the textures and colors are made with the great taste. The check-in procedure was very quick and then I had a room tour. I had a queen courtyard room, for me in NY it is always important to have the room with the courtyard view to avoid the street noise, but here I had the ventilation system just behind my window, so it wasn\u2019t quite enough actually if you decide to open the window (so ask for the highest floor). The room is not so big, but well equipped and made with the unique style. I was a bit surprised to discover, that you can\u2019t open the second door of the cupboard because of the bedside-table, so maybe the slide doors are better for this small room (but of course I understand that everything should be in one style).\nBathroom is great! So spacious and with a lot of light: to be honest, I was ready to spend all my time in this marble paradise. The only thing, that should be in each bathroom \u2013 the hygienic pack, but I didn\u2019t find it, maybe it was hidden away. The bathtub is very deep, so you can enjoy after a long and active day. \nThe turndown service was very pleasant and made with a care, so I felt as I came back at home. \nI had breakfast at the hotel and I think, this is the point for improvement. The food was good, but there is no buffet, so you are in the frames of the same choice each day. You have 30$ to spend for the breakfast which is covered by your rate, but in Mark 30$ is not enough (each dish is about 25-28$), so it\u2019s up to you to decide where to eat, but next time I will have my breakfast out. Also, I highly recommend to the hotel management to pay more attention to the restaurant staff. There are a lot of staff, but only one person does something while others are busy with each other, so you need to remind each time about the forgotten tea spoon, additional cup, jam or butter, milk for the porridge or your juice. I\u2019m sure that the hotel of this level can afford the best staff for them.\nI want to say a big thank to Melina, who was so kind and so operative with my booking and room requests. \nAll in all this hotel is the great one, actually for its location \u2013 just 1 minute from Central park, so I had no excuses to miss my morning cardio. I wanted to go to the gym, but it is small, so I decided to keep it for the bad weather. Also, I think the bottled water is necessary in the gym, not all people are ready to drink tap water with sliced lemon.\nThis part of the city  is the best one, so the hotel is situated in the right place. So be sure, that you will be in a good company! \nI would be glad to come back here!","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We asked for menus, mentioning we were starting with caviar and would possibly have something else after ...she was not overly in favor of more food being served, in spite of a food bar menu being there for that exact reason. \" well as long as you are not really having dinner here\" was more or less the response.  We still tipped 20 percent. Not sure why.  Breakfast in the restaurant was fair. Got in as they opened as I had to get to JFK early.

I am familiar not only with the residences at the Mark, but also the hotel and the hotel services.  Having stayed at many wonderful hotels in the states and abroad, I can honestly say - there are few that do it better.  \n\nMy visits to the Mark are always proceeded by a great deal of preparation - assistance with dinner reservations within the hotel, and outside.  Florals for the rooms we are using and if needed for our guests.  Stocking of food and wine and specialty items.  Having the pleasure of working with Isabelle Hogan from the Concierge desk and her team - I can tell you there are none better, and they have never missed a beat at making sure our arrival is perfect.   \n\nFrom the moment we arrive at the front door and are welcomed home, through the lobby, assistance with luggage, all the room preparations, dinner reservations, - and right up until we depart, General Manager Olivier and his team deliver world class service.\n\nIn a city filled with hotels, some great - some not so.... I would seriously address any issues you are having with someone of authority before you take to the internet to air your disappointment.  Customers are certainly the eyes and ears of management, and if you don't feel you are getting the services you expect in a hotel like this - I would reach out and ask to speak to the manager on duty - I am sure you will find they will fix it faster than you might expect.\n\nHaving recently hosted a birthday party weekend there - all of our guests that stayed at the hotel were impressed, de-stressed, and joyous after having visited here.  The attention they were given from the doormen and bellmen - offering hotel transportation services including bicycles, rickshaws, and a hotel car - to flagging down a cab - everyone that goes through the doors is in my opinion, well taken care of.  \n\nThe Food and Beverage department are an outstanding compliment to the hotel with Stephen Carro at the helm, our birthday weekend in room catering , and meal at Jean Georges were phenomenal.  \n\nI have been in the hotel just prior to the Met Gala, during UN sessions, and other busy weekends, and am astounded at how calm and accommodating the staff can be.  \n\nI would honestly give them the benefit of the doubt on any slips, as you can see by the GM's response - he cares deeply, doesn't make excuses, and acknowledges where there is room for growth they are all but willing.  I have met the GM, who is readily accessible when you have an issue, and if he is not , the manager on duty certainly is.  I am sure that they would be more than pleased for the chance to make it right!","travelDate":"2015-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room was at the back and can only be described as overlooking air con plant and equipment. We were in 603. Make sure you insist on a room that looks out onto the road not out the back. Most hotels I go to value returning clients and give them a nicer room. Clearly The Mark doesn't do that. The refrigerator in the room Is so noisy at least you can't here the air con plant outside.

I was v excited to come try this hotel, however I wasn't very impressed. As a fellow reviewer stated there was no 'omph'.\nFirst the staff were all very blah. They seemed to be there because they have to. There was no energy or friendliness to the service they provided. It was as if they were doing us a favor by being there. I do have to say a special thank you to Jackie from the Concierge for arranging to have cookies in our room upon check in. \n\nSecond, I think the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in in a 5 star hotel. It sunk in the middle and was way too soft. Even after requesting a harder mattress twice, we never noticed a difference. Please learn from the Four Seasons or the Mandarin, and get more comfortable beds. \n\nOne positive note: the breakfast was delicious. Skip the lousy pastries offered with the Continental breakfast and ordered the scrambled eggs and their freshly baked scone. Delicious. \n\nOverall, it was a very unmemorable stay at the Mark. \n\n","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Beds were comfortable, electric blinds worked, kitchen had it all (fridge, stove, microwave). The tub was amazing, the deepest I've ever been in. Awesome. The location is truly Upper East Side with designer stores right there on Madison, and only a few short blocks to Central Park. In terms of overall value, it's expensive for what you get. eg: a room with kitchen and sitting room is $1,100-$1,300 a night. For a couple and a short stay, it's worth it. With children, no way. The New York Palace is half the price and better located for kids. For longer stays, I'd recommend checking out One Fine Stay - they rent out high end apartments for one week or more. Two bedroom with full kitchen for $550 a night. If you need a kitchen, this is a better alternative.

New York never sleeps, so even in a fairly quiet neighbourhood, you can get some noise. Ask for a higher floor if noise bothers you.\n\nBut on the positive side, the room was spacious and the bathroom excellent.  And being on the second floor meant that we could skip the elevator and take the stairs, which was great.  There was a person providing shoe shines on the second floor.  They never seemed that busy, but it was handy to have.\n\nThe hotel has an elegant restaurant.  Breakfast isn't included, but (depending on your package) they give you $60 each to spend, which just about buys pancakes and coffee!  We preferred to sit in the sunny part of the restaurant; apparently so does everyone else.  The staff try to seat you in the darker section where no one wants to be.  It's fine during dinner, though.\n\nI would rate the service as perfectly fine, but not outstanding.  No one wowed us, but no one disappointed us either.\n\nIf you're staying on the Upper East Side, definitely consider staying at this hotel.

However, it's expensive for what it is and the service is...superficial...\n\nThe rooms are lovely - the bathroom is particularly nice. The quality of the toiletries\/toilet paper (!) is poor. \n\nBed and bedding is very nice.\n\nWe ordered room service on one night and it was prompt and delicious. We could've done without the opened and used jar of mustard that came with the other condiments, but hey, mistakes happen. $75 for 2 x burgers with fries is pretty pricey, even by our standards!\n\nWe had an unfortunate experience with an extremely disrespectful neighbour (smoking, playing loud music). It disrupted half our stay (evening\/nights especially). We got several apologies but nothing was done in terms of offering to relocate us so we basically just had to put up with it.\n\nWe also had a couple of small issues with the room but we would have overlooked these on their own.\n\nI complained about the bill when we were leaving and I was promptly contacted by the front office supervisor who offered to adjust our total bill by approx 15%. I also responded to the feedback request and was promptly contacted by the General Manager with more apologies and the offer of a free night - not great as we live in the UK but I understand the gesture. I responded to both of these people and thus far, neither have graced me with a reply. They have promptly charged my card though! I suppose I shouldn't have expected more but they SAY they stand apart from the rest...they do, but not in a good way. \n\nSo, yes, overall, disappointing.

I live in the neighborhood and stopped in for a drink with some friends during the big \"blizzard\" the other night.  The bartender was not at all friendly and promptly informed us that the bar was closing early due to the storm.  \n\nThough the bar was nearly empty he seemed too busy to give me the water I requested several times, and it was a major chore to provide us with the nuts they typically serve with your drinks.  What really upset me was that a hotel guest came in and the bartender refused to serve him, saying that if he wanted a drink he could order room service.  The man came back in a few minutes later and tried to reason with the bartender, to no avail.  My friends and I were horrified that a hotel of The Mark's reputation for service would treat a guest that way.  I understand the City was shutting down and public transportation closing, but arrangements should have been made by the hotel to keep the bar open for guests who had limited other options.  Sincere New York apologies to the unknown guest.  If we had met you at the bar we would have brought you along to some other neighborhood establishments that managed to stay open and provide great service!","travelDate":"2015-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I just stayed at The Mark on the Upper East Side (great location on 77th between 5th and Madison). It was my first visit, and what I loved most about it was that it had great style and attention to detail. It's not often anymore than you find hotels with true personality. It's like Paris in the 30's, contemporary chic and a buzzing atmosphere. Had a delicious Brunch at the Jean-Georges restaurant (don't miss the famous Truffle Pizza.) It was full of locals from the neighborhood and menu was excellent and not fussy. My corner room on the was bright and airy, great closet space and nice bathroom. A big plus was complimentary wifi. I love to work out when traveling and for a hotel this boutique size, it has a really great gym. Lots of equipment and not just an \"exercise room\" like you'd find in other hotels. This is was a full gym and they also had a Frederic Fekkai hair salon. There is a fabulous little Mark Bar where in the morning where you can grab a coffee and a bagel and relax without having to go to the main dining room if you just wanted something light. In the evening, it seemed to be a popular spot for cocktails. I loved the Cocoa Kiosk during the winter - guests can have complimentary hot chocolate throughout the day and homemade cookies - I went back several times. The staff always knew my name and everyone seemed to truly enjoy working at the hotel. The GM Olivier has done a great job in managing this wonderful hotel. I will be back.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

The hotel is beautifully appointed,the rooms comfortable,the bathroom stunning and the staff pleasant and helpful. Although the location was further uptown than I have always stayed,taxis were quite easy to hail and the walks to surrounding landmarks and shopping enjoyable. The only disappointing experience was on Saturday evening when I decided on a late lunch\/early dinner in the restaurant. I had looked forward to the event,given the supposed reputation and affiliation,however I was immediately identified by the youthful,blonde haired hostess as being older and alone - hence once again,relegation to the farthest seat,although there was only one other party of three ding at the time. The gentleman server was delightful.I ordered the chicken sandwich on ciabatta - the bread was so heavily toasted it was totally inedible - I returned almost the whole thing and notice that two of the other lady diners did the same thing. I mentioned my disappointment to a lady server who was ambivalent but said she'd let the chef know - and then when I ordered the Butterscotch  pudding signature dish she delivered it saying 'this should be softer for your teeth'!!

Having traveled and enjoyed luxurious hotels around the world, the Mark is at the top of our list, and we would not dream of staying anywhere else during our trips to the City.  The Mark Bar, as well as the Restaurant by Jean Georges are excellent places to entertain friends and clients.  Cafe Carlyle, which offers a unique and intimate cabaret experience is across the street.\nOur strong appreciation for this gem of a hotel only deepened once our children were old enough to travel.  From the moment we arrive, our girls are warmly greeted by name, and they love catching up with everyone in the lobby.  While one would not necessarily think that such an urban and sophisticated hotel would cater to young children, they certainly do--from the duckies for the tub to step stools, and comfortable roll-away beds.  The location simply can't be beat!  The hotel is located steps (or a short stroller ride) away from Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney, and some of the best restaurants in the City.  \nIn fact, you don't have to go very far to visit one such restaurant, as  the Mark Restaurant by Jean Georges is located inside the hotel.  It is, by far, one of our family's favorites, and we try to eat there at least once during our stay.  The Basil-Pistachio Pesto Angel Hair is our daughters' favorite.\nTo be able to travel with children without sacrificing luxury, comfort and convenience is a gift, and we are so grateful to the Mark for this gift!

Check in was smooth--no tickets for the bags and no ticket for the car.  Everything seemless and smooth.  The hotel lobby is impressive in a boutique hotel type way and check in was quick and efficent.  We were taken to a room on the second floor but we decided to wait a few hours for a 7th floor room to become available.  The King Madison Avenue room was impressive featuring one of the nicest most powerful showers I have ever experiened.  And while I am not a fan of technology for technology sake, the system worked ok and we could control the TV, lights and temperature from one device.  The TV had to be rebooted once but no big deal.  Nicely appointed with a comfortable bed.  No views to speak of unfortunately.\n\nThe bar was beautiful and friendly (all the service was top notch) and we could have a quick late breakfast of cappucino and pastries. Otherwise breakfast was in the Jean Georges which was fine.  The dinner was spectacular--great food and very friendly accommodating service.\n\nThe area is great--we ate in Cafe Boulud one night and some trendy Italian place next door for lunch.  Great museums and shops and much better than midtown.\n\nSo a great weekend splurge and a welcome addition to my favorite NYC hotels.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Needless to say, the Sunday we arrived I knew right away that I'd never stay in another hotel but this one, at least on the Upper East Side. So chic, so clean, so Impossibly Parisian. The hood can't be beat if you are consummate shoppers as we are and the hotel restaurant has the best menu I've seen in years along with a festive dining room where upscale families were partaking in their ritual Sunday dinner. We had two Madison kings across the hall from one another with a private entrance for both. The space wasn't huge but ample and very efficient in European decor and fixtures. The bathroom had a double sink which I shared with my fella and was luxurious with generous storage for longer stays. Good marks as well on the bedding, sexy mini bar and espresso maker brought in by request. Even better is waking  to  coffee and pastries around the corner at San Ambreuse cafe - one of the best Italian haunts around for bfast lunch or dinner  after the theater.  The Mark also serves up good breakfast in the dining room and we enjoyed yogurt and fresh fruit one morning and delicious soy lattes. Dinner was even better with salmon roasted to perfection and beet salad. The bar is hopping most nights and very swank. It's walking distance to the Carlyle where woody Alan and his New Orleans band was performing to a sold out  crowd and rumor has it he also frequents The Mark.  I will be returning and we did get good rates on Hotel.com and since rates fluctuate you can monitor them before locking in. Love that Grange did the design as I've been a devotee for years. Also we had a bellman named Tucker who really went the extra mile to help us with bags and flag down rides.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The details in every aspect of the design are a real delight and reflect the vicinity perfectly.\n\nThe devil is indeed in the detail as it is a huge shame that the hotel is let down by gross inconsistencies in staff behaviour towards clientele.\n\nWe were met with some exceptional hotel service, and some that could have been an offshoot of a better dressed fast food restaurant.\n\nWhen asked with an enquiry close to reception, the staff threw comments over to the concierge rather than walking the guests there. Comments were then hurled back in a dismissive manner and suggestions not written down.\nVery unusual, lets say for a 5 star establishment.\n\nMany of the staff do not go out of their way, nor even appear remoyely hospitable or interested. Staff worked most effectively when often told exactly what to do. If this a part of the Marks in house style, it certainly needs to be addressed as service is the crux of a good hotel.\n\nWe met some truely professional reception staff, bell boys and reateraunt staff. \n\nThe Mark would be exceptional if these issues regarding staff behaviour were standardised and addressed appropriately.\n\nOne could look to the Penninsula for some tips regarding all of the above.\n\nThe Mark could well be a cut above the rest one day. \n\n","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"NONE"}

It was definitely on the top of my list. I arrived Friday morning and received a very warm welcome. I was very early and was assured they would call me once my room was ready. The staff was super helpful in storing my luggage. Above all, what I loved was the attitude of the staff including the Assistant Hotel Manager who recommended an awesome breakfast place next door. I stayed in the Seventy Seven Kings Room, extremely spacious, uber luxurious and the level of comfort is astounding! I would compare The Mark to some of the best hotels in London matching their level of service, taking in to consideration requirements of guests. James in the reception team was super helpful and even extended my check out time for my convenience. I couldn't have asked for more! This is definitely the epitome of luxury off Madison Avenue.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is quite small making one feel at home away from home. The bellmen were readily available and ushered us in, and brought our luggage straight up. No fuss during check-in and we were given a late check out which was most appreciated since we had a long flight ahead of us that night. The hotel has been renovated and the room was very comfortable. The beds and the bathroom were outstanding. Also of notice that even though we left our room for dinner quite late ( around 8 pm) we still had our turndown service. We enjoyed the neighborhood ( many nice shops on Madison and great restaurants), and the Whitney Museum too. Overall, very pleased!","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

CP is not even an entire block away. \n*The value for the room was excellent considering the location and square footage. \n*Very quiet for NYC - we were not disturbed at all, in fact it was almost eerily quiet compared to some places where the incessant honking will drive you up a tree.\n*Large rooms, huge bathrooms by NYC standards, double sinks, marble everywhere.\n*Very modern and sleek design. I understand it was recently remodeled - they did a beautiful job\n*Intense water pressure from shower and tub - loved it! \n*Fully stocked mini bar (although shockingly pricey, even for a mini bar)\n*Friendly and helpful staff\n*Tons of closet space (in the Seventy-Seven king room)\n\nThe only cons are as follows: There were several large stains on the carpet, I mean really large stains that (I would think) in a hotel of this caliber would warrant the carpet being replaced, and the closet has 2 shelves that are resting rather precariously on screws over the closet hanger rail that both fell on me when I was hanging up my clothes. The may want to consider securing those shelves since I nearly broke my hand when they came crashing down. Thanks to my cat-like reflexes (ha) I was able to dodge them but someone else may not be so lucky.\n\nOverall this is a lovely hotel and I'd definitely recommend a visit. No complaints other than the tiny details above and neither of them detracted from the enjoyment of our stay at all.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is very conveniently located (and it was in our old neighborhood, bonus) half a block from Central Park and a couple of blocks from the 77th St 6 subway stop.  We stayed there for the location, reputation and the fact that they are very pet friendly.\n\nOur room was lovely and had plenty of closet space so even with our many suitcases and bags, it wasn't cramped.  Bed was super comfy and the room had a seriously fabulous bathroom.  That is one feature in some hotels that gets overlooked but ours was not only spacious with two sinks, a soaking tub, stand up shower, etc. but it was impeccably designed and really beautiful.  Very high tech features to speak of, including a remote control that controls the entire space.\n\nOur dog arrived a few days after us and was treated like an A list celeb.  We've stayed in a few hotels that allow you to bring your dog.  Some just tolerate your dog and others will roll out the red carpet for your dog.  The Mark really rolled out the red carpet - he got bowls, a placement and even a doggie bed that matched the decor!  The staff always petted him and had treats and even offered to walk him if we were going to be out for awhile.\n\nSpeaking of the staff, they were really first rate.  Super accommodating, super helpful and really kind.  From the bar to the front desk to the door staff to the housekeeping staff, just all really sweet and lovely.  They even helpfully stored our dog's giant travel crate until we left.  We had to stay a few extra days because our apartment wasn't ready and even though the hotel was nearly overflowing, they managed to accommodate us which we really appreciated.\n\nWhat a great way to come home!  Can not recommend it more.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is no better hotel in New York, and the location was beyond superb and incredible. Hard to find a fault here, with the exception of the restaurant's staff during breakfast. they were terribly slow, taking over 20 mins to get us a cup of coffee, and messed up orders bringing wrong items, and also forgetting to bring some items we had ordered.

Very good room category.  \nThe one small thing that I annoyed me: when I had breakfast with my daughter, they automatically added 20% tip to the check, perhaps believing we were international tourists, which we are not.

Sometimes I wonder if the people giving these reviews actually stayed there and I hope to set straight some of the myths - having been there all of last week. The first thing I want in a hotel is a quiet (very important in NYC) room, good air conditioning and it must be a pleasant environment too. The Mark ticks all the boxes - the beds are big comfotable and changed daily, the air conditioning is easily adjustable and very, very efficient, top quality fittings, stylish and more storage room that you could every use, with fantastic 'drawer style bar and freezer' with tons of ice on tap. These rooms are quiet, draw the blinds (electric) and the room is a perfect environment for uninterrupted sleep. The B&O TV system was being upgraded while we were there (it needed it) and it is now excellent with moving on tap and TV listings. The bathroom is beyond good, it is fantastic, the shower has everything you need and the bath is huge (you could float in it) and fills quickly, there is even TV built into the mirror above the sinks - all black and white marble and everything you could ever need. Room service is very quick, top quality and if I had one complaint more space round he table would be nice. Breakfast in the Mark is the best value there is, lovely dining room, impeccable service, coffee, fresh orange juice, cooked breakfast, toast etc all for $28 + tax and service ($24 for continental) you would not get anything half as good in the area, I know because I read the reviews that said it was too expensive - and I tried to get something of better value and failed miserably! This is the Upper East Side and value is rare here but for us The Mark delivered real quality at a fair price, convenient to Central Park, The Met, the Frink, The Guggenheim right on Madison Avenue for top end shops and galleries, great bar, great staff we had a fantastic stay. The Mark offered us an oasis every evening when we returned to have a refreshing G&T. The hotel is not perfect, there were small things that annoyed us - the main restaurant for dinner was just OK - concierge offered things at a price not solutions but we worked round them and it delivered us a great spot to base ourselves while in New York. It is not cheap but you remember the value long after you have forgotten the price.  The Mark made our stay in New York not only memorable but unforgettable - Thank You!","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The oak bar with forest green leather chairs, the black and white tiled floors and bathrooms, the New York City feel...all was glorious.  I was initially skeptical about the renewed, refurbished Mark, and worried it might be too flashy and lose its previous character. Those fears turned out to be unfounded - the new, improved Mark retained its marvelous, boutique, uptown New York City character without sacrificing one iota of modern luxury.  First, let me say, the Mark is one of the few hotels in the US that serves a proper afternoon British-style tea, complete with authentic scones and clotted cream. While such may be of little consequence to the average American, it was hugely important to me. Second, the restaurant offers exceptional cuisine. My friend and I had dinner there and left feeling quite overcome by the culinary bliss - the crab with a crisp Sancerre is not to be beaten.  Third, the rooms have now been retrofitted with great taste to add the modern touches missing before - enormous and highly-functional closest space, grand and full outfitted bath room, a mini-bar to rival the most glamorous 5-star hotels.  And all of this is delivered in an unpretentious, somewhat low-key manner. The staff offer unparalleled service - opening every door, securing taxis, delivering extra towels, extra drinks, and swift responsiveness at every turn.  The door man even gave me a Mark hotel umbrella, and I use it to this day (thank you!).  I stayed in a queen room that never felt small or cramped in any way - the space has been so well designed to function at a high level and feel uncluttered.  The unrivaled location sets you at the door step of Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Madison Avenue's art gallery haven. I love the intimate feel of this hotel and plan on making it my New York home base many times in the future.  I am also a fan of the Ritz-Carlton properties, and what I would say to those who ask is that the feel of the two hotels can be quite different, and difficult to compare.  While more expansive, the Ritz properties offer an excellent, business-like experience. The intimate boutique feel of the Mark, combined with its location, make it an equal and excellent choice.

We chose the Mark for its location, close to Lexington Ave shops and restaurants, Central Park and the subway; and on recommendation from a friend. We were by no means disappointed ! The rooms are spacious with subdued decor, and ours on the 5th floor had an outlook over the street, which is nice. The small thoughts in the turn down service are appreciated after a long day. The foyer and small downstairs bar seemed to be always crowded though, and a couple of times we turned away because there was just nowhere to sit. Also, 'cheap and cheerful' restaurants close by seem few and far between, unless you want to head downtown to soho ... then that's the nature of the upper east side, I suppose.The big upside for us was the help at the front desk. Sam, Daniel and Jimmy could not do enough for us - from help at check in, to a late check out, and all in between. Their making us feel welcome was probably the big upside that means we will certainly pick the Mark Hotel next time we are in NYC !","travelDate":"2014-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Even though there were many things about The Mark that I enjoyed (close proximity to Central Park and the Met, safe neighborhood, all marble bathroom, highly functional room) there were aspects of my stay that were less than stellar (service, room decor, noise, linens, degree of charm). \n\nDetails of my stay:\n\nDecor\nMid century meets art deco with lots of highly polished surfaces. I thought the lobby was blindingly shiny and the seating was uninviting.\n\nGuests\nSuave and international.\n\nStaff\nMature, seemed to be trained in hospitality, lots of slicked back hair.\n\nRoom\nThe first thing I saw when entering the room was a chartreuse curtain caught up in the lamp cord exposing an electrical outlet. Disappointing first impression. I couldn't wait for the front desk person to leave so I could fix the curtain and cover the outlet. Really?\n\nI was on the 5th floor in a Madison King (although maybe it was a queen because the bed was really small). The entrance and hallway inside the room were large; the bedroom area was about 200 sq. ft. Although the decor was a nice seque from the pale brick buildings lining the street outside, the overall effect was bland: lots of neutrals. Design details included grass cloth on walls, commercial looking art, matching blond furniture and a mid-century style table and chairs (eyesore - looked like they were borrowed from the set of I Love Lucy). \n\nLots of closet space. Ironing board. Super cold A\/C. \n\nThe bathroom was huge and entirely clad in marble. Double sinks. Giant bathtub. Mint green vanity. Good lighting. Lots of mirrors. Heated towel rack. Highly functional. No window. \n\nHighlight of room: ice drawer\n\nDrawbacks: Street noise, coarse BEIGE sheets\n\nService\nThe Mark really fell down on the job for me. I made the reservation directly with the reservation department via email and phone. I requested an outside room on the 7th or 8th floor and if it wasn't available to please place me in a courtyard room. When I checked in, I was placed in an outside room on the 5th floor. No mention of my request. \n\nI heard lots of street noise on the 5th floor. \n\nOn two occasions, my room key failed to open the door and I had to call for help.\n\nThe front desk was accommodating with both an early check in and late check out. Much appreciated. \n\nRoom Service\nI only had breakfast. I called in the morning and my tray was delivered in about 10 minutes with everything exactly as I ordered it. Nice job. \n\nHousekeeping\nImmaculate. Inconspicuous. (Except for the offending curtain).\n\nTransportation\nYou can walk to the park and a number of museums. If you want a NY deli experience, there is a Pastrami Queen deli a few blocks east. There is one train station a few blocks away but overall, you will be taking a taxi and I found that just about everywhere I went it was a $15 cab fare (including tip).","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I will write more about it on another occasion. \n\nSo after one night spent in that horrible appartment (120 E Broadway) I decided to treat myself and was looking for the most possible - but affordable - luxury. So this is the story how we found out The Mark hotel. I loved the design of the lobby, bar, restaurant and the rooms very much. The staff at the reception desk was extremely polite and nice, we could check in even earlier (noon) than according to the official hotel policy (3 p.m.) and were upgraded to a better room. It was impeccably clean and quiet. The only disturbance I could hear - and I am very noise sensitive - was the refrigerator, but it was not too loud, it was just a nuisance. After we have spend two nights there, we booked a car to the airport, it was not only there perfectly on time but it was a limo with a very friendly driver who gave us a lot of information about the city as well. We have had breakfast only once in the hotel, we were given a beautiful table but the organisation of the staff was not perfect. They forgot to bring us one order at all (they did not charge it though), the people attending to our table were changing and the signature breakfast was fine but nothing special. The belgian waffle was outstanding with fresh cream and strawberries. So after my terrible experience with a private appartment I was more than happy in The Mark hotel. I have been do NYC five times in total and this was definitely the most beautiful hotel where I have ever been.

Some of it was successful and some less so, however, the hotel still has a luxe feel to it, the staff are top in NYC, and the restaurant is superb.  \nI love the refrigerator - it is nicer than most, and the tv in the bathroom mirror.  The master control was fine, but the system was down a few times so we could control the lights and TV, but not the shades. I like that the Wifi is free - too many places charging in bits and pieces for such things.  Hope I can afford to return!!!\nThey say the sign of a great restaurant is the roast chicken.  Jean- George's is excellent as is the chicken, cocoanut, ginger soup. Loved the pistachio pesto.   If you like butterscotch or caramel ( I still get them confused) don't miss the pudding - sweet beyond belief...along with three tiny almond cakes. The staff seemed genuinely happy to be of help - very cheery group and attentive...and humorous too.","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

From the moment we stepped into the hotel we felt welcomed and cared for.   Our experience started with Lucas and Paulette at reception.  They were both \u2018bubbly and fun\u2019 yet very professional.  We relied heavily on the concierge Jeanie and Isabelle who were nothing short of perfect.   They were very knowledgeable, professional, yet again wonderfully pleasant to speak with.  Of course we did not fully appreciate the quality of the staff until we travelled to a luxury hotel in Soho to spend two nights there.  There was a stark difference between both the hotel and the quality of staff.  As for our impression of the Mark over and above the staff, it was also perfect.  All small details were thought of; bright and inviting design, rooms were cleaned perfectly; the bathroom\u2019s shower pressure was spa like; the bed was the BEST mattress I have ever slept on (in fact got the name of the manufacturer) and the list goes on. \n\nIn short it was a perfect visit to New York and The Mark played a very large part!  Of course as a business owner I fully appreciate that such perfection must be well orchestrated, so my compliments go out to Management as well.  They have obviously coached staff well and led expectations for attention to detail.\n\nNext time we are in New York we will stay at none other than The Mark!","travelDate":"2013-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I really do not understand what happened to this hotel! In 2010 it was a dream: immaculate and clean rooms, superlative service and very attentive staff, very high end guests...I came back this January and I could not believe to be at The Mark, NYC. \nPublic areas ( including floors hallways) were dirty and bad mantained.\nRoom cleanliness was poor and walls, carpet and furnitures seemed to be in bad conditions.We could hear every kind of noise coming form the street and from the hallways and cold air passed trough our window. The heat system was extremely noisy.\nWe were 3 adults and everyday we had bathrobes, bath towels and bath amenities for 2, also after several requests.\nThe staff at the reception and at the concierge was very kind but they gave us a lot of wrong infos.\nWe booked a table for breakfast and dinner at The Mark Restaurant for 5 consecutive days and at the third day we had to cancel all the following reservations: they take care of usual local guests and treated us in a very bad way ( they gave us always the worst and littlest table available, the waiters always tried to charge on our bill the 20 % gratuity for groups of 8 or more even though we were only 3! and so on)\nI think to remember that in 2010 this was a SLH hotel and now it is not any more in SLH hotels list!

This type of service is seldom and if ever achieved in any other high profile hotel isa constant reality thanks to Julita at the Mark. Julita learned quickly about my requests and preferences even before i stayed there for the first time. She will always go way and beyond to make sure my stay will be perfect.

This is what I need when I come to New York: comfortable, first rate service, a hotel and a professional staff which will make my stays ones that I am more than happy to spend the money on.\nI would recommend this hotel to the kind of traveler who wants the best service possible in New York City.

The Upper East Side can be snooty but it is also convenient to the major museums and you can just zip down Fifth Avenue to get to other parts of the city. I have stayed in the hotel during very high rates and low rates so be mindful that rates change at different times of the year. I like the room that I had facing the courtyard and other townhouses. I don't need a view of Madison Ave. This hotel is probably best for people who know NYC already and just want comfort. It is sophisticated but exceptionally comfortable and up to speed in terms of room goodies. The only downside is there really isn't a place in the lobby to chit chat if you are with others except for the bar which has a scene thing going on. Not for me. But you can just walk around the corner for a latte or other place if you are meeting someone. Yes there is a delish restaurant in the hotel but it is not too intimate but is convenient. I had an excellent chicken paillard salad with the best dressing that I have tasted in a long time. The bathrooms are large and up to date. Not sure I like the European toilet but other than that, I love this hotel and don't really want to share how good it is with you because I want to be able to keep it to myself!!

It is unusual that after seventeen nights, no problems emerged and our stay was consistently pleasant. Our room was extremely comfortable and felt like our own little home in NYC. Apart from a few small things, housekeeping did a wonderful job and it was always a pleasure to return \"home\" after exploring the city. On returning after evenings out, we often went to the lively bar for a nightcap or two which was a terrific way to end the day. Susie in the bar is a treasure. We love the location, a few steps to Central Park and great museums as well as wonderful shopping. It was never a problem to grab a cab to mid or downtown and the lovely guys on the door were always happy to help. Before our arrival from Australia, the Concierge desk assisted us with making restaurant bookings and secured some \"very difficult to get\" reservations. Jeanie was just great, so too was Jackie. We found the staff in every area to be charming and warm and they went out of their way to assist us and to make us feel welcome.

I can easily say it is one of the most comfortable and beautiful luxury boutique hotels we have stayed at, hands down.  \n\nThe lobby is quirky chic and impeccably clean.  There are couches that provide a very comfortable place to wait or just people watch given there are always people milling about.\n\nThe rooms are very large by NYC standards and impeccably clean.  I found the room to be beautifully furnished and incredibly comfortable and lush...it is clear a lot of thought and care has gone into the decor and furnishings of the room.  The bathroom was magnificent.  Looking at pictures on tripadvisor it looks chintzy retro, not glamorous retro...but I assure you that in person, it is quite luxurious in a very art deco type of way.   Our room also had a kitchenette, which was a fantastic touch.  The room has plenty of closet and drawer space which is quite helpful for longer stays.  \n\nWe ate at the restaurant for breakfast and it was only just mediocre.  New York is a haven of restaurants, so venture out for your morning meal, better value and will be tastier. \n\nThe one downside of this fabulous hotel is the slight snobiness of the staff.  Luckily I am secure enough in myself, that it didn't really bother me that I was often overlooked so that extra special attention could be showered on the patrons flashing their money around their necks and fingers.  In this way, it was a bit disappointing.\n\nIt is not to say that staff didn't go out of the way to help or that the service was bad...it just seemed that you had to be someone special they either knew or someone in the know to be looked after in a friendly manner.  If you were anyone else, you were assisted but with a snooty demeanor.  I witnessed this first hand and not just vis-a-vis myself, but in relation to various hotel guests.  This is the only aspect of this hotel that would downgrade it from a true luxury hotel.  True luxury hotels provide solid service and solid service is consistent, not selective.\n\nThere was also an incident where the hotel manager dressed down the doorman for not wearing the proper pants.  This type of behavior is unbecoming of a hotel as beautiful and luxurious as The Mark...I'm sure issues with the staff could be handled somewhere other than in the hotel lobby.  It's unnecessarily embarrassing to the staff member and uncomfortable for the guests.\n\nThat being said, the concierge was very helpful and the doormen were exceptionally nice.   And if you get stuck for a cab, ask for the house car.\n\nHaving lived in the Upper East Side, where the hotel is located, I am partial to to the area.  It definitely has more of a residential feel than downtown, but it's quiet which makes for a good night's sleep.  There is also fabulous shops and cafes and it's only a short walk to Central Park.\n\nLast tip, if you're flying out of Newark, take the train.  Instead of a 35 minute train ride we took a 3 hour car ride because of traffic.  Not worth it.\n\nOverall, The Mark is a beautiful, comfortable and luxurious hotel and I would gladly stay there again.","travelDate":"2012-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I live two minutes walk from the Mark and often go there. We sat down and were given a menu by the insipid waitress. Within a few minutes, the bartender strode over to our table and, in a rather aggressive and unnecessarily loud voice, demanded to see our IDs. Before we could even reach for our wallets, he continued and said that even if we had IDs he was sure they were fake since we did not look 21. This was all before we had even ordered anything, alcoholic or not. The bartender spoke so loudly that everyone in the bar heard him. My friends felt like we were being publicly admonished for sitting in the bar and wanting coffee. This bartender, and the manager who he was allegedly on behalf of, presupposed that we were underage and there to break the law. Furthermore, he thoroughly embarrassed me and my friends in front of important people, some of whom I knew and recognized.

For the most part, it's a lovely facility, but they have 4 rooms with unacceptable bathrooms.  What a disappointment that they would let any guest stay in these rooms.  When we checked in, we were asked whether we minded a bathroom with a walk-in shower rather than a tub.  I actually prefer stalls to tubs so I don't have to shower in a tub full of water, so I was pleased to accept the room.  What they didn't tell me was that the shower is completely ill-designed in a quest to be ADA compliant.  The stall is extremely narrow, has no barrier between the shower and the rest of the bathroom, and has a disgusting shower curtain that blows into the shower space so you have to fight not to have the curtain stick to your body while the water's on. Also, because the stall floor is flat with the bathroom, the water flows out to the rest of the bathroom so the marble floor gets incredibly slippery.  Topping it all off, ithere's no fan in the bathroom so it's a steamed up mess by the end of it.  When I complained at check-out, they admitted that they know these ADA bathrooms are a problem.

It did not disappoint on the former. The location is fantastic for exploring the art galleries and museums on the east side and Central Park. Just walk out the hotel and turn right.\nWith regard to the hotel itself we had a courtyard room on the 8th floor. It was excellent; quiet;large comfortable bed, lots of wardrobe storage and an absolutely stunning bathroom. The only downside for us was the 'Creston' room control system. We had a number of issues during our stay relating to the air-conditioning and television controls. Although we had a couple of visits by maintenance the system was still giving problems when we left.\nThe quality of service we received during our stay was very mixed. Breakfast was excellent but the service haphazard, and painfully slow on a number of mornings. The doormen were very polite, friendly and helpful with a plentiful supply of umbrellas when the rain arrived on a couple of afternoons. This contrasted with the concierge service which we found extremely unhelpful, even arrogant. Requests for assistance in sorting out some issues relating to a brief visit to Washington during our stay were answered with a 'can't  do' rather than 'can do' attitude. Even a request for assistance booking a local restaurant for lunch became a major issue. In the end we made our own arrangements; it was easier.\nWe will definitely stay when we next visit New York.

It is not fatal of course, but on the other hand explaining the hotel staff how and by which resourse the reservation was made and what is our membership number etc. is not what you expect to get from a Leading Hotel of the World after a 10-hours flight.  When things had been resolved several minutes later, we were accompanied to our room which was spacious, bright and had a view on the Madison Avenue. Here comes the room tip: I would not advice you booking a Madison Avenue rooms at this hotel as all of them look at a strange high white building located on the other side of the Madison Avenue, so if you do not want to end up with someone starring in your windows from across the street, book a courtyard or 77th Street rooms.\nComing back to the room itself, I would add that the bathroom seemed a bit dated and equipment rusty in some places; bathroom amenities not of the best quality at all which made me go to the closest 24-hour pharmacy at 5 a.m. to get some decent shampoo and wash gel.\nThe breakfasts are ok - not of the widest variety we had in some other places, but rather well prepared at least.\nAll in all the place has left us with a bitter taste of frustration - it's all about \"a bit\": beautifully decorated rooms, but a bit dated bathrooms, lots of staff, but a bit slow and not really caring service, famous Jean George's on site, but a bit poor breakfasts.

Though I'm a big fan of the UES, this was my first time staying there (I've stayed in Midtown, Soho and Brooklyn on previous trips). The hotel was very easy to get to; the 6 train is about two\/three blocks away. Check-in was quite easy, though since I was there early, they held my bags for me. When I returned the keys were waiting and they had already taken up my bags. \n\nThe room itself was lovely, everything was clean. There was quite a bit of closet space which was handy, though not that many hangers. It was fine since I was the only one using them, and I would hope in a place of this standard more would have been brought had I requested them. The wifi was always quick and complimentary, which was nice to see. Though I had reserved a courtyard room, I was given one facing Madison Ave, a slight upgrade but still appreciated. Even though it faced the street there was very little noise. The bathroom was fantastic; the tub was just about the biggest one I've ever seen! Tons of towels and a fluffy robe. The room was fairly large for a single traveler, and even when my friend came up a day later and was staying with me, it was still comfortable.\n\nOne of the nights my friend and I had a drink at the bar downstairs. I had a cocktail and my friend had a mixed drink (it's been a while so I don't remember exactly what they were). They were both pretty good, nothing mind-blowing, but at the level you'd expect. We stood at the bar as it didn't seem there were any tables available, though since we were only have one drink it didn't bother us. It seemed like there was a good mix of guests and locals, which was nice. \n\nI would say the location is great if you're interested in seeing the museums or serious (window)shopping. At night the area is pretty quiet and residential, so those looking to party may want to stay closer to the action. For me it was perfect. \n\nFor the most part service was nice, but not overly warm. For $400 (which is on the low end for the hotel, in the summer rates start at about $600), I expect something a little more friendly; maybe a smile.

In defense of the hotel the temp. outside was consistently in the high 90s throughout our stay, but still it made our stay less then fantastic.  Other then that the room service tended to forget one item every time we ordered something, which was alot since we were confined to the room much of he day.  The in house bar was a little expensive for my taste ...($15 for a top shelf vodka\/soda...I guess its not too bad for the upper east side at a five star hotel.  It gets pretty busy on week nights.

It's not a fun\/lively hotel, more of a subdued\/got no soul establishment.\n\nWe were upgraded to a one bedroom suite on arrival which was a nice touch, and one concierge (Isabelle) was extremely helpful with coordinating my sister's 2 best friends arriving as a surprise - I only wish we had moved hotel then as planned, rather than moving to a 2 bed suite within the hotel.  Isabelle is so lovely it seemed like a good idea at the time (I did make the final decision & they did give us a good rate on the room).  \n\nGOOD POINTS: Rooms are spacious & clean.  The hotel is in a great location close to Central Park (and only 5 mins by cab to fifth avenue).\n\nBAD POINTS: Room service prices are insane.  Staff (except Isabelle & the doormen) are quite arrogant (particularly another female concierge - when I asked re comedy nights & timings she responded 'I don't know, you'd have to look on line').  The bar is very small & packed with questionable female clientele.  There's no outdoor area at all.\n\nI could go on.  In short we had a fabulous time in New York & will definitely return - just never to The Mark Hotel.

At first I was a little worried that it was too far North (East 77th Street) compared to those hotels I usually stay in in the 50s, but that proved to be an asset, as it was quieter, a few minutes walk from Central Park, the Met and subway, as well as more residential, which was nice. The service rocks! The doormen were attentive at all hours...opening car doors, giving directions, hailing cabs and loading lots of bags. The front desk folks were welcoming and attentive. They got us into a better room before official check-in to accommodate an early afternoon engagement. Within a day one gentleman greeted us by name. They even retrieved theater tix from our valeted car to save a us a trip to the garage. A plate of cookies, chocolate milk and champagne greeted us in our room, as well as fresh cut roses. The room was awesome. Not a spec of dust, comfy beds, clean\/fresh smell, and amazing bathrooms. House-keeping came immediately one night to set up the pull-out bed and brought in a roll-away for the kids. When I asked to get a cup of coffee, they didn't hard-sell me on the hotel coffee ($12\/small pot), instead directing me to a bakery down the block.

I booked\" The Madison\" one bedroom suite which was large but unfortunately was missing a beat to it. I had reserved it for several days as I was in for business with my husband. To begin with from the front doorman, except for one, we had to open the door even though they would be right there. Not that I have a problem with that but given we had to hail a cab with no offers from them for this service. Actually, they would just be talking to the other gentlemen outside the door of the bar.  There was no door service from them at all not even welcome back or enjoy your day! The restaurant which we dined at for breakfast daily and lunch had a wonderful menu and was delicious but the wait staff was more in tuned with what was going on in the kitchen or talking about an inspector that was there for one of the days. We had a horrible strong smell of some kind of paint or something that was coming from a store the borders the hotel. After being seated there and asking to be moved to another location as the restaurant was empty at this time I wondered why the hostess would even seat anyone at this location. The waiter was more than gracious to relocate us inside closer to their bar, as the horrible odor wasn't present there. As I mentioned the food was delicious and we did have a fabulous waiter that day. Back to our suite, I found that the cleaning service wasn't up to our standards as the floors were a little dirty, dirty dishes left on our table in the living room for two days,  as well as in the bathroom wasn't that cleaned well. The suite was very uninviting \"cold\" such as no magazines or books to offer it's guest to look at,  which I find strange??? The bed wasn't that comfortable and we ended up leaving earlier than expected. I really wanted to like this hotel but probably wouldn't return. Rather go to The Surrey one block over as from the moment you enter it's lobby to every staff member and suite we have stayed in there we have never been disappointed.

My partner and I recently stayed at the Mark for three nights.  We usually stay at the Pierre or Gramercy Park but had heard good things about the Mark and thought we\u2019d give it a shot.\n\nThe good is really good.  The design is gorgeous from the bar to the restaurant to the lobby to the rooms \u2013 everywhere, everything is contemporary and stunning.  Clean lines, sleek and bright.  Often the lobbies of high-end hotels are stunning and then the room falls down (Dream Downtown).  Not the case here.  We were in Room 812 \u2013 king sized bed, gigantic (by Manhattan standards) shower and great closet space.  The bathroom had a flat screen built into the mirror.  You can see that the spent a lot of money on mouldings and finishing work.\n\nWe went to the bar at night \u2013 great crowd, a good mix, young people, established people, gay, straight \u2013 well dressed, sophisticated.  Cocktails were terrific and the service was spot on.\n\nAnd then it fell down a bit.   As the check-in clerk was showing us the room, we noticed that the Crestron system was not working \u2013 which is a bit of a problem since the entire room is tied to the Crestron remote.  She said someone would be up within the hour to fix or replace the remote.  We went out for a walk, had lunch, came back \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t fixed.  I went downstairs as we were on our way out for the night and asked again if someone could have a look at it.  I was assured they would.\n\nNo one ever came and it was never fixed.\n\nWorse yet, the TV\u2019s \u2013 in the main bedroom and in the bathroom \u2013 would randomly turn on at 4 or 5 in the morning with intensely high volume that all had to be shut down manually.  Not a total disaster but given their price point \u2013 not good news either.\n\nWhile the bathrooms were impressive by New York hotel standards, there is design flaw they need to figure out.  The seal at the top of the shower is too tight and doesn't allow the air to circulate - the upshot being a moldy smell that takes away from the luxurious design.\n\nThe other issue was street noise.  Wow.  I am pretty durable by New York standards.  I lived there for twenty years.  I get it.  But this was pretty disturbing.  We were on the 77th Street side of the Mark (which I thought might be quieter than the Madison Avenue side).  If that was the case, I can only imagine the Madison Avenue side.  If you decide to make a reservation \u2013 definitely ask about noise and request a \u201cquiet room\u201d if one exists.\n\nWould I stay there again?  Maybe.  It has the potential to be an amazing addition to the luxury hotels on the upper east side \u2013 but again \u2013 given their price point, it needs to be flawless and it\u2019s not.","travelDate":"2012-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The service was top notch, and we would definitely say there again.\n\nThis is notmthemplace to,stay if you want to be within walking distance to Times Square,or mid-town, but we walked only 2 blocks to catch the subway, which was only 2 stops from 42nd street, and it was very cheap and easy.\n\nThe Mark has a couple of complimentary limos available to guests on a first-close basis, from 3PM leo 10:00PM, butmwemwere never able to,get one.  The door man was very adept at getting us a taxi when we needed it, and all the employees were very friendly and helpful.\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyedmourmstay at The Mark, and would definitely go back!","travelDate":"2012-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":10,"locationId":112052,"title":"What a let down... Such a shame.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2012-05-02","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I recently booked 3 nights accommodation at The Mark. I have been to NYC many, many times, normally staying downtown at the likes of: The Bowery; Soho Grand; Mercer etc. On this trip I decided it might be nice to do something totally different for the first few nights of my 12 day stay and book a good hotel uptown or on the Upper East side. After a fair amount of research on the similar hotels in this area, which hold a 5 star rating akin to The Mark, I decided to go ahead and book a Madison King Room. I have pretty high standards when it comes to hotels, travel a decent amount and I work in an artistic field so therefore apart from basic requirements deemed necessary in a hotel such as; good service, quiet rooms, bed quality, cleanliness etc., I am personally always very drawn to the small design details and d\u00e9cor of a hotel, therefore based on what I saw from The Mark website and its status as one of NYC's nicest and most luxurious hotels, it looked beautiful to me and I very much looked forward to staying.\n\nMy husband and I flew in from the West Coast after flying from Sydney (20+ hours of travel) and arrived at The Mark at around 8.30pm on a very rainy Sunday night. The desk staff were nice enough, no major faults there, although honestly there is a somewhat snotty, pretentious feel about the place. It's fine if you like that sort of atmosphere (which I realise is all part of that 'UES NY' atmosphere and was half expecting it) but we found it a tad cold and insipid, it lacks warmth. You can still do 'refined UES' but be less wooden and stiff about it if that's the main agenda at your establishment due to the neighbourhood you are located in.. It all just comes across painfully stereotypical and rather boring. \n\nWe checked into our room and waited for about 20 minutes for our bags to be brought up. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the room, the design was lovely, very stylish and it was spotless, as was the bathroom. Literally gleaming and it had a very cosy, glamorous and comfortable feel. The mini bar was good and wonderfully there was a large freezer section full of ice \u2013 so during your stay you have ice 'on-tap' so-to-speak ~ one feature I loved. We headed downstairs to meet a colleague for a drinks in the hotel bar then retired to the room and booked some room service food.\n\nThis is where it all when majorly downhill. Whilst I was waiting for the food I decided to take a deep bath, I was shattered after all the travel, the bath was great, great that is until I went to unplug it. After several attempts on both my husband's part and mine, we surmised it was totally broken and we'd have to call reception for them to organise a plumber. (BTW the plug in the sink was totally blocked too). A plumber was sent up at around 11.30pm who set about trying to fix the bath. At 12.45am he was still there and unable to fix the plug, so was shovelling bucket loads of my bath water into the shower, the room was a mess. Following this we got 40 minutes of incessant loud banging as he went at the plug with a crowbar (or what sounded like something similar). It was 15 mins into this stage that my husband went to the front desk to say we would need to be moved to another room as we were unable to get to bed for the previous almost 2 hours due to said hammering in bathroom at almost 2am. \n\nWhilst my husband was at the front desk he received a very flippant and disinterested attitude from the receptionist. He asked that we were moved as it was getting onto 2am and we needed to get some sleep. He was told there were no rooms available other than one smaller than the one we had paid for and if we moved that's where we would be for our 3 days stay. They also told him the hotel was otherwise fully booked for the Monday and Tuesday \u2013 call me a cynic, but on a Monday and Tuesday night in early April in this area, I am instinctually feeling this was a lie. Also when I checked online in the room from my laptop, every form of room from a Madison King to their Penthouse was available to book\u2026 (Why on earth don't hotels cop on to that fact guests can tell when they are lying about room availability by simply checking online ?!!). During my husband's time downstairs the plumber (a really nice guy BTW) came into my room, dripping in sweat from all his efforts saying it was totally unfixable and he wasn't sure how he could fix it the next day either.\n\nI was pretty disgusted at this attitude from the front desk. Fair enough if we were in a 1 or 2 star hotel, but their entire attitude was snotty and cold and totally unacceptable for the level of hotel they claim to be. Had she said; \"I am so sorry we are full tonight, would you mind staying in the room or the smaller one and out of courtesy we will move you to a better or same level room tomorrow?\" that would have been utterly fine, also, we were very unimpressed that she never checked with the plumber after 15 or 20 mins to see how things were going as she would have been aware we were hanging around waiting for him to fix it. \n\nWe decided to stay the night and check out the following day as I'm not interested in forking out money to hotels who blatantly show they don't give a fiddlers about you unless you are paying for their Presidential suite. When my husband ventured down again to tell reception we would be leaving the following morning he was met with a stunned 'rabbit caught in headlights' stare from both female and male receptionists, who suddenly started pleading was there \"Anything at all they could possibly do?\", \"Could we upgrade you to a better room tomorrow sir??!\" What a joke, 30 minutes previous we were told there were \"no other rooms available\" other than a pokey lower level one. The following morning upon checking out we were asked how we enjoyed our stay? When we replied 'Very disappointed\" yet again, another 'rabbit caught in headlights stare' from the morning staff who then mentioned \"was there some issue with your bath plug, I see a brief note here, I am so sorry, next time please come and stay with us and I will ensure you are upgraded\"\u2026 The whole way they handled themselves was almost embarrassing esp. when they claim to be 5 star. \n\nWhen we decided on the Sunday night at 2am to leave, I booked a room immediately at The Greenwich Hotel in TriBeCa and we moved there first thing Monday morning. Which, within second of walking into, was warm, inviting, friendly, cosy, incredibly decorated and totally welcoming, they have service and details down-pat. In hindsight I was actually totally delighted The Mark treated us the way they did as if not, I wouldn't have moved hotels and had a wonderful 2 night stay there will 100% return to The Greenwich on my next NYC trip. It is without a doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed at in New York. \n\nOn an end note, if you do decided to stay at The Mark\u2026 a tip, book a room away from Madison Ave, during our one and only night stay, I must add the room was crazy noisy, at around 5.30 or 6am we were awoken by the irritating, high-pitched, repetitive beeping noise of a truck reversing, or maybe it was a bus as it happened about 6 or 7 times between this time and 8am\u2026 aka zero sleep from 6am onwards. Fantastic when we only got to bed 4 hours earlier. In addition this was only made my annoying in addition to the loud humming all night long of the air conditioning unit which were found utterly impossible to turn off. \n\nReally disappointing overall and a really awful way to start a long anticipated break away in NYC.","travelDate":"2012-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However, we were disappointed to be waken up by a 4:00pm visit from a guy who was checking the minibar, not knowing that we just checked in, tired and snoozing for a few minutes. Furthermore, a bellman tried to get into the elevator (which is the size of a small closet) while four other people were there... Trying very hard until I asked him to wait for the next elevator...\n\nWhen we mentioned the unscheduled afternoon visit to the staff downstairs we got the Perfinctory \"we a very sorry.\" response. At this level of hotel, one would have expected the staff to have more authority to \"make things right.\" disappointing.","travelDate":"2012-04","tripType":"NONE"}

We booked two Madison King suites and could't have been more delighted. They are joined by a separate foyer which can be used privately when both rooms are used by the same guests. We loved the new bathrooms, the Sub Zero mini-bar systems, the technology \"tablet\" that operates just about everything (including the curtains) and the spaciousness of the rooms. The Mark has a long history of guests from \"old wealth,\" but knows instinctively how to meet the needs of a cliental that includes a great deal of recent diversity.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":112052,"title":"The Mark of Excellence","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2012-04-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"We spent five sterling nights in April at the Mark on the Upper East Side (UES) of Manhattan.  It was in a word 'superb'.  Check in was quick and easy and they have at least five folks standing at the entrance during busy periods to ensure all is running smoothly.  We signed up for the Leaders Club and booked the room through them.  I highly recommend you do this if you are staying any more than two nights.  The $60 allowance for the breakfast in the morning covers down on most of your meal.  I do say most of your meal as the room service prices are pretty intense and we rarely stayed under that figure for breakfast for two (oatmeal is $14).  We were getting married in the city on the 19th and were met in our room by a bottle of chilled Taittinger and a welcoming note from the manager.  Leaders club also scored us an upgrade to a Madison King.  As some of you may be aware, NYC is notorious for small hotel rooms.  This is not the case for the Mark.  The rooms are quite expansive and very newly renovated.  WiFi is complimentary (as far as something can be complimentary for $545.00 per night ;-]...).  The tub is huge, and I mean huge.  It easily accommodated two six foot guys and we availed ourselves of it most evenings. All the room amenities are very cool.  The only thing I would critique is the lack of a full length mirror in the living space (they do have one on the inside of the sliding door to the bathroom, but it gets a little warm in there and closing the door to tie a tie was a pain).  Every person we encountered was nice and asked if we need anything.  We did not take advantage of the concierge, but they were always there if needed. We went to the bar on our last evening and the folks there are just wonderful.  We had a party of six and they got us in and out quickly as we were going to Cafe Boulud for dinner (incredible, that place.)  Best drink was the Rhubarb Hibiscus Cosmopolitan; try one! The location on the UES was absolutely perfect.  It is far enough away from the tourists in mid-town to make you feel like a local as you walk among the top 1% income crowd.  You will note the uniform for the UES is skinny, skinny with discrete Chanel or some other designer and skin stretched tight on those of a certain age (and we are not just talking the ladies...)  The Mark does not have views per se, but it's always interesting to watch that UES crowd strolling by from your window. Overall you would be hard pressed to find a better place to alight than here in NYC.  Spend the extra dollars, you will not be disappointed.","travelDate":"2012-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}
