First off, don't book through Expedia or one of their partners. I keep my loyalties with Marriott properties 90% of the time & almost always book directly, but had a ton of credit card points & used Chase's portal which is run by Expedia. It's not the hotel's fault, but booking through there sold a room with a view of Central Park that I guess they do not have any longer, so we entered to a regular room instead of one with a view of Central Park. I went to the front desk to bring it up & though they didn't have to, the manager Joe intervened and helped us out and got us a room higher up that had a better view of Central Park, even though there's a new building under construction across the street that will eventually block almost the whole view. :( From here on out, smooth sailing. Our room was nice, and while small, I wonder if reviewers here know that in NYC you aren't going to get large sprawling rooms like you would in middle-of-nowheresville. For two adults, it was perfectly fine - you're there to sleep and shower, not stay in it. King bed had room to walk around and a good amount of storage. Bathroom was nicely cleaned, shower was great, water was hot when I needed it. Maybe my eyes are better than others, but the room lighting was perfectly acceptable from the desk to the lamp to the bedside - all good. We did have a drink and side dish at the attached lobby bar while waiting for our room switch and the experience there was also great, attentive server, good food, and good service. They also held our bags after we checked out and did some exploration of the city before our train back home, which was nice. Easy access to multiple subway lines to get around NYC or to get to from Penn Station. Would definitely consider for any future visits, but this time I'll book direct.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I stayed in a suite at this property a year ago and I did like that room (but note the suites used to face Central Park, and they now face a massive construction project on 57th Street blocking the park view, so even those rooms may not be what you expect now), but we tried a regular room this time.  That was a terrible idea.  The room was tiny, extremely outdated, had dingy carpet, was dimly lit (the \"desk\" light did not even work - and \"desk\" is in quotes since nobody could actually work in that space), and had an awkward bed that is practically on the floor with a strange nautical-looking wood closet\/giant headboard behind it.  To be fair, the room is still better than a Motel 6 -- probably -- but for over $350\/night, this property is absolutely not worth it (if the price was $150 to $200, I might reconsider for a short trip of one or two nights, but not a longer one).   \n\nI am only giving this property 2 stars because the location is great, and the staff was genuinely friendly and helpful.  When I told the front desk that I was leaving early, they were helpful at getting me checked out (and didn't seem entirely surprised that I wanted to leave).  The staff does clearly care about guests, which counts for something and I appreciated that.  \n\nIf you're looking for a property in this area of Manhattan, I moved to the Thompson next door (a Hyatt property) and it was great and only slightly more per night.  The Residence Inn\/Courtyard south of Columbus Circle is also very nice and usually priced similar to this property (and actually worth that price).\n\nAlso - do not be fooled.  If you stayed at the Parker Meridian before, this is not that property.  From what I understand, this is the former Viceroy, which already had poor reviews when it existed and the rooms have not gotten any better since then.  This could be a nice property, but it it needs a massive renovation of all rooms to get it there.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I can generally count on certain brands such as Hyatt and Marriott to provide consistently high quality.  However, my recent stay (February 2024) at Le Meridien in NYC (a Marriott Hotel), was the exception. This hotel is a disaster from the burnt out\/ flickering lights in the lobby to the dirty, dark and dank hotel rooms.  My hotel room was not only small, but was next to the elevator (VERY noisy) and was old and dirty (the carpet was stained and appears not to have been replaced in years and the bathroom was equally disgusting).  To make matters worse, no one informed me that there was major construction right across the street which started early in the morning and did not end until early evening and that the street in front of the hotel was dug up and there were metal plates in the road that made a very loud noise every time a bus or car ran over them throughout the night.  In short this hotel SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COST until Marriott invests in refurbishing the hotel to at least get it to a 3 star standard (it is no where close to that today).","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We got a general admission for roughly $170.\nFirstly when we arrived before the start time of 9pm we could see the management was all over the place with no structure at all\u2026 they had opportunity to start checking ID\u2019s and tickets before the 9 start time for smooth entry however, they didn\u2019t start this process until 9.15 so by the time they started slowly going through the line, most of us didn\u2019t get into the venue until 9.45, noting we were about 5th in line on the general admission side of the line. The drinks package was 9pm to 1am so we missed out on almost an hour of what we had paid for. \n\nThe event was completely overcrowded and we were packed in sardines. There was not enough bar staff but the ones they did have worked hard and were pretty quick at getting the drinks out. They did their best. There was also supposed to be a champagne toast at midnight however the champagne never reached us or anyone in our vicinity (I think I saw two people with champagne glasses at midnight). \n\nThe main huge disappointment was the issues with the 3 restrooms not meeting the needs of the amount of people on the venue. 3 individual restrooms for I would estimate at least 250 people and no separate male and female restroom. At 10.00pm there was already a 30 minute wait which got to be about a 45 min wait by 11.00pm which only got longer. This is a health and safety issue.  When we asked if there were any other options we were met with staff pretending it was their first day to avoid dealing with our concerns. The other issue was the line for the restroom went straight though the dance floor and onto the bar line (what a joke). The man managing the restroom had no sense of urgency to get people moving and people took ages in the toilet making the wait even longer. With no options of other restrooms or any urgency to hurry people up, people were forced to hold on and wait. Other disapointments\/misleading information was that the event said there would be a view of Central Park and the fireworks\u2026 the view was a construction site of new high rise building being built directly in front and a slither of the east side of the park with zero view of the fireworks (what a joke). The event also stated there would be \u2018house classics\u2019 with what the Dj would play\u2026 I heard none, with most of it being very average which was reflected by the lack of people on the dance floor (which was also due to the restroom line being so long)! The dance floor was literally empty. Overall the event was not worth the price, had misleading information on what it would deliver and left my bladder in a state of anxiety.  We were extremely disappointed.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Disappointed doesn\u2019t begin to describe my feelings.  Was it livable? Yes!  Was it exceptional?  Not by a long-shot.  It is obvious the negativity stems from the MANAGEMENT at the top.  The entire staff seems so terribly disenchanted with having to be there, and that is usually a sign that MANAGEMENT has made them feel that way.  To begin with the front of the hotel looks nothing like the picture on their website or the picture on the Marriott website.  Marriott has this hotel listed with a restaurant and that is not the case, it\u2019s more like a Caf\u00e9 lunch counter.  So very misleading.  We stopped in to the cocktail lounge to have a nightcap, and when I ask for directions to the restroom I was directed down the stairs to a dungeon type room that had unisex bathrooms, and only one had a door that would lock, and only one had a light that would come on.  Marriott has also listed this hotel with a gift shop, which is not the case.  I asked to have my down feather pillows switched out for hypoallergenic pillows, and we were the recipients of the tiniest pillows I\u2019ve ever seen.  This is a very old and tired property.  It makes me wonder that with the construction site across the street erecting a 30 story building that will block the view of Central Park\u2026 if perhaps Management has put the skids on putting any more money into the hotel.  To strengthen that suspicion upon exiting the hotel on an extremely rainy day, I asked the hotel for a complementary umbrella, and I was told that MANAGEMENT has basically eliminated that part of their customer service.  I do want to applaud the young woman who checked us in for letting us check in early and the help received from the Concierge was equally appreciated.  It\u2019s very sad to see a hotel that is comfortable charging such outrageous prices for such minimal delivery.

She said it was full and the hotel is 10 years old and has never been updated.  It looks way older than 10 years old. What she basically told me is all the rooms are bad.  I was going to check out and move next door to The Thompson which is way nicer and has entrances of 56th and 57th (I used them) but I dedided to just stay because I didn\u2019t want to waste any time. \n\nWhere do I begin.  The room is so tiny.  It felt like a cheap cruise stateroom or rundown hotel outside a train station in Europe. I thought the bed was comfy enough but my daughter disagrees.  Carpet is old, the furniture is not nice.  A closet or luggage rack would have been nice. The small cabinet part of the bed was useless.  We had 2 carry-on suitcases and I tripped over them a bunch because there is just no room. The bathroom is even worse.  There were 6 types of old marble.  They must have gotten a deal on it because it was every color, shape, and size.  Hideous. The design is not women friendly at all. I don\u2019t wash my hair everyday and you have to get wet to turn the shower on.  The mirror would be cool if shorter people were considered. The makeup mirror was so high, the bottom of it was at the top of my head.  Multiple times we thought a spider was in the shower. Nope, just the disintegrating grout.  The black toliet seat cover is not good.  It is old so I kept thinking something was on it. The bathroom was old and ugly but it was clean. \n\nThe lobby is small. Sometimes people were in it. Probably because the rooms are so small there is no where to sit.  The rooftop bar is an enigma.  They had \u201csupply issues\u201d so it was closed for breakfast. I tried to go at 10:45pm and it was closed even though I was told it closed at 11.  I got the free breakfast for Titanium rewards members which they hosted downstairs. Just skip it.  Continental was so limited. I ended up ordering eggs that I had to pay for.  I had to ask for salt and pepper 3 times.  They also don\u2019t offer green tea.

An occasional door opening when we got back to the hotel. The cleaning staff was always friendly and the room and hotel is clean.  As a Titanium rewards member, you would think they would do something nice to make up for the fact hotel is a disappointment.  No upgrades here.  I was on a lower level with a terrible view.   Fine service is not good enough. \n\nThere are so many nice hotels. Please do not make the mistake I made. Pick any other option.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our primary reason for staying at Le Meridien was its proximity to Carnegie Hall (it's on the same block) where we would be attending a performance. The secondary reason was that the hotel was a block away from Central Park - thus giving us a chance to take a break from all the buildings, skyscrapers, and busy streets of Manhattan.\n\nOur stay at the hotel was very pleasant. I had called prior to our visit and the concierge addressed my questions and even emailed me for further assistance. The minor issues we had with the room during our stay were addressed very quickly. Staff was friendly and professional. The hotel is in between two major subway stops so very convenient to travel around the city and the staff was very helpful in grabbing us a cab when needed.\n\nWhat really made our stay at Le Meridien wonderful was how accommodating they were. We arrived at 8am in NYC. Instead of having to wait till the standard check in time, because rooms were available, they checked us in right away, allowing us to rest for a bit before starting our first day of sight seeing in Manhattan.\n\nWhat made our stay at Le Meridien outstanding was after we checked out. We had inadvertently left behind some valuables in the safe in the hotel room. We were so thankful to the hotel staff that all of the valuables were accounted for. They arranged for overnight delivery by mail.\n\nI would highly recommend staying at Le Meridien where you won't be sharing the hotel with hundreds of other tourists and where you will receive service with integrity.

We arrived from the airport past 5 PM, they told us that our room was not ready because the previous guests were frequent travelers and had the right to late check out. That was crazy enough, nevertheless we left to give them time. When we came back two hours later, our room was still not ready. We went for dinner and at 10:30 PM we were finally able to check in. The sofa bed was not made, nothing to make it in the closet, not enough towels. \nWe book 4 nights. On the second day, we left in the morning and we came back at around 5PM, the room was not service.

So I decided to go downstairs and talk to the manager. I do not know if the person I talked to was the manager or another employee, he did not introduce himself properly and lacked or kind of skills for the job since, instead of give me an apology after I told him all the inconveniences, he started to justify every single issue. Here is when it gets crazier, he said that they can not know when other guests are checking out when they have the privilege for a late check out , that normally they do not prepare the sofa beds for a 3rd guest or have the bedding and that you always have to call and ask. BUT then to justify that the room was not serviced, he said that they do it every other day. Is asked if this was stated on the website because I did not see it there, like I did not see anywhere where it says that after 4PM you might not have the right to check in if somebody else decides to do a late check out. He kept trying to convince me that not service the hotel every day is a common practice in all Marriotts. Again it is not what it says on the website. \nWhen I was leaving more upset than before, I looked back and he was laughing with one of the front desk employees.

The person at the desk said that if she were not alone she would have brought them up immediately, and I believed her-she was very accommodating. 3) no breakfast on Thanksgiving morning. 4) On Saturday, there was a free buffet that was kind of like a lower-level Marriott property would have.  5) heater was awful! Initially, it would not heat, and we had engineering come up. They told us to crank it up to 78!!

My spouse had open heart surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital.\nAfter a few google searches, we ran into this excellent hotel's website and decided to book a suite. It ended up being the best decision we made. \nFrom the moment we arrived, we knew it was the right place to be. A smiling Rafael greeted us at the Valet. Mutabi bell staff (I hope I'm spelling his name correctly), with such grace, helped us to bring our luggage up to the room. Both (Rafael & Mutabi) happened to be the same team who helped us during our departure. \nAt the front desk, Melissa was cordial and pleasant and made us feel she cared.\nShe has the perfect attitude to be part of the front office team. The same about Vijay and Brian; they went above and beyond to make our stay very comfortable.\nI saw at least four or five different housekeepers and housemen who cleaned our room. I remember one name, Jeff. They all did a fantastic job. They were very attentive and with an exceptional eye for detail. \nI cannot forget about Will from Maintenance. The day my spouse was discharged from the hospital, the AC unit in the room stopped working, and the room temperature was 75\u00b0. Will came to the room immediately and worked on it; not only was he able to fix the unit, but he was constantly checking and ensuring that the AC was still working. Last but not least, your Director of Front Office, Yolanda Garcia. Once she learned that someone in our room was ill, she called to ensure we had everything needed to be comfortable. That human factor is so important today. \nI could keep writing about our experience, but I don't want to write a book (it already looks like one). \nI know how difficult it has been for hospitality during these terrible times. The General Manager should be very proud of the culture she\/he has created with the team members.

I checked out, and was on my way to the airport for a 4 hour delay followed by the inevitable cancelled flight. As the flight delays progressed, I started looking for a room because I was skeptical the flight would still make it out. It was graduation week and there was almost nothing available, including the Le Meridien being sold out. I decided to take a chance and call the hotel - and to my utter delight, after speaking with a few kind employees, they were able to find me a room - for a great rate- and even upgraded me to a suite! I was fortunate enough to interact with these individuals when my flight was cancelled and I finally made my way back to the city and hotel.

I actually stayed here twice in the same week as I had an overnight stay at the Courtyard in Poughkeepsie. In all honesty, I have to agree with some of the reviews that the hotel is a bit dark as many have reported. For example, the bathrooms in the lower level are the almost a total blackout..not cool. But the libby is bright and inviting. The rooms are a bit worn and the walls are painted a dark blue. My room had a few pieces of modern art on them but the other walls had large shelves with books..that is art in my opinion. Both of my rooms had brass fixtures and marble floors and tile. The towels were very white and fluffy and the bathroom amenities were very nice and generous. I did not have any issue with noise in the hotel..but it was loud outside. It is New York after all. I will say that my room despite being worn was immaculate and I am super picky. (This is something that the Marquise should be paying attention to.) I have to say, please take advantage of the free water and espresso service because for some reason the coffee in the hotel restaurant is pretty yucky.\nMy shout outs to this property is their staff. From the valet\/ Bellman to the front desk associates including the concierge, it was nothing less than stellar. Clearly they make service their priority and they certainly were there for me when I accidentally left my phone in an UBER, needed to store my luggage, and FedEx a few boxes.

I was pleasantly shocked that the hotel had a room ready for me! The rooms are tiny (common in NY), but very clean and modern. They are designed so well to fit everything into such a small space. Bathroom was gorgeous with brass hardware and intricate tile work. \nHotel itself is so nice. There is a nice wine store across the street, a gourmet market two doors up the sidewalk, and a drug store on the corner. It's in such a great area of the city to easily get almost anywhere by subway or cab. It feels very discrete and trendy--refreshing change from that sterile vibe of many NYC mega-hotels. Rooftop bar with city views was a great treat in the evening. I'm not sure if the bar is actually associated with the hotel, but the service was fantastic. Bartender proactively comped one of our drinks when there was a billing error on their end.

On the plus side, the water pressure was decent and the bed was comfortable enough, although quite low to the ground. There was next to no closet space if you want to hang things for your trip.

For one night we had a European King, that was to say was cozy. We were only there for a night and it was fine.  \n\nFor the other 5 nights I spoke to the front desk before checking in and said the \u2018cozy\u2019 room was not going to work for my wife and I as we\u2019re on the road for 17 days, three different climates and lots of luggage. They confirmed a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite (I have titanium status with Marriott). When we tried to checkin at 4pm room wasn\u2019t ready yet. No worries, we had to be at Nordstroms to have a few suits tailored. We come back at 6pm room is still not ready, the front desk associate got the front desk manager since this was an issue as my wife and I had a dinner reservation at 7:15 and needed to get ready. The front desk manager immediately apologized and upgraded us to a Central Park suite.\n\nThe Central Park suite was in the low 20th floor and had a great view of the park. The room for 5 nights was perfect, it felt like an actual condo. We had a couch to watch TV at when we were home. The fridge was a great size and let us keep water, seltzers, and other beverages chilled. The living room gave me a place to change early in the mornings for my runs and to get ready for work without waking my wife. \n\nService was very good, a few nights we had extra water sent up and toiletries. There was one day where we never received housekeeping and it took over an hour to have towels sent up. But I chalk this up to a fluke as overall the staff was friendly and attentive. \nIt was supposed to rain one day and we called down for umbrellas, we needed two as my wife had to go to her office and I had to go to my respective office. The gentleman only said he had one, he said if he couldn\u2019t find another one he would give us his personal one for use during the day since he was working the full day tomorrow, just please return it when we were back. Now, that is service. Thankfully he was able to find another Le Meridien one so that wasn\u2019t an issue.\n\nThe gym on the C level was a good size and I rarely saw anyone else there, that may of been because I\u2019m typically there around 6AM. \n\nBell hops were excellent and had no issue with our seven bags.\n\nOverall the location can\u2019t be beat if you need to be in midtown. Only issue was the room was a bit dark, lights didn\u2019t seem strong enough, but that\u2019s minor in the grand scheme of things. Never tried the restaurant for breakfast or any other meal. Just as a heads up the rooftop is only open Friday and Saturdays currently.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We walked everywhere in Midtown within 30 mins\u2026Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th ave shopping, Broadway show, National History museum etc.. \n\nFront desk staff very friendly, complimentary continental breakfast of bagels, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juice and cereal each morning on their rooftop deck which is a great view looking uptown. I was there with my 10 yo and we could only go up there in the morning. No minors allowed up there after that. Free WiFi was a nice plus. \n\nRooms are NYC small, but for just the two of us, it was fine. Bathrooms are roomy\u2026huge shower! Large TV in bedroom. The beds very comfortable and lighting good around the room. The desk and other furniture a bit rundown and the mini fridge was subpar as it didn\u2019t keep much cold. Biggest complaint is the noise in the hallways. You hear every time a door is open and shut. We were on 22nd floor. The hall is small so only a few rooms in a round setup, but I felt as if I heard every door slam on the floor all day! Street noise not bad at all. From what I could tell, except for rooftop bar, there is no restaurant to eat at in hotel. That was fine with us bc we were out and about, but just FYI. No room service options etc.. \n\nI researched several hotels for our stay and I would say for the price and convenience, this was a good pick. Definitely suited our needs and I didn\u2019t expect it to be super fancy, but it was nice enough. Other notes for NYC currently: Definitely showed my vaccine card for all restaurants. I had an app that Colorado has, but they accept photos as well. Just easier to have it on phone than carry around card IMO\u2026although I brought it as backup. For my 10 yo, I had to show a negative covid test for Broadway show. We did the self-test that you can buy at many drugstores. Super easy and accepted..had to be done within 6 hours of the show start. We had no problem getting reservations for places to eat and tourist things which was kind of nice.

The design and decor here is downright stunning, and even for double or triple the price, I don't think I've ever stayed at a more beautiful hotel. It definitely has a boutique vibe, with an entry and lobby so narrow I missed it the first time walking to check in. And yes, the rooms are small, but they're so efficient and honestly, they felt large for New York standards (I know I've stayed at three other hotels in the area with rooms half the size). \n\nAnother thing I loved? They're dog friendly up to 100 lbs. And location-wise, this place can't be beat. Just a few blocks from Central Park, my dog and I enjoyed walking there every morning and night. And it was just far enough away from sights like Times Square that everything felt accessible but without all the grime and crowds. \n\nHotel staff did leave a bit to be desired. The shower in my room had a drainage issue that was only further complicated by staff miscommunications. And there was vomit in the hallway on my floor that had obviously been there a while based on the smell. Unfortunately, even I notified the front desk and it was cleaned, the smell remained for the rest of our stay.\n\nBut even with the few negatives we experienced, I can't imagine wanting to stay anywhere else in New York City.

We stayed at the Le Meridien hotel on 57th street in Manhattan.  We had a good experience.\n\nMany Marriott hotels in New York have been closed during the pandemic.  There are several logical reasons including the absence of tourists and business travelers.  Fortunately the Le Meridien is open.\n\nThey have plenty of protocols in place.  The confirming e-mail lets you know there are steps to follow if you came from a state with elevated Covoid-19 case numbers and are staying 24+ hours.  The elevator is restricted to two passengers (or one family) at a time.  Inside the elevator are two circles at diagonal corners where passengers stand.  The rooftop area is closed.  No coffee or minibar available in the room.  Curiously there were no washcloths in the bathroom.\n\nCombined with the masks, plexiglass barriers and masks, we felt very safe.\n\nThe staff is excellent.  They are friendly and accommodating.  They are genuinely glad guests are there.\n\nThe rooms have been remodeled during the pandemic.  They are on the smaller side, but it's an older building in the heart of Midtown Manhattan.  The bathrooms have been remodeled and quite elegant.\n\nAre there negatives?  A few, but they are minor.  The room next to us has a connecting door.  The person in the next room must have been talking loudly on his phone, because it sounded like he was standing at the foot of our bed!

I travel all the time and am a Marriott titanium elite member - not that this hotel cares.  First off, thought I had booked Le Parker M\u00e9ridien but it appears that in 2019 that it was bought by Hyatt and the le meridian moved next door into a hole in the wall building. There is basically no lobby, no lobby ba, no nothing. The staff isn\u2019t rude but they are insanely clueless and inattentive. I booked a one bedroom suite. The size of the room is the only nice thing I can say about this place. You can hear people showering when you are in the nasty hallway. The windows are so sold that it was like sleeping outdoors it was so cold.  They gave me two Rinky dinky towels for the entire suite.  Had nothing to dry off with in the morning. Most annoying thing was when I took the time to go through the room service menu to order breakfast and called down to order, they told me that menu doesn\u2019t exist anymore and I had a selection of a muffin or a muffin.  They told me it was because the restaurant is beiMy renovated. So I went downstairs and the restaurant is fully open. I asked if I could get breakfast to go for my room and they said no, it was 35 dollar buffet.  No thanks.  Went across street to get breakfast sandwich at a deli.  Normally the front desk always asks how your stay was when you check out but I can see why this front desk didn\u2019t ask.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

As it stands in January 2020, the property is definitely not at Le M\u00e9ridien\u2019s standards. However, I will absolutely return to this property when I am in New York.\n\nWhat makes this property incredible: The People\nEvery interaction that I had, from check-in, to getting acquainted, lobby staff interactions, bar \/ restaurant staff - the people are incredible. I felt like a valuable family member the entire time I was there, and that is the top memory that I carry from my first stay at this property.\n\nThe esthetics\nKnowing that the complete renovation is imminent, my opinions are very lenient on this point. The hard product is very worn, dark, and not at all what you expect from a Le M\u00e9ridien property. This will change, so give it a chance. Right now, the rooms feel awkward, dark, but still everything is very comfortable and I will stay here again even before renovations. Remember, this is New York City, spaces can be cramped so don\u2019t expect a bathroom the size of one that you might find in Atlanta or Miami for example. \n\nThe lobby has already been renovated so it is very warm and comfortable when you arrive, especially on those chilly and brisk New York winter days. Two elevators serve the 29 floors so waiting for a lift is very quick.\n\nIf you\u2019re staying here before the renovation - yes the rooms feel dark, the surfaces feel worn and old, but this will change soon.\n\nFood & Beverage\nThis was the biggest weakness for the Le M\u00e9ridien brand. Please note - I did not experience room service (maybe I should have, perhaps next time).\n\nThe restaurant off the lobby on the ground floor is called Kingside. As of January 2019 this restaurant is only available for breakfast. So I have not had a chance to try this space. Even being in the middle of Midtown New York, we need a full service restaurant at this property.\n\nOn the 29th floor, there is a very charming bar called Rooftop, and part of it is indoors and outdoors (during my stay the outdoor section was covered, and had heat lamps). \n\nThis is where I had my worst, most non-Le M\u00e9ridien experience.\n\nAgain I say, the people at Rooftop are incredible, very accommodating and warm. I learned my first night that the food & beverage management company had just recently changed, and here is the new menu. Two nights later, nothing on that menu is available. Instead, a very limited selection of food is offered (eg., olives, cheese & crackers, French fries, salmon toast), all which are very expensive. I ordered the cheese & crackers and the French fries which were completely unacceptable. The fries were soggy and limp, the cheese was served walk-in cold and just not good. \n\nI did have a very positive conversation with Juan, who rectified my invoice, and was very open to my feedback. I hope that the next time, there is an improvement.\n\nOverall : B-\nRoom: B\nFood & Bev: D+","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were disappointed.  \n\nThe pros are few: friendly staff and great location.  \n\nThe cons were the hotel itself and the breakfast.   \n\nThe hotel is outdated, dark, rundown, and needs renovation badly. See the photos.    It is like someone\u2019s den from the 70\u2019s with old furniture and outdated lighting that is not bright at all and makes the room feel cave-like. There is ugly brown carpet and stained wood furniture (I attached just one photo of the stained\/marked furniture, but took more than that). The desk is literally bolted to the floor.   The light fixtures are awful and provide little light.   The hallways are dark and dreary and look like a cheap hotel.  I have stayed in hotels in lower categories and had much nicer rooms and decor.  It is worth mentioning that the photos on the Marriott website, where I booked, made the rooms look light and bright.   They are not.\n\nWe booked a 1 bedroom suite with Central Park view.  Not sure what room Marriott took the central park view picture from, but we were on the 22nd floor and had the view in the photo attached.  There are 27 floors and I don\u2019t see how going up five floors higher or to the left or right gets the unobstructed view shown in Marriott\u2019s photo on their website.  (it was very foggy the day I took the photo, so not the best shot, but you can see that the view is buildings with Central Park visible beyond.) \n\nWe are Marriott members so had a special rate that included breakfast.   I would not recommend spending extra for the breakfast.   The cost of it is $35 per person and $15 for a child.  It is a buffet, so chafing dishes of scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and sausage.  Also cold cereals, bagels, bread to toast, fruit, and yogurt with granola.    Juice and coffee included.   Does it sound almost exactly like a free breakfast at a Residence Inn?   It is almost the same in selection and quality, but $35 per person.    Our rate to have breakfast included was $40 or $50 more versus a room rate without breakfast (can\u2019t recall exactly), so we weren\u2019t actually paying the $35 per person, but the breakfast was not worth the extra money.   Really disappointing considering we could have gone to a restaurant and had much better breakfast for less than what we paid.  \n\nIn sum, we would not stay here again and would t recommend to friends.   Marriott really needs to spend some money here!","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

And while that part of town is charming around the holidays, the surge pricing of hotels rooms is anything but... In the past years I've stayed at The London NYC, but since its being renovated, I was looking for something similar, in the same price range: homey, not corporate, charming and high-end.  From the website, Le Meridian seemed comparable, so I booked a room there for this year's trip and was totally disappointed.  Knowing we'd be arriving after midnight, I made sure there was a note in our reservation to hold our room and called twice beforehand to ensure it would be.  Of course, when we arrived at 1:30AM, our room had been given away and the only room available was the last one in the hotel - room 203 - which is unfit for guests.  It has two double beds (not queens) with ill-fitting sheets, no furniture, no alarm clock, no remote and hadn't been cleaned.  Ugh.  Just to add insult to injury, the people at the desk tried to convince me that this room was actually an upgrade (!!!) and charged $799 for the night ($200 more than the king room we had booked).  They knew they were putting lipstick on a pig.  We were moved to a king on a higher floor the next day.  And while that room was fine, it was tiny and the compressor for the heater kept having to be reset, so it was freezing.  The staff is friendly.  The lobby is lovely.  The Roof was closed for private parties every night we were there (second week of December, so understandable).  It's very convenient to where I have to be for work meetings.  The Art Deco vibe is charming in the common areas and maybe in the larger guest rooms, but the rooms we stayed in were old and dinky.   Next time I will stay at the Parker or the Park Central, which have more updated rooms and are a much better value.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I explained that it wasn\u2019t my birthday but he said they would do it anyway, that they would send a bottle of Prosecco to the room and asked which day I would want it. I gave a day. It was never received, which is fine, but I don\u2019t think hotel staff should make claims and not follow through. I also had SEVERAL issues with bell services. I checked in very early morning and had to store our luggage until our room was ready but the man at the desk tried to page them on a walkie talkie to come get the bags and they never came or responded. He had to send another staff member to get someone. We also never received any sort of notification that our room was ready that day. We came back late at night after being out all day. As I was at the front desk again collecting keys he tried to page bell services to retrieve our bags and they never responded. So I left the claim ticket and they said they would deliver them to the room. This was after midnight. It took over 30 minutes to deliver the luggage. I am not a complainer but I had to call the desk to ask about them because we needed them before we could go to sleep.

We opted not to stay with family at their 8th Ave and 14th St property, but instead made reservations at Le Meridien 57th St Central Park South.\n  I've been a Marriott brand property loyalist for the past 5 years.  As a consultant I spend approximately 72% of my time on travel in hotels, and I've come to expect quality service and impeccable accommodations from Marriott.\n  The Le Meridien New York, Central Park property was amazing.  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by professional staff eager to welcome us to the property.  Check-in was swift and efficient.  I've ambassador elite status, and was excited to have received a suite upgrade.  I had no idea what was in store for us.  As we entered the 27th floor suite, the massive glass windows filled the suite with brilliant sweeping Central Park Autumn foliage views.  Setting our bags down, we walked through the rooms to make note of the accommodations.  The suite was impressive.  The enlarged bedroom also offered panoramic views of Central Park.  The bedroom had a wall-mounted television, firm and comfortable mattress, as well as vintage designed features and fixtures. As we walked through the pocket doors into the bathroom foyer, dual sinks recessed into granite countertops finished with charming brass fixtures were to our left, walled off separate walk-in closet and toilet were to our front, and a massive open glass walled shower to our right.  The enormous bathroom space was filled with natural light from a raised porthole window.  The space allocated to the bathroom area by no means compromised any of the suite's vast living space.\n  Back in the main living space were vintage designed sofa and chairs, stools, tables, and lighting fixtures.  The space also featured a workspace, elevated buffet table, and a tailored minibar with complimentary and for purchase-items.  The kitchenette featured an enlarged bar sink, Illy coffee maker, and glass door mini-fridge.  The mini-fridge was stocked with non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages for purchase.\n  Every detail of the suite was carefully designed to give an eclectic feel but with modern amenities.  Taking it all in, we realized we weren't in a hotel, but rather an apartment tailored to provide a fashioned vintage experience.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't comment about \"The Roof\".  It's the Le Meridien's New York City rooftop lounge.  It too was impressive with sweeping views of Central Park and the surrounding skyline.  It featured outdoor (covered) and indoor lounge areas, comfortable seating, ambience, and was serviced by professional staff and populated with polite patrons.\n  In my opinion and experience staying at Marriott properties, I'd say the Le Meridien 57th St Central Park is my favorite.  It is not a cookie cutter property to house guests, but instead offered us an unparalleled quality of life and comfortable experience.  I would encourage anyone looking to feel at home in New York City to stay at the Le Meridien 57th St Central Park.  My wife and I will return.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel staff went out of their way to make sure the many marathoners on property felt encouraged and welcomed, which was nice. The only downside we found during our two night stay was the buffet breakfast at Kingside, the onsite restaurant. It was anemic: a couple of trays of pastries and bagels, a picked-over bowl of fruit (with those little fruit gnats buzzing around it) and a near empty at 8am chafing dish with standard eggs, potatoes, sausage, and bacon. Nothing fancy or special - and entirely adequate for a reasonable price. $30 per person is not a reasonable price for scrambled eggs and potatoes, even in NYC.

I picked it for a couple of reasons but mostly because of the decor and fantastic views of Central Park. When the property was bought out by the Marriott and became the Le Meridien, they transitioned everything over seamlessly and honored our reservations, as well as the hotel block and group rate. When I had toured the property as the Viceroy, I was shown the rooftop bar and deck which has amazing views of Central Park. I really wanted photos on our wedding day from here capturing the city. I later found out that the rooftop is separately owned\/operated and I received a little bit of a hard time gaining access for photos. The staff at the Le Meridien still made sure my request was taken care of and organized roof access for me to have photos taken up there (Thank you Tyler!). The front desk employees were incredibly nice, friendly, helpful and accommodating. Overall, everyone at the hotel really did everything to make sure I was taken care of on our special day. We also ate at the Kingside restaurant in the lobby. We were pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. I stayed in the penthouse suite which was insanely gorgeous. Probably the nicest hotel room I have ever been in. I did have family and friends in king and double rooms, which were also nice for a standard room. Yes the rooms are on the smaller side, but welcome to New York. Everything in New York is on the smaller side.

Come to find out, a few years ago the hotel was divided in the middle of the two blocks, with the 57th street part of it becoming Le Meridien, a Marriott hotel, and the 56th St part of it becoming the Parker Hotel, a Hyatt property.   Must be that all the good rooms ended in the Parker Hotel, because from our own experience (and the other reviews posted on Tripadvorr) I would venture that there are no good rooms on the Le Meridien side of the former Parker Meridien.   Now we paid using Marriott points, but when I checked the price on the web for Saturday,Oct 12, it was a little over $600, and if I had paid that for this little enclosure with poor water pressure, I might have ended up jail.   Next time we'll try the Parker, so check back for my posts in a few months for a comparison.  \n\nThe plus-es:  Terrific location, half a block from Carnegie Hall,  and a very nice staff.\nA big negative:  No business center or computers available to guests.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Front desk mgr, Kyle Kitchen immediately took responsibility to ensure we had the best possible experience and he did not disappoint!

Every single person we interacted with during our stay was friendly and professional. We will definitely visit this property again. If you\u2019ve seen some of the questionable reviews from recent months, please know these were probably just from the growing pains of the recent ownership change.

Upon our arrival we were told that we could valet park our car for a fee of $75 per night with no re entry privileges, that means that every time you use your car you pay additional $75. Nobody told us that we could self park at the same (close) garage for a lower amount. Aside from that, our stay was very comfortable, and I would highly recommend it also for families and small groups. Rooms come with a mini fridge, 1 free bottle of water daily and complimentary espresso machine with pods.

They did end up placing me on a higher floor after the fact, which was odd because I didn't follow up or push it at all. Maybe a change of heart?\n\nThis is def not one of the better Meridiens, that's for sure. It reminded me of a motel 6 with a great location. Some coworkers stayed in the W (similar brand, also Bonvoy) and had 0 complaints.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Great Hotel, great location, great staff, great service.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I stayed at Le Meridien for three weeks, and I miss it. The staff was friendly, and the location was incredible. Only a few steps from Central park, and pretty much everything else. Even a nice 24 hour grocery store only 20 ft away that has everything you could imagine. The hotel also has one the most popular rooftop bars in NYC, with incredible views of Central Park. They had a DJ for the people inside most nights, but still had an option to relax and drink in the open air rooftop portion as well. The hotel restaurant is also a real hot spot, with great food and service. The hostess even remembered that I had a little three year old back home and wished me a happy fathers day when I came down for dinner. A couple of nights, the restaurant held some blockbuster movie premiers. One was for \"The Dead Don't Die' movie and I got to run into Selena Gomez and a couple others. The rooms are very unique and upscale regal feel. My room had wood floor, brass fittings, walk-in marble tile shower, and the coolest bathroom mirror I've seen in a hotel (a second mirror is on a bracket and swings around to view all angles). Since converting from Viceroy, they also have a new sales staff that's top notch. I met Mirian, the new Director of Sales, and I could tell she really cares for the hotel and puts in a lot of effort into making the events, and guests, feel as welcome as possible. I would see in the lobby some mornings greeting all the guests coming and going.  The housekeepers were also some of the best I've experienced. The GM is quite a character too. With the new staff, the Le Meridien flag, and the Marriott brand backing them, this hotel is a no brainer. Again, I miss it and hope to go back sometime.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The stay in Le Merridian was the worst experience with the hotel misplacing  8 pieces of my expensive shirts\/ trousers\/ t shirt which I had given for laundry. The response of the hotel staff was very disgusting to say the least as they lacked both accountability and responsiveness. The staff changed the narrative multiple times and what was promised to be delivered in 24 hours is yet to be found after 72 hours. As someone who is on a road show and travelling to multiple cities in the next 10 days, the behaviour by the hotel has put me in quite a distress.

Nope - that hotel, now known as the Parker New York, is now in the Hyatt family and confusingly is right next door to the \"new\" Le Meridien New York, formerly the Viceroy. (I should have known the price was too good to be true for that hotel.)\n\nNow for the good part - we received a small upgrade to a room with a terrace, a low floor so no park view, but any NYC view is kind of fun. The room was \"cozy\" as booked, clean with new carpet, full of slightly worn but interesting art Deco wood furnishings and tiled bathroom, both of which add character and I hope are to be refreshed but not replaced. (Dear hotel - consider some leather mats to cover the scuffed end table and desk.). Air conditioning looked new, and worked great. Reception (VJ especially)was friendly, helpful, and extended our check out an hour to have breakfast. (Kingside was fine for breakfast, and also check out the roof bar for its views, although it might be crowded.)\n\nSome nits - found an empty a water bottle on the terrace. Used the app to try to get more towels and got no response after 2 hours, but a call was answered and towels delivered promptly. \n\nSo, not the hotel we expected, but warm, courteous, clean if a bit worn, and right now at a price point tough to match in this neighborhood. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}
