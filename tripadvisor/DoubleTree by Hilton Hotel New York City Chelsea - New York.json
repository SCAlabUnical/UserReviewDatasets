I came in for a concert and was able to walk to and from Madison Square Garden with zero issues. It was also a relatively easy walk to Times Square and to multiple subway stops.\n\nThe room was clean, well-kept, and modern.

There are only a few rooms on each floor, and so you\u2019re never truly far from the elevator. My room was immediately next to the elevator shaft and there was noise from the elevators as a result. However, I never found it to be disturbing, and it never woke me up or prevented me from sleeping. It was just sort of background noise \u2014 same with the city noise. I was on the 23rd floor and still heard city noise, but it didn\u2019t bother me!\n\nI ordered desserts via room service and breakfast via room service as well. Everything was fantastic!

Reading some of the other reviews, I'm somewhat baffled as I've not experienced many of the issues mentioned.  I've also stayed in quite a few other hotels both in this area and around the city in my years of regular travel to the city.\n\n*Waiting for an elevator is a normal occurrence in a hotel this size - I've never waited for more than 3 to 5 minutes at this hotel, and that's just during peak times. Also, I've never had to go down to the basement go back up (as one review said). If the elevator is heading down and you board it, then yes, it will go down first and then back up, just as any elevator would.\n*Wear and Tear - Yes this facility has seen some use and everything isn't pristine new. However, any functional issues I've experienced have been quickly met by the staff with a good attitude and never have I seen any mold issues in the bathrooms, air units, etc... and I always look as I'm very sensitive to mold!\n*Beds and pillows are comfortable.  I like my bed at home better, but never had an issue sleeping.\n*Closets - Closet space is small as NYC rooms are small and there isn't a lot of extra space, but I've never had a problem hanging up a week's worth of business clothes.\n*Noise - If you're not a really heavy sleeper, I recommend getting a white-noise machine for ANY HOTEL in NYC as there will always be noise from the streets, etc... .  I usually do have a room that adjoins the elevator shaft, so I do hear a little noise from it (not loud) and the white noise machine will drown that out no problem (along with sirens, etc..).\n*Restaurant - I often eat in the restaurant simply out of convenience and it's included in my stay. It's a good, basic hotel restaurant.  Staff is friendly and courteous. Food is decent.  \n*Cleanliness - Never seen major issues with cleanliness. Yes, sometime the lobby gets trash on the floor when large groups come in or during periods of heavy foot traffic, but the staff cleans it multiple times a day (I've witnessed this).\n*Location - It's a relatively quiet, safe location with plenty of restaurants and subway stops all within a few blocks.  I don't mind bringing my family with me to this hotel as I feel they will be safe.\n\nOverall, I will continue to be a regular guest at this hotel and find it to be a great option at a stellar price point compared to others in the area.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was seriuously an issue - we were burning 5-15 minutes waiting for an elevator whether or not we were going up or coming down. Not something you expect at a modern hotel. Finally at check out, there was a restaurant charge on my bill that wasn't mine.

Room is extremely small, which I guess is somewhat expected but it became unbearable after a few days. Hallways are narrow too. Overall it felt very suffocating. Luckily we moved onto another hotel after 4 days so managed to salvage our sanity. Fortunately you're not in the room much but when we were, the 4 of us were constantly knocking into one another or the furniture. Staff were unpleasant and seemed like they didn't want to be there. Service levels were pretty appalling. They have 2 elevators, one of which was out of order for our first 2 nights, which meant there was one old clunky elevator for the entire hotel. Staff were using this too and you can comdortably fit 4-5 people in at one time. There would be a queue to use the elevator on most days. We often had to wait 10-15mins to get up or down as we were on the 16th floor. Often times we would walk down the stairs but with a toddler and stroller, it wasn't the easiest. Especially as the staircase was pretty tight. Housekeeping didn't bother to tidy the room even when we didn't have the DND sign up. When you contacted housekeeping or front desk for help, they were rude and abrasive and requests would take several chase ups to get what you needed. Super noisy AC unit which was incredibly dirty. Cleanliness wasn't a strong point either. Bathroom super compact, basin was the smallest I've ever seen\/used in a hotel. Not enough space to put our Toiletries. Windows are not soundproof so you can hear everything going on outside at all times, which meant we were often woken to the sound of binmen or sirens.

Maybe I expected more from the Hilton brand, but while there was nothing wrong as such with the hotel, there was also nothing particularly special or distinctive - I preferred other places in NYC over this one. It just all felt a bit dated, & no real feel of comfort or semi-luxury as the TV adverts suggest.\n\nIt is close to Penn Station, maybe a 10-minute walk, so is good for public transport around the city, as well as arriving from JFK airport by the subway or LIRR.\n\nThe room was ok, standard NYC size really (room for the bed & not much else). There was a (very noisy) air conditioner, a decent-sized TV (but which took us a while to work - the TV guide is a channel rather than a separate feature, which it took us a while to work out!). There was a fridge, but it seemed to be a repurposed mini-bar, so not much room to actually keep much in it! The bathroom was very compact, barely enough space around the sink to wash, with a tiny old bathtub, with a showerhead in it - again, nothing wrong with it, just a bit old-fashioned compared to offerings elsewhere. Windows were not particularly soundproof so we were disturbed when bin lorries came in the night - not the fault of the hotel when the services come, but soundproofing improvements would probably be welcomed by guests as & when it becomes possible. Same issue with the door - our room was near the lift doors so we heard a bit of noise as other people on the floor came & went, although we didn't have any problems with noise through the walls.\n\nService was ok. We arrived quite late at night (after 10pm) due to delays in travel & check-in was a bit perfunctory - I heard later than cookies were usually offered to guests, but we didn't get any offered at check-in, or at any time after. We had breakfast at the hotel a few times as it was included in our rate, but didn't bother the rest of the time as it was nothing special - plate ordering rather than a buffet, & an $18 limit per day per guest, which with tax only covered a few of the dishes on the menu, otherwise you'd be liable for the excess (which for me is not quite 'breakfast included', as such). They did store our luggage for a few hours until it was time to head to the airport though, which was appreciated.\n\nSo basically, it was fine as somewhere to stay, but wasn't the best - the experience was not sufficiently impressive to win me over as a Doubletree by Hilton fan, anyway, & would not particularly look to stay here again if there was a similarly-priced option nearby.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The 2 bookings were made seperately & at different times, the 1st lot was paid for prior to arrival the 2nd lot to be paid on arrival when due.  we rung Hilton customer help and advised we had 2 bookings and if possible could we keep the same room for both the stays.  On arrival this confused her immensely then she wanted $ for security reasons then she said we had to checkin & checkout between stays, there was a man hovering around the wonderful Blake.   He had it all sorted in a wink, said we could keep the same room just had to get the keys for that room remade for the 2nd stay.  He could see $688.76 was paid for the first stay, and that $960.96 was owing for the 2nd stay.  So on the 25th we went down to the lobby and got Kimana again, we were going to \"exchange\" keys for the room I did at that time tell her not to be so very rude which she ignored.  She couldn't cope with something on the computer wanted us to pay more $, and was just foul so I took the key back and joined the line for Blake.  Blake sorted the issue out for her, told her to exchange the keys.  I said to her do you want me to pay for the 2nd stay now I have my card, it is different to the first card used for the first booking.  She said no you can pay for it at the end when you check out just tell them it is a different card you will be using.  I said thanks we left.  At no time did she say thanks or please.  You are extremely lucky to have Blake (and George & Gladys) at your hotel.

So I ring for Blake and get her he was out.  Then he was busy.  So I went down and explained the situation to Blake, he could see that had been done, so he took our 2nd credit card for the 2nd stay and ENTERED THE AMOUNT AS PENDING AND HE THEN PUT THRU A REFUND\/CREDIT FOR THE FIRST CREDIT CARD WHICH DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY LEFT ON IT WHICH WAS WHY IT WASN'T BEING USED.  HOWEVER THIS WAS 4.00PM Friday by then and too late.  SO WE ARE IN THE POSITION NOT OF OUR OWN FAULT OF BEING OVER ON OUR CREDIT CARD AND FACING CHARGES.  OF BOTH CREDIT CARDS BEING USED FOR THE SAME BOOKING.  And this was deliberately done by Kimana.  We now have very little money left for the remainder of our stay in New York while we wait for Blakes credit to reverse a charge that should never have been made, that she did in spite at not being able to do her job efficiently.  I also spoke to Chris about this on Saturday 27\/8 he said he could see both charges on 2 seperate cards and the credit that Blake had put thru at 4.00pm Friday and there was nothing further he could do as it was the wkend.  I would really have like to give you a zero but you don't include that, and that wouldn't reflect fairly for Blake, George and Gladys.  But I won't be in a hurry to return to USA and use Hilton again.  We had paid in advance for the first 2 nite stay, she charged us NOT PENDING for the next 4 days stay on the first day of that stay and then Blake put a pending thru for the stay also.  And that was deliberate after I told her we would use a different credit card and she said just tell them at check out time, and then she went and charged us.  You asked for feedback there it is, a very sour experience due to 1 person.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Upon check-in, we were greeted by Blake. He let us check-in early which was fabulous because New York City was in the middle of a severe heat wave! He let us pick our room which was on the 10th floor and we had a nice view of the Empire State Building! My 15 year old niece was super happy about that! Blake also gave us great suggestions on things to do that I never thought of! One was to take the Ferry offered by NYC around the East River to see great views of Manhattan and Brooklyn and you can even see the Statue of Liberty. For three people, it was $18 round trip! It was such a great cruise! \nOur room was great! Nice and clean and we even had a cute little fridge which was great to store our water in because it was so hot! No big issues with the room or the view! It was great! \n\nWe arrived back at the hotel and due to the heat, I became very overheated. As I went upstairs to the room to lay down, my sister went to the front desk to ask where we could get a Gatorade for me. She was helped by Wesay the front desk attendant. Wesay told my sister to sit tight and she would be right back. She ran to the store around the corner and purchased me a Gatorade so that I would be OK! I\u2019ve stayed at a lot of hotels and have never had this level of service! It was just so kind and thoughtful and we were eternally grateful for her quick thinking and desire to go above and beyond! \n\nWhen it came time to check out, I was honestly sad to be leaving! We had such a nice time and I would recommend this hotel to anyone! The location is perfect being in the Chelsea neighborhood and close to NY Penn Station and Moynihan Station for Amtrak. There\u2019s lots of local places to eat that were great! The rooms in the hotel are not huge\u2026 keep in mind in New York City, most rooms are small. But this hotel has something for everyone! Fresh water when you come in and warm chocolate chip cookies! \n\nA big thank you again to Blake and Wesay!

I love the DoubleTree. As a matter of fact, if I was a spokeswoman for the hotel and it\u2019s cookies, their profits would triple. That being said, don\u2019t allow anything or anyone to ruin your stay......unless it\u2019s a flea or bedbug.\n\n#1 Regardless of how you reserved your accommodations, guests should be treated exactly according to their mission statement. The problem is, staff forget what that is Connie and Swapna. Upon arrival with a very busy foyer, my family and I were greeted by Connie, she confirmed our reservation and our amenities, so we thought. The room was without refrigeration or a microwave. We had a 5 month old baby with us. We had an unpleasant view of the backside of neighboring hotels and the lower maintenance area of our hotel. As an Hilton Honors member, she confirmed our free breakfast yet we got charged when we went to eat. The food was so bad we couldn\u2019t even eat and left the food. When I addressed this at the front desk, I was rudely and loudly denied that we had free breakfast with again a crowded foyer. The kicker was several people had no problem open mouth coughing and sneezing without regard to children, babies, otherwise healthy guest, and the open display of hot and cold food. Hello Coronavirus.\n\n#2 Our beds were very uncomfortable, which is surprising. The sheets and comforters were very stiff and rough. In the morning, my daughter had large bite marks around her ankles and my granddaughter had red marks on her hands. We thought maybe while she was having tummy time on her blanket on the floor that somehow she hit her hand. The problem came when the little black spots showed up. We thought they were scabs. I got a tweezer to make sure and after trying to gently investigate it, as I finally was able to move the first one, the darn thing jumped, right into my daughter\u2019s plate. We got a napkin to hold it down to make sure it was actually a bug of some sort. When I tried to grab it again with the tweezers it jumped again. It was obviously trying to burrow itself in my granddaughters hand. Once we realized what we were dealing with, we notified management. Regardless of a different room, we got no sleep prior to our morning departure.\n\n#3 Room service. We spoke with the housekeeper specifically. After a long day out and around Manhattan, we returned to half the room being serviced. My sheets merely had the comforter thrown over it and tucked in, my daughters bed wasn\u2019t touched and the trash was left at the door. Really! Why did you even come in?\n\nIn a metropolis where you can pick anywhere to stay, we chose DoubleTree because their past hospitality was bar none. This was my first time back home to my roots since childhood. Where you choose to rest your head to refresh yourself after a long day should be a compliment to any establishment.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1214829,"title":"Good hotel in good place","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-03-01","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My wife and I wanted to visit New York and we were searching for nice hotel with moderate prices in good localization. Thanks to TripAdvisor \/ GoogleMaps, we picked DoubleTree by Hilton in Chelsea. When we arrived, it was hard for us to find the entrance, it's a little bit hidden, without any big brand logos. Before coming to USA, I bought some dollars to have nice exchange rate. However during check-in, it was a problem to pay by debit card or cash for hotel stay. Because we were tired after 11 hours of flight, I said to use credit card for  entire bill. So it's not possible to give credit card for additional expenses and pay for stay in another way... that way I lost on poor exchange rate on credit card. At least we received, as usually in DoubleTrees, cookies. \n\nWe received room on 20th floor. It was huge enough with big bed - so comfy! There are many places for clothes and other things. Big TV screen with cable TV - super cool! Internet bandwidth was very good, no problems for video calls or Netflix. Bathroom contains bath (not shower). Many places for hanging additional towels. There are two electro sockets. In bedroom, there were at least 4 or 5 electro sockets with additional USB sockets. There is in-room safe but our was broken. I was able to close it and then open it without entering code. But it wasn't problem for us so I didn't make a complain about it.\n\nOne thing must be added about room. Cleanliness. I was in many places around the world and cleaning service was always a problem. Here, my wife was cleaning common places like tv remote control or table with antibacterial tissue and it was white clean! Huge congrats for such a perfect cleaning service.\n\nFrom my point of view the biggest advantage of the hotel is location. Hotel is located near PennStation (5min walk), Macy's (10min walk) and TimesSquare (15min walk). Subway station (28th St Line1) is just around the corner. We were walking till late hours and there was no issue with safety.\n\nAbout restaurant I cannot say anything because we didn't try breakfast nor dinner. About breakfast we decided to eat like a local because groceries were everywhere like Walgreens, Target or Duane Reade stores. Dinners we were eating at the city. In room there is small fridge. Huge plus also for coffee machine. Coffee beans (capsules) were refilled every day. \n\nIn afternoon there is hot coffee or chocolate free for guests. \n\nBefore coming to DoubleTree, I was afraid about the elevator issue that some people wrote. Unfortunately I can admit that it's really a problem. Elevators are so slow, stops so frequently. During our stay, only once elevators (both 2) were broken. There was a need to use stairs for 20 floors. Fortunately it was fixed quickly.\n\nDuring the last evening, we had an occasion to check hotel maintenance service. Something happened and water was pouring down on our heads. After two minutes, hotel crew member came to us and fixed the problem. Huge thanks for that!\n\nTo sum up, it was our first stay in New York. What's more, it was our first trip to USA ever. Picking DoubleTree hotel for Valentine's Day period in NYC was a perfect choice. Price-quality ratio, localization, hotel crew, cleaning staff - everything that made our stay unforgettable. \n\nWill I recommend the hotel? Of course. Will I return? For sure!","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The location is wonderful and convenient. Unfortunately, that is the positive part of the stay. \n\nThere are 26 floors in this hotel and two elevators. I would suggest you ask to stay on the lowest floor possible, we ended up using the stairs everyday at least once a day. This is problematic when you have luggage and are checking out. The only way we could get our luggage downstairs, from the 14th floor, was to catch the elevator going up and then ride it down to the lobby. Not terrible, but having to use the stairs to get down to the lobby every day was annoying. \n\nThe staff was not attentive and they did not try to be helpful. We were told we couldn't change the bill, so that my friend and I could split the room charges, without a manager. There was never a manager available and finally someone told us that we didn't actually need a manager. They are not interested in providing quick service at the front desk and do not ask for anything to be delivered to your room outside of room service. We requested our dry cleaning be returned and they did not have anyone to deliver these items so we had to use the stairs to go down to the lobby to retrieve it. When we requested additional blankets housekeeping was not available. There is always a line at the front desk and often there is only one person working. If you need to speak to someone you will need to wait, I think they are not staffed appropriately. Large groups of people stay at this hotel so you may also find the small lobby stuffed with luggage that needs to be stored.\n\nThe rooms are small but not unusually so for New York. The rooms were clean and the location is good so if you do not mind the inconvience of using the stairs everyday (or can book a room on a low floor) and rude staff this may work for you.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I\u2019ve been on to the bank, the hotel keep chip & pin details from the security deposit you pay upon check in ($50 a night) which you are supposed to get back after 3 days from check out.

This made her feel just as special as I do when I visit.\n\nA special \u2018shout out\u2019 to Brittany at the front desk.  We asked if she could make some recommendations of sites to see that are accessible from the nearby subway station.  When we got back from breakfast, she presented us a handwritten list of sites along with the specific trains to take.  She exceeded our expectations when we made this inquiry and were extremely appreciative of taking the time to do this.\n\nAll staff members wanted to ensure we had to best possible experience during our stay.  It started with breakfast where Aracelis and Kayti worked.  I shared with their manager Tammy how much we appreciated both ladies.  The front desk staff that included Sheledine, Christopher, Venus, Sianna and others that were relatively new all cheerfully greeted us as we went through that area.  I made sure Musa was aware of the great job they did.  Building services staff members Martin and Christopher were also helpful if we had questions.  I can never forget Duane and Harrington who always greeted us with a smile and asked how we were doing.  That really meant a lot to both of us being southerners.  There were MANY other folks whose names I regretfully don\u2019t remember but were instrumental in ensuring we had a great visit.\n\nGeneral comments I would make is with respect to the recent room upgrades.  I would \u2018suggest\u2019 they reconsider placing slightly larger refrigerators in the rooms.  Also given the new height of the closet, one can no longer store luggage on top of it.  Lastly I would suggest they consider a microwave in a common area near the restaurant.  This would be helpful for heating up leftovers as some of us try to save on food expenses.\n\nI definitely recommend this property for those visiting NYC and welcome being treated like a family member that had not been seen in a while.  Thanks to the Doubletree Chelsea for the great training program they obviously have in place for their staff members.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was told that I should go around the block and park it myself. Not a big deal, just not what I expected or was sold.\n\nThis hotel is in need of renovation and upgrades. The entrance includes a large amount of trash that runs along the right side of the way in as one enters the lobby. The lobby itself is small and not very attractive. The elevators are so slow that on a few occasions we were forced to walk downstairs from the 9th floor. The morning of my departure, with our bags, I was forced to wait about 10 min at least before an elevator with room arrived.\n\nThen there is the room. We were very disappointed. First, the corners of the room had dirt and poor caulking visible all over. Other problems: (1) dirty light shades; (2) a closet that remains open due to the safe door swinging open; (3) a drain in the tub that had apparently come apart and the pieces were sitting in the bottom of the tub - this was the way it was when we walked in to the room; and (4) a bathroom mirror that should have been replaced long ago as it is chipping and falling apart.\n\nThere were other issues, but I think you get the idea. On a positive note, the staff is very nice and friendly, and do their best to be helpful.\n\nI should also note that I will probably not be staying in a Double Tree again, as this is the second time we were disappointed. I find that the quality control of Hilton brand hotels seem to somewhat lacking and the name is of little significance in determining the quality, other than for the top brands such as Waldorf. \n","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My sister and I shared the room, and we had a balcony which was nice, with a decent view of the Empire State Building.  The lock on the door to the balcony was broken, but the chances of anyone entering the room via the balcony were slim!  I asked in advance for a rollaway to be put in the room.  When I checked in, I asked if a cot had been placed in the room, as previously requested.  I got the names mixed up because when I got to the room, there was a rollaway as well as a cot for a baby!  My mistake.  The cot was removed!  \n\nMore about checking in - I was a little early so I said I'll go to get a drink in their bar\/restaurant, which was adjacent to the reception area.  The young lady at the desk (I think her name was Venus) said she would come and get me when the room was ready.  I thought that was a nice gesture.  Sure enough, I didn't have to wait long before Venus came and delivered the room keycards to me, together with a cookie and bottled water.  One of the downsides of this hotel is that there are only two elevators serving 27th floors, and they're not very big.  Consequently, they fill up quickly and you may find yourself waiting a bit for the next one.\n  \nThe hotel offered both a continental and a hot buffet breakfast.  My sister and I opted for the hot buffet both mornings which was $25 each.  I thought that was quite reasonable, and the food was good.  Scrambled eggs, with or without cheese, bacon, sausage, waffles (everything was hot and not cold and soggy), as well as bagels, toast, etc.  We ate as much as we could which set us up nicely for lots of walking around NYC!!  \n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and friendliness of the staff, both at check-in\/check-out, and in the restaurant.  Considering the Hilton is a chain, this particular hotel is a good choice - not too big, not too small.  The location is convenient - not in the middle of Chelsea, but a good base if you want to do your own walking tours.  It was quite noisy on the Saturday night (even on a high floor), with sirens wailing, but that's New York for you.  I would most likely stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Subway close too.  Street is quieter.  Hotel was clean and every staff member we encountered was very friendly!  Room is cozy but I haven't stayed in a room in NY yet that isn't.  Best price I could find in the city that weekend (for this hotel quality). We had 2 double beds and a great view from the 26th floor.  Being on the 26th, we didn't run into the elevator issues that others describe because it was empty for us - but we typically stopped at least 5 times going down but never had an issue getting on - but can see how others could.  They have fresh chocolate chip cookies (YUM) and cold, fruit infused water in the lobby which we really enjoyed.  For AM, head across the street to Luna Coffee for the best NY bagels!

Just as I was about to board my flight to NYC I received a email from the hotel explaining that my card details have not been authorised and I would need to provide an updated credit card otherwise my booking would be cancelled. Whilst I take full responsibility as I provided a old credit card I would have appreciated to receive the email at least a few days before my stay. However I was able to call the property and provide them with my new updated credit card details which they verified everything to me over the phone. \n\nI had read a few reviews of customers not being allocated the room that they initially reserved which I was worried about however I had issues with this. Upon\narrival check in was easy and quick under 5 minutes and I received warm cookies & bottled water on arrival which was a nice touch. \n\nI booked a king suite the room was perfect and had more space than expected, the bathroom was quite small however this was not a problem at all. The bed was comfortable and large and it was nice having a separate living room area to relax and watch some tv. The room was fully equip with a coffee machine and coffee and tea, which was nice to have hot drinks whenever you pleased. I only had room service once during my stay as I did not feel it was necessary especially as I had spent a lot of my time outside. \n\nBefore arrival I had read a lot of reviews on trip advisor stating that the lifts were a problem however I had no issues at all with the lifts as I never had to wait more than a minute for a lift. Yes the walls are quite thin and you could hear the lifts at time but this was no bother at all. \n\nThe main attraction of this hotel is the location which was the main reason why I had booked this hotel. My stay in New York was based around Wrestlemania which took place at the Met Life Stadium. Transport to get to the Met Life was via Penn Station which was under a 5 minute walk from the hotel. This made it easy when I was travelling back from the Met Life stadium at 1am to get back to my hotel as quickly as possible. \n\nThe only downfall I would say about this hotel is the street that the hotel is located on. Sometimes at night when walking back to the hotel you would come across certain people standing\/lying on the street. Even though they do not do you any harm it can be quite intimidating and felt uncomfortable at times. \n\nOther than that this hotel is under a 15 minute walk to times square which makes it easy to walk to the chaos however nice because it is out of the way. Numerous of subway lines around the hotel which made it easy to get around and the staff at the hotel were amazing and always happy to help. Did not have the breakfast so I am unable to comment about that. \n\nBottom line is that I would definitely stay at this hotel again when travelling to New York especially at the rate which I paid- more than value for money.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Vicinissimo a diverse fermate della metro aperte sempre (tutte tranne la  vicinissima 28 st che \u00e8 chiusa la sera e nel weekend). Circondato da locali dove mangiare sia per colazione che cena. Letto king comodo, vasca\/doccia funzionale, abbastanza silenziosa la camera ma si potrebbe migliorare in quanto le finestre non sono il massimo dell'isolamento (qualche spiffero entrava essendo a met\u00e0 marzo..). Noi eravamo al 14 piano e pur avendo una camera standard avevamo la vista sull'empire.

Grande difetto \u00e8 la rumorosit\u00e0 del fan coil (impianto di riscaldamento ad aria) che ci costringeva a spegnerlo prima di andare a dormire con conseguente raffreddamento della stanza durante la notte (essendo a marzo la notte eravamo quasi sottozero esternamente). Qualche volta ci siamo svegliati dal freddo in piena notte e l'abbiamo dovuto accendere. La cosa assurda \u00e8 che ti trovavi davanti una tv bellissima ed enorme (che sinceramente abbiamo acceso un paio di volte) e poi questi vecchissimi fan coil che chiedevano di essere sostituiti. Preciso che una volta partiti poi la camera si riscaldava in un attimo e quindi da accesi non faceva assolutamente freddo. Abbiamo avuto un piccolo disguido in quanto ci sono stati prelevati dalla carta di credito i soldi per due notti che, per un errore, pensavano non avessimo pagato. Ma spiegando che avevamo gi\u00e0 pagato tutto in anticipo, hanno prontamente annulato l'operazione. Quindi nel complesso se sostituissero gli impianti di riscaldamento (o andando nelle mezze stagioni dove non \u00e8 cos\u00ec necessario il loro utilizzo) ci tornerei tranquillamente.

Sure enough the scaffolding around the entrance was gone and the checkin  desk is on the opposite side of the lobby.\n\nAgain the hotel met our expectations, nothing was any trouble for the staff.  We had issues with the safe which wouldn't lock and someone was sent up in less than 10 minutes.  The following morning, I went to use the coffee machine and it obviously hadn't been used for a long time as the creamer portions had curdled and needed ro be replaced......again new ones were sent to our room expediently.\n\nThe location is excellent, two blocks from Penn Station which is brilliant for Newark Airport, and it is close to, but not actually in Midtown (although saying it is in Chelsea is a bit of a stretch....)  We were also attending an ice hockey game at Madison Square Garden and it is literally 3 minutes walk away.  Criticisms are few....this is not a spacious hotel by any means as the building is a tiny little tower sandwiched between two other buildings and the rooms are well.....cramped.  The two elevators serving the hotel are not enough at peak times.  And the entrance plaza isn't particularly inviting with garbage bins right next to the front door. \n\nAt checkout the staff arranged our car transfer back to Newark and the doorman took our luggage out without having to be asked.  Pricewise we paid $130 a night which is pretty typical for a big name hotel of this standard in Manhattan at this time of year.  Overall it was a great stay from beginning to end and we will definitely be back.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room had a mini-fridge which was not plugged in when we came into the room. As we wanted to use it, I tried to find the outlet to plug it in but could not locate it anywhere on the wall behind its location. I had to take it out of its cabinet and plug it in elsewhere. Not a big deal really, just an annoyance.\n\nThis being a NYC hotel, space is at a premium, so we still booked the room with its' two double beds (as we would have preferred two queen beds) and brought a air mattress for one of our boys (otherwise, there would have been a struggle for space while sleeping so the air mattress was the best solution - trust me - the air mattress fit in the room - barely)\n\nThe only complaint I have is with the elevators - especially around check out in the morning. There are only two elevators and the wait for one was incredibly long - at least 20 minutes or more. As we had to leave for an appointment, I could only wait just so long and ended up dragging our luggage down 7 flights! So either check out earlier than the posted time or have a lot of patience.\n\nAll in all though, this Doubletree location was fine.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This was not the case for this hotel.\n\nWe arrived at 10pm after a 24+ hr flight, one of our rooms were available, the other room we were told was unavailable for the night. We were sent to another room to spend the our first night. We dropped our bags off and went to get some food. We got back to the room at 11:30pm and discovered that our room for 3 only had 1 bed and the sofa bed had not been unpacked or had sheets on it. I called down to the front desk to ask them for assistance, they told me that it would be a while before they could do anything given the time. At 1am and after a few more calls, a knock on the door occurred and a plastic bag with sheets and a towel was left at the door. I made my own bed and had a shower after the long flight and went to bed pretty angry. Given they knew, we were coming as a room of 3 and they knew we were staying in this room for the night, I don't understand why it wasn't prepared properly.\n\nThe next morning, I went to the front desk to inform the staff, that the actions of the night before were pretty pitiful. They informed me that the night staff are apparently not allowed in the room as it may disturb those sleeping, I responded that nobody was sleeping as we didn't have a bed made to sleep in. No resolution came from this. \n\nThat day the elevator broke, leaving a long line for the one remaining elevator, taking 30 mins to get to our floor. The management engaged the manual override only allowing elevator to go up and not pick people up coming down. We were told to take the stairs, which was impossible as one of our party  needs a walking stick and isn't able to use the stairs. The elevator also doesn't return to the lobby after it is finished, meaning it took a long time to ever use it.\n\nAfter the one night in the spare room, we were told to leave our luggage in our room and someone would move it to our new room during the day. We arrived back at the hotel at around 5pm and were told our room was still not ready and they had collected the keys to our old room, meaning we were roomless. We found our luggage sitting unattended on the floor our new room was going to be on. I was very angry that our luggage was left unattended in the hallway. The management apologised. \n\nOnce we were in our room for the next 7 nights, we had three instances of only receiving two towels instead of three and had to call up for it to be corrected. In addition, on another day, the housekeeping just left the empty roll of toilet paper on the holder without replacing it. I went to the front desk to ask for another roll as it didn't make sense why it was not replaced. The lady told me that they sometimes leave spare rolls under the TV. This made no sense as the TV is not near the bathroom. She told me that I should check their before requesting toilet paper. I said to just send me toilet paper regardless, I did check under the TV and there was no toilet paper there, so I don't know what she was talking about. \n\nThe rooms were very small and didn't comfortably fit three adults with luggage. The bathroom was standard, we didn't have a drain filter or plug for the shower\/bath. The shower was also leaking. \n\nThe breakfast wasn't worth the price, the options for food were very small. \n\nI won't be staying here again.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The entire front courtyard was full of items under tarps and very limited sitting, mostly just a smoking area. If you're not a smoker, you know that you'll have no desire to sit have a drink right next to a bunch of smokers. When we went to check in, the lobby was closed in due to the remodeling down to the size of a NYC one bedroom apartment. Imagine 6 or 7 people checking in and being almost shoulder to shoulder. When I got to the desk, I was informed that the higher level room was not available due to the current guest staying over an extra day. I asked to insure that what ever room I did have, would have a view of the Empire State Bldg. From the 16th floor, I could see the spire and a little below. Also when we arrived in our room, the Champaign and cheese and fruit tray were not in the room. After we had settled into the room, I went down stairs to inquire about the view and extra service items that I had paid for. As far as the room I was limited to that room due to the NYU graduation and the hotel was booked to capacity. The extra service items apparently were not in the booking, but when they made a call, there seemed to be a glitch but they were ready to make it good. They asked when I would like the it delivered to the room, I informed them we were going out to dinner and watch a band but would be back around 11:00pm so please have it there before then. The night out in the city was great until we returned. No service was delivered to the room and the kitchen never prepared the platter. \n\nDay 2: I'm an early riser so let my wife sleep in and headed down for breakfast, read the paper and just chill out before we got our day started. when I finished up and was headed up to the room, I thought make shift breakfast in bed would be nice. Well forget that, they would not allow me to take anything up because that would then be considered room service, really! Before I went up, I asked about the platter and bottle service that was not delivered. they thought that it had been delivered, well I guess that miscommunication is allowable and I asked that it be delivered that evening. I talked to the GM about our lack of view as was told if I wanted, they would take our things up to a higher floor. My wife was just not ready to re-pack for a move. I asked for a reduction in rate due to their lack of availability and was only offered honor points. \n\nWhen we went to head out for the day, I also found out that the parking was not included in our bill. That it was a guest rate with their 3rd party vendor. I believe that things like this that are considered extra charges should be spelled out in the booking on the Hilton website. \n\nwhen we returned, you guessed it not service platter and bottle in the room for the second day. On our way out the door headed to a show on Broadway, I notified them that the service had still not been delivered and to please have it in the room by that evening upon our return. well you guess it again, when we returned, nothing in the room. I went down to see what the issue was  and they had no excuse this time. they offered just a bottle of wine and fruit basket haphazardly put together. I declined just because I found it very insulting to not get what we paid for. \n\nDay 3: After a long day the prior day, we slept in and made sure this time to get downstairs with my wife so she could get breakfast. it was about 1 hour before that were wrapping up breakfast, but what and issue. We had to ask for items that were either not replenished or were Luke warm at best not the breakfast bar. My wife gave up and just had scraps of the mixed fruit, cereal and toast. When we addressed the platter and bottle issue for the third time, all they said was they were going to give us more honor point, I guess they just gave up at that point. the remainder of our stay was uneventful but after all that had happened, I just can't imagine that we'll return to that Hilton property. the entire visit with DT Chelsea can be summed in one phrase. \"over promised and under delivered\"","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hotel is under major construction. Housekeeping and construction workers use main elevator meaning you wait up to 25 mins for the elevator or stop on every floor while packed like sardines inside. I was on the 23rd floor so it was a hassle coming or going from your room. Rooms are approx. 24'x12' and with 2 double beds, only one person can move in room while other sits on bed or stands in corner. Closet measures 12\"x12\" with rod going from front to back instead of side to side. You have to empty closet each time you want to get your clothes.  The main lobby has one small bench for seating, otherwise, you stand in the 10x10 space or escape outside. The outdoor terrace is on the street with half of it piled with dirty laundry and the other half with construction materials. There are 5 dirty plastic chairs lined up against the building that you can sit -behind the dirty laundry carts. The bellman is extremely helpful and insistent in getting you a cab-BEWARE- once you arrive at your destination the driver quotes some outrageous fare. Took me from hotel to JFK morning of departure (17.1 miles) and said fare was $90.00- fare for cab to hotel was $46.00. He reduced to $82.50 after I complained. I have since disputed with my credit card company and having charge reversed.  Get your own cab or uber and save yourself some money.  The restaurant\/bar looks like a garage with cheap tables and chairs for dining and the bar (same as dining room) consists of liquor rolled in on a cart  and the bartender turning on a radio full blast.

The positives of the hotel is that it is very centrally located (more midtown than Chelsea, to be honest) and very close to the 28th street subway station. It has lots of restaurants and supermarkets around if you need anything as well.\n\nBut beyond this, I had numerous problems with my stay at this hotel:\n\n1. Upon check-in, I was told the room level I booked was unavailable, because 'Expedia overbooks our hotel'. It seems unfair that their flawed arrangements with Expedia should impact upon guests, but there you go. I was given an 'upgrade' for just that night, then told I would have to move out of that room the next day once the price of room I had booked was available. I.e. a full check out then check in on my 2nd day of staying in the hotel. If that wasn't annoying enough, the next morning after packing up ALL my things and taking my suitcase to reception, I was told I could actually stay in the room I had been given. It would have been nice to get a call informing me of this before I went down at midday fully ready to check out then check back in.\n\n2. When things arrived for me at the front desk, they always insisted I come down to get it and never offered for someone to take anything to my room.\n\n3. The lifts are SO SLOW. There are two lifts for 27 or so floors, and I often would wait for 15 minutes for the lift only to see it was completely full then have to wait again. I often walked up the stairs instead of using the lift, even though I was on level 25.\n\n4. My room was serviced only twice out of my 7 nights with the hotel. Multiple times I went down to reception requesting service, and no one ever came. I often did this in the morning ~10am, then left the entire day and came back to a still dirty room. \n\n3 nights before I was due to checkout, I left the hotel with a refund that Expedia was able to organise. It seemed absurd to be paying ~$400 a night only to have no maid service, poorly working lifts, extensive construction, and quite aloof and unhelpful service.\n\nI would never stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Not sure that I could do any better at project managing something as substantial as a full renovation on a downtown NYC hotel that intends on continuing \"normal\" operations throughout. With that being said, there are definitely elements of the hotel that due to the renovations or otherwise are not up to the type of standards one would expect given the rates being charged.\n\nOur room was, for the most part, clean and adequate. Kudos to the housekeeping staff who did a great job every day under less than ideal conditions. The bathroom was quite shabby and in need of some aesthetic and hardware repairs, though I suspect that's the type of work being done via the renovations. The lobby and entrance was a mess due to renovations. The day we checked out, construction crews were using an industrial jackhammer on tile floors in the lobby (the poor desk staff who didn't have noise protection...).\n\nWe were fortunate that we seemed to be coming and going at off-peak times because the elevators were a definite problem. Having just 2 elevators for a hotel that large would be an issue on the best of days, but particularly so when 1 is frequently used to transport construction crews and debris from the renovations.\n\nHad a couple of 5 to 10 minute delays waiting for an available elevator, one time we just gave up and walked down 11 stories which we understand would not be an option for many folks.\n\nOverall could have been far worse","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Turns out that a workman had used a ladder to lower himself from the roof onto the balcony where he was able to see straight into the room. A gross invasion of privacy given that we were not notified or even made aware that this might happen. \nOther issues included a shower that went through a 60 second cycle of ok pressure to completely stopped and then back again - didn\u2019t bother getting maintenance up for this. \nOh - and be prepared for long waits at the lift (up to 10 to 15 minutes) during peak times. \nComplained to the front desk and Brittany assured me that the manager would be in touch - never happened. \nComplained to management through my Hilton diamond account and was offered some points (by Venus) to compensate for the shortfall but these never were followed up on. \nIn short - I paid a lot of money for a very poor experience and would warn against staying here (at least in the expensive rooms).

When we left our luggage with the concierge, it was stored in the lobby which I did not feel was very secure but we were left with no other option. It was nearly impossible to get an elevator, we had to take the stairs to our 6th floor room with an 8-year-old and a 5-year-old. This included check-out which required us to carry large suitcases down 6-flights of stairs to an outside exit and we had to walk around the building to get to the lobby.

After a frustrating long drive I just wanted to park and get to my room but instead I needed to call and ask where to park . Took me another 10 mins just to get around the block so I could get back to the parking lot . Makes no sense to me why it is not mentioned on the website .

Smelled silmilar to the subway station .  Rugs were dirty too .  Thank goodness they are planning on updating the hotel. At these prices you should expect more .\nThe outside of the hotel is under construction but didn\u2019t effect us in any way . I actually found the construction workers more pleasant than the front desk staff . One worker offered to get out the elevator to allow room for more guests !\nOne night after getting back late from our show we witnessed another guest being told that he had to pay to get his luggage out of storage after 11pm .

The rooms can really only be accessed by lift (there is no proper internal staircase and the stairs there are (which you are allowed to use - the fire exit stairs) were used as a storage area) and there are only 2 lifts, one of which was out for most of our time we were there. This meant lengthy queues to get a lift and it being very cramped in the lift. Unfortunately the smoking area is around chairs directly outside of the front door, meaning you walk out into a cloud of smoke, which isn't very pleasant. \n\nEach floor is relatively small and in true New York style so are the rooms. However, this is by no means a criticism - it's the way of things in this city. The rooms were comfortable with a clean and efficient bathroom - albeit that the air conditioning unit was very loud at night. The complimentary products were also of very good quality. \n\nOne of the real upsides to this hotel is its location: very close to Penn Station, for the Long Island Railroad to\/from JFK airport and well located for the subway and other New York attractions. \n\nOverall this is a solid - if not spectacular - hotel.

We called it three times to receive the items that housekeeping forgot to leave and on each occasion had to call them back again an hour or so later to chase them up. Nobody seemed to care. With just a few exceptions we found the staff to be surly and unengaging\u2026including reception where there was zero Hilton Honors recognition at check-in and no water provided. We called down for it but guess what\u2026.it never turned up. Which was probably because the hotel has just two small elevators catering for its 27 guest floors which means moving between floors often takes an eternity. \nHotel management will blame poor reviews such as this on renovations and assure readers that they are continually \u201cstriving\u201d for this, that or the other. Let\u2019s hope they all strive a lot harder than they have been in the past because the Hilton Doubletree Chelsea is currently not a good hotel.

I had a twin room for my kids - done for free on Hilton Honors points but my own room was paid at a pricey $290 a night.....but then again this is Manhattan in tourist season so par for the course unfortunately.\n\nIt is in an excellent location, literally a couple of blocks away from the Penn Station \/ Madison Square Garden complex, with Times Square, the theatre district and all the shops just a little further.  There is also a Subway stop on the 1+2 lines a block down so it is very easy to get downtown.  The hotel is very small - sandwiched in between surrounding buildings and as a result the rooms are a bit on the compact side.  However I have no complaints with the cleanliness or the facilities in the rooms which were spotless and up to a typical Hilton DoubleTree standard.\n\nThe only downside was that there was construction work going on at the front of the hotel so the entrance plaza is completely shielded by scaffolding, but to be honest this never impacted our stay nor were we ever bothered by construction noise.

You'll see part of the reason right up front when the sight of scaffolding,and  patio furniture piled high and haphazardly on both sides of an entry greet you. Once inside, the corridors will bring out the claustrophobic in anyone, and the rooms are more like cells. Mine was freezing cold and the thermostatic didn't work. So I could either freeze or shut it off completely and suffocate. The \"kingsize\" bed could barely accommodate my 6-foot frame and the rest of the furnishings were used and abused cheap fiberboard that made excessive noises at the slightest touch. My tiny room also seemed to have chronic water problems. A fabric shower curtain with no plastic liner assured that the bathroom floor got soaked whenever I showered. Toiletries consistently fell off the glass shelf in the bathroom as well because it was so small and somewhat slanted downward.  The in-room coffee maker leaked as well, soaking the desk and papers I had stupidly placed there.  I was freezing and wet much of the first night's stay. I left the tag for breakfast from room service on the door but it went ignored. I never saw ANY evidence of room service of any kind. After working in the city for two days I was ready for a good night's sleep on the second night, looking forward to leaving in the morning. No such luck. The fire alarm went off at 2 am, but the ringing units on my floor did not relay any sense of urgency or danger. Once I heard people piling out of their rooms I realized that there might indeed be a problem. Turns out it was a false alarm. In the chaos in the lobby all I could hear was a frustrated and annoyed fireman trying to learn from staff whether or not there really was any means of fire escape. Finally, I mistakenly left my glasses in the room. After several calls, housekeeping called me back and said they had found them. But, i had to send fedex or UPS labels to the hotel to get them back. Why?  Out of pure courtesy and customer service couldn't they just mail them?  Fedex does not issue labels any more, no to my knowledge does UPS.  What's so difficult about sending me my glasses. I doubt I will ever see them again.  Bottom line, this place is a joke and barely functioning, like a car running on two cylinders.

We didn't bother visiting the restaurant\/bar again throughout our stay. \n\nOur room was booked for 3 adults but it was only set up for two guests - we were only provided with two tea\/coffee cups, towels, etc. we had to request addtional of each. We also didn't have a great view - it's advertised as city views\/Empire State Building Views but unfortunately we just had views of the dirty empty building opposite us.\n\nIt was fairly clean overall however the bedsheets were not changed enough during our 7 night stay and were not clean upon arrival (make up stains before any of us even touched the beds) \n\nThe worst thing was the lifts! There were only two for the entire 29 floors and only one working throughout the entire trip with the second stopping and starting. This was a bit of a nightmare considering they were both tiny and could only fit about 4\/5 people comfortably in - even less during check-in\/check-out times. Luckily we were only on the 6th floor so was able to use the stairs however they led to the fire exit straight out of the building which isn't helpful if you need to go to reception\/gym\/internet room. \n\nThe staff were not at all friendly or helpful, they did not make any recommendations on where or what to do on our trip or even ask if we had anything planned or see if we needed help with anything!

There is much I could say here, but the incident that remains with me the most is the inability of the staff to clean my room in a timely manner.  I left the hotel at 9:00 am one morning and asked the front desk, as I was leaving the building, to please have my room cleaned as soon as possible.  The clerk told me he would call housekeeping immediately to have it cleaned.  I returned at 10:30 am and it was not touched.  I called downstairs and told them it had not been done yet.  They again told me that housekeeping was on its way to clean my room.  I went downstairs to the lobby to wait until it was done.  At 11:15, my room had still not been touched.  At 12:00 noon, it was still not done.  Finally, just after 12:10 pm, I was told that my room had been completed.  Waiting in the lobby, which is rather small, when I would have much preferred to be in my room, left me with a very sour experience.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that afterwards I complained in my post-stay survey that they sent to me.  I was even more explicit in that response about what I didn't like. I received an automated message saying that my response had been received and then later a corporate response saying how glad they were that the local Doubletree had already responded to my concerns--except they hadn't.  To this day, I have not received anything from the local Doubletree even though their national office believes that I have.  I informed them that the local Doubletree had not contacted me, but I received no reponse.  \n\nC'est la vie!","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

But lacking any nice touches in the rooms such as a business desk or nice window, it's a drag even to rest in the hotel.  To say this hotel is in Chelsea seems stretch.

It's amazing how many Hilton branded hotels are nearby though, easy to get confused as they all look pretty much the same. However, we had selected this hotel for our stay. Arrival was perhaps the most disappointing part of the stay, although the hotel rectified it admirably. The room we had booked was a King Size but they only had a double available for our first night. Therefore, we would move rooms the next night. Further to this, other guests upon check in were given a bag of cookies, whereas we weren't. We did book the hotel through someone other than Hilton but I am a Hilton Honours member, so found that a bit disappointing particularly as it seemed most people were receiving them. The following morning we woke up to receive a complementary breakfast through the door, which was a very nice touch by way of an apology for the room move. The breakfast was lovely. \n\nThe hotel itself is nicely appointed. Rooms are your standard Hilton affair, which means they are well equipped. There was a great large TV, fairly decent Wi-Fi and a very useful in room safe. The room was nice and clean too which always helps. Upon check out, the hotel offers a concierge service which takes care of your suitcases so you can enjoy a last day of sightseeing before an evening flight. This was an efficient process. Staff were generally on the whole fairly decent and friendly. \n\nThe only other criticism we would have beyond the check in is the lift situation. We were only on floor 2 but still had to use the lifts. We tried to find a staircase to the main lobby but did not succeed. Therefore, it was quite frustrating waiting for the lifts and they're not particularly quick! \n\nHowever, the Doubletree Hotel Chelsea was a nice hotel overall. Staff did a good job to make up for the issues at check in and the room was nice and perfect for the trip we made. Would consider staying here again .. although, as said at the start of the review, it doesn't really matter which Hilton you stay in, they're all essentially the same. It all comes down to price, and this hotel won on that front.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Staff was very friendly and accommodating, the hotel is actually nice.  That said, I am not sure I would stay here again...  maybe it's just me, but I was put off by the very small rooms and hallways.  The hotel designers and management should have put a little more emphasis on customer space.  Now am not a frequent visitor to Manhattan or New York... so I can't speak to other locations...  I am sure most people will say something along the line of, \"Well, that's New York.\" or, \"You get what you paid for...\" or something similar.  Me, however, I need more space, especially since there were 3 of us in a room that was barely built for 2.  Not a lot of storage space in the room, case in point...  The hotel staff place the towels in the short on a rack above.  So, if you like to take a shower and you are good at splashing, you will have towels that are wet before you need it to dry off.  This sink is extremely small... just a functioning sink you would find in most half bathrooms.  We opted for the higher floors to get a vantage point of the hotel and surrounding area.  We were on the 23rd floor... there really wasn't much to see because most of the other buildings were that tall or taller.  We could see the Empire State Building off in the distance at an angle, part of it anyway. I was a little concerned with some of the other TripAdvisor reviewers talking about the elevators being slow... I did not find this to be case.  Yes, I waited, but did not think it was longer than normal.  One thing that irked me was there were no laundry facilities on site.  Really??? you couldn't have used one room designated for laundry facilities???  This was very frustrating... Yes, the hotel offers a dry clean option, but not on Sundays...  which is when I needed to wash my clothes.  I do have to give a shout out and thank you to the following individuals.. They made our stay.  Sandra at the front desk was very helpful and made sure I got the vouchers I needed for breakfast.  Jose in the dining hall was a great waiter.  Very friendly!

Otherwise, staying here was a poor experience. I\u2019ve stayed in a lot of hotels, and as a Hilton Diamond Member I have stayed at a lot of Doubletree Hotels, but this one is not up to par. First off, the lobby is small, the front desk is small, there are only 2 elevators serving 27 floors and a couple hundred rooms, so expect a long wait, the hallways are extremely narrow, so much so that it is difficult to pass the housekeeping cart with luggage, the room is small, the bathroom is small, and the beds only have one very thin blanket. Next, dinner in the hotel restaurant was average, expensive, and the service was very slow. The sole employee we saw was seating people, taking orders, serving food, busing tables, and working the bar and he couldn\u2019t keep up. When we returned to our room for the night, we found that the deadbolt on the room door wouldn\u2019t latch and the tv didn\u2019t work. After almost 40 minutes of waiting while engineering tried to make repairs, we asked for another room. The tv remote in our second room didn\u2019t work but was quickly repaired. Finally, breakfast was an average hotel buffet, and the room that it was served in was a glass atrium, so it was a very cold dining experience on a January morning. I chose this hotel because it is part of the Hilton chain, but it does not reflect well on the Hilton brand, and I would not stay here again. ","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We set off at 4am british time and finally arrived at the hotel after trying to get from newark airport to the hotel through snow and heavy traffic reaching the hotel at 18.25 ( 23.25 british time) we had been travelling for over 19hours in total. I gave the receptionist my id and booking and after staring at the screen for a minute or so went to get her manager. Meanwhile another guest was arguing about cockroaches in his room with another receptionist who basically said he was a liar even though the photo on his mobile clearly showed the cockroaches. Then there was another elderly woman trying to check in but they said they had no record of her booking on the system also. Finally the receptionist that was dealing with me appeared with the manager who i clearly heard tell her weve sold the room! She then told me that booking.com had cancelled my room. This was impossible as i still had the live booking on my mobile showing it still active and when i rang booking.com they said the booking was still live also at their end. The hotel said there was no rooms available for me and me and my patrner had to go out in the snow and cold in a city we had never visited beforeto try and find accomodation at nearly 12 oclock at night. The hotel receptonist were downright rude and did not give two hoots about customer service. They had obviously sold my room to someone who had clearly turned up at thehotel willing to pay over twice as much as i had reserved the room for months earlier. Only advice i can give is dont bother booking this disgrace of a hotel with staff that lie and treat customers with utter disrespect!

They were happy to store my suitcase, and the concierge was very friendly. Upon check in, I was given 2 bottles of water in a little welcome bag, and a warm chocolate chip cookie..a nice touch. When I came back that evening to get my room, a bit of disappointment kicked in. The room is small, but that's to be expected in NYC, and really, who needs a big hotel room in Chelsea?  The room itself left much to be desired.  From the dirty\/old carpet, to the awful and dusty dust ruffle on the bed, i took one look around and realized this was a place I wouldn't let my suitcase touch the floor. There were old wet marks on the ceiling, dust all over the remote, no hand towels hanging in the bathroom, and a really nasty phone in the room. It's not so gross that I would walk away, but if you want cleanliness, dust free surfaces, etc look elsewhere.  For a hundred bucks less, I wouldn't have bat an eyelash. The TV has Guide, a great bonus, but a few channels didn't work (ahem, HGTV).  Bottom line: fine place to crash, no frills, kind of dusty\/dirty, just okay customer service.

There are only two elevators (staff and guest use them both) and several times during my stay one was out of service.  Two elevators for such a tall building with so many rooms is insufficient on its own, one elevator is unacceptable.  It appears that this issue has been going for some time based on other reviews. I took to the stairs several times in stead of waiting what could have been 15 plus minutes to stand in a cramped over full elevator.  The stair wells were unkept as well because there were service items in the stair well like old room service stuff and other things, probably because the staff couldnt clear it away given one elevator.  \nAlso, in spite of my request to face the back of hte hotel to avoid street noise they did not accommodate this even though I got there at 2pm and reiterated the request (already in my reservation) and waited till after 8 to get to my room which in the midst of the elevator mayhem was facing the front of the building and the street with all the noise that entails.  In light of the elevator problems I decided to just stay put and not inconvenience myself with a move the next day to another room.\nThe room was on the small side as is common in NYC.  Comfortable bed.  Somewhat worn out in places.  \nId probably not return to this property, certainly hope they can sort their elevator situation out because two working ones is already underserving, just one working is unacceptable.

We have stayed in tons of Hilton family hotels, and the bedding is always nice. The sheets are soft, the duvets are fluffy, and you feel like you can really relax in the beds. These sheets were old, and not as soft as usual, but the worst was the duvet. It was situated between two sheets, which is fine if the duvet seems nice, but it was stiff and if you held it up to the light you could see that only about 10% of each square had anything in it.

But it is this property's practice to overbook and bypass respecting guests confirmed and prepaid reservations, and so redirect the unlucky guests to a sister property, rate not honored at transfer either so take your risk booking here. Rather invest in your reservation being respected at the Millenium across WTC. We switched hotels due to the greedy business practice of this property to overbook and not help cheated guests. I would have given one star for this practice alone but the hotel was saved by its excellent bellman, Duane. He saw me crying in hallway about this stuff and stopped to be human with me and make a proper apology on behalf of the hotel staff, so the injury from disappointment at check in did not stay on to ruin my visit to New York City.  Duane saved the day, and Jennifer at front desk made amends by comping a free night because it was wrong to shortchange paying guests their promised room, especially Diamond member! Some other things.... the internet is a little slow, it's hard to get cell phone signals sometimes, and the breakfast is best changed out for points.... if you have HHonors, go for the points and not the breakfast as the breakfast is basically prepackaged foods released from saranwrapped boxes and put under hot lamp where other guests cough.

I felt the pictures on the website are reflective of what you get.  About ten rooms per floor, with approx 25 floors so tall and thin hotel, modern style.  I don\u2019t think all rooms are the same size on each floor, from looking at the corridor layout, but can't confirm that.  My friend said her room was small, I thought mine was fine - (I was given a wheelchair accessible room, so it may possibly have been larger?) - I was in a standard queen bed room.  I've stayed in much smaller rooms in NYC, so I thought this was a relatively ok size. For anyone in a wheelchair, you could have wheeled all around the bed and into the bathroom and the entrance to the room was at an angle and seemed slightly larger and switches and plugs were at a sensible\/accessible height.  I counted 16 plug sockets from standing at the end of the bed!  I don't know if this was specific to an accessible room or all rooms?\nMy room was located at the back of the hotel - very quiet\/zero road noise - my fave location!  Air conditioning efficient and not too noisy. Quieter than many I\u2019ve experienced. No complaints at all about room noise. \nThe room was nicely decorated in a sort of latte coffee color - pleasant but not too bland with a patterned wallpaper behind the bed. The bed was comfortable with nice white sheets, firm mattress. Room had a coffee maker, safe, ironing board, wardrobe and chest of drawers, desk and a full length mirror as well as a large mirror above the desk. There was space to store a suitcase without falling over it.\nBathroom had a shower curtain and a seat, for easy access. Bathroom nicely decorated, granite counter top. Small amenity bottles, included hair shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, plus a bar of soap. Plenty of towels and hand rails for convenience.  Not much space for a wash bag, ok for a small one.   My room and bathroom were both clean - no housekeeping issues at all.\nCheck in was very friendly and I was given a cookie and bottle of water upon arrival. I was even able to check in early which was great. They were really doing some nice decorations for Halloween which was fun.\nThere\u2019s a surprisingly decent restaurant out the back. It opens out into a sort of frosted glass conservatory so is light and spacious. Breakfast, whilst not cheap ($23 for omelet and coffee and toast) was good.  Work booked me the room, so price was not an issue regarding breakfast!  Staff were really friendly in the restaurant - efficient good service, plus they were happy for us to sit and chat and not rush us!  I can't comment on any other meals apart from breakfast.\nI did notice late at night, we had to use our room key to access the foyer. There were staff if you'd not checked in, but it meant no one could just walk in off the street - so an additional safety feature.  \nOnly thing I didn\u2019t like, as the hotel is tall and thin, you may wait a while for an elevator and they did tend to stop at nearly every floor.\nThis one ticked all my boxes for a standard, comfy, decent overnight stay in NYC. Would be happy to stay there again.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

That also means it goes up 27 floors.\n\nThe rooms are tiny and if you had to spend any amount of waking time there it would be very claustrophobic. The corridors are very narrow and the decor is scruffy. Carpets in the hallways look dirty and in need of a refurbishment.\n\nThe beds are very comfortable with quality linens and nice pillows so a good nights sleep is very easy. Rooms are clean with good amenities as you would expect from Doubletree.\n\nOne draw back of the narrow property and high floors is that the elevators , of which there are two of them, are also small. The wait for an elevator can be a long time especially at peak hours and also trying to get down from the lower floors ( 12 and under). I waited through four elevators before giving up and walking down 8 floors. That would not be possible with luggage so allow for extra time when checking out at peak time especially if you have a flight to catch.\n\nThe location is excellent - close to good shopping and attractions but far enough away from the chaos of Times Square.\n\nOverall good Hilton service and standards but with very small rooms and long waits for elevators.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Beware!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-10-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"One of the most disgusting hotel experiences i have ever had. We booked the Hilton via booking.com for a stay in September 2016. I had booked the hotel room a few months in advance at a great rate and was really pleased. Unbeknown to me that week of our stay coincided with a visit from the United Nations so a lot of the hotels shot up in price. To add, I have had a booking.com account for years and I have never had a problem. We arrived in NYC to not only a lot of traffic at 9pm but in the middle of a bomb that had been detonated in Chelsea. Luckily we managed to get into the hotel and when we got to check in, I was told that the room had been released because they had tried to call me during the day as they had incorrect card details and because they'd couldn't get through to me (as I was on a plane I tried to add) they cancelled the room. I however, had no texts to say i had missed calls nor did I have any emails like they said they had sent me. On top of this, all the hotels were sold out and the receptionist did NOTHING to help locate us elsewhere. After a long flight, we weren't even offered a glass of water. After over 2 hours on the phone to booking.com they managed to find us another hotel, but due to the bomb, we had to walk 4 blocks with huge suitcases at 1am in the morning, the hotel did nothing to help. On arrival at the Morgan we told our bell boy what had happened and he apologised on behalf of a hotel that he doesn't even work in and said he would never work for Hilton as they \"do this all the time.\" He said Because the room rate had  gone up due to the UN visit, they cancelled my room so they could get more money for it. It was \"standard procedure\" for that hotel. During my holiday I had also booked a Marriott in Philadelphia using booking.com - so I called them to double check all was okay, and what do you know - it was! They took payment from my card no questions asked - there was nothing wrong with it at all. I have never known such appalling customer service from such a renowned name. The hotel next door were the ones that told me to call booking, the Hilton did sweet FA. Literally nothing. Be careful. I have also stayed here before which is why I rebooked and the rooms are outdated so beware. I just chose it again because of location but there are nicer, friendlier hotels in NYC to stay in.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The trip was due to me turning 30 so when I booked the hotel I asked in the message box for a room facing the Empire State Building. I didn't get that but instead I got a room facing the One World Trade Centre tower which was still just as good. It was nice at night seeing it lit up. \n\nOn arrival I was given the free chocolate and nut cookies I read about and they were really nice. The hotel kindly provided me with a free breakfast certificate and drinks coupon because of my birthday which was really nice of them. \n\nThe room was nice. A little small compared to other hotels in America and this size I would expect in Europe but as I had done my research about standard hotel rooms being smaller in New York, I was not surprised. \n\nOne concern I did have before the stay was about the lift as I read that it could take a while for it to come up and down with their being only two. That was true. There was about 27 floors and 2 lifts and I was on the 26th floor so it did take a while for the lift to come up and vice verses when I was coming back to the hotel it took a while for the lift to come down. Do be mindful that in the mornings the lift can stop a lot. I swear one morning the lift stopped about 10 times before getting to the lobby. \n\nThe location is amazing, only being a few minutes away from Penn station which is a great hub for travelling on the subway to the rest of New York. I was able to travel with ease to a number of different places such as the Yankee Stadium, the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge and the 9\/11 memorial museum. \n\nI did initially want to stay in Times Square but now I am glad I stayed in the area I did and this hotel. Along with being near Penn station, Madison Square Gardens is next to Penn Station which was perfect for the Garden tour I booked and also the concert I was attending. Macy's, Victoria's Secret, Sephora and a whole bunch of other shops are nearby.\n\nThere are plenty of choices for food nearby too. Yes there were about 3 Mcdonald's and Starbucks within 15 minutes from the hotel but there were other places to eat such as Parnera, Brother Jimmy's and Panda Express. \n\nI would definitely stay in this hotel again and recommend anyone else to.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Great location for getting to all the usual places that you would want to visit, although I did find the situation of the hotel a little run down and upon entering the hotel, the reception is a little dingy and could do with updating and the rugs need a good Hoover.  The reception staff are very courteous and friendly, however, when checking in, alarm bells did begin to ring when we were informed that we were on the 2nd floor and the chap behind the desk apologised, letting us know that no other rooms were available! When we arrived at our room by the elevator, I could see why the apology was made, as we were greeted by roughly 15 hoovers, which left us a little bemused.  When I popped to the ice machine, it was apparent that we were in fact next to where the cleaners keep all there items to clean the rooms, hence the hoovers.  Come the following morning at roughly 6am we were all woken up by the \"charge of the Hoover brigade\" it was so noisy with cleaners talking to each over walkie talkies, slamming doors and moving hoovers.  I've never stayed in a hotel where rooms are next to the cleaning utility room, perhaps it is not the best idea to have bedrooms situated in the same area.\n\nOn a positive note, although the rooms are small, I found our bedroom really cosy and the bed was remarkable...bit of double glazing or soundproofing would be advantageous when rooms are on the lower levels as the outside noise can be clearly heard unfortunately.\n\nAvoid room 208 if you can.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We stayed here on the front end of a spring break trip.  The city had just received a foot of snow, and the hotel did a great job keeping the property and the sidewalk clear for people to walk safely.  The front desk people were so friendly and helpful.  They even gave my mom and me two free comps for a breakfast buffet one day.  The buffet is awesome, but it's pricey normally.  There are a lot of great delis and food options around, if you don't want to pay for that.  Our room was small, but the bathroom was an accessible one and large.  The only issue is that the bathroom door wouldn't stay propped open, and it always slammed closed.  Also, we couldn't figure out if there was a fan in the bathroom or not.  The bed was comfortable and the pillows were awesome.  Overall, the room was very clean.  Our floor was quiet, but with only two elevators and a very tall hotel, sometimes you had to wait a while for a free one.  The bar had a good happy hour special on wine, and of course, we loved the cookies!  If you want to stay in NYC, this is a good option, especially since it is close to a subway station (just around the corner), and Penn Station is within walking distance.  It had views of the Empire State Building too, although our room did not.  You can't go wrong with this property!","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Usually at Doubletree you have larger rooms or suites.  But these were TINY.  Also there are only 2 elevators and no staff elevators, so the staff (housekeeping) has to use the same elevators as guests.  This means you have to wait for multiple elevators to come if you are trying to go down to the lobby as they open and they are all full.  I once got on with 4 cleaning staff with their buckets and cleaning tools.  There was hardly any room.  If you are trying to go up from the lobby there is often a line.

If you need a hotel on a bright, glamourous street with a big ornate lobby....this isn't the place for you. It's in a relatively dark, gritty block mainly occupied by wholesale businesses that are not open to the public.And for a hotel as nice as this one,  the lobby is positively tiny. But if you can work around those things, this hotel can be a fine value for you. The hotel is well run and maintained. Everything in my room worked well, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The room was very tidy (though using the stairwells, Imoften had to step over bags of garbage during cleaning hours). Hallways are narrow; rooms are fairly small; there are relatively few room per floor, so most are quite near an elevator. I was on the 9th floor, so the view was unremarkable, but I could see the very top of the Empire State Building. Elevator service is a bit subpar but okay overall; there were some long waits. Wifi worked very well except for needing to log in each time. The staff responded well to my request for more decaf and creamer, though the front desk did forget to make a wake up call I requested directly from them. Staff was pleasant but mainly unremarkable--but the concierge was fantastic in helping me on my checkout day. He was friendly, helpful and made me feel it was his pleasure to help.  He was superb. \nThe location on W. 29 th is not scenic--but it is in a great location for the subway, Madison Square Garden and things to do. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. Finally, I would say the price I paid was a good value. For what I was looking for--a good base to see the city while in town to see Wisconsin in the NCAA basketball tournament up the street at MSG--it fit the bill well. I'd definitely consider staying there again, especially if being near Penn Station and MSG were a priority.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Additionally, there is a convenient NYC subway station about one block from the hotel with direct uptown and downtown access, with stops at popular destinations such as Central Park and museums, Times Square, 9-11 Memorial, and Battery Park ferry terminals a short ride on the 1,2,3 line.  The staff at the lobby desk were helpful, efficient, and cheerful, offering suggestions for sightseeing and dining.  The bellman assisted me without delay in storing my luggage (because I arrived very early in the morning) and getting a taxi when needed.  I did not use the hotel dining room, since there are literally dozens of cafes, delis, and pubs within a few minutes walk, particularly on 7th Avenue.  The 27 floor building is tucked in among other buildings of similar height.   My compact room was comfortable, quiet, and clean and had a view of the upper half of the Empire State Building, also only a short walk away.  There was a king bed, small desk with rolling chair and a wardrobe for storage.  As a person who uses the room mostly for sleeping, rather than work or sitting, it worked fine for me.

But since we had some questions about our stay we contacted an employee who informed us about the \"Best Price Guarantee\" policy of Hilton. \n\nDue to this policy we decided to book the room directly through Hilton and apply for the \"Best Price Guarantee\" policy. This process is quite easy and straightforward. Within 24 hours after submitting the form we received an email that Hilton is honoring our request. Because we had paid the room in advance, they told us they will send us a cheque with the amount to be received. Because cashing out a cheque is quite expensive in the country in which I live, I asked them if it was possible to receive the amount back on my credit card or bank transfer. This was not possible according to the support staff. Because of this it was cheaper for us to book the room through a 3rd party website then directly with Hilton. When I asked for a manager to discuss the matter, I received an email back that they only do cheques and that they close the case and will not respond to future emails about this. So we ended up with a high price then advertised available.\n\nSince we were traveling with family and our 1 year old son we had a lot of luggage with us. When we arrived at the hotel by taxi and unloaded all our luggage the front door manager didn't apply to help us but stayed inside and watched how we struggled with all the luggage. When we arrived at the front desk we had to wait for at least another 15 minutes before we could check in because all the staff were busy with one group of people who had issues with there reservation. It would be more appropriate if one of them helped the group and the others helped other customers.\n\nAlthough we had to wait for more then 15 minutes, the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful and made sure the requested crib was arranged quickly.\n\nThe room itself was clean and had a nice view at Liberty Tower but could use a make over as they are very outdated. The beds were very short which caused my feet be outside of the bed all night resulting in cold feet. The blankets were made of a thin fleece blanket with sheets around them. The heating \/ cooling unit turn on every now and then during the night and makes a lot of noise which woke us up.\n\nBecause we were on a holiday with family we booked a room for 4 persons but only received 3 towels. Although we requested for an additional towel, we only received it ones. All other days we did only receive 3 towels and needed to request again for an additional one.\n\nInternet connection in the rooms are good but you have to login again everyday. The hotel is located near Penn station and it is easy to travel to all the sightseeing locations in New York.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The bell man was very friendly and helped us with storing our bags till our room was available. Travel tip: I would advise tipping the bell man. We did and while we were waiting I was noticing a lot of people did not. Although it's not required, it is a courtesy he is providing and it is in good etiquette to do so. After all, he IS storing and keeping an eye on YOUR luggage. It would be smart to take care of the people who are taking care of you. Don't be cheap. \nWe always had a \"have a great day\" as we were leaving and a \" welcome back\" as we returned each evening. Small thing, but meant a lot to see smiling faces behind the counter no matter what time of day it was. \nI had a little trouble in the business center, the printer kept reading \"off line\". So I couldn't print our Knicks tickets. I went upstairs and they took care of me. Printed them for me, no problem at all!! Very helpful. We made it to the game!! \nThe elevators ran smoothly. No issues with waiting a long time. Keep in mind the busy check in\/ check out times, there will be a slight wait during those times. Don't panic.   At most 2-3 minutes. \nThe one and only negative. They were completely out of any and all red wine all the days we were there. That really bummed me out. Buts that's ok, lots of other places to go for red wine. Wasn't really an issue, other than braving the cold wind. \nTo recap, everyone was friendly. There are a lot of choices in regards to places to stay in New York City.

We came back to get something and we were at the business center and a few minutes after we were just browsing the Internet, this security guard in the name of Francis asked us if we are guest. We said yes. And we showed our room key to him. This was like 230am, though. We even said we are Diamond HH members. He left us then he came back and told us that we are not guest. Then we explained about the booking etc, etc. I even showed him my tag. We just bowed out heads and left. We just cancelled further reservations and booked to another hotel. \nIn addition to that we had an incident that is not so nice. Our room's toilet is clogged. They even have to call the staff to get a plunger to fix it. They will not transfer us to another room even the first night we asked for upgrade(since we are diamond) they said all rooms are sold so no upgrade. I mean, where is the appreciation here of reaching this level? Never had ever been offered any service recovery bonus or points. Hampton did have us a free night. So far twice. This has none to offer to fulfill the guest satisfaction promised the the business they are in. I am spending a lot of money in hotel and we chose our hotel, not expensively but the practical type. We deserve some courtesy as being part of this membership especially when the purpose is to honor Hilton guest, courtesy is part of it. I guest, hotel guess are suppose to be treated at par excellent especially in customer service. \nNumber 1 - the treatment is so rude. The treatment is not suppose to be this way since we are guest still and still going to be guest in the following days. Well we guess not anymore. We felt humiliated and embarrassed that we felt like we are criminals that just gate crashed into the hotel or inside the business center. We felt like we are to steal something in the hotel. I would understand also if we are doing something alarming like we making noise damaging the property or the like but we were just siting in there surfing the web. Yes, he might be following what his responsibility which is to safeguard the hotel. Not to throw us out. \nI want a reprimand to the management of hotel to training arrogantly a staff that does not deserve to be in the customer service oriented business whose primary goal is customer satisfaction. I don't believe he is even qualified and if this is the fruit  of the training of this hotel. I recommend readers of my review to think twice. \nIf in case management will appreciate our review for letting the readers known of it. I want us to be appreciated to any HH  hotels and resorts for free nights and points. The shamefulness we felt as we left the hotel.

LOCATION: Walking distance to most subway lines, Herald Sq, Chelsea, MSG. STAFF: Everyone I interacted with - front desk, maintenance, restaurant, doorman, baggage ALL friendly, helpful and genuinely caring. The breakfast buffet was quite good -- free as a HHonors Diamond (and I believe Gold) member; not sure it would be worth the $30 it was charging others. \n\nThere are many areas that need improvement. The biggest two are only two elevators for 27 floors and they are for BOTH staff and guests. Waits of ten minutes happen too often. Night security is a joke. I came back three nights after midnight - walked straight into the lobby to the elevator. No one stopped to see if I belonged. \n\nOther areas that should be noted, and addressed where doable: Rooms are tiny, even by NYC standards. Stains on bedroom ceiling. No hotel room guide (being a frequent traveler, I knew to ask to have sheets changed more than ever few days, or for a room refrigerator. But even I still missed TV directory.) My Diamond upgrade room was a room with from the window, if you peer closely from the corner of the room you can see a smidgen of the Empire State Building. I had to ask! To me an upgrade would be a larger room, a bathrobe, refrigerator, etc. No premium wifi for Diamond guests. Vending\/Ice only on 6 of 27 floors -- especially troublesome given the elevator situation. \n\nAgain because of staff and location, you might want to consider.

Positives: every and I mean every hotel worker was friendly and helpful. No questions re: request for more cookies, and the breakfast staff worked so hard but all were there to help out and ask if I needed more juice, etc. Thanksgiving morning was able to just walk out of the hotel and down the street to see the parade!!! It was so awesome!! Near Macy's and Koreatown plus all the other 34th Ave shops. The room was clean and quiet! Better to have no view IMO and a quieter sleep. Also worked out and all the machines are new. I loved the green paint it felt bright and airy. Cleaning ladies I ran into downstairs were also so nice. \nNegatives: did not like the air freshener\/Febreeze like smell immediately upon room entry. Did not happen last time I stayed. Left note for cleaning lady not to use next day and she did not. Wasn't sure if from hotel or previous guest. Bathroom and room are pretty small.  The heater has a pretty loud vent, though does not smell and after the first night was better regulated. Still could sleep well! \n\n","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and the free cookies at check-in were a nice touch, particularly after a long flight. \n\nThe room was basic but clean and functional with a large screen TV, safe, hairdryer and iron & ironing board. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom well stocked with towels and plentiful hot water. Although we didn't eat at the hotel, we used the bar for pre-dinner drinks and it was very reasonably priced for NYC. Free WiFi was also particularly welcome. \n\nOn the downside, only having two elevators for 25+ floors can result in a long wait and we often found it quicker to walk down the stairs.  Our room was on the sixth floor at the front of the building and didn't seem particularly well soundproofed, with vehicle noise and sirens from the surrounding streets being heard throughout the night. The room was also quite compact which meant limited space to store our suitcase.\n\nHowever, these are minor problems and this is definitely a good base for the budget conscious traveller.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived around 9 am and staff gladly stored our bags until our room was ready. Same for a late afternoon departure flight when they again stored our bags after checkout. The room was good size by NY standards and very clean and well maintained. Linens were above average quality and always plentiful, although some towels were somewhat worn.

When in NY, we usually stay at another large chain hotel a block away, but decided to check out the Doubletree this time.  Not again.  Although the staff was terrific, this is an old property, and there are things that can\u2019t be changed.  Our rating is based on the following:\nService\u2014The staff was friendly and very professional.  We left our bags with the bell captain the morning we checked out, and it was quick and easy on both ends.   \nWiFi\u2014Although they told us there was a secure site to use, and gave us the password, we were never able to access it, and the front desk couldn\u2019t make it work either.  \nRoom\u2014The room was really small.  We are in NY several times a year, and know that most hotel rooms are small.  But here we had to unpack completely, because there was no space for a small suitcase to remain accessible.  There was a temp control on the wall, but it didn\u2019t actually effect the A\/C.  Our experience was that the temp was turned down overnight, which was fine, but at 8am it blasted icy air, which we couldn\u2019t turn down.   The bed was good and it was quiet.  Bathroom was small, but very clean and functional.  There was a small wardrobe, with a safe and plenty of hangers.\nElevators\u2014There are only 2 elevators to service the entire building.  It has 25-26 floors, with 8 rooms per floor.  That means a lot of people and a lot of staff using the same 2 elevators, which take some time to make a trip up and down.  There were times when the doors opened and we saw that the elevator was already full of huge bags of fresh laundry, or a service cart, and we had to wait for the next one.  \nWe were on the 18th floor, and paid extra for a view of the Empire State Building.  Views will certainly vary, depending on the room, but check out the photo from our room, and see if you think it was worth it.  \nThere is a small outdoor courtyard out front, which is nice.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Plus, we didn't book as early as we should have.  Best advice is to book early and keep your eyes on the prices.  \n\nGreat hotel, the best staff and yummy cookies.

A couple of blocks from Madison Square Garden, a few blocks from a direct subway to MoMA. The staff was really welcoming, especially the front desk and bell staff.\n\nI must tell you that the room is small, like Holiday-Inn Express small. I think the hotel is not Doubletree caliber because of the size of the room and the limited amenities. Only with nicer-looking furniture it deserves to be a Doubletree.\n\nNow the hiccups. I called the morning of arrival and was told my reservation is for the next day, even though I had the email confirmation with the correct date. After an hour talking to people on the phone and telling me they didn't have any room available, they straightened it out. No apologies from the hotel but by the end of the episode I was happy to get a room there.\n\nI asked for late checkout and was given initially at 1pm. Apparently the information didn't trickle down to housekeeping, who knocked on the door at 10:30am.\n\nAnyway, that week of the stay UN General Assembly was in town and every hotel in Manhattan charged north of $500 including this hotel. I don't think it's worth that much any other day, but demand really drives the price.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}
