Upon arrival around 5 PM on a Thursday, there were roughly 4-5 parties waiting in the narrow hallway for an elevator (there are 2).  They waited and waited...when a door would open, the elevator was full of staff and things like laundry, they didn't get out so the line got longer.  Due to this, we requested a low floor figuring we'd use the stairs.  The only available was the Lower Level.  Fine.  The staff allowed us to use the stairs and go through an \"employee only\" area to access our room.  So we took the stairs down to the basement to what we somewhat affectionately dubbed \"the Dungeon\".  The room was small as is the norm in NYC, but adequate.  The lighting however was not, particularly in a room that gets almost no natural light.  The AC\/Heat unit is in front of the window, and being in the basement the window was a bit high.  At 5'4\", I basically had to be on tiptoe to open the blinds.  \nThe bed was very comfortable, the internet connected fine, the bathroom was adequate but not stocked well.  Everything was clean and in fact the room smelled of disinfectant.\nThe issue with the room is that it was across the hall from a staff office and we could hear conversations at all hours.\nThe lobby was comfortable and had a small food pantry for snacks.\nThere was nothing \"wrong\" with anything during our stay, but it felt impersonal; maybe it was the lower level space.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-03-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I been staying at this establishment since 2011. My agent introduced me to it and I keep coming back. \n\nFirst of all the location, 45th & 5th Av, you cant beat this location. I like to walk in Manhattan (Manhattan is for walking) and got to know all parts of the city - You cant beat this location. Every hour of the day you can find action around Times Square. I was walking thru Times Square during all hours of the day. The location is also a perfect central position wherever you wanna go: downtown, central park, broadway, upper east upper west.\n\nSecondly the rooms are nice clean and comfortable. They are not too big but most rooms in Manhattan are small. Rooms are fine for 2 persons and very fine for one person. You get a desk and a chair but no closet. There are some hangers to hang clothes.\n\nThird Francesca Gamboa, I was lucky to have her as the receptionist upon my arrival. Friendly, smiling, informative.\n\nThey have a kind of Continental breakfast starting at 06:00; coffee, orange juice, danishes, croissants, bananas. They have a big table at the lobby you can all sit around + some places by the big window. The pics enclosed of the breakfast were taken at 06:00. I was the first guest after a 2 hour walk I took starting at 04:00 AM. I saw NY going to sleep and waking up. In Manhattan you have to make the most of every minute.\n\nI would recommend to put mirrors at the elevators so you can look at yourself before heading out to the city.\n\nI also recommended for them to put a scale for people to weigh their luggage before heading to the airport.\n\nI would also recommend for the hotel to establish a fixed discount if you waive room service during stays of more than 1 night. Many dont need room service every day and it saves the hotel lots of money so why not pass part of those savings to the patrons?\n\nPut a banner - Save the planet and save Money, If you waive room service we discount you lets say a 15$ a day. So if you stay lets say 7 nights, hotel gives you back 105$ and they only service your room upon your check-out. What about giving restaurant coupons as a discount? Restaurants mught give it to hotels for almost free to get a flow of clients. \n\nManhattan is amzing. It's my 32nd visit starting in 1986. Some things change (in 1986 a metro rise was 25c, now it's 2.75$) but Mnhattan is always exciting. Every street and every avenue is a new adventure. \n\nThis hotel is probably one of the best bases while visiting Manhattan and exploring all those adventures. \n\nCome, stay, wake up early, and see all that this city has to offer.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

This took 3 hrs to sort and we were told 3 different stories by members of staff who were blatantly lying they'd overbooked and we met another family the following day who had the exact same thing happen. Not what you need when you've just travelled for 20 hrs with an autistic child and partially sighted adult. I had to be very firm that i wasnt paying for taxis to the next hotel as it was their error and they needed to sort it. Eventually after several phonecalls for permission they agreed if we kept receipts they would reimburse us. I feel this was the least they could do and shouldn't have even been an issue. Rooms were very small I will say clean. However we had no room service for our 4 night stay bins weren't emptied no clean towels provided. There was a trolley permanently sat outside our room 24\/7 so we just helped ourselves I'm not sure if that's the general idea as the other half of our party on a different floor had the same. The breakfast is very basic coffee, orange juice, croissant jam and apples.theres one communal table so if more than 2 families eat at the same time prepare to stand. We actually wish we'd stayed at the first property they put us in but we thought a smaller boutique hotel would be more personal than a big chain. We were wrong! They did offer to remove some of our resort fees for the inconvenience when we checked out this wasn't the case and nobody was around to override the system. So we paid the full amount and the lady said I would get an email and refund when the shift manager arrived well that was 4am thurs and so far nothing.

For example, running check-in like a cheap airline-- late checkout? That will be $20. A room with a nicer view? Another $10-20 a day. Want to leave a bag at the desk after checkout? $5 per bag. The nickel-and-diming is tacky, especially since the price, while cheaper than some (better) hotels in the area, is still significant.\n\nHowever, the reason for my one star, and why I considered leaving almost immediately after check-in: After checking in, I got in the elevator to go to my room, and there was a maintenance man in there with me. He made a flirtatious comment towards me, which made me very uncomfortable (Not me misinterpreting, either-- it was a very blatant come-on) and when I got to my floor, he held the elevator door open and stuck his head out to watch what room I was going to.\n\nI felt like panicking but I tried to just get in as soon as I could. He said something like, \"Want me to come and help open your door?\" and I said \"No, I'm fine\" and he kept insisting, saying he could help me get into my room. In light of the flirtatious comment, and that I am a woman alone with this man, I was feeling super unsafe that this man not only stopped the elevator to watch me go to my room, but was now insisting he come to my door. I was super flustered and repeated I was fine, got into my room, and immediately bolted the door.\n\nIf I had been traveling alone, I would have probably left. Fortunately my male friend was coming to meet me and stay with me. And thank goodness, too, because guess who came by at 7:30 PM, knocking at my door?

Management could care less.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-07-09","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"We booked 3 nights on the week of July 4th. On our very first night when we came back from spending time in the city we came back to take the elevator to our 14th floor room. As soon as my mother stepped in the elevator it fell one and a half stories towards the basement with my mother barely getting in without being crushed to death or losing a limb. We pressed the call button to get help and the guest services employee said they were calling the elevator manufacturer to come get us out. This elevator had no air conditioning or ventilation in July and we were trapped with the door closed. After waiting about 45 minutes the heat was unbearable. We called the desk again and were told the same thing. We finally called 911 because we were drenched through our clothing in sweat and had another French family on with us with 2 small children who were very upset. FDNY came to pull us out after over an hour and were shocked at the heat coming out of the elevator when they opened the door. When I told the front desk person we wanted to be moved to a lower room because we were traumatized by the incident they agreed to move us to the 2nd floor the next day. When we got back from a day in the city the next evening, we packed out things to move to the lower floor. Once we got to the new room, it was not even ready for guests, with linens stripped from the beds, cleaning supplies strewn about everywhere, and a stench of ammonia so strong it burned our throats. I went back to the front desk and he said housekeeping was gone and he could only give us sheets and blankets to make the room ourselves, which I was not even considering doing. With no help from him we moved back to our previous room and unpacked yet again. After all of this trouble we were sick of moving our things around and waiting 30 minutes for the only working elevator. We didn\u2019t receive so much as an apology from the hotel management for this nightmare of a hotel stay. I feel like we should have been compensated in some kind of way or at least apologized to for the trauma and trouble we endured at this hotel.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My two teen daughters and I stayed at the Fairfield Inn Marriott the day before and I regretted not staying there for the rest of the trip. Only good thing about the Citadines Connect is probably the location. Walking distance to most things. \n\nThere's no fridge in room, and only one of 3 ice machines works, and it's located on the 15th or 16th floor. The older male maintenance staff was helpful. After telling him about the machines, he went to get ice for me. \n\nBreakfast hours are from 6:30-9am; consist of stale croissants, stale danishes, almost room temperature yogurt, room temperature orange juice, coffee, hot tea, and bananas. We got breakfast by 7am, so the room temperature items should've still been cold. We stood from 5\/6-5\/9\/22 and it was like that each morning. I didn't bother eating it after the second morning.\n\nThey charge a resort fee ($68.88) for no resort amenities. According to front desk, the amenities are newspaper, phone, breakfast, and WiFi. I can't see being charged for so much on the quality of these items.\n\nThey charge to hold your bags (even if it's only for 3 hours). They charge $5 for every 3 bags. So if you had 6 bags like us, we were charged $10 to hold 3 back packs and 3 roller bags, for 3 hours.\n\nMy linens smelled like a sweaty cologne man, I had to remove the pillow cases and sheet. It didn't seem sanitary.\n\nI did like the bathroom. It was spacious. I did not like they only provided 2 towels. When I questioned for more, they were hesitant and stingy about it. One adult, and two teens, I don't know how only 2 towels are enough. Front desk seen what was reserved and the occupancy. Just be courteous and provide the items, simple.\n\nTV did have cable and HBO, and the window in the room opened a couple of inches so it was nice to have a little fresh air in.\n\nBeds were not comfortable, think it was the springs that you can feel.\n\nIt did come with a small safe and ironing board with iron.\n\nOverall, this stay was average.

It was clean,  newly remodeled in a simple modern decor, perfectly located for walking or the subway, and had very helpful and responsive staff.  We walked to Central Park, Macy's, Times Square, and rode the subway down to lower Manhattan and Greenwich Village. The street in front is not overly busy, but there is a Wendy's across the street, a Walgreens around the corner, and lots of local restaurants only feet from the front door.  Since we flew out on a late flight, the hotel allowed us to store our bags in a locked room for the day at a very minimal price.  Not all hotels offer this service.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":584986,"title":"A Cozy and Comfortable Stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-11-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"New York hotel stays are largely noted for several things. One, you're not there for the room, but to explore the city. Two, you always want an inside room unless you enjoy the serenade of street sounds all night long. Three, you seek safety, comfort, and thick walls blocking neighbors' laughter or TV time. This hotel succeeds, and was a very pleasant stay. First, the location is unbeatable -- a short walk to Grand Central and Times Square, with easy access to Central Park, Bryant Park and Subways to Queens. Second, a 21st floor inside room offered ample space between neighboring buildings and minimal street noise. The lift wasn't a problem as was the case at other mid-range New York hotels in Midtown in past visits. Second, the cozy room has modern furniture and the tight space is appointed appropriately. Yes, we had some minor issues with a broken toilet seat, but maintenance quickly fixed it. The Bigelow bath products are a plus, as is the modern bath -- something still not found in similarly priced, and aged, hotels. Lastly, you cannot beat Francesca and the front desk staff for their professionalism and \"we care\" attitude. This was a very welcomed change from other NYC stays. My wife accompanied me for what was to be a business trip. I worked. She played tourist. And, our stay was one that made us want to come back in a few weeks! Great job Ascott on a lovely stay.

She was able to process our early check-in but with a fee of $50+tax, I was disappointed when I\u2019ve notice and heard the next day that a family of 3 was able to check-in early without paying an early check-in fee and was accommodated right away, it\u2019s unfair that we had to pay for the early check-in fee. Anyways let\u2019s talk about the room, just so you know that this is not a 5 star hotel but I believe this is one of Citadines boutique hotel? (Maybe I\u2019m wrong) but anyways, room is a bit small (of course you\u2019re in NYC, just don\u2019t expect you\u2019re in a luxury hotel) we chose this hotel because time square is just 5 minutes walks and close to Rockefeller, Saks Fifth, Empire State, and Central Park.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":584986,"title":"Truly the worst hotel ever..","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-05-28","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"I would recommend this hotel to anyone that 1. loves to get screwed over or 2. wants to have their luggage stolen from them, then have the hotel never give you the time of day and continually brush you off and after 2 months, not fully reimburse you for the $2500 worth of belongings in the stolen luggage. The general manager of this hotel, Elizabeth Ardiles, does not know how to display good customer service or follow company policies, given the company has policies, probably not though. On the morning of March 30th, we walked in at about 9:30 to check in. Elizabeth told us that the hotel had no hot water (??????), so we decided we would leave our luggage at the hotel while we figured out our plan. When we left, she had told us to put our luggage in the lobby wide out in the open and she would deal with it, which she clearly did not for god knows how long because when we came back one of our backpacks was missing. We came back at around 11:00 to check in for one night, as we would switch hotels the next day since they had no hot water. We check in and I PAY, and then she reveals to us that one of our backpacks was not there. Conveniently enough, the camera footage is lost. She sends me off into the street with some random guy that also works there to go look for the backpack as if we will just find it laying on the street. Elizabeth assures me I will be reimbursed and that I should get an email from the higher ups by the end of the current week, it was Tuesday at the time, or the beginning of the next week. This does not happen, and for the next two months I send email after email, text and call Elizabeth for updates, to which all I am told is to \u201cwait until the end of this week\u201d and \u201cI will email [corporate] again to see what\u2019s going on\u201d. I do not believe that any of that happened though. After a month, I am handed to the controller of what seems to be a different hotel? (The Element New York Times Square), Ivan Bonilla. He asks me for my address to send the check to on April 27th and that\u2019s the last I hear from him. I response in 5 minutes. In my response, I also ask for the amount that will be issued on the check. No response. The next week I email again asking if the check had been mailed. No response. Two weeks after that (May 21st) I email, again. I ask in this email for an update (one I feel I am entitled to) on my check, if it had been mailed yet. No response. I finally received a check on May 24th for less than half the amount of the worth of my items. Not to mention, I\u2019m a college student who does school fully online, so not only did this hotel cause me to lose all the items I use for school, but every assignment, note, and document I\u2019ve taken from my college career. \n\nI think that this was an inside job, and one of the employees at this hotel, if not Elizabeth, took my luggage. There were many cameras in the lobby of this hotel, yet none of the footage was recoverable? What\u2019s the point of the cameras then? Please never stay here. The rooms are insanely small anyways, even for NYC standards, and the night stand in our room wasn\u2019t even level\u2026 you could not place anything on it without it falling over.. Save your money and your sanity. And your stuff.. The other hotel that we went to after was the Hilton Garden Inn on 57th and 3rd. Same price, way better. I recommend you shift your travel plans there if you are on the same kind of budget I was.","travelDate":"2021-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":584986,"title":"Cosy & Friendly...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-03-01","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"The caption above may sound a little odd for a hotel that has 22 floors and 125 rooms, but when in New York, it is all relative, and cosy and friendly Citadines Connect Fifth Avenue New York was.  The hotel is located in the heart of Manhattan, 45th Street between 5th and 6th Avenue and is in close proximity to all the fantastic shopping on 5th and Madison Avenues and to Rockefeller Centre and Radio City. It is a very busy hotel as one would expect, and the small reception\/lobby area that also serves as a communal breakfast and breakout area with an estimated max seating capacity of 20 does not make it easy for anyone trying to navigate his\/her way around.   \n\nCaitlyn, the fantastic resident manager whom most of us who will come to know and meet at least once during our stay, was especially helpful with jostling and managing my unpredictable schedule and unforeseen changes and went out of her way to assist when the hotel was fully booked on the President's Day weekend. For this I am thankful to her and her entire team.\n\nMy room, although basic, is reasonably spacious by New York standards (approx. 17m sq.) and a king size bed fits quite comfortably. There is no wardrobe except for a hanger bar and some shelf space.  Bathroom amenities are of decent quality, and it comes with a full size bathtub, a rarity in a big city hotel. The only drawback is the walls are thin, and there was the cheeky European guest in the adjacent room who stole a couple of puffs in the room. The smoke didn't have to travel very far as there are only 5-6 rooms to a congested floor.  The smoking stopped as soon as management was alerted to it. \n\nBreakfast is included but only a limited selection of fresh fruits, yoghurt, mini muffins and pastries are served, with freshly brewed coffee and tea. The morning occasion becomes rather stressful as the eating area gets so crowded that I didn't even bother having breakfast one morning. The staffs however do encourage us to take what we need and eat it elsewhere, but that defeats the whole purpose of having a relaxing breakfast when you're on vacation, and, when it's 9 Fahrenheit outside. I would hope that management would seriously consider either upping the spread and the space or perhaps not including it at all. Having an unpleasant breakfast experience will mar any customer\u2019s overall satisfaction.  And if the hotel continues its breakfast offering, please also consider including a hot cereal, especially in winter, that, I\u2019m sure anyone would appreciate. One is not asking for a full English breakfast here.  The Grab and Go (refrigeration) corner in the eating area is a great feature that stocks cold juices, water, fruit snacks and yoghurt and any guest can purchase the items at any time.    \n\nThe business space, located on the lower level and though small, serves a useful purpose for urgent printouts.  It is equipped with new 2 new iMacs and a printer.  I had to print a few documents during my stay and to my pleasant surprise, they were free of charge. One gets so used to being charged an arm and leg elsewhere (\u2639) so this was a really nice touch (\ud83d\ude0a).  \n\nNotwithstanding, and in spite of a few shortcomings,  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who would like a reasonably priced*, cosy and friendly accommodation in the very heart of a fabulous city that is New York.  \n\n* non-holiday off peak rates.  Holiday rates are comparable with other major hotels in NYC which range $150-$250 for a Premier Room King.  \n\n*****","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and never had any problems with noise or anything else. Our room was on the first floor. Since our room was facing the inner courtyard (construction site), we had no view at all, but we didn't care, we weren't in New York to look out the window. The hotel is in a really good location, in 10 minutes you can walk to the Time Squer and you can easily walk to the Empire Statue Building (about 20 minutes). You can also be at the Grand Central Station in 10 minutes, from there you can easily reach everything you want by subway. In 15 minutes you are in Centeal Park (walking). So the location of the hotel is just great. Very, very friendly and helpful staff who are available 24 hours a day. The breakfast is grab and go, so for those who value breakfast very much, you should plan your breakfast outside. There are small muffins, orange juice, coffee, tea, yoghurt ....\nFor us this was sufficient, we are not big breakfasts it was absolutely sufficient and otherwise there is a Starbucks right across the street. There is a great pub 10 meters further on (higly recommended, I will also write something about it). The rooms are \"small\" (without wardrobe) but you have everything you need, a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. I definitely recommend this hotel and the fact that you have to pay the hotel bill right at the beginning is very common so nothing to worry about.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The NYC location has less than the international locations. I like the Ascott properties because they have access to washer dryers, which is nice as I'd rather handle my own laundry, and those properties have small kitchen areas. After a day of exploring, sometimes it's nice to come back, cook for yourself, and relax. The NYC location doesn't have that, but what it does have is a great location just blocks from Bryant Park. I used to live in NYC and was in town for a conference and to visit friends. Being in midtown made it very easy for me to get around whether I was heading uptown or over to Brooklyn. \n\nThe staff was pleasant and helpful. Since I used to live in NYC, I didn't need too much hand holding, so I can't comment on how helpful they are regarding that. \n\nThe breakfast can get busy. I got in the habit of coming down with a small bag to grab what I wanted and get some hot water for tea. The lobby is crowded with lots of folks mostly from Europe it seems. It's just too crowded for me, so I'd head back upstairs to eat. \n\nThe next time I'm heading to NYC, this will be one of the first locations that I check. ","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

I read reviews saying the room is noisy with noise from doors and bad soundproofing. The Hotel replied back and promise people they will get them a better and quieter room the next time they stay there. So, this is what I did.. I contacted them to make an enquiry to place me in a quieter room. They answer me within 24 hours and assure me they made a notification to the hotel. I arrive on the day and reconfirm to the front desk that I made a special request. They got the notification alright. Once I was in my floor (6th floor) I was placed at the same floor with a group of young tourists from France. Let me tell you, in my floor there are only 6 rooms. All rooms more or less are not far from the elevator. So when a group of people from 3 or 4 bedroom from the same floor are talking in the corridor or 6 to 8 people talking in a bedroom, there is no way you can\u2019t hear them. \nSo,.. be ready to hear noise from the moment other rooms open their doors, close the doors and talking in the corridor while waiting for the elevator or even worse when they hang out in the corridor and talk. There is no way the hotel can give you a quiet room if all the room layout is the same as the 6th floor. Unless the floor you are in only occupied by you only or 2 other people who understand the situation and try to be decent and respected guests. I think it is a design flaw and they need to put more soundproofing material in the corridor and choose a better door closing system so they don't make too much noise.\u00a0 \nHaving said all that, the location of the hotel is very good; it is in the middle of all I need to be. Room is always clean and you got free simple breakfast (be ready to wait for your table).\n","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Anyone else is going to be disappointed. SO much wrong, I won't cover everything here. But the things that stand out:\n\nRooms are very small - there is about a foot of space between the beds and the walls, 2 feet to the sort-of desk unit. There is no closet, no chest of drawers, just hangers on a bar and a couple nooks and small drawers in the desk unit. My room had two beds, one became my staging are so there would be a little room on the desk to work. WiFi is decent, but needs regular reminders. Mounted heater\/air conditioner is noisy, but otherwise the room was quiet and the bed was comfortable. The message light on the phone blinks constantly - the hotel doesn't take messages, and they can't turn off the blinking. Electronic key entry never worked the first time: twice it worked on the 5th pass, once I had to go back to the lobby to get a new key. The TV system is run form a cable box under the desk and a remote. Don't aim the remote at the TV - it won't work. When I arrived it was set to Spanish speaking and a golf game I couldn't get out of. A tech guy came and showed me how to get other stations, but still in the Spanish system. This morning nothing worked. Another guy came, spent about 10 minutes with no luck, then went off to do something somewhere else. 10 minutes later things began working - and I now have TV, stations I couldn't get yesterday and options in English. Other reviewers have covered their very basic breakfast, served at one large communal table in the small lobby. The table between the beds has rounded edges: if things aren't in the center, they roll off onto the floor. The cheap adjustable lamp had two positions: up and down. Whatever would have allowed you to adjust it, was worn out. There are 22 floors and 2 elevators. If you miss one, expect a wait.\n\nThis is the kind of hotel you sometimes find in 3rd world countries: hastily and cheaply built. A client booked this hotel for me, but it's not suitable for business. Had I known in advance, I would not have made this trip, or would have booked my own room somewhere else. I seriously considered moving anyway, but figured I could stand it for one night. Hotels in New York are not expensive this time of year. For my needs, it would have been well worth paying more to have a decent hotel. Look closely at the photos online. Business travelers and grownup should not consider this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We booked the Hotel on Hotwire and paid for a King Bed. When we arrived, we were told we did not pay for a king bed. Our reservation clearly states 1 room king bed 2 adults. The young lady at the front desk is very nice, but she blamed the mistake on Hotwire. Sadly she stated there were no rooms available with a king bed so we were basically stuck with two double beds. My wife and I were determined to not allow anything to ruin our trip. We took the room which was very nice and just dealt with it.\n\nThe Hotel offers free breakfast in the morning which isn't much of anything. Coffee yogurt cereal and some muffins. Breakfast is served in the lobby which I felt is very tacky. Too small of a space to have all of these people hoarding around. We skipped the free breakfast and went elsewhere. \n\nCustomer service was good. Just make sure you get the room you pay for. That alone will have us not staying here in the future.

Bathroom facilities were good. Good place if want to discover especially Times Square and Bryant Park etc... Wifi was good, even tho on 19th floor. Room was good size,  bathroom was clean and good. Nothing special tho. Free luggage storage, big plus for that. Housekeeping was friendly. Front desk stuff wasn't the friendliest or most helpful. Didn't get to experience the breakfast in neither mornings, was 2 mins late from it so was refused to get a cup of coffee. But breakfast looked like pre packed muffins and juice etc. My second night, mysterious smell of cigarettes came in to my room (on 19th floors?!?!), my jacket etc still smells like cigarettes smokes. Fire alarm kept going off in some of the room more than few times during the evening\/night. Mentioned this to front staff at the night, nothing got done to it. Basic and clean hotel, definitely seen a lot worst but nothing mind blowing either. Nice refurbished rooms, but thats pretty much it.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"SOLO"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":584986,"title":"Excellent location, friendly staff, good breakfast, free luggage storage","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-10-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"We stayed here for the October Billy Joel concert at Madison Square Garden.  The rooms were very comfortable.  I loved the pull down blackout shades that leave no room for cracks of light in the window.  I need those in my house.  The breakfast was all  the stuff I usually eat: fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, muffins, juice and coffee.  Hard-boiled eggs would have made it complete.  The first night I stayed very comfortably in the bedroom and heard minimal noise.  But the second night I stayed on the pullout sofa.  The noise while sleeping in that living room was very loud.  Lucky for us we were on the 16th floor, but unlucky for me that the living room is right next to the maid's closet. I wanted to sleep in until 9:30 on a Sunday, but was awoken by the cleaning people opening trash bags in their closet over and over again starting at about 7:00 a.m., and a lot of other rustling noises I couldn't identify.  So my advice is if you get the suite, put your heavy sleepers in the living room, because my son said he didn't hear any noise in there at all on the first night.  There is no maid service each morning like there is at a typical hotel, but I always find that annoying anyway when I come in and all my stuff is moved around.  The furnishings and decor of the room were nice.  A plus to this facility is that when we checked out at 11:00 on Sunday, our flight was not until 8:30 p.m., and they stored our luggage for free.  They have a very organized system for doing so, and most hotels charge extra for this.  For this reason, I give this hotel an excellent rating.  Also, the location of this hotel for the price can not be beat.  It is close to Times Square, about a mile from Central Park, close to Rockefeller Center, and just a few blocks from Grand Central.  We walked about a mile to Madison Square Garden.  Overall, I am completely satisfied with this hotel and would stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}
