The location of the hotel is excellent, welcome, cleanliness of the rooms too. The room used for breakfast is inadequate and can accommodate 72 people and even if they open from 6.30 until 9.00, if you decide to take it easy you are in trouble because the queue reaches the hall. Having said this, in my humble opinion and given what is offered, you should first spend $10 and have breakfast outside. At breakfast you will find bread for toast, jams, butter, honey, cereals, milk, coffee, fruit, waffles (where there is an endless queue), muffins, eggs and a sort of hamburger immersed in a slop that I had never seen. It is not an American breakfast where cheese, cold cuts, bacon and spreadable chocolate are missing... As for the rooms, with furnishings and a slightly old-fashioned concept, it must be added that the photos taken with a wide angle will give you a quadruple (as in my case) which is nothing more than a double with two very small queen size beds where you sleep uncomfortable.

This sound also occurred when any neighboring room showered. \n\nThe elevators, again at least on the 7th floor, made a faint whirring sound like what you'd hear when walking on a sidewalk and a subway passes underneath. As Elwood Blues said \"You get used to it\", however,  light sleepers might have a challenge. \n\nHousekeeping schedule was odd - first day, room cleaned by 10AM.  No service the next day, third day no bed service but housekeeping knocked about 5PM to pick up trash and offer clean towels. \n\nSmall thing, but odd - TV comes on at 100% volume, so if you forget the mute button it blasts you out. \n\nOverall, a good stay.

The hotel is quite pleasant, staff from reception to the restaurant were all friendly and helpful.

I know it's not the fault of the hotel, but I can only rate it on what it's like. Which is pretty rough. Homeless and beggars all over the local streets and a lot of drug taking, in fact most of the Garment District to a couple of blocks north of Times Square was unpleasant to walk around, especially after dark. The one good point is that the subway (Port Authority Bus Terminal) is at the end of the street, really handy for getting to Lower Manhattan etc. We had a couple of small issues with the room when we got there which were sorted out quickly, and the complimentary breakfast was a plus point.

The bed was fine.  The employees were extremely friendly and helpful.  We were able to keep our baggage stored for a few hours after checkout but before we transferred to a different hotel close to LGA.  The room is tiny, but that is to be expected in NYC, however, the hallway on floor 5 is barely wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side.  And the cabinets outside of the elevator doors made the hallway feel very claustrophobic.   We did not eat breakfast here as the selection was lackluster -- they were out of eggs and while the plain bagel might have been ok, once you sliced it, it was covered in gunk from everyone else's bagels.  Probably not a deal breaker for most people, but was definitely a deal breaker for my picky 8 year old.

We requested a ride to La Guardia airport on July 2, in the morning (8 am), at the hotel front desk. They called for a flat rate taxi and told us to wait for a black car to arrive. A black car was waiting a few minutes later; instead, front desk staff guided us to a private (run-down, not black) car at the door, apparently not belonging to any company, no sign of any license to transport passengers. Once started, it became apparent that the driver had no idea how to get to the airport, tried to navigate himself with his phone GPS, driving with one hand, while holding his phone in the other. Still he missed the obvious airport sign on the way and took a wrong exit and took us to a detour on small streets and finally getting back to the freeway later...the car had no AC. A passing car tried to warn that something was wrong on the left side of the car, but the driver said it was OK. Then he started to demand cash payment before arriving at the airport...Fairfield Inn Times Square hotel should know about this scam ride (probably used on other guests too) and hold any hotel staff, who is involved, accountable, to end this dangerous practice...Future guest should also be aware of this scam, if they plan a flat rate ride arranged by front desk staff.

As a general line the whole experience was a 5 out of 10. The hotel offers just enough for a decent stay: OK bedrooms and great location. \n\nRooms: The size of the room is OK for 2 people. We booked a 2 double bed bedroom for 3 people and it was a little awkward to move around. Storage isn't enough even for 1 person. The bathroom is OK.  Beds are comfortable. \n\nAmenities: The room has a kettle with few tea bags and coffee samples, small fridge, safe, microwave, clothing iron and a tv with Netflix. All in good condition. \n\nCleaning: The cleaning service just operates every other day and the cleaning days weren't that clean. We didn't always get the full set of towels (1 towel per person, rarely got hand towels) needed in the room and it was barely dusted. \n\nEntrance and services: The hotel hosts a large number of guests which usually crowd at the lobby making it difficult to access the help counter. \n\nElevators don't suffice the daily transit to the lobby. The high number of guests and floors create long lines every morning during breakfast hours for people to go up and down their room. \n\nBreakfast was poor. We all understand the challenges of serving a good breakfast during covid, but it was far from good. The choices were limited and the quality of the food was towards bad. \n\nStaff: Everyone was nice and helpful.\n\nLocation: Location is great. Super centric and easy to travel around the island by metro, walking, bus or taxi. Lots of restaurants and entertainment close by. Probably the best asset of this hotel. \n\nOverall, the experience wasn't bad, but far from great.

When you arrive, it will make an authorization for the whole stay. And when you leave, will make another charge for the stay, instead of taking it from the authorization. Took them 3 weeks to drop the authorization. In that time they completely ignored my mails asking about it.\n* The 1st time the housekeeping was done, I noticed they reprogrammed the AC unit to keep it off and with a lower temperature by default.

We had a total of 4 rooms, which took a while to secure because we had to wait for rooms to be released as people didn't check in--totally understand that. We made sure that our high school students in our group had rooms, and by the time I made it to my room at 2:45am, I was exhausted. By 3am, I crawled into bed, only to realize that it was wet. It had an odor to it as well. This was really odd as the bed was perfectly made. I left the sheets down, and moved to the other bed in the room, which was thankfully dry. In the morning I could see a large yellow pee stain on the sheets in the area that had been wet. We let the management know at the front desk the next morning, and their only response was that I should have called down to let them know at 3am. I was incredibly surprised and disappointed that at a Marriott hotel I would first have a bed wet with pee in a \"clean\" room, but that there was little support from the hotel staff, other than I should have called them. We were led to believe the hotel was completely full as we had to keep waiting for rooms to come available (which wasn't a problem), and it was 3am. This was not the best stay at a Marriott property.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Permanentemente, luc\u00eda amargada, triste, frustrada, con el ce\u00f1o fruncido cuando se le hablaba.

Es importante tener en cuenta que en la cuadra del hotel queda una sede de NYS DOCCS (New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision), entidad estatal encargada del control y supervisi\u00f3n de los reclusos, que se deben presentar en las oficinas. Hay permanentemente filas de reclusos en el d\u00eda (esto garantiza una presencia policial permanente si bien la cuadra no se ve muy amigable debido a esto). Adicionalmente, en los d\u00edas y las noches se ve mucha mendicidad y drogadicci\u00f3n en la cuadra. La cuadra es oscura y  sucia. En todo caso, se rescata la practicidad de la ubicaci\u00f3n, ya que desde all\u00ed es muy f\u00e1cil organizar recorridos a toda la ciudad: a la vuelta queda la estaci\u00f3n de buses y Metro de 42nd Street Port Authority. A 6 minutos a pie, la de Times Square. Est\u00e1 \u00faltima conecta con m\u00e1s l\u00edneas de Metro y Tren. El aseo s\u00f3lo se hace si uno lo pide desde el d\u00eda anterior. El desayuno es una bolsa con un jugo de caja, una barra de granola y el bagel m\u00e1s duro de Nueva York ( con queso para esparcir), que hay que reclamar (\u00fanicamente) entre 7 y 9 am en la recepci\u00f3n. Es un sitio \u00fanicamente para llegar a dormir, que en el fondo es lo que uno necesita en Manhattan. Las habitaciones son c\u00f3modas. El estado de las llaves del agua deber\u00eda mejorar porque gotean. Si uno quiere caf\u00e9 tiene que comprar agua embotellada en la calle, y pedir en la recepci\u00f3n vasos de cart\u00f3n y sobres de caf\u00e9 en polvo para preparar en la cafetera de la habitaci\u00f3n. Hab\u00eda visto en algunas rese\u00f1as el tema del olor a marihuana, pero es algo que no es propio simplemente del hotel, sino de la zona de la ciudad: en los alrededores, cada cuadra tiene una o dos convenience stores que venden productos de marihuana para fines recreativos, as\u00ed que es cada vez m\u00e1s com\u00fan ver gente fumando en la calle, sobre todo ahora que no est\u00e1 penalizado el consumo. Pero es cierto, la cuadra entera huele a marihuana. Tanto que cuando uno entra al hotel siente que adentro tambi\u00e9n permanece el olor, si bien uno no ve a nadie fumando adentro. El bar del hotel, as\u00ed como el gimnasio, y la cafeter\u00eda est\u00e1n cerrados por las restricciones sanitarias y de aforo de la ciudad (abril de 2021). En conclusi\u00f3n, es pr\u00e1ctico si bien hay muchas cosas por mejorar.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A friend was having a birthday party at the sky room and we had another event in the city the next day so thought it would be better to just stay. Glad we did. \n\nThe room was decent (nothing to write home about) bed was comfy, staff was nice. Check out is at 12 which I loved! Breakfast was nothing to write home about, we decided to get breakfast elsewhere. \nParking is ridiculously expensive. $74\/day, 60-70 if you self park! We booked an ipark spot a few hours before for $56. The garage was a 4 min walk away. For us it was worth it being that we were coming from Long Island and a round trip train ticket was about $50 for the both of us. It just felt easier to drive. Traffic getting to the city can always be challenging but it was fine for us. \n\nOverall, I would stay again. It was exactly the getaway I needed! \n\nHappy Yelping :) ","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a city view room on the 30th floor - had a great view of the empire state. Rooms themselves are spacious. From previous reviews I was expecting a tiny room, but there was more than enough space to store clothes etc from 2 large suitcases. Room decor is nice and has a modern feel. We had a huge TV with Netflix. The bed was amazing - I had the best nights' sleep here! Didn't hear any noise from outside either. Breakfast is great especially considering it's included; something for everyone and lovely starbucks coffee too. Location was just perfect, literally minute's walk into the centre of times square, but plenty of bars, restaurants, transport links even closer on the way. There is a subway entrance just further up the street, a bus terminal across the street and a handy bus close by (on 42nd street) that goes east-west and vice versa across the island, from the Intrepid museum on the west to the UN building on the east. \n\nAll in all, a fabulous stay and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in NYC, hopefully sooner rather than later!","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The two double bed room had very little room to move around. And the double beds were among the most narrow that we\u2019ve used - really tough to fit two adults in one of these beds. There was an instant coffee maker but no kettle. We received a free bottle of water each day. There\u2019s a beverage fridge in the room as well. Good Paul Mitchell toiletries. No shower cap but they do provide makeup wipes. The wardrobe had a safe in it but since the wardrobe was tilted forward, the safe door would swing open if it wasn\u2019t locked which caused a few head bumps. \n\nThe breakfast was ok - somewhat typical free hotel breakfast. If you don\u2019t go down for breakfast by 9, expect to wait a while. The line stretched to the checkin desk on one morning when we were late going down. We had to wait over 25 mins to get a table. It probably is not a good sign that there\u2019s a printed sign stating average wait times (during weekdays only). I suspect the weekend wait times are a lot longer. \n\nThe location is not bad - centrally located to Times Square, etc. \n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms are small. Our room and the hotel were clean. The worst part is the bathroom. It has no counter space.It just has a couple narrow glass shelves. The make up mirror gets in the way of the main mirror.  The mirror in the  hall outside of the bathroom is positioned in a spot so that if you leave the bathroom door open anyone in the hotel room can see right in the bathroom. The walk in tile shower is very nice. The beds were comfortable. The elevators are very fast which was great. I've stayed in New York hotels before that ran me  late for functions because the elevators were slow so.This is a big deal. The location is ok that's about it. The hotel is on the backside of the port authority bus terminal. This gives it a little back street feel. The bus terminal does have a shopping mall inside where you  buy anything you might need and a walgreens is right around the corner. Their is a sub way stop on the corner. The hotel is not far from most tourist attractions  but isn't real close to most tourist attractions either if that makes sense.  This hotel is  on my list of places to stay next Christmas season.

Checking in was easy and simple, we were greeted with a glass of wine. The lady on reception chatted with me about how it was my first time in NY and asked what my plans were for the weekend, then proceeded to provide me with details on the Thanksgiving Day parade when I told her we were planning to see it.\n\nThe lobby is small, but there are public toilets for use (you may need a key card from reception  but they're happy to give it to you as a guest). There are 3 lifts for use - having read previous complaints about the lift, my personal experience suggests you can disregard these complaints. Wait was not long and on times when there was a queue for the Skyroom (which by the way was separate and those visitors had access through a side door), the security guard on shift always prioritised guests for lift use.\n\nThe rooms are very spacious with all the necessary amenities; safe, hairdryer, TV, iron & ironing board, complimentary toiletries, spare pillows, towels, wardrobe and free WiFi. King size bed is huge and very comfortable! Plug sockets and USB ports in multiple places all over the room, including by the bed. We were staying on the 21st floor and were not disturbed by noise during the night, from either the skyroom or the streets below. \n\nBreakfast was included, this along with free WiFi throughout were among the top reasons why I chose this hotel. We did have to queue on the Friday, but being the day after Thanksgiving I think this can be expected. On offer was hot food (Turkey sausages, sometimes bacon, lots of egg choices), cereals, fruit, breads, juices and hot drinks. The toaster wasn't the best, twice round and bread was still warm rather than toasted. Whilst I wouldn't say it was the best variety around, simply having a free option for breakfast was welcomed. It was an all you can eat type buffet allowing you to eat as much or as little as you wanted. \n\nThe 24hr reception was also fantastic. Being tourists in NYC for the first time meant we were coming and going at all times of day - leaving at 5am for the Macy's Parade, returning at 1am one night having visited Top of The Rock and Times Sq. Staff were always cheerful and friendly.\n\nUpon checkout, they were happy to store our luggage for the few hours we were still in the city after checkout. The bellman also arranged a taxi to take us to the airport, and then another bellman managed to bring our taxi booking forward when we queried whether we could leave earlier. All done with smiles on their faces!\n\nIn regards to location, I honestly can't see how anyone could feel unsafe in this area (referencing previous TripAdvisor views I read prior to my stay). The Fairfield is sandwiched between two other hotels, one of which is a Doubletree by Hilton, so there are people coming and going down the street constantly. This hotel is situated just off 8th Ave, around the corner from the Bus Terminal. It has easy access to a subway station (just at the end of the road) and many popular attractions are with a fifteen minute walk or so - Times Square, Madison Square Garden, Madame Tussauds, Big Bus Hop On Hop Off stops etc. \n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience. Thank you to all at Fairfield for making my stay a comfortable one and for helping to make my very first trip to New York a pleasant one. I would highly recommend this hotel.

I could hardly believe I found this gem for an amazingly low price compared to other hotels in the area, and after checking the beautiful photos and positive reviews, I decided to go for it. \n\nOn the whole I was not disappointed. The room had a large comfortable bed and looked at least as nice as rooms in the more expensive hotels I've stayed at in the past. The fitness center was adequate enough for me to continue my fitness routine and the rate included breakfast which was great. \n\nIsabella Luo was an excellent front desk agent. She handled the check-in process in a quick and professional manner and was warm and smiley throughout the entire process. Definitely added to my stay as this was the very first impression at the hotel. She even saw me as she was leaving to finish her shift and made sure once again that everything was okay. \n\nLocation really was amazing- 2 minute walk from Time Square, the subway, and a lot of cool bars. I really enjoyed just walking around and exploring.\n\nAnother nice surprise was the complimentary Starbucks coffee available every morning.  \n\nThere were a few things that can be improved:\n\n1)  Waiting on line for breakfast was quite frustrating. Either add more tables and chairs, or perhaps consider allocating different breakfast times for different rooms? On my 3rd day there I actually gave up after waiting over a half hour to enter the breakfast and went out to buy a bagel.\n2) The breakfast itself was very simple, and there were almost no vegetables or healthy options. \n3) I was staying at this hotel for work, and there was a business center advertised. This is misleading as in reality the 'business center' constitutes 2 desktop computers in a small crevasse right outside where breakfast is served, crowded by those standing online for breakfast. Not exactly ideal working conditions.\n4) Individually wrapped plastic cups is a huge waist of plastic. Using plastic cups is bad enough, but each individual plastic cup in this hotel seemed to be wrapped in another layer of plastic, which I saw in my bathroom, the gym, and at breakfast. \n\nDespite the above points, I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to others. Next time I have a few days in NYC I would definitely consider staying again if the rate stays as low as it was. Excellent value.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This hotel was booked by accident as we thought we had booked the Fairfield at the 33rd Street location (booking error on our end).  However, our experience at the 40th street location was positive.  Our room was nice and comfortable.  We had a nice bed, soothing shower, good Wi-Fi and a decent amount of storage.  The hotel offered free breakfast, which worked for our needs.  A word of advice, try the breakfast as early as possible as the queue to get in gets a little long after 9 am.  The elevators for the hotel traveled fast (something that is rare in NYC hotels).  Location-wise, it worked well.  We were close to Times Square, Port Authority (next door) and not far from Penn Station.  We attended Comic Con at the Javits Center, which was only a 10 minute walk away.  The A,C and E subway line was just down the street from the hotel entrance, which was very convenient.  The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly.  The lobby is a bit small and can get crowded at times.  One note of negativity (and not directed toward the hotel) is there was some riff-raff and homeless folks as you got closer to 8th Ave.  We didn't get harassed, but it was troublesome walking through the crowd with their drug activity and such, especially later at night.  Maybe being close to Port Authority you get that presence.  Otherwise, a very nice stay and would stay again.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. Also, the room was spotless and quiet. I notice the little details when it comes to cleanliness and this is one of the few hotels that spends a little extra money to enclose a mattress in an impermeable zipped cover. I always feel so much better sleeping in a bad where the mattress is protected. A clean room and good night sleep are my two top priorities and this hotel met them. I was adjacent to the elevator and still did not hear a thing.\n\nAs far as the bad, hands down, the elevators. On a good day, it is possible to routinely wait 5-10 minutes for one of the two elevators. On a bad day, like the day I was there (with a broken elevator), I waited up to 15 minutes on multiple occasions. Clearly, this is not a new issue. There must be something that can be done to address the problem. Otherwise, one just needs to plan on calling an elevator 10-15 minutes before needed OR stay on a low enough floor to use the stairs. \n\nThe location is what it is. It's not the fault of the hotel that the block its located on is a little sketchy. I wasn't bothered by it and did not feel unsafe. The hotel is quite convenient to major transit hubs at both Columbus Circle and Times Square. \n\nWhile this won't be my first choice to return, I would come back if the price was right. In face, I chose this time because the price was far less than other typical options.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is superbly located for Times Square and all the Hop on Hop Off buses operate from there, but we also walked to Grand Central Station, Bryant Park, The Rockefeller Plaza, Empire State Building, Macy's and the start of the High Line with ease from this hotel.  The hotel is very clean and the staff are incredibly helpful and attentive, they also have a lovely complementary breakfast in the mornings, as well as complementary coffee and drinks in reception throughout the day.  As it was my husbands birthday trip they also went to the extra effort of putting balloons and a bottle of wine in our room.  We booked the 2 double bed room which was very comfortable and well equipped, as there are only 8 rooms on each floor we did not hear any noise from any other quests, you do hear a very slight amount of road noise but hey you are in New York. I would definitely stay here again especially as the Hotel arranged our taxi back to JFK at an all in charge of $70.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I'll start with the good--they allowed me to check in early. I arrived around noon and check in is 4. I think I wound up with a lower quality room as a result, but I was really just happy to be able to check in. Also, the room was clean. Location was somewhat convenient in that you are not too far from Times Square, but the location was much more of a negative than a positive.\n\nNow, here's what was bad about the hotel. The biggest problem is the street it is on. 40th Street between 8th and 9th Ave has historically been a horrible block. I lived in NYC for 15 years and this was just a street you would avoid. Well, not much has changed. The liquor store which attracts the scum of the earth is still there. There are numerous disgusting, unpleasant people on the street at all hours of the day. And you are directly across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the worst place in all of NY and possibly the world. As for the hotel itself, it apparently has a roof top bar which attracts a crowd. This makes the elevators really slow. I waited 5 minutes for one when I was trying to get to dinner, and I eventually gave up and took the stairs down 5 flights. This bar scene is really pretty unpleasant. The elevators get filthy and there was a lot of highly intoxicated people outside when I got back later that night.\n\nOther problems was the street noise (I was on the 5th floor so maybe it's not so bad higher up?), a really uncomfortable bed, a long wait for hot water in the shower, and a horrible grinding noise when the shower was on. Also, cleaning equipment and supplies in the hallway the entire time I was there.\n\nDefinitely would not recommend this hotel. I hate to think of tourists spending a week here for their vacation.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Depending on when you went down to eat, you either walked in or there was a line up.  But they were very quick to clean up and see you quickly.\nThe staff during the day need to be a little more friendly.  I asked a simple question and the lady did not even understand what I was saying.  I even turned to another guest and asked if I was speaking proper English.\nWe did a problem in our bathroom on the last day.  When I called down to the front desk they informed me that someone would be right up.  Well it took them 30 minutes to come to our room to fix the issue.\nThe other thing was the elevators. There were only 2 running each day and you would have to wait at least 10 minutes or more to go downstairs.  Many people walked down the stairs.  This was very inconvenient especially when you are checking out with luggage, who wants to drag it down 20 flights of stairs?\nIf you are staying at this hotel on Friday or Saturday night...be warned for the Sky Room nightclub.  There are lines of people outside the hotel and again 1 elevator dedicated to the bar.

Overall a good hotel. My room is small but not atypical for Manhattan hotels. Mainly, the AC works really well. I believe it turns off when I leave the room, but it was able to quickly cool the room on one of the hottest days this summer. Room and bathroom were spotless.\n\nI went up to the rooftop bar dressed in jeans and sneakers, and felt underdressed - drinks were pricey (normal for NYC) and food not bad. There are two levels up top. The top-level was loud and full of young 20-somethings looking to hookup, and fairly well-dressed. For some of the commenters complaining they were not allowed up there, my take is for me it was not a fit anyways. I felt more comfortable in the area one floor below the top level.\n\nCons:\nElevators are very slow. After waiting for 15 minutes, I decided to walk downstairs from the 16th floor.\n\nBreakfast lines can be long unless you get up early when they start serving. They have signs in the lobby in the morning telling you the expected wait time based on what time you make it down for breakfast.\n\nTip: If you are in the breakfast line, talk to a staffer about a to-go box. I just walked up to the left of the line and asked. They had a staffer announce that to us when we were in line. That way you do not have to wait for a seat, and you can take your breakfast up to your room.\n\nI have to hand it to the staff.

Got a great price on the room so i cannot complain but staying in many hotels the service level here was just lacking. I know this is a fairfield inn but still. Upon arriving at 10-11 pm we were given a room with one king bed after requesting 2 double beds online. We were told the hotel was completely sold out. Which would have made sense if i didnt look online and see multiple rooms available, with double beds. Even after bringing this up to the front desk, they said we are sold out completely, without even checking the system to see there were rooms available. It was almost like the higher ups told them to just tell everyone they were sold out. Just weird.  Not too big of a deal though, we got over it and just slept together. My biggest suggestion for this hotel, is to open the rooftop to YOUR guests, at any time of day. We woke up early to have some coffee and relax on the roof but could not even get up to the roof top because it is only opened at night for the bar located there. We ended up just walking up the steps and hanging on the roof regardless but it was trashed from the night before. I also understand dress code, but i saw multiple guests staying at the fairfield inn, get turned away from going to get a drink on the roof because they were not properly dressed. a man and his wife were wearing very nice clothing but he had on sandals, and was turned away and told there was nothing they could do. Guests expecting a hotel with rooftop access, it is completely separate from the hotel and you will not be allowed to the rooftop unless dressed properly.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

In a really busy morning, for instance, Keitha, who was probably managing to feed and find tables for over 100 people, was nothing but smiles, effectiveness, efficiency, and professionalism.

Expect low water pressure from time to time, lack of hot water (which has happened to me here once, so I don\u2019t want to make it sound like an epidemic, but I do wonder if a revitalized infrastructure project may not prevent it in the future) and a broken elevator, but I guess that\u2019s to be expected?

Fairfields inn & suites is an okey hotel if you look at service, rooms, staff etc. What is wrong is their total ignorance of the environment. \n\nLike most other hotels they do have signs in the bathroom that they hope their customers reuse the towels to save water. On the door they kindly ask you to turn of the aircondition to save power for the environment. So far so good. \n\nThe problem is when you enter the breakfast area in the morning and they don\u00b4t have anything else than single use plastic cups, single use plastic cutlery, single use coffee mugs and plates. This is where we can talk about wasting resources. \n\nI contacted Fairfield Inn about this and got a short answer. I quote:\n\"Unfortunately we are not a full service hotel so we do not have the opportunity to use glassware in our breakfast area.\" \n\nI won't stay there again until they have fixed this or leased the breakfast to another hotel nearby where their guests can have breakfast.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Rooms are -not- guaranteed however!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We reserved a king bed directly with Marriott, and emailed the hotel directly to let them know that we would be checking in late and asked about a shuttle. They acknowledged and said they don't have a shuttle, but recommended cab or Uber. \n\nWe ended up coming in a few hours later due to the fog over NYC and took a cab for a flat $35 (around 2am - to note they asked if we wanted them to book a flat rate cab back to the airport for $50 on checkout day.)\n\nThe front desk staff was friendly, and we checked in quickly and headed to our room and exhaustedly collapsed into bed (We had been up for ~24 hours straight at that point).\n\nWe both woke up in agony, our backs were in bits. It was only in the morning that we looked around and realized that we were in a queen bed, accessible suite. When we travel, we either book a king, or two queens. We went to the front desk and pointed out the error and said we wanted to get our original booking of a king bed.  She said they would store our bags while we went out to the city and when we got back they would find us a new room.\n\nAfter repacking, we went down for breakfast. I don't know why people are saying the line ups are 20 minutes +, we have only ever waited a couple of minutes and have gone at various times throughout our stay. While nothing special, it was handy and had hot\/cold variety and was a nice touch to get the day started. The ladies in the breakfast area were all incredibly friendly and worked their socks off keeping the food items stocked. Thank you ladies!\n\nThis location is great for walking everywhere, the subway has multiple lines within steps, there is a pharmacy on the corner.  There are a couple of undesirables gathered outside the parole office (a couple of doors down) at night, but they ignored us when we walked by.\n\nWe got in, checked into our new room. It was clean, to be fair both rooms were clean. The king room was a little cramped, but that's par for the area. Limited toiletries, but they have facial wipes, so that was nice.\n\nWhen we went out for dinner, the third elevator was solely being used for the rooftop bar, so lines ups were long to get to\/from your room. The lineup through the lobby side seemed to be early 20s guests. They weren't too rowdy, and outside they were roped off with security.\n\nBiggest issues in the room itself:\n-There are NO fridges - only a beverage cooler. We couldn't figure out how to work it, we just put an ice bucket in there and hoped for the best. Warm beer\/pop and cheesecake is pretty gross FYI, so don't bring those back with you.\n-The bed are ridiculously hard. We travel a fair bit, and this was one that continuously had us waking up in severe pain every morning. It felt like plywood with a moderately thick blanket on it. (we have a pillowtop at home, this was nothing like it)\n- The heater was ridiculously loud. It got to the point we would just heat during the day and turn it off when we were in there just so we could hear one another.\n- The shower apparently ran out of hot water, the pipes would make a very loud banging noise and only give lukewarm water. That only happened once, but it was awful.\n- I had left a box of a small electronic item that I was meaning to return on the desk stacked with the tourist brochures, and when we returned to the room it was no longer there, along with a reloadable subway card. I unfortunately am now stuck with that device. Put all packaging in the drawers or safe if you want them to be there when you get back!\n\nOn checkout day, I emailed inquiring about possible credit\/points for the initial check in issue for our inconvenience for giving away our room.  Although the email went to several people (standard), not a single person replied.\nAt noon when we went to checkout, I was told the manager wasn't in just yet, but would be back later to discuss.\nWhen we returned in the afternoon, the manager told us that the room type was not guaranteed, although we had made the booking directly with Marriott, and had confirmed our late checkin directly with the hotel. For our inconvenience, she stated that she would give us a token pittance amount of Bonvoy points. We have not received those points. Why bother offering them? We're loyal Marriott customers, and have been for years now. I found being lied directly to my face incredibly insulting.\n\nWhile we are headed back to Manhattan in June, we will not be returning to this location. As Bonvoy credit cardholders and frequent travel enthusiasts, we expected much, much better for a cobranded hotel.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Nobody came for 2 hrs, then of course we left to visit the city!! When we came back we had a second room (303) which was even worst: the air conditioning was not working, the carpet was badly smelling and it was located at the same level of the bus paltforms so you can image how noise it was.

We've stayed at Fairfield Inns across the country and know what to expect. Our king room was standard. The bed, as almost always, was very comfortable. We had a very large flatscreen TV. The bathroom was quite tight, but there was plenty of hot water, strong water pressure, and some storage space under the sink for toiletries.\n\nWe noted two things that we thought were better than normal.\n(1)  The breakfast room was always very busy, but staff tried to help people find seats rather than let us wander. The food was kept well stocked and refreshed. They had five or six thermoses of coffee, which were continually checked and refilled. Unbelievably, there was a constant supply of fresh, properly ripe bananas! These are usually cleaned out be early risers at other hotels and never replaced. That alone shows special effort and consideration.\n\nAlso, tables were cleaned up rapidly so that newcomers could find seats. There was plenty of staff to keep that area running smoothly and efficiently and they were cheerful and polite. \n\n(2) On our first night, a Sunday, at 9:30 p.m., we were unable to turn on the TV with the remote. We called the desk, expecting to be told that someone would look at it tomorrow. No--a pleasant maintenance man was at our door in five minutes! (Hardly time enough for me to get dressed!) Turned out that the little coffee maker had gotten pushed in front of the sensor button on the front of the TV that picked up the signal from the remote. Problem solved easily, but we wouldn't have figured it out ourselves. Kudos to the Fairfield for having helpful maintenance people on a Sunday night!\n\nThe location, as others note, is close to the action but on a cross street, so out of the mob scene. However, that block is a little seedy, as it abuts the back side of the Port Authority bus terminal. That said, we didn't feel unsafe; indeed there are several other budget hotels owned by major chains in the same block, so there are plenty of tourists around.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's a few blocks walking distance to the theater district, times square and other tourist locations in Midtown. The subway is at end of the block from the hotel and Penn station is six blocks away. The property is a typical Fairfield Hotel, nicely decorated and clean. The front desk staff and the concierge were friendly, responsive and gave us lot's of information about where to go and are good at responding to requests. The hotel includes breakfast and that is a huge plus since a typical breakfast at Midtown will run you about $12-$20 per person. The staff at the dining area keep the place well stocked and clean at all times. Very friendly as well. Our only negative was that housekeeping was subpar and in my opinion did not do a good job of cleaning the room at the normal standard for this type of hotel. We had a couple of days when we found the room had beds made and towel added, yet no trash was removed and the housekeeper did not vacuum the carpet or clean the bathroom floor. They also are a bit stingy with toiletries and for a family of four we only had one small shampoo bottle every night and had to call the front desk every night to get more. If this is a hotel policy it would be nice if they would let us know that way we would have bought our own shampoo. The room itself is smaller than the pictures represent, it would be perfect for one or two people yet it was a little cramped for a family of four. I've stayed in Fairfield Hotels before in California and for the price they charge I will probably try a different Hotel chain next time I travel.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was my husband, me, and our eight year old daughter. We are Starwood\/Marriott Rewards members and we've stayed at multiple Starwood\/Marriott properties in various cities, states, and Caribbean islands. We used our points to book this hotel. Anyway, I'll start with the good first: The hotel is close to Times Square and two subway stops: Times Square and the 42nd St.\/Port Authority Bus Station. I'd say it's probably a 5-10 minute walk to Times Square. The hotel is clean, and our room was always cleaned when we came back. Our room was also very quiet. We were on the 12th floor (near the elevator, actually) and weren't bothered by any noise. There is also free breakfast, which is one of the reasons why I booked this hotel.\n\nAnd now for the not-so-good. The OPs are correct when they say the rooms are small. I'm glad I followed their advice and had my family go with carry-ons, which I could store under the desk in the room. If we had all checked bigger suitcases, we would have been even more jammed in that room than we already were. There literally wouldn't have been room for them. The bathroom is also quite tiny. There really isn't anywhere to put things like a hair dryer or curling iron. The three of us were dodging and crawling over each other in that room. Even the hallways are narrow!\n\nThe hotel does offer free breakfast, which I thought was great since we usually don't like to spend much time on eating or searching for a place to eat breakfast. We'd rather eat something quick and get on our way. The breakfast place is small and you may have to wait for a table. It can also be quite crowded with people who aren't watching where they're going and bumping into you. Also, don't expect much as far as the quality of food. There are inexpensive places within walking distance of the hotel where you can go, so I wouldn't book a hotel near Times Square just because it offers free breakfast. We ended up going somewhere else for breakfast after our experience.\n\nTo conclude, if you just need a simple place to sleep and it's just you and maybe one other person, go for it. But if you're coming with your family, I'd probably pick somewhere else, unless you want to be crammed into a tiny room together.\n","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"NONE"}

It was our first time in the city and I had no idea where to stay. I wanted a place close to Times Square and the Theater District, so this fit the bill nicely.\n\nAfter arriving very early in the morning, we dropped by the hotel with the intent of just dropping off our luggage, realizing it was unlikely a room would be ready. To my hapy surprise, we were immediately given a room. That was such a welcome relief after a sleepless red-eye flight. I was so grateful for this unexpected gift. \n\nOur room was small but I expected as much (I mean, it's Manhattan!). The beds were so comfortable and the was room was clean. I was worried about noise as we were right across from elevators and then had the Port Authority across the street but I was pleasantly surprised again - yes, there was some noise but nothing crazy and it was infrequent, usually trucks outside in the early am and once there was an ambulance racing down the street at 5am. No big deal. \n\nThe breakfast is fine. There's plenty of eggs, breads and bagels to toast, some sort of meat protein like turkey and pork bacon, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit. It was helpful and got us off to a good start. My only complaint there was that the breakfast room was so hot, likely due to the constantly running toasters. \n\nThe staff here was very friendly and we were always greeted with friendly smiles and hellos. The concierge was helpful and gave good advice. There are plenty of taxis outside, it's close to multiple subway stations, and easy for Ubers to pick you up.

We thanked the agent numerous times, and it started us off to a great start. Even though our room had a moldly smell, we bore through it for the night. However, its been over a week now and we never received the promised points.\n\nMy wife called today to have a friendly chat to follow up about what the front desk agent had said when we checked in. What was supposed to be a nice follow up conversation quickly turned negative. The agent on the phone today could care less, with the conversation accusatory and terse. She stated there were no notes mentioning such a thing, and that it was our job to seek out and contact the specific front desk agent from our check-in about it. We felt awful to be treated as liars or thieves.\n\nIt really made the experience sour and we feel awful from the mistreatment of both the front desk agent (who toyed with our emotions) and the agent over the phone. We stay in a lot of hotels, and 1000 points is nothing. It's not worth fighting over. All we did was simply follow up on what was promised to us when we checked in, only to be treated in a hostile manner. I would not recommend this hotel and the unprofessional staff present here. It's your job to follow up with your staff. I don't know if this is a single instance, or if staff are trained to lie about points to guests to reduce the complaints during a stay. It worked though, because the kind gesture caused us to keep our mouths shut and remain in a moldly room. If this is not a technique of Fairfield Times Square, then I suggest you look into it and the staff who stated it to us on our stay, and the staff we spoke to over the phone.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It is very convenient to reach any point of interest.\n\nBefore booking a hotel room I had read terrible reviews for what is available in New York in my price range, so I was very relieved because the room size was decent and comfortable, the room clean, and there was free wi-fi (very important if you want to plan your daily excursions). There is a big flat TV in the room, which I did not use so I have no idea about the channel selection. The room was warm enough and there was a thermostat which you could adjust. Amenities included one set of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, face soap bar and body soap bar. The bathroom had a shower. I was on the 16th floor and there was no outside noise.\n\nThe highlight of the hotel was the breakfast, which was plentiful. The hotel serves hot breakfast which includes scrambled eggs and\/or omelette, sausages and\/or bacon, and fries. There is also a selecion of bagels and bread which you can toast, cake, pastries, fruits, cereals, yogurt, boiled eggs and various beverages. In a city as expensive as New York this breakfast kept me full until the afternoon, when all monuments and museums closed and I was ready for dinner.\n\nEvery Tuesday they hold a small reception at the always full lobby and they serve wine and a selection of cheese and meat to whoever guest happens to pass through. There is always water available in the lobby.\n\nThe only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the heating system was noisy. I got used to it, however, and I did not care. There is not much of a view (just buildings to look at), but that is not at the top of my priorities anyway. The lobby is rather small.

The staff in the hotel do an excellent job and do it with a friendly smile.  They all have great attitudes and are very helpful.  The rooms are small but we rather expected that in an older building in a large city.  They were kept immaculate during the 3 nights we were there.  We never had a problem with the elevators even though we were on the 26th floor.  The lobby was the only disappointment as it is small\/plain to almost non-existent.  Breakfast was the usual but I appreciated that they seated you as tables became available.  It kept the busy breakfast room from becoming chaotic.  Again the staff there were wonderful.  We did go up to the SkyRoom and the views were great.  But the loud music and the entire atmosphere was not for us so we just took a few pictures and left. There were several other nice hotels on this block, but also a few sketchy businesses, trash on the street & a few homeless people.

El desayuno durante las obras se sirve arriba en azotea y aunque las vistas son espectaculares no es nada c\u00f3modo comer agachados en mesas bajitas y peque\u00f1as de pub, Adem\u00e1s me consta que con el cambio provisional han retirado embutidos y otras cosas del desayuno t\u00edpico que ofrec\u00edan abajo. Si ya antes de las obras he leido que era repetitivo pues ahora mucho m\u00e1s pues hay menos variedad. Entiendo que las obras son provisionales pero no tengo culpa durante mi estancia y debo verme perjudicado en la menor medida posible.\n\n- TERCER PUNTO NEGATIVO Y M\u00c1S IMPORTANTE QUE JAM\u00c1S ME HAB\u00cdA OCURRIDO EN ESTE GRUPO DE HOTELES. En el cuarto d\u00eda de estancia descubro que en la sabana inferior de la cama a la altura de la almohada aunque por la parte lateral de la cama hab\u00eda una mancha enorme de sangre seca... buahhh que asco la verdad. Con la limpieza no se juega y eso es asqueroso, perdonen la expresi\u00f3n. Mi pareja llam\u00f3 a recepci\u00f3n y todo hay que decirlo que inmediatamente enviaron a un Sr. a comprobarlo in situ y as\u00ed lo hizo pero como era de noche no ten\u00edan limpiadora y nos ofrecieron una compensaci\u00f3n economica de 50 dolares y nos daban unas s\u00e1banas limpias y que nosotros las cambi\u00e1semos y ellos al d\u00eda siguiente. Tengo que decir que fueron muy amables y jam\u00e1s pusieron en tela de juicio lo ocurrido pues era evidente pero aunque la compensanci\u00f3n sea de agradecer creo que no existe compensaci\u00f3n posible para tal marranada y deber\u00edan tener mucho m\u00e1s cuidado.\n\nCUARTO PROBLEMA. No hab\u00eda ningun canal espa\u00f1ol y la verdad es que entre tantos como hab\u00eda pod\u00edan tener sintonizado alguno. La verdad no tiene mayor importancia pero me gustar\u00eda rese\u00f1arlo como punto a mejorar de manera bastante sencilla. \n\nSi ven mi historial ver\u00e1n que no suelo votar negativo sin motivo alguno, m\u00e1s bien todo lo contrario y es una pena pues este hotel podr\u00edan tener mejor puntuaci\u00f3n cuidando esos aspectos tan importantes...","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Because the floors are so small, ice and vending were... well, somewhere else in the hotel.  After having climbed the stairs and found nothing on a few floors, I gave up the search.\n\nAt least the staff is friendly, and proud of the fact that this is one of the better-rated Marriott properties in all of NYC.

This hotel was that and more. Every staff person we saw was ultra helpful and friendly. They are remodeling the lobby which wasn't a problem at all.  They moved the breakfast to the top floor due to construction, which gave us a wonderful city view. We only realized after the second day that we could have sat on the extra top floor where they have a rooftop bar, probably more room up there when crowded, but the view was actually not as good if you are short like us. The breakfast -juices, milk, yoghurt, bagels, toast, waffles (heat in the toaster), oatmeal packets, scrambled eggs, omelets, bacon or ham and  sausage depending on the day, fruit, Starbucks coffee, tea, and assorted add ons (cheese, dried fruit etc) and more. It was crowded, but if you went early it was fine. We requested a corner room and got it on the 29th floor, with a view to the side of the Empire State building. Much better than the usual view of building across the way. Also they upgraded us to a double room rather than one bed. Quiet rooms and not small especially considering it's NYC. Beds clean and comfy along with plenty of pillows. Paul Mitchell toiletries. Good location on 40th so not a far walk to the middle of Times Square, the A, C, E subway and everything else basically Midtown. The hotel was directly next to Port Authority so we just had to walk out the door to catch our bus home. All in all we would absolutely stay there again.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The friendly staff took our luggage and told us that check in was at 4 PM. We came back at 5:15 PM, tired after a long day, and our room was still not ready. We rested in the lobby with a cup of tea for half an hour. When our room still was not ready, we decided to go out for dinner. Our room was finally ready when we returned. The first thing we wanted to do was to wash our hands, but there was no soap. After calling the front desk, soap was brought up. Then, we noticed there was no toilet paper.\n\nThe following day, breakfast was being served up on the 34th floor lounge, maybe as a treat for the mattress situation. The views were fantastic but there were issues. The tables were small and low- difficult for breakfast. There was a problem with the toasters blowing a fuse so only one working toaster. There was a long line waiting to toast bread, waffles, bagels. If you were looking for a quick breakfast, this wasn\u2019t the day for that.\n\nThis was also the day the staff were removing the old mattresses.\n\nThere was no tea\/coffee\/hot chocolate available in the lobby for the final two days of our stay. The last issue was the long line in the lobby for the one working restroom on our \ncheck-out day.\n\nThe hotel was clean, quiet, and comfortable.

We drove in from the Detroit area so we needed a place to park our SUV. The hotel lists parking as $67\/day. Well, if you park it yourself, the rate is actually $50\/day. The $17 includes valet. The garage is literally around the corner so it was very easy to access our vehicle if need be. Port authority is right across the street. The attendant there is excellent as far as directing you to anywhere in the city and exactly how to get there. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I liked coming \"home\" to a less busy area after being out all day in the city. Yet Times Square is only a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel. The only cons were the small rooms and double beds. For two adults and two teenagers, the room was pretty tight. The bathroom did not have any counter space. If you're prone to being claustrophobic, this might not be the hotel for you. We were on the 27th floor and our room was right in front of the elevator. The hallways are super narrow and lower than the average hotel. I understand and expected small rooms, but wow I was still surprised. The city view was just ok. It's a smaller window that overlooks the top of the parking garage. Do the cons outweigh the great location? I guess that depends on what's the most important factors on your vacation. If we were traveling without the kids we definitely would stay here again!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Stampate la prenotazione di booking e fate attenzione al conto che vi presenta l'hotel. Ho letto altre recensioni di questo tipo e purtroppo anche a noi il conto preteso dall'hotel non era quello indicato da booking. Le tasse e imposte di soggiorno sono previste dal conto di booking quindi non dovevano esserci grosse sorprese se non un differente cambio al momento del pagamento, ma... arrivati in hotel il conto che ci presenta la struttura alberghiera differiva di pi\u00f9 di 200 USD... Appena arrivati in hotel la receptionist ci chiede la carta di credito, ero sicura che ci fosse capienza poich\u00e8 la carta nel mese non l'avevo usata per niente. Passa la carta per pagare l'intero importo del soggiorno e mi dice che la carta \u00e8 stata rifiutata, ne proviamo un'altra e niente. La receptionist allora ci dice che la prima notte era stata prelevata, di andare a dormire tranquilli (certo come no!) e di chiamare la nostra banca per risolvere il problema, ma entro le 12. Cos\u00ec alle 3 di notte, quando in Italia erano le 9 di mattina, chiamo la banca e mi dicono che la carta \u00e8 attiva ed \u00e8 tutto ok. Mi illumina la ragazza del call center della banca e mi chiede se fossi sicura che l'importo che avrebbe voluto addebitarmi l'hotel fosse corretto... e infatti!! Praticamente la mia carta ha un plafond di 1500euro, il conto di booking era di 1400euro, mentre il conto che l'hotel intendeva addebitarmi era pi\u00f9 di 1600euro... ecco perch\u00e8 la carta veniva rifiutata... stanchi dal viaggio e dal jet lag non abbiamo pensato che potesse essere quello il problema... \nFacciamo colazione (pi\u00f9 o meno tranquillamente) e trovo al banco della reception un altro ragazzo, gli spiego il problema della sera prima e del fatto che forse loro cercavano di addebitare sulla mia carta un importo che andava oltre al mio plafond e gli chiedo inoltre di controllare la mia prenotazione di booking con quella a loro sistema. Sta l\u00ec un p\u00f2 a fare calcoli e poi scusandosi mi dice che... s\u00ec c'era stato un errore nel conto, trovato il problema (il problema era una differenza di pi\u00f9 di 200usd!) e ci fa pagare  le restanti notti come da costi previsti dalla prenotazione di booking. \nAbbiamo trovato pulita la stanza il primo giorno, nei giorni successivi mai pulita moquette e mai tolta la polvere, hanno giusto cambiato gli asciugamani che lasciavamo a terra e rimesso shampoo. Le amenities sono un p\u00f2 scarsine per due persone: una crema per il corpo... e va bene, uno shampoo che fa anche da bagno schiuma in due... e un conditioner per i capelli... Solo il primo giorno ho trovato una confezione con una salvietta struccante... Ogni giorno una sola bottiglia di acqua. Diciamo che per il prezzo pagato (230euro a notte) forse non tutto \u00e8 andato secondo le aspettative di un 4 stelle, ma capisco anche che siamo a NY e che in questa citt\u00e0 il rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo purtroppo \u00e8 un punto dolente. \n\nIl punto di forza dell'hotel \u00e8 sicuramente la posizione: in una via non troppo trafficata, facile da raggiungere dal JFK, la metro all'angolo, tutte le maggiori attrazioni si raggiungono a piedi. Altro aspetto positivo \u00e8 la colazione, farla fuori per come la facciamo noi (cio\u00e8 mangiando in modo abbondante dolce e salato) costerebbe troppo. Il personale della sala colazione \u00e8 gentile ed in particolare una ragazza che si ricordava ogni giorno che non volevamo stare nella prima stanza perch\u00e8 c'era l'aria condizionata forte. La stanza \u00e8 ampia per essere a NY, noi abbiamo prenotato una camera con vista e devo dire che era notevole, Empire State Building e altri grattacieli di notte davvero magici, quindi per questo ne \u00e8 valsa la pena pagare un p\u00f2 di pi\u00f9 la camera.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The breakfast was ample and delicious. This is a convenient location as we walked to Times Square and the Javits Center, which are in opposite directions. \nThe best part about staying here is the people. They went out of their way to be helpful. On the day I was departing, Uber had surge pricing and I was having problems connecting with Lyft. One of the men in the lobby told me about Juno, a new ride-sharing service, but they also had surge pricing. Then he double-checked with the concierge about an express bus shuttle direct to the Newark Airport. It was only $18 and was getting ready to leave as I walked up. I so appreciated their extra care and concern.

I read the reviews for this hotel and they were pretty positive so I decided to book. The location is great for midtown if you want to be close to Times Square (but not so close you can still sleep), Subway and Penn Station. The check in process was very easy and the check out process was done using the app.  I stayed in a King size room on the 23rd floor.  The room was very comfortable and was set up well. I liked the night light above the bed and the fact there were plenty of USB ports and outlets in the right places. The bathroom was small but more than adequate. I liked the marble floors and walls that extended into the shower (which was also a tub).  Water pressure could have been better.  I would have liked to have more counter space for when you need to use the hairdryer but managed okay with my toliletries because they plenty of shelves. The hotel provides Paul Mitchell shampoo, conditioner and lotion which is a nice touch. Besides being well set up and clean,  loved the fact that it was super quiet at night and I could sleep.  This is very rare for NYC. The closer you to stay to Times Square the louder it is. The room also had complimentary bottled water and a Keurig although I preferred to get coffee downstairs at breakfast.  Breakfast was pretty impressive for being included in the hotel rate. You wait in line and they make sure they have tables.  They had hot items such as eggs and bacon, plus bagels, muffins, toast, fruit, individual yogurt, granola, and cereals.  They also served Starbucks coffee which was just as good as going to Starbucks. I opted not to get my room serviced in exchange for points. They gym is small, located in the basement but definitely adequate if you want a treadmill, a bike and an elliptical. The elevator can be slow.  On the first day one was broken so it took some time to get down.  The following day it was quicker. They do have valet but no in and out privileges and it's $67\/day so you might want to park around the corner where the garage is only $55\/day. This would be a great hotel for families if you can get a suite.  I will definitely add the Fairfield Inn on 40th to my list of go to hotels when I'm in Manhattan.

Check in was excellent- Anthony was very friendly and accommodating. At my last few stays in hotels I've had poor to average front desk interactions, so Anthony's welcome was very refreshing. I said I was tired, and he pointed me to the complimentary Starbucks coffee. I needed a food recommendation, he pointed me to a place 2 minutes away. He went above and beyond during my stay, even giving me a late checkout when my bus was delayed, which was a huge relief for me. The staff can make or break a hotel, and Anthony made my stay excellent.\n\nThe lobby was very pretty and modern. Starbucks coffee is complimentary, and there are multiple fantastic cafes on the block. \nLocation is great- close to Broadway, Times Square, and the subway, but the street wasn't super busy.\n\nThe room had more traditional decor, but was functional and very clean. Honestly one of the first hotels where I didn't feel like I needed to sanitize the bathroom myself. There was towel folded as a pretty swan folded on the bed.\nI didn't pay for the city view, but my view from the 24th floor was still pretty. I couldn't hear much outside noise, only when a loud horn or something honked. This is a big deal for me, because I live out in the country and don't sleep well in noisy environments; I slept fine.\n\nBreakfast was complimentary, and had coffee, bread, yogurt, fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage, and a large selection of hot sauces. The eggs I got were way over-salted, and were the only negative thing I experienced during my stay. I'm guessing they were an mishap, as the omelet I exchanged them for tasted fine. The space is crowded, but they had a worker seating people as not to waste space and to maximize efficiency. \n\nOverall, it's a good hotel with excellent service. If I ever return to New York, I'd definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

NYC\u2019s taxis have a flat rate for when they pick you up\/ take you to the airport which is very affordable and reasonable!\nThe hotel is located on 40th Street W,  which is like a 5 min walk or so from Times Square. It is also located across the street from a Bus Depot, which stays busy (but so does everything else in NYC)! If you are going to a show on Broadway or doing anything in Times Square, you are in a prime location for walking (if the weather is nice). If you desire to catch the metro, there is a location very close as well.\nThe hotel itself is very nice and modern. The interior decoration is nice. They have Starbucks coffee near the dining room area that they offer to guest complimentary. There is also a reception area for evening g snacks and wine.\nMy room was located on the 30th floor (it goes up to 32).  I had a city view room which gives you a beautiful view of the city. If you are not a fan of bright lights, don\u2019t get this room.\nIt was a typical NYC size, which is small.  The bed was with a firm mattress, which I am a fan of. There isn\u2019t a fridge or microwave, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby that delivers!\nThey have complimentary breakfast, but I had to check out early due to the snow storm that was on the way, so I can\u2019t tell you about it. But the dining room was nice.\nDue to the hotel being downtown, the building is very narrow, especially the hallways. Something to consider if you plan on bringing a lot of luggage or equipment.\nThe staff is amazing. Had to catch a cab when checking out due to the weather. The staff member at the desk went out and flagged one down for me, then assisted with loading my luggage. Little things like that makes your stay SO much more enjoyable.\n","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our flight was canceled due to weather twice - arriving and leaving and both times the reservation person and hotel staff were great in changing my reservation and not charging me extra - in fact I got a better price. There was even an extremely helpful man at the desk at 2:30 in the morning who was able to add another day to the two reservations I had.\nIt is a very busy location to be sure and it took a little persistence on my part to find the right person to help me with the changes I needed to make in getting the two rooms I had reserved next to each other but once I found him - he was great.\nI wanted to give this hotel 5 stars but held out because I did have to ask a couple people before I found someone to help me get my rooms together - once I did it was no problem for him but it was like the other people I spoke to didn't want to be bothered. Also our second room was not really clean. Our first room was great - no issues but second one they had to come and change the bedding on one of the beds.\nThe double beds room was definitely tighter than the king room but both had more space than the Chelsea Fairfield. Noise level in the rooms was also much better. No earplugs on the nightstand here = )  We had two different floors, the 21st back of building and the 12th front of building. The back of the building was quieter but neither really had any view to speak of.\nBreakfast was basic with variety in meat and fruit. The breakfast staff was always friendly and quick to clear your used items - which is nice. The one woman even brought my father-in-law a gift because she found out he was going to be having his 90th birthday soon. \nTook the express bus from Newark Airport which drops on 42nd and picks up on 41st and 8th so just a couple blocks to walk to the hotel. Also there is a subway entrance at 8th and 40th which is supper handy. Located far enough away from Times Square to avoid that mess if you choose to.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room was fine, it had 2 beds as I booked, good ones I might add, good shower. I found it odd that my 2nd floor room didn't have a window. I mean, The window was there but the curtains wouldn't open and the glass on the window weren't transparent. \nThe hotel let us have the conplimentary breakfast the day we arrived, which was very kind and I appreciate it. The lines in the breakfast room can get big, but we never waited more than 5 min for a place to sit. All the employees coordinating the guests and tables were very kind and did an amazing job. Congrats to all of them! Breakfast is good, with bagels, eggs, cakes, Starbucks Coffee, no complaints. \nI stayed only 2 nights, but had an amazing time there.\nOh, before I forget, the location is good, right in front of Port Authority, which came in handy since I had plans to visit the outlets by bus.

The room was spacious by New York standards (six feet of walking between the bed and bathroom!), all of the furniture and fixtures were clearly recently renovated\/replaced, the TV is one of the new Marriott models with Netflix, and, as I was given a corner room on a high floor, it was incredibly quiet. As noted, the location is excellent - just far enough from Times Square to be away from noise and nonsense, but a couple of quick blocks to get there (also, there is better food, like the Westfield Diner, on 9th). As a bonus to this good experience, the room was also exceptionally low-priced (granted, it was January, but I love the cold so I'd rather visit then, anyway) and well, well, WELL worth the $155 per night. I usually prefer a full-service Marriott, but this might be my new go-to choice when in the city.

Is Lift 1 Working Yet?","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Paid a lot of money for a lousy stay. Comfy bed and beautiful room cleaning and breakfast attendance staff that is it. One lift of 3, for 34 levels of guests, and to get patrons to the nightclub on the top floor,  and cleaning staff and equipment around, was not working for the entire 11 days I was there. Reasons varied - it will be fixed in a couple of days, to staff who said it hadn't been working for weeks, to eventually signs in the lift and out the front of the lift in the lobby saying that they got it wrong, the lift was to undergo annual maintenance, and to come to drinks and nibbles at 4pm. Why would you plan maintenance at Christmas time? Why was the lift not working in the interim? Why was I not told of this before booking and paying a lot of money so that I could to make an informed decision and go elsewhere? Up to half hour waits for lifts up and down, many folks getting in and going up to ensure getting down. On my last day, a couple set off down the stairs - 27 levels - they commented that 17 minutes waiting was more than enough. On Christmas morning there was nothing special - no greetings, no nothing. Oh yes there was. They ran out of bowls so we ate cereal off cardboard\/disposable dinner plates, and they ran out of hot food. Something to do with ordering and holidays, the manager advised. Not our problem, we had all booked and paid well in advance. You are a hotel. People stay in holiday periods. Duh? So rug up, and out in the cold, to buy breakfast\/a meal, and bring the receipt back, said Mario, and we will reimburse you. Ha, no one was interested in that - the front desk person told me that it was not his problem and to email Mario. Please keep my voice down and then just totally ignored me. I emailed Marriott USA. What a joke. Lots of talk and advertising bull...about the Marriott experience, but no substance. Mario had attended to me, they said. No he hadn't and still hasn't. Finally on my last day - a week after Christmas, and after asking every day and being ignored, Carlos lifted the cash tray and pulled my receipt out where it had been stashed and gave me the cash equivalent. Felt very weary, embarrassed but determined by this stage. What is my Marriott experience ? - a damn expensive and regret I did it experience. Fury at the total couldn't give a s.. dismissal by Marriott corporate staff. Lots of words about the Marriott experience. One lift of 3 totally out of action from well before arrival, according to staff, and still when I left. Sharing a lift with folks going to the nightclub on the 34th floor - yes, nightclub patrons sharing a lift with hotel guests and having access to accommodation floors.  One occasion, just me, and 6 solid men. They could have gotten out at my floor and I had no way of stopping them\/seeking assistance. No key\/access security for floors in the lifts - the first person into the lift put their card into the swipe and we all could then select any and all of the 34 floors to go to. Waiting and waiting and waiting for lifts. Watching the hotel staff manage entry to the lifts on the days the night club was open to ensure they all got there quickly and shoving as many of them in with me and other hotel guests as they could. Coming back to my room to find a restaurant menu shoved under my door - level 27. It appears no security or management of access to floors. One day an announcement over the PA system telling us that one of the remaining 2 lifts was not working, for at least an hour and walk if possible. Great. Even longer waits. Massive queues for breakfast. People in pajamas at breakfast. Lots of talk and not an ounce of action - oh yes, Marriott said, 40,000 points for my stay. No thank you, I have had a Marriott experience. I don't ever want another one. It ruined my Christmas. Why would I ever stay again? Of just as much concern, as a paying guest for 10 nights, and a Marriott member (not for much longer), why was I not asked to provide a review? All reviews are glowing on the Marriott site.

There were also a couple of time when my family had joined me. It serves its purpose....clean rooms, shower, free hot breakfast, with great access to public transportation (Port Authority was just a few steps away). \n\nFor this visit, we timed it for us to check in on New Year's Day. Julia V. took care of our needs. We informed her of our planned arrival, and that we were staying there for 5 nights. We stayed in a very comfortable Penthouse Suite, very roomy for my family. We had great view of Midtown (Time Square). We were also there during the blizzard, and there were no issues at the hotel at all. \n\nThe staff were very accommodating with our needs, and had a smiling face whenever we  spoke with them. For a hotel in Times Square, this was such a great value whether you are paying in cash, credit card, or using points. We love going to the theatre, and watch 11 Broadway shows during the 1 week in NYC. This was the perfect location to be close to the Theatre District.\n\nI wasn't surprised that I chose this hotel for our vacation, and was so glad I made that choice. Thank you, Julia, for taking care of my family. We hope to return again someday soon.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff was super nice and very helpful. The night manager Joe is awesome and attentive . The rooms were clean and also quiet for sleeping. The housekeepers were very friendly and asked several times if they can provide us with anything. No extra hidden fees was a plus. Continental Breakfast buffet with large variety of foods. Free Starbucks coffee and free water w\/lime. Rare to get anything free in NYC! We even received a small gift bag w\/gourmet chocolate and an anniversary card hand signed by staff. Sweet touch! The sky room club was a bonus when we wanted to go out but not leave the hotel. As it implies you can see the skyline and beautiful views of NYC. Lounge style couches with sky views. \n\nLocation was great. Super close to Times Square main attraction. Within walking distance, not immediately in the action but close enough. Two Subway entrances around the corner close.\n\nOnly downside was the elevators during busy time. Only 2 out of the 3 were working. But honestly that was not a big deal. Definitely not a deal breaker. \n\nDecor was modern, clean lines, very upscale looking. Mattress was extremely comfortable. Plenty of pillows, plenty of towels.

Also,  since I was driving in from Buffalo,  I was VERY ANXIOUS about driving in the city,  so I was VERY pleased with the location as I dodged most of the city driving fears!   This hotel was literally right off the Lincoln tunnel.   Two turns and I was at the front door,  where I took advantage of the valet parking.    Parking is always expensive in NYC,  but for me,  was worth it!   I was greeted with a glass of wine and a cookie!   Nice touch and well needed after my drive.     \nI had a double room for 3 guests,  was a bit cramped,  however tolerable.   Very clean and comfortable.  The rates were very reasonable at this time of year!    Was on the outskirts of Times Square,  so very reasonable location for everything!   The only cons I had were,  the elevator situation,  VERY VERY small inside and VERY long waits!   One elevator was out of order,  so that definitely made the situation worse!   And.. .. There is a complimentary breakfast,  HOWEVER,  the lines were a mile long each day we were there!   It really irritated me.   Overall though,  it was a positive experience!

PROS: The room is typically small (NYC hotels of this calibre) for 4 people, but I expected it that so that's OK. The breakfast is pretty good with a wide variety of choices (cereal, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, Chobani yogurts, etc, etc. !!!). We like having hearty breakfasts & this was a great way to start the day. Coffee is from Starbuck's & available from breakfast til 10:00 pm. If you do not wish to wait to get a table in the breakfast room, make sure you go before the crowds. There are line-ups to get a seat if you go after 8:30 a.m. We'd like to mention that the ladies managing the breakfast room are very efficient, professional & personable. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Times Square, Bryant Park, subway stations-well situated if that's what you like. It is also situated right next to a parole office so there can be some sketchy characters in the neighborhood, but nothing to fear as the street is very busy from all the other hotels & Port Authority Bus Terminal across the street. We came & went at all hours without any incident.\nCONS: There are 3 elevators in this hotel & 1 of them was not functional while we were there. There are 31 floors in this hotel so the wait times for the elevators was 10-15 minutes !!! If you can, ask for a low floor so you can walk up & down from your room. If you drive there: Parking fee of $67\/day + tax is ridiculous, even for NYC. They valet your car onto an outdoor lot so while we were there, there was a blizzard & my truck was covered in snow. The hotel (Staybridge Suites Times Square) right next to this one has a $35\/day parking fee & the Port Authority Bus Terminal lot charges a $50\/day tax incl. fee. Only found out about that one at the end of my stay. Shop around on the internet before coming to NYC, you will get a better rate & get peace of mind. I've reached out to the hotel Manager about the fee & did not get any response. \nWe got a great rate for our 3 day stay so all things considered, our experience was good. If not for the elevator situation & parking fee being a little more reasonable, this would have been a 4 star review. I would recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Major plus...They stored our bags upon arrival so we could start exploring even thought our room wasn't ready until mid afternoon. Location was just about perfect! We could literally walk to everything or catch the train. Most people will head straight to Times Square but if you are looking for a more authentic experience try turning left out of the hotel and explore that area. We found Rudys (dive bar) which was super fun and also the amazing Thai restaurant (hotel recommended). Fairfield room rate was excellent and the main reason I booked here because New Years Eve weekend was pricing out at like 400 a night!  Staff was helpful and really did their best to make sure they were meeting our needs at all times including making sure my husband had a great view as a first time visitor to NYC to recommending the best THAI restaurant EVER! Breakfast was OK and it's free so no complaints from me however it is extremely tight spacewise. The Starbux coffee is def a nice touch. There is a nice Sky room bar on top of the hotel that was fun to visit at happy hour. Beers are 5 dollars and there is a nice view. Hotel guests need to get stamped before heading up and attire at Sky room is business casual. The complaints about the elevators are true. Only two are working and they are SMALL. My advice is to expect to have a slight wait during busy times and honestly I'm really impatient and I was able to deal with it. Loved the toiletries that were provided. In Summary,  If you are looking for super BLING then this isn't the hotel for you but if you like to get the most bang for your buck then this just might be the right up your alley! FYI...there were a few reviewers who commented on Port authority being across the street. I never found this issue to be a problem and felt safe at all times. I used the location info as marker when getting off the subways and knowing where to exit...follow the port authority on 40th signs!!

The location and views from the hotel is very good. We then went out for the evening still content with everything and when we returned this time there was a queue outside of the hotel. A little unsure of what was going on we then returned to our room and as we got to our floor it sounded like a loud thumping bass from the Sky Bar. It was so loud still at 1am and our nights sleep was greatly disrupted. \n\nA little annoyed from lack of sleep we came down to breakfast to discover a very basic choice of food served on PAPER plates and with PLASTIC cutlery. The hotel immediately lost its class in our opinion considering the price you pay to stay here at a weekend. The only thing keeping us awake now was the Starbucks coffee they serve on tap which was a nice touch. \n\nWe went to express our disappointment to the staff and the response from them was why we had not called the front desk as they could have turned the music down. The fact the staff thought we were that naive annoyed me further. At this point they offered us a 10% discount for one night. This was an insult in our eyes so the front desk agent spoke with his manager and returned to inform us he could offer us a 20% discount. At no point did the manager introduce themselves and apologise which I think is appalling. \n\nNot wanting to let it ruin our day we went about the city and had a fantastic time being so close to Times Square. Our friend was also staying at the hotel that night so we met them on their floor. As soon as the elevator door opened there was a very strong smell of cannabis coming from one of the rooms. Not exactly what you want to smell. Well we went to inform the staff and they seemed very attentive to the issue. When we went back up to my friends room the staff member tried to tell me he couldn\u2019t smell it and that it must be the cleaning products. I can tell you all now it was not cleaning products, it was cannabis. \n\nNeedless to say overall the hotel I found to be very over priced and disappointing with the service received. However the location is great and you can be at Times Square in minutes. \n\nI will not be returning to this hotel based on the service. \n","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After reading some of the negative reviews I thought I would address some of them.\nElevators, there are 3, and it is a 32 floor hotel with a roof bar (Sky Room) that in the evenings they reserve 1 just for it, with that being said the waits were not that long, the elevators move very fast and the hotel was sold out when we were there. So don\u2019t let that scare you away. \nBreakfast is served every morning on the main floor, seating is limited, but the staff moves you in very quickly and are very friendly. We never had to wait more then 5 minutes the whole week and sometimes we never waited. We went down to breakfast from 6:30 - 7:00 ( no wait ), also as late as 9:00 - 10:00 (less than 5 minutes). As for the breakfast quality it is just so so, there is eggs, little cheese omelettes, turkey & pork sausages, sometimes bacon and Canadian bacon, fresh fruits, toast, bagels, waffles, yogurts, cereal and a few pastries. Nothing fancy but fills you up. For those that complain about the quality, most NYC hotels do not offer free Breakfast, so if you want better, go to a restaurant and pay for it, if they served higher quality, the rooms would cost more per night. It is the same with the paper plates and plastic utensils if they used regular plates and silverware they would have to spend more labor washing the dishes and that would drive the cost of the room higher. \nThey offer free coffee, tea and water all day.\nSome say they feel the area is a little unsafe as it is near the bus station, it does have some homeless people around but so does most of New York, besides asking for some money once in a while they never bother you, if it does bothers you to walk by them, then just go down the north side of the block until you get to hotel which is in the middle of block and then cross the street, a couple of them will sit on same side of street just up from hotel. They are never on the other side of street. There also are 2 or 3 other hotels right next door to this hotel, so lots of people coming and going all the time. We never felt unsafe.\nThe bus station (Port Authority) is a positive because it is real easy to get to and from the airport, we flew from  Newark and it cost 17.00 per person, one leaves every 15 minutes and only takes 30 or 45 minutes. No need for a taxi as you just go across street, around front between the two buildings and look for the bus marked Newark Airport and you can pay right there, cash or credit. The same when coming from airport just go out the front doors of airport and look for Newark Port Authority bus to NYC ,also comes every 15 minutes, and get on and pay on the bus. \nThe rooms are small as most NYC hotels. The hotel only has 6-8 rooms per floor, so not much noise from the other guests on your floor. They have many, (lots) of places to to plug in charging devices with plug-ins & USB ports. Room was very clean and was always cleaned when we came back for the day, it has good lighting, showers always had hot water, the one negative is they have little mini fridges, which are not refrigerators at all, they call them coolers and they only cool to 58 degrees instead of cold like a refrigerator so the water and things are just luke warm, might as well not even had them. They should replace them all with real refrigerators.\nAs with most NYC hotels staying on street side lower floors you will hear all the street noise, the first night we stayed on 11th floor street side as it was late when checking in and had the street noise, the next night we moved to the 22nd floor back side and it was absolutely quiet (room 2208). \nThe hotel is 1\/2 block from 8th Ave. Times Square is roughly around 42 & 7th Ave. a short walk  with a lot of shops, shows and restaurants in between, a great little restaurant close by is Black Iron Burger, Midtown (245 W 38th St.) just two blocks down and in the middle of the next block.  It is a small and you might have to wait, but it has very good burgers.\nI would stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1390172,"title":"great hotel, could use a little work","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-10-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"This was for a 2 night business stay.\n\nCHECK-IN: (2\/5)\nI made this booking online the day before on Booking.com. I came to the hotel in the morning around 8:30-9am to see if early check-in was possible just so I can drop my things off in the room before heading to work. Unfortunately, the person that helped me couldn't find my reservation. They had a print out of my booking, but it wasn't in the system. What should have been a 2 minute max check-in time, turned into about 15-20 minutes because they couldn't find my reservation. I don't know if the front desk ever found my reservation in their system or just made a new one, but I was finally able to get a room. Unfortunately, it was a second floor room out of a 30+ floor building...\n\nROOM: (4\/5)\nThe room itself was very nice. It was spacious and clean, probably bigger than most hotel rooms that I've stayed in. The one pet peeve I really had with the work was the TV. Sure, I'm not in the hotel room watching TV all day, but it kept blacking out and coming back over and over again for a split second. It kept kicking me out of my Netflix account (which is a great feature for the TV, but would have been better if it actually worked). Eventually, the movie I was playing just stopped working and so did anything else I tried to play. I don't know if it was because the connection was crappy, but it was really frustrating.\n\nAlso, I don't know if it was because I was on the 2nd floor, but it took FOREVER for the water in the shower to turn even a little bit warm. I probably had to wait at least 10 minutes with the shower running on maximum high setting until it started to feel warmer. Did not do me good when rushing in the morning. Same went for the sink water.\n\nFOOD: (3\/5)\nBreakfast was included with the room rate, which is always nice. Though I was not all that impressed with the spread. It was mostly carbs that were available. What impressed me most was the refrigerator stocked with a variety of yogurts and the hot drink station. The eggs and protein could really use some work, tasted like cardboard as did most of their bread selections. I would recommend going as early as you can. They seat you like a restaurant and there will be a line during peak morning times. It's a pretty tight space too so if you wanted to get breakfast before checking-out, leave all our stuff in your room and get it after.The breakfast area turns into a [sports] bar at night, which was neat. Coffee and hot water is available 24\/7 by the area which was nice too.\n\nGROUNDS: (4\/5)\nOther than the tight space for breakfast, the elevators are devastatingly slow. I was actually grateful about the second floor room because all I had to do was walk up and down a flight of stairs. The hotel in general is on the smaller side. Hallways are narrow and you can tell the design was to make the most of the space given as possible. The building is almost as if it was one building, but split right down the middle for two different hotels. The lobby can get really crowded so try not to stick around and linger if you're on the claustrophobic side.\n\nSERVICE: (4\/5)\nDespite the less than perfect check-in, everyone was nice and hardworking. It would have been nice to see a bit more \"I care about you, the guest\" but I didn't get that kind of vibe here, even with the mishap. It's nice to be known by name because of these kinds of things though. I like it when they do that, it makes it seem that they pay extra attention.\n\nOVERALL: (3\/5)\nI would stay here again if the price is right and I'm on a budget. Breakfast was disappointing but the rooms were really nice - minus the water temperature and the TV. If those few things were improved, I would definitely come back again.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

First impressions were good, the reception was friendly and very helpful, upon entering our room it was clean and very quiet but quite small, especially the 'double' beds that we would be sharing!  Our view was disappointing, looking out onto a dirty alleyway with an office block where the staff could see right through our window. \nWe were on the 13th floor so always needed to take the lift, a couple of times it would take a while but the majority of the time it was efficient enough.  We were impressed by the maid service, she came every day and with clean towels, the only thing that was a little annoying was that she only ever left 2 bottles of water (even though the room fits 4 people) even after we asked if she could leave some more.  Breakfast was alright, plenty of choice although wasn't very impressed by the bacon and whatever the horrible looking turkey thing was, avoided that side of the breakfast bar and kept to the bagels and fruit!  Sometimes we had a little wait but it was never long, the staff were always on top of it making sure we got seated as quickly as possible.\nThere is a skybar next door to the hotel but unfortunately we didn't get the chance to go up, it's not open until 5pm, on the Saturday evening we planned to go up but there was a bunch of young people queuing to enter so we decided against it, the following night there was a sign saying it was closed and then on the Monday we were told it's only open on weekends.  \nLocation was a little bit dodgy but I think most of Times Square is anyway, lots of homeless people and drunks on the street trying to get money from you.  The hotel is also directly across from the bus\/subway station which was handy for getting to Brooklyn\/Lower Manhattan for a day but everywhere else is within walking distance to an extent.  \nOverall not a bad stay, if you've the money to splurge then I would suggest staying in a nicer area but really, this place isn't too bad for a bed to sleep in and a refuel in the morning.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff were lovely, especially the ladies in the restaurant. My only complaint was that on our last night we went to the bar (which isn't actually a bar, it's the same room that breakfast is in) and we were charged $29 for two glasses of wine and were ignored when we asked for a receipt.

The hotel needs to work with the NYPD to address this issue.\n\nAs for the actual hotel, it is nice with no issues. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nAs an aside, I am not saying there is anything shady going on between Apple and Marriott, but if you search for this hotel on Apple maps, the NYC correctional facility does not show up.

Situated around the corner from Times Square and within walking distance from Bryant Park it offers the best of both worlds. It's close to subway stations and is literally across the street from the Port Authority (bus station). \n\nOn the weekend we visited we arrived early. We expected to have our luggage held until the afternoon while we explored the city. Instead we were offered a room on the second floor if we wanted to check in early. We appreciated being informed that we might hear traffic, if that would bother us we could check in later. We took the room and we're glad we did. Room #204 was the quietest room we ever had in all of our city travels.  Our room: space was ample, handsomely appointed and kept clean and stocked throughout our stay. There is no view from this room, however, as a privacy film covers the bottom half of the window. But we didn't book the room for a view of the city, rather to experience it.  The hotel gym was also clean and very well equipped, a big plus. \nI also want to mention the staff who were friendly, helpful and engaged.

The hotel let us check our belongings in a locked room after we checked out so we didn't have to leave the city until the afternoon.  The rates were great, even with valet parking (which was still cheaper than taking a train and dealing with parking garages, etc.).  Beds were comfortable and there were complimentary earplugs in the room, which we did not use.  We asked to be on a \"quieter\" floor and they accommodated us, putting us on 18, about halfway between street noise and the club on the top floor.   I would recommend this hotel.

You could squeeze in 5 guests, or 4 with small suitcases.  We arrived at the hotel late afternoon on Friday and there was a bus load or two of young guests waiting on the two elevators.  After waiting about 20 minutes, I walked up the 8 fights, and my husband waited an additional 10 minutes for the elevator after the staff moved the large group to one elevator and allowed other guest to use the remaining elevator.  I  can't rate the breakfast as the area is extremely small and we did not want to wait what would have been a long time for their breakfast.  The hotel room was adequate, but not what you usually get from Fairfield Inn and Suites,  There is a beverage cooler not a refrigerator and when I asked I was told you had to go to the lower level for ice, so we did without as I did not want to wait on the elevator to get ice,  I was concerned we would be late Friday evening for the theater as it took a while for an elevator to stop that was not crammed with guests.  The shower floor is very slick, so be careful in the shower.  we had a view of the side of the bus station from our window and eight avenue had trash bags on the street all three days were at the hotel.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location was convenient to Times Square and the subway. The thermostat in our hotel room was wonderful and responded very quickly to the changes we would make.\n\nIt is missing 3 stars because: \n1- the staff was not up to par. At check-in, the girl asked me if I was expecting. I am not. In fact, I miscarried 2 months before our trip (at 9 weeks pregnant, long before you show anything). I have a thin build, am not overweight, etc... It was embarassing and painful, a difficult reminder of the loss I experienced recently. You NEVER ask that question.\n\n2- After checking in, there were not extra towels in our room like we requested in our reservation made directly with Marriott. We called to request them when we got to our room at 3:30. At 4:30 they still had not come so we called again. We left at 5:30 for dinner\/a show and when we returned at 11:30 we STILL did not have the towels. When we called at 11:30 they came quickly. It should not take 8 hours and 3 phone calls to get extra towels.\n\n3- The water pressure for the shower is non-existent. Shaving was difficult b\/c there wasn't enough water pressure to rinse the razor. Also, and more importantly, there was NO hot water. We turned the shower as hot as it could be, and the water coming out was lukewarm at best. Showering in cold water is not a fun start to the day. What was interesting was the hot water from the sink faucet was so hot it would burn your hands if you didn't also turn on the cold. How is the sink so hot and the shower so NOT?\n\nThe doors are VERY thin. Our room was near the elevator and we were woken up at 2 and 3 am each night by somebody else from our floor being LOUD while waiting for the elevators. Some common sense would go a long way. Stacked extra pillows along the crack under the door, but it did little to help.\n\nSidenote: The bed was very firm. A little too firm for our liking, but others may prefer it that way. No stars lost here.\n\nSo we would stay here again, but with lower expectations. And hope that it is warm so I don't need a hot shower to warm up after a cold rainy day.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The very minute we had finished our food (we had to take our cardboard cup drinks with us), we were asked to vacate the table as the queue was long for people waiting to be seated. I was not impressed. \n\nWhat I thought was very strange, the bar is only open 3 evenings per week.  We had been out all day, returning early evening, looking forward to a glass of wine or cocktail, to be told we would have to go back out as the bar isn't open. I have visited hotels all over the world & never experienced this. \n\nThe only positives:\nthe hotels location (good for popular sights)\nWifi was efficient \n\nOther than that, I wouldn't visit again. Of the hundreds of hotels in New York I will do more research to find one that is superior.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The hotel is just a block away from the nearest subway station and it is nicely decorated. Breakfast was included and though it the same everyday and you had to wait for a table it had a little bit of everything and to go boxes. The rooms are New York size, smaller than an average hotel room so don't exaggerate with luggage. Besides that they have a sky room bar that had a lot of movement but we couldn't go because it was business casual and we didn't bring any dress shoes. Instead we went to the little improvised sports bar, the bartender is talented but he barely has any equipment and for the ambiance drinks are too expensive. Besides the sign says open until 1am but by 11:30 the bar is closing up.  Could improve those little details, and water daily water bottles would be appreciated.

I had been to The Sky Room before and loved the rooftop lounge so when I found a great deal I booked right away. \nThe location is great, close to Time Square and all its attractions and restaurants. The staff were courteous and helpful. And the breakfast was one of the better hotel breakfasts I've had. It is pretty standard but they offered two types of eggs and two meats. Lots of coffee and tea and juice options. Also fruit, yogurt, cereals, and breads, etc. \nThe room was very clean and modern, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was spotless. \nEach floor only has 8 rooms as far as I can tell so even though we were near the stairs and elevator there wasn't too much noise. \nWe even went up to The Sky Room around 1 am! By then it was in full club mode (to be expected on a Saturday night) but the place is well staffed and seems to handle the crowd smoothly. The views are amazing (I believe it's the 33rd floor) and as a hotel guest you don't have to pay a cover or wait in line. \nDue to the late night we were a little slow in getting ready to go in the morning and figured it was worth a shot to call down to ask for a late checkout (right before 11) and the front desk obliged and let us hang out until 12:30!\nWe used their valet as well and as long as you retrieve your car prior to 24 hours after leaving it with valet they charge you for one night of parking @ $55. \n\nAll in all a great experience, would definitely stay here again.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1390172,"title":"Not bad, especially for NYC","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-01-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I normally review on a curve because you wouldn't expect a Super 8 room to be as good as a Hilton (or a Hilton room to be as bad as a Super 8).  Apart from that the baseline for all hotels is whether everything was clean and worked as it should.  This Fairfield Inn is pretty good all things considered.\n\nFirst, it's not a typical Fairfield Inn.  Over 30 floors (insufficient elevator capacity noted in other reviews) with a few rooms on each floor.  The rooms don't look like most Fairfield Inn rooms -- almost everything's smaller in New York despite the sky high prices.  That said, the room was basically clean and well-furnished for its size.  Indeed it was quite cramped (only one chair at the desk and you have to move it for two people to navigate to the closet armoire).  Bathroom clean, appropriately stocked and the shower was acceptable.  The room cleanliness was better than many \"normal\" Fairfield Inns elsewhere in the country (ditto for the furnishings that were there).\n\nThere were some minor issues.  I think the third set of room keys was ultimately the charm so it took us quite some time to get into the room.  The heater\/air conditioning unit behaved erratically, putting out cold air when it shouldn't.  We had to elevate the temperature on the thermostat considerably to work around that issue.  There is no refrigerator in the room -- instead a marginal beverage cooler.  Also no microwave.  So as far as things working as they should I'll say \"mostly\" but there is room for improvement.\n\nStaff was friendly, professional and very responsive (even to the point of making sure we had enough bottled water to get started).  There is a concierge desk.  The hotel is on kind of a side street so it may be a bit more difficult getting a cab although it's about a three block walk to the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  \n\nWould I stay here again?  Only thing that might cause some hesitation is the cost. $275 with taxes for one night is not a good omen for a Fairfield Inn, even if it happens to be in New York City.  The Fairfield brand was intended to be Marriott's answer to \"budget\" lodging.  Room rates nationwide have been climbing higher than inflation as well but despite how good this place it I think it needs to be more realistic.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I paid USD 774.00 for a two-night stay in this 2-star hotel which is extremely higher than the USD 216.00 a night I paid at the swank Crowne Plaza hotel nearby. This hotel's entrance door is irritatingly constricted and can hardly accommodate jumbo-sized guests, while its lobby is as small as a kitchen.  Breakfast has an unlimited serving of cheap convenience store stuff but the assortment is so few.  The food they serve are not palatable to Asians like me.  They use environmentally hazardous  styro plates and plastic utensils.  While the rooms are comfortable, they do not have drinking glasses inside the rooms.  Again, they have plastic cups. Is this a Marriott?\n\nWhile I was told by front desk people that the property is not a full-fledged Marriott hotel, whatever that means, the room price are way way above what I normally pay for a night's stay in a Marriott hotel in other parts of the world.  But then they would always argue that this is NYC and hotel rooms are not very cheap.  If that is the case, what could be a more plausible reason for their rates which is 50% more than the rates charged by Crowne Plaza, a hotel  better located in the heart of Times Square.  They have good breakfast, you drink on glasses and not on plastic cups, you eat on china plates and not on styro plates.\n\nAll I can say is avoid this hotel at all cost if you don't want to be ripped off.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

From the hotel staff, to the wonderful room and the yummy breakfast, it was all first class. Even the price was amazing for what you get in the city. It's a wonderful value. My husband and I stayed there December 16-19, 2016 for a surprise trip for his 50th birthday. I was in contact prior to our trip with the front desk supervisor Michelle Granados. She went out of her way to give us early check in after a red eye flight, a city view room upgrade and even sent us wine and a birthday card signed by the staff. She was so professional and nice. Even calling us by the name the remainder of the trip.They went above and beyond. Our room was on the 20th floor and perfect size. The TV was huge, bed was comfortable and met our needs in every way! The front desk staff helped with directions or whatever we needed. The breakfast staff were hard workers and super helpful. The cleaning staff was courteous and sweet. The hotel was close to everything so it was convenient to wherever we went in our jam packed 3 days. Some people complained about the elevators, but there was only one time that I noticed it being a little long. Noting to really complain about. We did go up to the rooftop bar just to check out the view Saturday night. Got to cut the line since we were hotel guests. Basically came right back down because it was too foggy to see anything. The breakfast was good. Plenty to choose from. Waffles, eggs, bagels, bacon, sausage, fruit, yogurt, cereal. Enough to fill your bellies before heading out for the day. They have to go boxes so we preferred taking breakfast up to our room a couple times so we could stay in our PJ's. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the fireplace was so welcoming after coming in from the cold.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to New York.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Valet parking was so helpful and a breeze.we didn't try the breakfast because there was such a long line and it didn't look like any seats avail. Saturday it ran 7-10 and we were down just after 7.

It appeared to be the best value, with it being centrally located and only about \u00a31000 for 5 nights (which between two people isn't that much, especially at Christmas!)\n\nOverall I'd say it's definitely three star. The rooms and bathrooms are very good - clean and modern and comfortable. HOWEVER for two days in a row, we came back to our room at around 6pm after a long day walking, to find our room hadn't been cleaned. Once I complained about it, a cleaner was up with us in about half an hour...but still, I don't expect to have to prompt any hotel to clean my room.\n\nThe Sky Room bar was one of the reasons we were attracted to this hotel, but the hotel doesn't actually own it. So it's open to the public (and only for three nights a week during the winter months) and it gets pretty busy - we could see all the locals queuing up to get in as we left our hotel each evening. Because of that, we didn't bother with it. They also supposedly have a Sports Bar open from 5pm each night, although I couldn't find it! What this hotel is lacking is a bar area that you can grab a coffee or a snack from during the day, if you need a break and don't want to go out.\n\nI echo everyone else's comments about the breakfast area too - far too cramped and the staff running it are rude. They do have take away containers down there though, so we tended to get down there early (pre 7.30...any later and just forget it, you'll be queueing!) and then stock up and take it back to our room. They also don't give you proper cutlery - it's all plastic. Not impressed with that at all!\n\nStaff on the front desk are very accommodating and polite. The lobby area is lovely. There aren't enough lifts for the quantity of rooms...but we didn't experience anything too bad - the longest we ever had to wait for a lift was 5 mins.\n\nThe location is perfect and so convenient if you want to be based near Times Square. There's a subway station at the end of the road, but we tended to use the TimesSquare 42nd street one because it's got better direct links and we didn't fancy changing lines constantly!\n\nTIP: check out restaurant Il Punto - it's one block away and delightful!

The hotel's location is excellent and is a 10 minute walk from Times Square. The staff on the front desk were efficient and really friendly as were the concierge staff. The room was pretty spacious for New York and was clean and tidy and had a comfortable king size bed.  The bathroom had a shower but no bath. The room had a hairdryer and an iron and ironing board too which was useful.  Previous reviews have mentioned waiting a long time for the lifts and sometimes we had to wait about 5 minutes but no more. Breakfast was included in the price and the selection and quality of the food was very good.  The only downside was that it was served on paper plates and plastic knives and forks which has prevented me awarding 5 stars, but hey we could live with that. Check out is 1200 but the hotel provides safe and free storage for your luggage which we used.  I would definitely stay here again on any future trips.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

In fact this is operated by a third party and is only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. It is not just for residents and plays loud music until 04.00 am. The operators clearly advertise it widely so there are usually lot of people. Rooms on the lower floors are better if you are a light sleeper. Despite all this the hotel has clean well appointed and well serviced rooms and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The concierge will book tickets and generally advise on anything. The location is in the heart of everything and all main attractions are within walking distance except the 9\/11 memorial which is at the end of the subway route.

Marriott Elite allows you to check in the day before we arrived, so I called the front desk and Mario was able to put us into 3 rooms on the 30th floor and 2 on 31st so that we were all close together.  When we arrived, Mario was there to greet us with a smile and helped us with whatever we needed.  We were greeted with a chocolate Hershey's bar per room with my name on it!  Everyone at the front desk were always professional, friendly, and very helpful.  They always called me by my name.  Mario and the front end group sent up a welcome gift of goodies to say thanks for bringing my group to their hotel.  I've never had a nicer group of people at any of the Marriott's I've stayed at and I only stay at Marriotts.  Between the maids & workers in all areas everyone was friendly and helpful.\n\nEven though there are 32 floors we never waited very long for elevators.  We paid for the rooms with the view of Times Square and we loved the view.\n\nBreakfast is included.  It's rather basic but very convenient in the back area of the main lobby.\n\nThe location of this Marriott is the best for NYC as it is just a few streets away from Times Square and most plays are within 10 mins. walk.  The Blue line is half a block away so can go anywhere on the subway including going to and from JFK airport.  It is across the street from Port Authority which was great for our friends coming in from Baltimore on the Greyhound bus. The Hop On buses are also just a few blocks away. The street it is on is not glamorous but safe.\n\nI would rate our experience a full 10 in all ways.  For the price it is awesome!","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We decided to go for a stroll around central park for our anniversary, grab a snack, have a nap in the afternoon  (being pregnant I am constantly tried) as we had booked Broadway to see a show that evening so wanted to go for a romantic meal before.\n\nOn our return to the room after our morning out the house keeping had been in but there was no suprise for my husband.

After speaking to the management again she said \"all I can offer is to fill out a form for our insurance\" at this point I was in tears!

One tip for people, take note of the signs on the entrances and enter the one that is relevant to the line you wish to use otherwise you can end up walking half a mile in warm, humid tunnels (the trains themselves are air conditioned but they have to blow off the excess heat somewhere).\n\nIs there a dubious liquor store and Chinese restaurant on the same road, yes, but we had no issues no matter the time of day (or night).\n\nThe room was large enough for our needs, 2 adults and an 8 year old, with two queen sized beds and a shower big enough for two. Paul Mitchell toiletries are complimentary from the hotel, and my wife appreciated those. We were on the 24th floor and no issues with noise, room faced the Port Authority but the view was still great looking towards Times Square and the New York Times.\n\nCoffee machine, hair dryer and iron supplied in the room, coffee machine is a little redundant as free coffee is supplied in the lobby 24 hours a day. The room is air conditioned with full control in the room.\n\nThe lifts, which everyone mentions, are not the speediest but I only had an issue on one night where there was a private function in the Sky Room and they seemed to be using all three lifts. I must admit the attitude that night did make you feel like a second class citizen, hotel guests spending hundreds of dollars a night were getting in the way of people buying a beer. However that was one night, in fact one hour of one night.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast is a great way to start the day, bacon, sausage, eggs and potatoes on the hot side and bagels, cereals etc on the cold side. Eat as much as you want, with the room run efficiently, in fact a special thank you to the room supervisor who squeezed us in ten minutes late for breakfast. Tip, read the sign in the lift for queue times for breakfast.\n\nIce and vending machines in the basement.\n\nFinally at check out the staff could not be more helpful, looking after the luggage and letting us create a bomb site while we tried to beat the 23kg limit per bag.\n\nIf not for the attitude on the Tuesday night where they had the private function it would have been 5 stars, the staff deserve it.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Our room was small, but very clean and cozy. The beds were excellent, which was perfect since we were working all day and walking a lot so we needed a good rest every night. We never tried the breakfast as we were always rushing out to work in the morning, but i'm pretty sure they offered a free breakfast.

It is directly across from the port authority which has a starbucks inside if you don't want hotel coffee:) When we went to check out, we were told to call about 45 minutes in advance to get our vehicle, so we called about an hour before we needed it.

And the biggest plus was THERE IS ONLY 8 ROOMS ON EACH FLOOR!! Which made for a great nights sleep! The grounds were always clean, the fitness center was great but. the only 3 things I didn't like was 1. they had 3 elevators but, from 5:00 PM - 4:00 PM 1 of them was for the bar only and eventually made a Line in the lobby and a 10 minute wait to go down to the lobby. 2. The coffee didn't taste good but, I found out like most Marriott's they serve Starbucks (Yuck!) I just wish they would serve different brands. 3. I wished the Breakfast was served later because, by the time we got back from Central Park at 10:30 AM Breakfast had been over for 1 Hour so I missed it but, breakfast in NYC is a huge plus. I would stay here again and recommend the hotel especially you want to stay near Times Square (less than 2 blocks) or are leaving on a early bus or train from Port Authority Bus Terminal (40th Street Entrance located directly across the street!) or New York Penn Station (10 Blocks South).","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location close to the main subway lines was an easy walk..about 5 min walk. We walked to the subway and took the subway everywhere we were visiting. It was also a short walk, maybe 10 min to Times Square. Did not feel unsafe at any time (Times Square at night, in the subway, or anywhere-lots of police presence!)\n\nThe room was clean, and while we were expecting the small hotel room and corridors in NYC, it was bigger than other hotels we have stayed at in NYC. The hotel had a modern, urban decor throughout. Comfortable bed and good shower. \n\nThe hotel had posted a sign of when peak traffic occurred at the breakfast buffet and we went during a non-peak time, which worked great for our schedule. We had no problems and the buffet was the standard fare, but when we left, there were many people looking for a place to sit (although there was a greeter to seat you?). Sum up: Go early for breakfast.\n\nWe drove into NYC and parking was a breeze at this hotel. We bought the parking with the room in a package, so we found value in the overall price paid (given that we were in NYC). Bellhop and parking staff were great looking after our baggage and car. \n\nThere were only 3 or 4 elevators, so sometimes there was a little wait, but not too bad. The concierge was helpful with our direction questions and gave us a map and marked the way to the places we were visiting. Check in staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a great stay.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Other reviews are a little too critical.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-07-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Long review, but other people got me nervous for no reason, and I hope this helps to alleviate some concerned travelers staying here in the future. The price is really great for the area and it was an overall great stay! Many thanks to Kim, she really knows how to deliver customer service!\n\nKim checked us in and cheerfully accommodated us with the requested early check-in and high floor room. This was especially important to my fianc\u00e9 and myself, because we were in town for a wedding, but she is in full study mode for an upcoming licensure exam and needed the extra few hours to study. I understand that these requests can't always be accommodated, but thankfully it was able to happen for us and the courtesy and kindness with which Kim did it made our day and really put this hotel at the top for us. \n\nI was somewhat nervous to stay here given some of the reviews that I had read. I want to ease the mind of those of you who may be in the same boat:\n1.) ELEVATORS: Yes, there's only 3 elevators and yes it may take a while (2-5 min) to get up to a high floor room, but this is ONLY during peak hours and remember you're staying in a fairly tall building with a lot of people, it's to be expected. \n2.) ROOM SIZE: Yes, the hotel rooms are smaller than what most of us are used too, but again, you're staying in NYC, so unless you're paying a premium at a Ritz for a suite, I think we can all agree that a nice bed, desk, armoire (for a closet), sink, and walk-in shower are more than enough. \n3.) BREAKFAST LINES: Yes, the breakfast area gets really busy around 7:15-7:30a, but the potential business of the breakfast area was CLEARLY advertised in the elevator. So, we got up at 6:45a and beat the rush. Problem solved. \n4.) BREAKFAST: Yes, you serve your own breakfast on plastic plates with plastic utensils, but if this is a problem for you, I really don't know what to say to you. I thought the food was fine enough, the area was clean, the ladies manning the door and picking up plates were efficient and doing their jobs well. \n5.) NOISE: There's potential for noise from the street and from the SkyDeck bar, in our case more likely from the bar, and Kim warned us and let us know to call down if it became a problem, but we were fine through the night. Only noise was from some neighbors with small children, but it was no problem at all. \n6.) ROOM: The room was recently renovated (per a card left in our room) and it was nice and clean with no problems to speak of. \n7.) CITY VIEW: We paid a little extra for a \"city view\" room and did indeed have a room facing away from the Port Authority terminal and towards lower Manhattan, beautiful! \n8.) CONCERNS BEING CLOSE TO PORT AUTHORITY: Yes, the area is right next to the Port Authority terminal and there's potential for \"unsavory characters\", of which there were some, but again, you're staying in NYC, there's interesting people everywhere, get over it, look after your stuff, don't get in trouble, and just enjoy your stay. \n9.) TRANSPORTATION: The subway entrance for the Port Authority terminal for select trains, I think only the 2 and 3, were right next to the Walgreens only a 2 min walk away. So convenient.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were able to easily walk to two shows, \"Lion King\" and \"Beautiful,\" and went to Radio City Music Hall with just a couple of subway stops.\n\nThe very small breakfast area is a picture of efficiency.

I booked this hotel for a 80th birthday trip with my mom. The hotel room was small (as we expected for NYC), but clean and comfortable. I should note that we had a king bed room, and while there was a chair at the desk, there wasn't another chair in the room. Thus, for relaxing in the room and watching TV, we had to sit on the bed. This was fine with us as we really didn't spend much time in the room anyway. We had an upper floor (27th floor of 32 total) and didn't notice the traffic noise at all - I think that could be an issue with the lower rooms. There were 3 elevators, and wait time wasn't an issue during our stay. Breakfast is provided and is the typical continental style - assorted cereal, yogurt, breads, eggs, bacon, juice, etc. The seating area can get busy, but the staff works hard to seat people in an orderly fashion. We never had to wait, but also went earlier in the morning (as the staff had warned that wait time was the worst in the later part of the morning). The hotel is within easy walking distance to the theater district and times square - my 80 year old mother is quite fit, but definitely had no problem walking to our tours or theater.

Check in time was 4pm. We came there 5pm and the line up was horrid right out the hotel door and against the wall. We waited 1.5-2hours in that god awful line. We went straight to front desk if they could hold our luggage and come back after they said you gotta wait in the check in line. Upon finally getting to the front desk to check in. The staff were rushing but did delivery good customer service and apologized for the wait. Our room was ready and everything upon leaving check in area the elevators themselves had a nice 1 hour line up. The elevators are very tiny can only fit 3-5 people with luggage. We did not reach our room till 8-830pm. The room was very nice the Refresh newly renoved rooms definetly delivered. The Room although small to fit 2 Queen Beds were comfy and the pillows were soft and very comfy like. The Bathroom with Shower as nice amazing water pressure. The Sink with no counter space not liked but ok. The Room was good we enjoyed the room stay but did not enjoy the elevator hotel. We opted for stairs instead going from the 24th floor down was not fun. Other guests took stairs with us and complained they waited 30 minutes and still no elevator going down. So i would imagine going back up would take forever. So our entire stay we did stairs. Upon mentioning to front desk they couldn't help us just said \"OH, were overbooked\" but upon checking website if i could book rooms for that same day it showed lots of availability. We wasted so much time at this hotel going up and down. I would now not choose this hotel for any more future stays.

Gli ascensori, solo tre per circa 30 piani, in orario di punta sono sovraffollati e per arrivare alle stanze nei piani alti o scendere ci vuole del tempo. Nota negativa e non da poco lo staff inadeguato e per niente professionale; al momento del check in lo staff presente nella reception richiedeva subito la carta di credito e senza avvertire il cliente autorizzava il pagamento anticipato del soggiorno. Il problema \u00e8 che ci accorgevamo grazie all arrivo di una mail che i pagamenti erano errati. Infatti una camera veniva pagata due volte!!! Subito avvisavamo la reception che annullava una transazione. Il problema che alla banca non risultava il pagamento negato e questo denaro \u00e8 stato prelevato dal mio conto. Ma io dico \u00e8 possibile fare errori di questo tipo????? Fortunatamente il mio servizio di carta di credito mi ha permesso di notare tale anomalia prima di lasciare l albergo per\u00f2 con altre carte di credito non avresti la possibilit\u00e0 di accorgerti in tempo di certi errori!! Inoltre subito dopo la transazione non ci veniva rilasciata alcuna ricevuta ne' ci veniva detto quanto pagato come se non fosse un problema nostro. In tutto il mondo una volta effettuata una transazione viene rilasciata una ricevuta di pagamento soprattutto quando si parla di tanti dollari. Spero giunto in Italia di non trovare altre sorprese in quanto le carte di credito utilizzate sono state due. Oltre a questo, il personale varie volte interpellato non ha preso in considerazione la gravit\u00e0 della situazione e solamente il giorno del check out dopo l ennesima sollecitazione si \u00e8 degnato di farci avere una dichiarazione scritta dell'errore di transazione. Sono cose che non devono assolutamente accadere soprattutto quando si parla di denaro di turisti che giungono da varie parti del mondo.

Very helpful staff. Room was well prepared and of sufficient size for two people. Only minus point was the quality of breakfast but was just sufficient. Free tea and coffee near the lobby all the time.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I chose the hotel based on its location -- it was a 10 minute or so walk from Grand Central Station...2 blocks from 42nd street.  From the moment we checked in we felt so overly welcomed by Jasmine and Kim.  They work tirelessly at the front desk to make sure that everyone is comfortable.  Check-in was a breeze, the room was immaculate (we even had complementary water which, if you have stayed at a hotel in NYC or the surrounding area you know is not common). We heard many people talking about the roof top bar.  They said it is NY's best kept secret.  We did not go there because we had to get up early to do a walk in central park.  You are staying in the heart of NYC you are near everything.  I would recommend the hotel's breakfast buffet!  We ate at Dafni Greek Taverna...as a New Yorker I would recommend looking for some of the authentic restaurants...not just the ones you see on the Food Network...email me if you need recommendations.\n\nWe had theater tickets in the evening after the walk in Central Park.  They have \"day rates\" if you need to check out later on in the day\/evening.  What a fantastic advantage.  I was able to get back from the walk and then get ready for dinner and the show and then check out.  \n\nOn a side note, Thank you to the entire staff.  My friend also stayed that weekend and her son has cancer and like us, was in the city for the walk.  The entire staff made him feel like a King\/Celebrity.  They went out of their way for my friends family and when I picked up my luggage later on Saturday night they inquired about the walk, how he did and how he was feeling.   It was so heartwarming and I am so grateful for all that you did.\n\nI would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel!","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Room although it was very small, it was nice and quiet. The Location of the Hotel was also very nice. Sky room was nice too. The Breakfast could be improved. Basic and bland. However there was a big variety of items such as bagels, muffins, breakfast cereals, Fruits, Yoghurt, nice fruit salad e.t.c. thus anyone could find something to eat. The Starbucks coffee that is served all day was also a nice plus.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

Loved everything.  Hotel is cute.  Breakfast was good.  Bar\/kitchen area is quaint & comfy.  Front desk staff was so polite & pleasant.  Room small but still comfortable.  Top security.  I had a lovely stay and will stay there again.  Everything so close and available.   I loved my stay and recommend it to everyone to stay.  They have a rooftop\/sky view hangout.  Great place!*****","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}
