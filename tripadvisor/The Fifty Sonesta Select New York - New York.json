I was coming back from a long business trip to Europe and meeting with my wife and kids for a week in New York. They were flying across the country from California to meet me at the hotel. Unfortunately JFK that day has severe delays due to the weather so instead of all arriving around the same time in the early evening, my wife and kids did not get into New York until midnight. When I arrived around 8:00pm on a Sunday, I told the person checking me in that my wife and kids would be arriving later than me due to the weather delays and to consequently give them a key to the room upon their arrival. There was no issue with this and the attendant was very polite. It's not the first time that this happens where we don't arrive at the same time and never had any issues. Well, when my wife and two little kids arrived at the hotel around close to 1:00am in the morning, the hotel attendant gave them a super hard time, told them they were not on the reservations and could not give them a key to the room. You can only imagine the despair after 7 hours or travels, delays and 2 crying little kids! No empathy, no emotional intelligence, no phone call to my room  (the room phone I found out later was out of order) etc. My wife tried to reach me but my phone was silenced as I fell asleep with the jet-lag from Europe. Anyway, after about 1\/2 hour of begging to get a key to the room, someone the attendant got a ah-ah moment that my family should get a key! I called reception right away upon the arrival and told the lady that she must be deranged for not letting my family to the room after I specified they would arrive late and also the fact that my wife also had called the hotel to let them know she'd be arriving late. This was the main issue here which is why I am giving the lowest possible rating. Beside that the hotel was subpar: uncomfortable beds, no water (constantly out of water at the convenience store and no vending machines to purchase water or snacks: imagine that in 100 degree weather), tiny gym with old equipment and guess what no water as well (constantly out)! They also never replaced the phone in the room after I asked three times. Breakfast was absolutely disgusting and they charged $20 for it! Frankly this hotel should issue me a refund a major apology! I got a very non heartfelt apology from the manager i.e. \"We apologize sir but your family was not listed on the reservation\" - she could not care less that they waited for over 30 minutes to get the key to the room. This hotel is a pure disgrace and I hope nobody will be treated the same way we were. Just avoid!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Needless to say, many bad thoughts ran through my mind. Had my pre paid purchase been handled the right way back in february I wouldn't standing at check in sweating and worried if we had a room the next 9 nights. \n\nThen we checked out our room, and the next surprice appeared. Our room with a terrace had 2 doors in it to the terrace. We couldn't open one door and couldn't lock the other door. We went to the front desk and they sent for someone from maintenance. When they came he said the handles were broken and that the hotel had ordered for new handles.  The next day after sleeping with one eye open due to a door that couldn't be locked we again went to the front desk for help.\n\nThe maintenance guy that came told a whole different story. He said the handles were taken away as a precaution so children wouldn't open the door themselves and walking out on the terrace alone. Completly understandable decision. \n\nHe said our choice was to either have the doors locked or open permanently during our stay. We chose to have both doors locked. But that left us with a key item of our room unavailable, one feature we really looked forward to. In the future Sonesta would be wise to let customers know in advance that the doors would either have to be locked or open during theire stay.\n\nNext was the biggest headscratcher for us.\n\nWhen we woke up the first morning we found out that during the night the AC had started leaking water. We notified the front desk early in the morning but the issue was NOT resolved until at night time the day after. \n\nAt least 30 hours after we rapported it we still had water on the carpet. We went to the front desk every time we went out to either ask for info or rapport that we still needed someone to get rid of the water.  The solution was a machine that blew air onto the carpet. This was after the first solution which was to lay a towel over the leakage. I thought carpets with water damage was going to be replaced.\n\nNeedles to say I was worried about this, that and the other thing regarding mould due to water on the carpet.

Here is a list of what we liked:  Although it's not listed as an amenity, there was a safe in the closet for locking up valuables or whatever, a nice surprise.  The bed was very comfortable and the pillows extremely so, as was the couch which comes with an upholstered ottoman.  The room was spotlessly clean.  The housekeeping staff is excellent.  The large 50 or 55\" Samsung TV with a swivel had an impressive picture.  The kitchen area fit the room nicely and was like new.  The refrigerator didn't make any noise and there was even a quiet dishwasher which housekeeping used to wash glassware. The large shower was terrific and well designed. The towels were  thick and fluffy. The windows in the room were double pane for noise abatement and could be opened for fresh air if so desired.  There are three elevators all of which are sleek and extremely fast.  I can't vouch for the breakfast room, exercise room or lounge as we didn't visit those areas.

The Fifty Sonesta, in my opinion, is a great option for families as the suites are larger and priced better than average for such a good Midtown Manhattan location. Close walk to St Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue shops and MoMA. There is an amazing French Bakery called Paris Baguette just around the corner with myriad tasty fresh pastries and remarkably smooth Lavazza lattes.  Yes, we don't all want to wait in line for Ess-A-Bagel nearby. Further, just across the road from Paris Bagutte is a Duane Reade (drug store) if you need some Advil or toothbrush or whatever (snacks - read Krispy Creme).  Be aware now, there is a $39 USD facility fee for the amenities at The Fifty.  This includes a \"credit\" of $15 USD from this $39 total you pay daily to \"buy\" items from The Cupboard just adjacent the Front Desk.  Make sure you get something that you already paid for from the Cupboard daily for this $15 USD credit.  It doesn't accumulate so that you can't save it all to use on the last day.  The 1 bedroom terrace suite is about 700 sf on the 21st floor.  Has a small kitchen with dishes and utensils, dishwasher, microwave, keurig coffeemaker; a dining area with table and 4 chairs, large living area with sectional sleeper couch and many windows.  The terrace looks directly down 3rd Avenue (note the NYPD 17th precinct is a block behind the building so you can expect some noise, but likely more of a sense of security). Down side to the suite was the single small bathroom, but we made do. The shower controls needed a Shaman to nail down the best setting for hot water, but I am a quick learn and then was stuck turning on the shower for everyone thereafter. The primary doorman and concierge, Romeo, is likely a key reason why this boutique hotel has so many return visitors. Incredibly polite, pleasant, helpful with great local restaurant or other venue advice.  I mean it. I have never met such a phenomenal gentleman as a concierge. Keep this man, Sonesta Fifty management he's gold.  Marco is pretty darn good too, on the night shift.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":502408,"title":"Shockingly poorly-run hotel is a stain on NYC","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-04-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"This hotel may have been adequate in the past, but these days it is crumbling in all senses of the word. It is dirty, noisy, drafty, cold and uncomfortable, the wifi is a joke, while the staff (with the notable exception of the doormen) are beyond incompetent. A shockingly poorly-run establishment that's a stain on NYC.\n\nI spent the best part of a week here, examined several different rooms and observed how management - in particular, head \"manager\" Randolph - deal with everyday issues that come up in any hotel. It's true what they say: the fish rots from the head down. When you have a disinterested and unmotivated person at the top, it sets the tone for everyone else.\n\nThe infrastructure: the hotel is in dire need of renovation, the rooms are dirty, the carpets are worn, the walls are stained, the wallpaper is peeling, various fixtures are broken (see photos). Much more problematic: the hotel has next to no sound or heat insulation. The windows are rickety, with 1.5 inch gaps in the frames. If you have a corner room where two of the four sides are covered in windows, it's like you're sleeping on the street - every noise, crash, honk, and scream from outside pierces straight into the room. The same with neighbouring rooms or the hallways: the walls are paper-thin and you involuntary become part of all of your neighbours' conversations. The elevators are noisy and can be heard from most rooms, even those that are not adjacent. The aircon system is old, rickety and super noisy. The pipes in the bathroom leak and make noises. Overall, it is definitely not a restful place - unless you are drunk and passed-out, you WILL be bothered by various noises 24\/7.\n\nThe management: The hotel appears to be run on an unfortunate combination of: 1) cutting all possible corners to save money, and 2) a total lack of common sense. For example, management took the decision to turn off the heating on 13 April (even though the NYC Heat Law stipulates landlords must provide heating through 31 May). Lo and behold, on 17 April the temperatures plummeted to below 40 Fahrenheit at night, leaving the rooms absolutely freezing, with NO heating for any of the guests. The staff at the front desk simply shrugged it off and said there was nothing they could do, as the decision to switch off the heating was taken by management. They offered extra blankets (!) I've never been so cold in a hotel room anywhere around the world. After two days of repeated complaints, Randolph promised to provide a space heater... I had to chase him three times, each time he said it was on the way and then... he promptly disappeared. When I asked his colleagues, they said he had gone home for the day and they could not help. They said I was free to go a purchase a heater when the shops open on Monday morning (!), or I could again get extra blankets. In the end, facing a third night of sleeping in a freezing room, I decided to ask the doorman for assistance and on my suggestion he kindly found a hotel down the street to borrow a space heater from. Why his colleagues could not come up with a solution was beyond me. Nobody from management or the front-desk staff could be bothered to make the slightest effort to assist or think outside the box - the level of apathy was unreal. The only thing I heard over and over again during my stay were excuses or explanations for various problems; never was there a solution offered. Every single time was a case of \"sorry, can't help you\".\n\nThere are countless other examples of sheer incompetence that would not be tolerated at far less prominent hotels. It is almost impossible to get through on the phone to the front desk; the staff either let it ring or put you on hold indefinitely. When you go downstairs to see what's going on they are not busy, but simply chatting amongst themselves. Anything you request from Housekeeping takes absolute ages (it took them 1hr and 20mins and 3 follow-up calls to bring a simple towel that they had forgotten to put in the bathroom). \n\nAs a \\going-away bonus, the hotel also managed to lose my laundry. As per the hotel's service terms, any laundry submitted before 9am should be returned to the guest by 8pm on the same day. I submitted my items at 8am on the penultimate day of my stay, but they were never returned to the hotel (or the hotel lost them). Cue more calls to the front desk, with no-one picking up, then when I went downstairs in person and suggested to Randolph that it was not professional to promise guests to follow up on issues such as no heating or lost laundry and then disappear, he could not be more disinterested. He simply shrugged his shoulders and said he could not remember what he had promised to whom. We are still waiting for the lost items to be located.\n\nIt's true that customer service levels have dropped across the board in many industries over the past couple of years, and the hospitality sector is clearly struggling to find qualified staff. Fifty NYC takes this to a whole new level, however. An aged, creaky, noisy, dirty building run by apathetic, disinterested staff with no comprehension of customer service or common sense. \n\nDon't spoil your NYC and avoid this place like the plague!","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location was superb, about a 10 block walk to the New Amsterdam theater, but in a quieter part of Manhattan where you weren't overwhelmed and could escape the madness of Times Square.\n\nAs for the experience and the hospitality, Im not sure we could have asked for more. Romeo was our bellman, and the minute we arrived on property he made us feel at home. He was so genuine and never overwhelming, we honestly would have come back to this hotel again just because of how he treated us. The check in process was a breeze (you can do an expedited check in online which helps!). On top of that, Randall, who checked us in, saw how many bags we had and upgraded us to a suite with a kitchenette without us even asking.  The extra space ended up being a blessing because we were snowed in the next day and we didnt feel claustrophobic like some NYC hotels can tend to feel. They also honored our rate for the previous nights stay. \nThis hotel didnt have a restaurant onsite, but its not like you need one in NYC. The gym was spacious and the foyer was welcoming and clean. \n\nWe will be coming back every year to this hotel. Thank you for making us feel at home and making our daughters first trip to NYC a blast.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":502408,"title":"Pretty good...could do a few things to be even better","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-01-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Our family of four had a long stay in a One-bedroom King Suite over the Christmas holidays. It's a modern hotel with a small, pleasant lobby, good lighting, three elevators, on a safe, well-lit, busy block. Overall it was a great stay, but there are a few things they could do to get to a solid 5-star rating.\n\nI'll start with the PROS:\n- Location, location, location. Seriously awesome spot with so many choices for easy, safe, and timely public transportation. The 4, 6, E, and M subway stops are a block or two away, and these are nicer stations that were safe and busy, even late at night. The uptown buses on 3rd and Madison Avenues, and the downtown buses on 2nd and Lexington Avenues, all run very regularly. We got the 7-day Unlimited passes from MTA (buy at a subway station), and used CityMapper or Apple Maps on our phones to figure out routes to our destinations and back. We got a ton of use from these! There is also a Walgreen's around the corner, which is always handy. Easy walk to Grand Central, Rockefeller, St. Patrick's, MoMA,  and the 5th Avenue shops.\n- Friendly, responsive staff. The lobby personnel and housekeeping were awesome. They brought stuff up pretty quickly when we needed something (towels, TP, kitchen stuff, etc.). Everyone always greeted you with a genuine smile.\n- Kitchenette. While we did not cook any major meals, it was great to have a small fridge, microwave, sink, 2-burner stove, and dishwasher in our room. We ordered groceries ahead of time and had them delivered via Instacart the day of our arrival. We always had breakfast in the room: cereal, toast, bagels (Ess-a-Bagel is across the street), instant oatmeal. There is a small toaster and coffee maker in the room.\n- Big bathroom. When it's just myself and my husband sometimes the quaint, boutique hotels are a fun change. But those little sinks with almost no counter space would not work with us and our two teen girls. The tub\/shower and toilet were fine, and the sink with a long counter plus open shelves beneath were great for all our toiletries.\n\nOkay, now the CONS:\n- I booked us a One-Bedroom Suite - King Bed. In the photos on their site it shows an L-shaped sectional sofa and a good-sized dining table with four dining chairs in a separate dining nook. Our room did not have all that. The sofa was just a regular sofa, not a sectional. The dining area was a tiny table about 2' in diameter with only two small \"dining\" chairs, and not in any kind of \"nook,\" but against a small wall next to the kitchen. The bedroom and bathroom were great, but the living area was nowhere near what the photos showed. It was way more cramped and smaller than what we were expecting; it certainly did not feel like a 750 sq ft room. I would have complained but we got in 2 hours later than expected and it was late, and our groceries had already arrived. We just made do. But that was a major bummer and a disappointment.\n- A little upgrade on the kitchenette is in order. Yes, there was a toaster and a coffeemaker, which was nice. BUT...a nicer toaster that could actually fit a bagel would be even better. The toaster was so old and small, with burned edges all around. The coffeemaker was sufficient, but if Affinia would upgrade it to at least a Keurig, it would work and taste a lot better. When we got in there was one glass, two mugs, and a bunch of spoons. We had to ask for more drink ware, forks, and knives (which they did bring quickly). The dishwasher's bottom rack was also completely off the rails, literally. To pull it in or out you had to lift it and put it on the door; it no longer slid on the rails properly. \n\nWould we stay there again? Probably, next time we go again as a family. Our kids love NYC and now that they're older it's so easy to bring them and enjoy more. Next time, though, when booking this same room I will definitely clarify room size and amenities. Would love it, though, if they spruced up some of the kitchen issues I mentioned.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Staff upon arrival at our hotel seem pleasant. We had to leave a deposit of $150 dollars as a reservation on our room (standard practise at hotels). They advised me that my card did not work, so they used my husbands. Upon looking a couple of days later I noticed I had a pending charge from the hotel of \u00a3625.81! I was a bit confused as did not know what that amount was for? I told reception who believed it was the amount for the room. I advised this was already pre paid for through Virgin holidays. He said not to worry I will get this removed asap. So we went on our way. It wasn\u2019t until I came home to the UK that I noticed that the whole amount had been charged to my card! I have contacted Virgin and Affinity directly and to date I still not have received this amount back? I tried to call the hotel directly we got cut off. But nobody tried to call me back! Absolutely appalling! I am taking this a lot further with Virgin and have put in a complaint! \nWe were also fobbed off by reception with regards to hot water in our room. I asked on Day 1 if someone could come and take a look at our hot water. I asked again on Day 2, 3 and 4. We checked out on Day 5 and still had no hot water.

I heard that from my granddaughter on our birthday trip to NYC with our two teenaged granddaughters.  \nHowever, first the good: Romeo and Lenny, both made the arrival to the hotel promising.  They were friendly and welcoming.  Also the Sunday front desk manager went above and beyond to help us retrieve some left behind Airpods.  \nNow, the not so good: the front desk manager on our arrival on Saturday.  I had actually spoken with her the day before and requested a room facing the street on a higher floor.  She said she would make note of my request.  I booked a Junior Suite for the size of the room and the photos that travelers had posted on the internet.  I had also sent the same request via the website, but never got a response.\nUpon arrival I again mentioned my request for the front facing suite on a higher floor.  She said she remembered the call and checked to see if our room was ready.  She called housekeeping and they were just getting ready to clean it.  We were called back in an hour to check in.  We were given a room on the 10th floor out of 22.  OK, so this time it was \"the bottom of the top\".  When we got out of the elevator, the room was right next to the elevator.  Never a promising sign.  We entered and noticed first, it was a good size.  Second we noticed that it was very dark and upon opening the shades we had a great view of what could only be called a large airshaft.  So, as it was a special occasion trip and I had talked up the hotel to my granddaughters, I said I would call the manger and see if we could get a better location. However the room phone was not working, it was dead.  So instead I went down to the front desk to speak with the manager.  She would not budge.  She said she remembered speaking with me but there was nothing that she could do about it.  She knew right from the start that for whatever reason that I was going to get the exact opposite of what I had very politely requested beginning a month out from our reservation.  \nThere are way too many  hotels in NYC to choose from.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-08-04","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":" We spent one night at the Fifty Hotel & Suites while  visiting family in New York City. Upon arriving to the location the valet appeared to be backed with multiple cars double parked in the street. The bell man informed us valet was running behind and we could leave our keys and they'd get to the car in about 20 minutes. Since we were concerned about being double parked we ended up driving 1 block over to a  garage as we didn't want to risk getting a ticket, the garage saved us $8. \nAfter finally returning to hotel we found you needed a room key to enter the hotel ( which we appreciated later that night when there was lots of unruley people roaming the area).\nUpon check in we were greeted with a modern lobby with nice art and a seating area. Check in was seamless as the reservation was  prepayed via Expedia $105. PreCovid the hotel offered a nightly guest reception that includeed wine and treats, since this was not happening due to social distancing they offered a $10 credit towards their pantry stocked with beer, wine & snacks.\nWe were assigned room 1501 which was a standard king bedroom. The room had ample space which is rare in NYC hotels as well as plenty of outlets. \nWith that said we did have a few issues during our stay. Be aware our room views were of dingy buildings. More importantly our thermostat didn't function properly on a warm April day the cooling function wouldn't seem to work which made our room uncomfortable.  In addition, the fan in the bathroom was not working so after taking a shower the ceiling was left with condensation which resulted in mold on the ceiling. \nWe pointed out these issues to the manager and they were apologetic and refunded our 'resort fee' saying they'd resolve the problem before the next guest arrived. \nOverall it was an average stay. The hotel has potential to be great with it's prime location, spacious rooms and a reasonably competitive rate ( minus the 45 dollar resort fee which is absurd).  If your staying in the future be sure to ask about maybe getting a room with a better view.  For video of our stay find us on YouTube at jenichael's journey.

Overall we had no major problems. The booking was correct and room ready, location was very convenient and surrounded by lots to do, eat and see. Staff was friendly and helpful. Mini-kitchen was nice to have and I felt the price was very reasonable for the area. A few negatives were the hotel is quite well-aged and it shows, things are a bit worn, it was \u2018surface clean\u2019 but not really clean, carpet was visibly dirty, dust bunnies under\u2026everything etc., hot water and pressure were good but tub was very slow to drain and the toilet only flushed all the way half the time which was weird. I called for maintenance to check the toilet and specifically said my kid was sick with a mystery illness so I\u2019d recommend wearing a mask (middle of this Delta wave) and he showed up without a mask, I didn\u2019t particularly care but it seemed a little careless to me. \n\nAs to some reviewers complaints about noise, it\u2019s in the middle of the city. It\u2019s noisy, no doubt. They decided to resurface the damn street our first night there, excavator, dump trucks at 2am. It sucked but I wanted to be in the city so that\u2019s what I get. The internal noise was also pretty loud, neighbors talking in the hall and whatnot but again, it\u2019s a hotel, you\u2019re not getting a soundproof room, sorry.\n\nOverall, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay again.

Quick check in, friendly doorman and front desk.  Went up to room and unfortunately, it wasn't cleaned.  Back to front desk and explained the situation.  Apologies and could we give them about an hour to rectify the situation. Having lived in NYC, we went out and ate...great food all around the hotel.  Returned to the hotel and was given a different room. BOY!!! Did we get a HUGE different room!  We had originally booked a 1 bedroom suite and what we were given in exchange was a one bedroom suite with a terrace.  If this was an apartment, I would've bought it because it was so spacious.   The housekeeping during the week was spotty maybe every other day. That was ok...didn't need new sheets everyday so we just asked for clean bath towels and they were delivered quickly.

During our visit we stayed at the Fifty and really enjoyed our stay.\nWe arrived at about 18:00hrs and was checked in by a very professional lady, unfortunately her name escapes me, apparently she had really good nails \ud83d\udc85. She gave us an overview of the hotels amenities with no sales pitch whatsoever.\nThe room was a regular room with 2 beds, TV, safe, fridge and coffee making facilities. Everything in the room was more than adequate for the four of us, it was never our intention to spend too much time in the room whilst in such a magnificent city.\nOn the second floor there is a gym and brew making facilities which are all inclusive in the price of the hotel. We made use of the brew facilities every evening when we returned from exploring. \nThe doormen were always polite and efficient, Marco in particular. \nIn the interest of providing a balanced review its only fair that I mention the noise that comes from the ventilation system outside, (this noise could never be described as the city vibrance) it also emitted a cooking smell. Whilst this was immediately noticeable I wasn't going to let it bother me as the hotel was more somewhere to sleep rather than the centre point of the holiday. The hotel do supply ear plugs, I was in room 519. \nDon't let the above point put you off visiting this hotel because you're right in the middle of everything. You're within walking distance of Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, Times Square and the delights of Broadway. \nOverall we really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to return when we make the trip to New York again.

We had booked a One Bedroom Deluxe Suite - 2 Queen Beds for my husband, me and our 14 year old daughter. We also booked a separate double room for my mother in law. The suite was ideal for our needs - the bedroom was very spacious with two large beds; bathroom with bath and shower, great walk in little kitchen with hob and toaster and kettle etc, and enough cutlery and plates just for the 4 of us (wouldn't be great if cooking up a feast but no need for eating in in NYC). We tended to have some breakfast first before sightseeing and it worked well. The sitting area was huge with a corner sofa and dining table - massive really for central NYC. The plan was that my daughter would sleep on the sofa bed and that was fine as it was also huge but in the end she shared our room - if you had a larger family there would be ample room for everyone to sleep comfortably. The terrace was great - we were on 20th floor so amazing views - it was very cold whilst we were there so we didn't get the chance to sit outside but I'm sure it would be lovely in the summer. Every day the room was cleaned and beds made and towels sorted so it was very nice to come back to after busy days in the city. We knew it wasn't a typical 'hotel' with lots of facilities and it more than met our expectations. We had read reviews about extra charges so we discussed the price on booking so no nasty surprises. It was a great location, just around the corner from the subway, and also several handy local places to eat: UrbanSpace was a great foothall a minute away that we went to on our first night after a long flight..great. Also enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the Lexington Brass - definitely worth finding. Also Grand Central isn't far to walk for lots of lovely food. Beyond that, the City is your oyster!

Towels, hair dryer and even ear plugs (the hotel is near the police station, so sometimes you can hear sirens) but it wasn't too noticeable at all. The bed was super comfy and there was also a handwritten birthday card and bottle of prosecco on ice, waiting for me in our room!

I honestly couldn't fault the staff or hotel.

After a breif moment he said he must have made a mistake and said \"you guys are good, there's no charge\". Fast forward to our check out we're being charged double the agreed upon rate and the front desk attendant who's name I regret not getting, is treating my group and I in a manner as if we were lying. She smuggly gets her manager and he tells us that the policy is solid and that we can only pay the balance until they can get a hold of javon to confirm the allegations. My issue with this entire situation is that a representative of their company, Javon, assured us of the rate we were paying. Had this been a misunderstanding on my part I would have happily paid the bill. Instead this was a failure on that employees knowledge, the hotels training, and worst of all the managers lack of acceptance in resolving the issue. He just wanted the bill paid. We did end up paying as the conversation was going in circles, but I can guarantee that my next trip to NYC will not be with any affinia hotels. My friends and family will be sure to stray away.

Our flight arrived early in the day - so we headed to the hotel to drop off our bags before heading out to Rockefeller Center.  A room was available on a higher floor as an upgrade and we decided it was worth it to get comfortable in our room at that time instead of later in the afternoon.  We were on the 10th floor facing 50th Street.  The room is nice and large and the windows give you a nice view down 3rd Avenue. There were two closets\/storage spaces, so we had plenty of space to put our belongings away.  Bathroom was average sized and had a shower (which could have used a little bit of bleaching), it also had a barn door, but it was not leveled so it would keep sliding open. The toiletries smelled great and thought they were pretty good. The beds were comfortable and plenty of pillow (we love our pillows).  There was a small fridge which I set it to the coldest setting as we had already purchased a few beverages on our way to the hotel, and it kept our beverages cold.  Wine hour was a nice treat for us, we enjoyed have a glass (or two) each evening, while they had lemonade for the kids and coffee and tea available as well.  This was a great trip except for the noise level from the street.  I think the windows allow for the noise to enter the room. They do supply ear plugs in the nightstand, but I can't sleep with them.  I have stayed in Midtown before and did not experience this level of noise. The daily $10 credit for their snack\/beverage allowed us to get two sodas and a bag of cookies each day (get what you want early or they may not have what you want.)  Staff were always pleasant and offered a smile.  Overall I would love to stay here because of the price and location - but that noise will make me think about it.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Based on our good experiences there we chose another Affinia hotel for this trip. The Fifty\u2019s location is great, the doormen were always cheerful, and the suite we had was comfortable overall. However, The Fifty did not measure up to our expectations of an Affinia property. There was only one person at the check-in desk the evening we arrived. We had checked in online and simply needed our room key. There were 3 parties ahead of us, so we had to wait in line 30 minutes to get our key. We had requested a \u201cfeather-free\u201d room due to allergies. The front desk person said he was sure it had been taken care of. However, decorative pillows on the couch had feathers \u201cleaking\u201d from the seams, so no one had attended to our request. No one had attended to thoroughly cleaning the room between guests either. The trash can in the kitchenette had not been emptied. There were used bath towels hanging on the back of the bathroom door. When we went to tell the front desk, he apparently did not recognize us as people he had just checked in, because he told us if we\u2019d just leave our used towels on the floor, housekeeping would know to pick them up. I told him they weren\u2019t our towels...they were left from the previous guests and I didn\u2019t particularly want to touch them. On the subject of towels, one of the bath towels they stocked in the room had a 4-5 inch rip in it. On the last morning of our four night stay, I decided to make a cup of coffee. When I pulled out the tray to place the coffee pods, there were two used pods (from previous guests) which had been sitting there at least four days. Finally, hotels are now commonly charging a daily \u201cresort\u201d fee in addition to the room charge. To offset part of this fee, the hotel gave a $10 daily credit per room to be used in their \u201cstore.\u201d Unfortunately the \u201cstore\u201d wasn\u2019t well stocked, rendering the $10 daily credit hardly usable.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The only other time I went to reception was to ask for address of nearest Doctor as my husband was very ill, she gave me verbal directions which is no good if your just a visitor to NY, I asked for the address and she huffed and said she would need to do a Google search for it, I waited for her to do that! Even the concierge was rude, on arrival he was casually chatting to someone and didn\u2019t even offer to open the door. He did offer huge smiles when our luggage was being held until 4pm and obviously looking for an equally huge tip.\n\nWhen we arrIved at the reception of Fifty Suites, the chap on reception stated that we had to pay for our room, I produced our travel documents clearly showing, double room and resort fee included, his colleague came across and without lifting their heads said we had to pay the $300 in advance for incidentals that we use\u2026.reluctantly we did so.  I was now having bad vibes of this place and rightly so!   We were given Room 301, this is a dumping room that they don\u2019t even clean the windows of, it\u2019s obviously a room for 3rd party bookings ie, anyone other than direct bookings.  The air con for the entire building is right outside the window, that\u2019s the only view, next to the door is the bin chute and next to lift shaft, reception weren\u2019t too pleased but agreed that we could have another room the next day after 3pm and not to unpack. After an extremely noisy sleepless night we moved to 515, the room smells of dampness, the carpets as sticky at parts, the room is dark and shabby and the bathroom lacked any space to move, the housekeeping really need some basic training, our bed was changed once and only because we asked and the top sheet only went half way down and the pillow menu is a joke as the pillows are all well used & worn. In the safe we found a previous guests boarding tickets, proving these rooms are not properly \/ suitably  cleaned for new guests  The tea and coffee was also only replenished when requested, the coffee machine is inadequate and fiddly, there is no complimentary water, this is $8 for 500ml at reception the only mirror is in the bathroom and with no fan it steams up and most likely the damp smell is a result of no ventilation,  I have never been in a hotel room without a mirror, the blinds do not fit the width of the window, the d\u00e9cor cushion was soiled, the front of the heater was held on by the edge of the chair and my husband did his best to secure it. In addition, you cannot control the room temp as this is done by the hotel so too bad if your cold. They also charge for Wi-fi at \u00a314.95 per day unless this is part of your package. Nothing is explained at check in, the \u2018tuck shop\u2019 we learned of later when getting water and the happy hour which we didn\u2019t use is actually one glass of wine if you chose to go. \n\nAfter all of the above it gets even worse, checking out we were told we didn\u2019t have any charges and she had refunded the $300.  Once home I checked our statement as I just could not shake off the bad vibe of this place, they had taken our room payment even though they had seen the paperwork clearly showing we had paid for it and a further 2 unauthorised payments totalling almost $1500.  We have had to get our credit card company involved and thankfully it has been resolved albeit the stress and having to cancel our card in case of any other unauthorised payments being taken, could have been worse if we had not used our credit card and used a debit card! \n\nWe love NY and were revisiting after being married there 18 months ago, our previous stay was at the wonderful Archer Hotel which was fully booked so we chose this one based on reviews & location, I even emailed prior to going requesting a front facing room as it was a special trip, they didn\u2019t respond! The hotel ruined part of our stay but we will return to NYC but most definitely not to the Fifty Suites by Affinia, who\u2019s Management obviously do not take note of the negative reviews.\n\nPlease also note that anyone can walk in and around this hotel and the lifts are not operated with your room card so security is non existent.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

This will probably be my last time to stay at this hotel. Not only has the hotel implemented a \"resort fee or facilities fee\" for basic stuff that used be included such as the gym (which is tiny and poorly maintained), but also the free wine and cheese hour every evening. Now, guests are being forced to pay for stuff that they may or may not even want. Guests are charged $10\/day for items at the lobby store (i.e., water, juice, wine, etc.). Of course, it's presented as a \"credit\" for free stuff at the store, but you have to pay $40 facilities fee whether you consume items from the store or not. The rooms are generally noisy, but this time I had a room close the Lexington Ave and it was so noisy that even my ear plugs were of no use. Even though the beds were made on daily basis, for some reason housekeeping never emptied the garbage can.  That was a real head scratcher.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":502408,"title":"Great location and wonderful staff\/AG package needs improvement","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-08-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We booked this hotel for its American Girl Package.  I wanted to surprise my child and the Fifty offered a reasonable rate.  We found the AG package to be no frills so if you are seeking a better AG experience I would go to another hotel.  \n\nUpon check-in, the clerk was very friendly and confirmed that I was staying as part of the package, however, I did not receive an explanation\/information pamphlet, with the exception of breakfast, on how things worked under this program.  Like other hotels, I assumed that the red AG bag would be waiting in our room, which would have been really nice for my child to see.  Once I realized that the bag was not there, I called the Front Desk to confirm that we have the AG package.  The man who answered asked \"is the room not set up?\"  when I answered \"no\" he said that he will come up with the bag right away.  This conversation led me to believe that the red bag was supposed to be in my room prior to check-in.  As we were staying two nights under this package, I also thought that the turn down\/sweet treat applied to the two nights (the website was unclear).  The first night was great.  The staff member placed the made-up doll bed with a treat on the main bed and my child was delighted. The second night, there was no such treatment.  \n\nAt check-out, I talked to the front desk about the underwhelming experience we had with the AG package and she clarified that the turn down\/sweet treat only applied to the first night and that the red bag would have been presented during turn down on the same night.  This was not clear on the website,  If I knew this when I making a reservation on-line, I would have not stayed at the hotel.  \n\nI think the hotel could have put more effort to make the AG experience better such as:  perform a turn down service every night with a sweet treat; my child received a 50 cent lollipop as her sweet treat the first night, a bad choice for a pre-bedtime snack.  Offering cookies or a small chocolate would have been better.  If not, spending another 50 cents on a lollipop for the second night would have been better than nothing; have the red AG bag sitting on the bed prior to check-in.  For a child, seeing the fancy bag waiting for them is really exciting; and hand out an information pamphlet detailing the package at check-in.  I had forgotten about the access to a personal shopper at the AG store since I made the reservation about three weeks prior to arrival.  A pamphlet would have reminded me.  \n\nDespite the disappointing AG package, the stay was great!  The bed was comfortable and the space was pretty big for a NY hotel.  The decor was very stylish with color block curtains and a white leather chair in the corner.  The bathroom was also clean and had fluffy towels.  The best part of our stay was the staff.  They were so friendly and I can tell that they love working there.  Everyone had a smile on their face.  The doorman was very friendly and took his time greeting us every morning.  We stayed on the 12th floor so we had a pretty good view.  The location was wonderful too.  It was a little far from the AG store, but there were restaurants, cafes, a really nice bagel shop, and other shopping amenities nearby.  \n\nAll in all we had a great stay and my child was happy because she was able to go to the AG store whenever she wanted.  We will definitely stay there again (sans the AG package)!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The location is great and overall, the staff is very friendly, especially the doormen. We had a very early flight the day we arrived and unfortunately were not able to get into our room until 4:00 (even though we were told they would try and get us in earlier). The room was decent size considering we were in NYC but not any bigger than a standard hotel room. The beds were comfortable and there was a coffee maker available. The bathroom really was in poor shape. It was very old and worn out plus the vent and the light in the shower were disgustingly dirty. It reminded me of a bathroom in a dorm room. The walls were covered in old, dirty wallpaper and the tile in the shower was coming apart. I was also surprised at the lack of attention by the housekeeping staff. We were left coffee packets the first day when we checked in but not any of the other days when our room was cleaned.  Also, I had to call down for toilet paper because we were left with a tiny roll and no spare. The other thing about the room was that it was very noisy and there was no way to control the temperature. The thermostat consistently said 66 degrees but it was always very warm in there. It was noisy because the windows weren't sealed properly. My husband discovered that they could be opened which is pretty dangerous if you have little kids. There is a common area on the second floor with seating and tv's to watch plus they have coffee in the morning available and wine from 5-6 every day which is nice.  Another example of the way the housekeeping staff operates...one morning we went in to get a cup of coffee while we were waiting for our teenagers to get up and the woman working the buffet breakfast was walking in front of us.  There was a cheerio on the floor and instead of picking it up, she kicked it under the closest couch. The doormen were always very helpful and held our luggage for us because we had a late flight. As long as your expectations aren't too high and you don't pay too much for a room, it's a decent place in a good location.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

They have this awesome 1hr wine-get together and (not sure if we were lucky that week) also had ice cream from 5-6 every day.. It was nice to come back from the City and sit down for a minute and even get to know some of the other guests, while sipping on good wine and enjoying a cold treat. \nThe doormen - also a very unexpected treat - doors were opened for us every time we came in or left - and always with a very nice greeting and a smile. We didn't eat breakfast - but I'm sure it was as delicious and wonderful as we experienced the rest of our stay. one afternoon we met some of the housekeeping staff in the elevator and all i can say - friendly, engaging and helpful.  - on our last day - we could leave our baggage with the hotel, until we were ready to head back to the airport - AND we even got a private car ride for less what the Uber cost us on the way in..

The bathrooms were super clean with very nice showers (with temperature regulation). I liked that they are more eco friendly by not providing small bottles of shampoo etc, but instead have refillable bath products. The only negative about the room was the toilet was a little slow to flush, however it was not too much of an inconvenience given everything else in the room.\nThey had a great Wine and cheese hour. IT was ice cream week last week, so it was a really nice surprise to see that they had different flavored icecream from  the very famous'Serendipity 3', including their signature Frozen hot chocolate icecream cake.My friend from San Francisco was really impressed with the hotel choice. \nOverall, the greatest value for money hotel in NYC according to my experience.

They offer a refrigerator which was good since it was the hottest weekend of the summer.  The thing that really bothers me is the \"resort fee\" that many NYC hotels enforce.  You get nothing.  This property offers you a $10 credit from their counter store, but there is not much you can buy.  A beer is over $7 and a small bottle of wine is $12.  The large bottle of water (and only water) is $8.  My advice would be to find a hotel that does not have this fee or at least one that you truly get something for it.  I stayed for three nights and nothing stood out.  There was no fabulous customer service, just basic and met the basic standard.  Even the doormen did not always open the door for us.

The place we were originally staying at was already full, so it was a completely last minute effort to find a place to stay one night in Manhattan.  We checked this hotel online and found a good balance of price and reviews.  I called and booked a double queen room on the phone for us and two young children.  Cost was a good $398\/night including taxes and fees, which is actually comparable to many Manhattan hotels during the summer.  But we sure hopeful this was a good find after reading the good reviews.  The rate comes with free wifi, a happy hour free wine in the lobby area, but no breakfast.  Check in time at 3pm and 11am check out.\n\nThe hotel is near offices, so amenities and late night entertainment isn't nearby.  But that also means it's quieter and a better night sleep.  There are plenty of food places within a 10 minute walk and McDonalds and Panda Express right downstairs.\n\nWe arrived the next day at a nice lobby and greeted by pleasant front desk staff.  Without asking she told us our room was upgraded with no extra cost to a \"terrace\" room.  We had no idea what that was, but entering the elevator we noticed our room was on the top floor.  Turns out the top floor had only four rooms, and as we opened the door we were surprised that it was a top floor apartment with a full kitchen, dining room, living room, large bedroom, and an outdoor balcony\/terrace with views of the Hudson River.  A contrast to the closet sized hotel room common in Manhattan.  The next day, we called the front desk to see if late check out would be a possibility and was automatically granted late check out at 1pm.

I thought it was weird that they charged me upfront for my entire stay and added the deposit and all service charges right away. I will definitely be checking my statement that the deposit would be refunded. \nI ended up being assigned a room on the 2nd floor. For me to get a different room meant that I would have to keep all of my bags packed and they would move my things for me once a room was available. A definite inconvenience. I opted to stay after in the room since I didn't want to deal with this. I had to ask them 3 times to make sure my mini-fridge was working. I had some communication issues with the night front desk guy who called me 3 times then only to inform me that he didn't have anyone until the am. He sent a Maitenance guy to bring me some ice for the fridge. The maintenance guy went on to give some unsolicited advise about how I should get a room with a kitchen next time. I thought it was a little out of place. \nCleanliness: The room had some type of red nasty spot by the bathroom. Hoping it wasn't blood. The decorative pillow was stained. Someone else's bobby pins were left on the floor. It could have been vacuumed better (for the amount of money I am spending) I found a long black hair on a towel. Lamps had some wear and tear. Bathroom is very small, but at least has a bathtub. They didn't provide basic things like Qtips and cotton balls. Breakfast is an extra $17 bucks. Don't do it. Go down the street you will spend way less. The maids were extremely loud not considering they might be disturbing people in the rooms. Service communication issues and being overly contacted: 1) front desk guy calling me 3 times to clarify the mini fridge not working. 2) Privacy sign on my door and housekeeping leaving me a voice message that if I want my room cleaned they are available until 6. 3) Walking in from the street and carrying bags. Have already stayed there a few days and one of the door guys asking me if I'm waiting for a shuttle. 4) Night manager asking me if I'm ok when I'm waiting by the elevator with my suitcase so I can come downstairs and check out. It was weird. \nI could keep going, but naw. The AC is very loud. Get some earplugs or keep it off. I kept it on a certain temp so it wouldn't come on in the middle of the night.

Great housekeeping service too.\nThe hotel is in a great location, easy access to all the local tourist attractions but away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square.

There is a chargeable fee for in room wi if however, we visited the business centre everyday to access messages, emails etc.... which wasn\u2019t a problem at all, it was very comfortable.

The front desk staff and the bellmen were extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The main lobby was nicely decorated and clean. I loved the location! We were in a room with 2 full beds and felt like we had plenty of space. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was pretty small but I expected that. There is a nightly complimentary wine hour and I had a $10 credit to spend in the pantry each day. It was nice to be able to grab a cold beer after walking the streets all day. The only issues we had were with the TV and the shower. The shower was a little difficult to figure out but we finally learned and it was fine after that. The TV seemingly gave an option for us to connect our phones to be able to watch Netflix and other streaming apps, but we never could get it to work. The front desk informed me that they are in the process of adding it \/ replacing TVs throughout the hotel and so not all rooms had TVs with that function. We were barely in the room to watch TV so it really wasn't an issue. I would definitely stay here again. ","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had a studio with two queen beds, a kitchenette, and bathroom. Our first impression - the room was huge. When you walk in, you actually have space to move and aren't immediately on a bed. We loved having a kitchenette (we got groceries from whole foods ~0.5 mile away). We didn't eat at the hotel but did enjoy Morning Star Cafe on 2nd Ave for breakfast each day. The subway is so so so convenient - you can get anywhere you want so easily. We used our $10 credit each day to pick up some Kind Bars or a large bottle of water. Our room was literally across from the elevators and next to maintenance & housekeeping but we didn't have a problem with noise - our room was on street side too but it was normal street noise - honestly, we only heard garbage trucks and fire engines - we also had white noise running on our ipad all night and there were some ear plugs in the bedside table if one needs them. Our only complaints is that when we arrived (travel delays caused us to arrive to the hotel at 11:30 PM) that we didn't have any washcloths (we got them the next day but it was annoying not to have them as we all bathed after our crazy travel day) and I thought the baseboards could use a good clean \/ fresh paint.

The policy of charging a resort fee infuriates me.  I know this is not exclusive to Affinia but the \"cupboard\" contains virtually nothing that a diabetic can consume and the happy hour is poorly timed for people who want to make the most of their hours in NYC.  So what exactly do you get out of the resort fee? For me, nothing.  The doormen used to be attentive; they are no longer.  The desk staff are stiff and defensive.  Would I go back?

There's a free wine hour every day for guests, but sadly only one of our group was able to make it as we were booked for the 5 nights we stayed.  I asked to upgrade and was given an excellent discount on a new room if we moved the second day, which we did.  The first room was fine and dandy, but the second was FANTASTIC.  It was the 1 bedroom suite with a pull-out couch and a kitchen\/dining area.  The living area was large enough that our handful of local friends could come back after our Broadway outing for a glass of wine and no one was cramped.  It's a fantastic find with excellent customer service.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The kitchen was small too. It had a convection, mini fridge, sink and a cooktop. Sufficient to make breakfast. The walking space in the room was suffocating due to the two beds. However, the storage options were good. It had a cupboard on the right, as you enter the room. Then there was one inside the bathroom, which was enough to hold shoes, towels, laundry items. And there were also bed side table and a TV cabinet.\nIt was the room space and the small bathroom that put us off, so we asked the manager to change the room. And, he was happy to change it. We downgraded to a room without a kitchen and a King size bed. But, he gave us breakfast coupons for our stay.\nThe new room had 1 king bed, 1 sliding door cupboard, a couch and a mini fridge. And, also a small balcony (although there was no view).\nThe bathroom was big this time. But, the storage option was very limited for two people staying for 2 weeks. We were not happy with the storage space but there was nothing we could do about it.\n\nThey provide European breakfast, which is tea\/coffee. Eggs (only boiled), crossiant, nuts and berries, juices and breads.\n\nThey don't have a live kitchen so that's the best you can get which is off putting for me.\n\nWe stayed there in Feb, 2019 and it costed around $2700 for 13 nights.\n\nTo summarize, I wouldn't stay again there for various reasons:\n1) Small rooms\n2) Limited breakfast option\n3) You can get better hotels in the same price.\n\nIf you are staying for longer duration and likes lavish breakfast then this is not for you.\nAlso, they don't have their own restraunt.

This hotel is in a great area of midtown, within walking distance to everything.  Housekeeping did a great job, and was very friendly and helpful every time we encountered her. We found the service to be outstanding and had no problems from check-in to check-out.  The only issue we had, which was no fault of the hotels, was the transportation we arranged back to the airport through the concierge.  This was the worst ride we have ever experienced and all felt sick by the time we arrived.

There is a sectional couch in the living room with plenty of additional seating.  The bedroom is separated and the bed is large and comfortable.  We set up food trays, wine, chips, etc. all around and people had plenty of space to mingle.

If you bring Fido, there is a dog park on E51st right along the FDR.  We stopped by a couple of times, very convenient.\n\nThree notes:\nParking - their rate of $65 a day with no in-and-out is high for the East Side.  Get a parking app like ParkingWhiz or SpotHero - I found a lot on E47th that was $60 for the whole weekend.\n\nBring lots of tip money - it's an NYC thing, you have both a doorman and a bellhop to tip.  One helps you to and from the room and the other to and from the car.  Both were very friendly and helpful getting luggage and food in and out though.  You can park right in front and load \/ unload your car with their help.\n\nIf you sign into WiFi, you get prompted to pay - DON'T, there is a code on the slip your room key came in for free access.

The images look very grand on the website, but on arrival, the reception desk is tucked away to the right and it's not quite as grand as it appeared, but for three nights it was ok, we had a huge city to explore.\n\nWe arrived earlier than expected and our room wasnt ready but we were offered an upgraded room with a balcony for a modest fee and that was ready now. So we took it.\n\nA few seconds before our arrival someone else checked in and their bags were taken to their room. We were not offered this luxury and were directed to the lifts which were quite compact.\n\nUp to the 17th floor, corridors were quite small but ok for three days. The room was fine, old large wardrobes built into the room, that's one of the things that makes me doubt the recent refurbishment of the room. But again, ok for three days.\n\nGood size safe in the room and the sheets were clean and tidy. There were steps up from the room to the balcony which we only used for photos on day 1. View out the street and beyond but as new york is so tall, not a great deal to be  seen of the city from there.\n\nWe didn't use breakfast as there were top many diners to see and try.\n\nThe bell boy, or whatever you would call him organised us a return car to the airport, very reasonable price, would definitely use that again as it was more luxurious than the yellow cabs.\n\nOne disappointment as you walked down the road was that at the other hotels the doorman were uniformed with peak caps and the like, always polite as you walked by. In Fifty NYC he wore an anorak most of the time, the quality of those other hotels shone in comparison.\n\nAnother thing to note, free WiFi in the lobby and first floor lounge area, but nowhere else in the hotel. In 2018 you might have expected more as standard.\n\nIn the lounge area on 1st floor there are tables and chairs, sofas and free coffee, used on the day of departure waiting for our car.\n\nOverall, pretty decent budget hotel without the frills. If you want quality, I am afraid you need to look elsewhere. The location is good as you can walk to the Rockefeller centre in 10 minute and central park in 20.

Happy hour free wine between 5pm and 6pm is a brilliant time to meet others and have a pre dinner drink. Will definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel may not have the facilities of other larger hotels but that doesn't matter. Fabulous location with everything you need right on your doorstep.We had a standard family room which was very large with a good functional kitchen; especially for NYC standards. After day 4 we upgraded to a family room with a separate bedroom with external terraces. WOW that's all I have to say, WOW, WOW, WOW. If you can get this upgrade, do it.We was on the top floor and had great views all be it was cold on the terrace but I could imagine in the summer it would be fantastic.This is my 5th time to NYC, first with the kids but we deffinatley stay again if we travelled back to NYC with or without the kidsWell done to all the staff, the room attendants who everyday did an outstanding job of servicing our room, the desk staff who sorting out all our trips and issues and the Doormen who were a breath of happiness everydayThanks and hope to see you again in the future","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We chose the Fifty Hotel and Suites because of the decent reviews. We requested a an early check in (1:00pm) but that request was not fulfilled, actually our room wasn't ready until well after 3:00pm (they called our cell phone). The room we selected was advertised as 325 SQ Feet, our room (518) was lucky to be 240 SQ Feet and the view was of the side of another building. My garage at home is 16ft x 20 ft (320 SQ Feet) at home and I could put this room inside there and have tons of extra space, not sure why they are advertising this as a 325 SQ Foot room. The room was clean but the bed was not well made the first night. On our last day we ran out of Kleenex before we set out for the day (around 7:30am), the maid did not give us any Kleenex. When we went to shower on the morning we checked out our shower gel was empty. The rack holding the shower gel was falling apart as well. \n\nThe front desk people were nice and friendly. The doormen were also nice and friendly. \n\nThe hotel is in a nice location.\n\nNot sure why Expedia is not including this \"resort fee\" in the cost of the hotel, the extra $40.00 US per night (fee and taxes) really adds up.\n\nI doubt we would stay at this hotel again, there are better hotels for the same or less cost.

For some reason, the reception did not make me sign anything regarding the pet at check in.  When I mentioned the next day that I have a small dog in the room for housekeeping, they wanted to force us to pay a $180. Strangely enough, if you read on their website, the VIPaws program seems to be optional and not mandatory...I had to argue with the manager about this and she kept saying it is mandatory to be finally waived!!!  She also mention that she has been in the industry many many years and no one has umbrella.  I don\u2019t think she realizes I\u2019ve been travelling around the world staying in many many 4 and 5 stars hotels and it is not because I booked through AGODA (a third party booking website) that she is entitled to give me attitude.

We are very seasoned travellers and know there are lots of options of where to stay when traveling. We have status with two other major hotel brands but decided to take a chance on something new as these suites seemed to offer more space than others in the city which would be perfect for the 4 of us traveling together. I originally made a booking on their site using a promotion they were offering. I had noticed in the pictures for the room that some of the pictures showed some furniture that looked different than that shown in the floor plan photos. I called the hotel directly to enquire about this difference and I was told that all rooms are different and there's no way to guarantee particular furniture. We were looking to confirm a sectional sofa with sofa bed for our son who doesn't want to share a bed with his sister. Seems like a reasonable question to me that staff should know about their room inventory. \n\nAdditionally, after a few weeks of making our booking, I was looking at some discount travel sites and noticed there was a rate that was significantly lower than what I booked on their hotel site. I checked their site and sure enough they had a Best Rate Guarantee offer. It said that they would match any competitors rate and offer a hotel credit and room upgrade as well. Responses would be received in 24 hours. 2 days went by and I have not received any response. I forward my email to other emails for Affinia I found online and still no response. Last night I called the hotel directly and was told by the Manager there that they don't deal with the Best Rate Guarantee themselves and that \"someone else\" handles all of that and they aren't able to change the rate. They did offer to provide their email so I could forward our details on the submission but I have not heard back from them either on this. 3 days have now gone by, no response from anyone. I called the only customer service number available on the Affinia website, which was Reservations. They said they are not able to adjust the rates or do anything with the Best Rate Guarantee. Ironically they tell me it is the hotel directly who makes all of these changes. Quite the contrary to what the hotel told me last night when I called. I explained to the Reservations agent, note not Customer Service agent, what had happened when I called the hotel directly, and they agreed that there should be better customer service. Sounds like this is a regular complaint they hear. \n\nBeing this our first time staying at this hotel, it doesn't bode well for how it's going to go. Currently looking for other options, while waiting to see if anyone actually works there to take our request. We also listed other questions in our email about our stay. No one has followed up to answer those either. Feels more like they just want you to book a room and check in and out, not actually want to have details taken care of during your stay. Difference between offering a service and actual hospitality.\n\nI hope others don't experience the same thing. I did read a review where someone waited 2 weeks with no response on confirming their reservation. I am surprised they can say they are 4 star hotel with this response rate. Get your patience ready!\n\nI will update this review if the situation changes.\n\nThank you","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check in and check out was efficient and easy.  We liked the location,  neighborhood feel but easy walk to midtown destinations \/ attractions and plenty of eating and takeaway places within 1-2 blocks,  and a decent grocery store (Morton Williams) within 3 blocks, subway 1 block away.  Staff were friendly and helpful.We had a Terrace Suite (room 1801).  The bedroom and living area were both a good size and comfortable for our family of 5 (2 adults and kids aged 11,13,15).  Bathroom was fine,  but contained the only mirror in the whole suite which made for a lot of bathroom contention, esp with 2 teenage daughters doing hair\/makeup).The terrace was however very small,  (much smaller the photos on the website probably no more than 3 feet wide it was more like a balcony) and it had no furniture, and was not suitable for sitting out on. The view was the side of an adjacent building so we didn't use it other that to allow air into the room.  Other terrace suites may be better but I felt mis-sold on this aspect of the room.  The kitchenette was useful with a microwave,  fridge, kettle and 2 rings.   However, there were only plates and cutlery for 4 people,   which seems a miss for a room which can accommodate up to 6.  It also turned out that the sofa bed in our living area was broken (it could not be folded down),  so the hotel put a single rollaway in the middle of the living area which was fine for one of the kids but dramatically reduced the space in that room.  The hotel made no attempt to replace or repair the sofa bed during our stay, so we had the rollaway in the middle of the living space throughout our stay.   (we would have asked for a change of room but packing and then unpacking again was too much hassle so we stuck with it).Overall,  this is a decent hotel,  but its far from cheap,  they can do better on the small details.  I would use Fifty again but I'd want a room with a better (i.e. usable) terrace so would avoid 1801.  ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location is great, and for the most part, so is the staff.  One of the doormen remembers us and always asks about our dad.  Thing is - there is absolutely NO loyalty program -- nothing to acknowledge in any way that we are major repeat visitors.  (My sisters have also been there almost as many times -- and we all book our own rooms!)  This time, my sister had a lot of issues in room 608 -- the bathroom door would not close and it took many days and a lot of time of workers in the room to partially rectify it.  She also had no washcloths - and despite repeated requests -- waited 2 days to get any.  I was in room 312 and had no issues -- except that I'm missing a brand new top and they did not find it in the room.  So, I don't know if we'll be back -- think next time a Marriott, Hilton, or Hyatt in the area will be our choice -- as we are members of their loyalty programs, and will at least earn SOME benefits by the stay.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Within 15 mins walk of the \"interesting\" stuff and nice shops. 30 mins easy walk to Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Times Square or Madison Square Gardens.

They charge $15 a day for that which was a bit annoying but we weren't in the hotel much so we didn't bother. It was clean and tidy, the room was serviced daily and we had no problems at all.

The staff, as has been mentioned previously, could not be nicer or more attentive.  They really made us feel special. I can't think of a thing to grumble about!  We didn't try out the guest social evenings but we did have room service which was prompt and truly delicious.  We also thoroughly enjoyed being able to walk just next door to one of the city's cutest rooftop bars at The Kimberley Hotel - so even though the Fifty doesn't have it's own restaurant or bar, if feels as if it does as you are literally next door to a couple of fabulous ones at The Kimberley and another hotel next door, name of which I've forgotten.

The furniture is old, the entire place needs complete refurbishment.  There is almost no reception to speak of and the queue was always long. The most painful thing was the lifts.   There are 2 very small and old lifts for the entire hotel.  One day we waited over half an hour for an available lift to get us from our floor (we were only about half way up) to the ground.

It started with a phone call earlier in the week for advice and setting up a reservation for other family members, arriving at all different times. I was given very helpful advice, for setting up the arrival to check in  and how to be sure the other guests were listed in the reservation properly, (in order to make things smooth). Very helpful. Later, long  travel delays, for some family  members, did not effect the others from checking in properly. Also every detail about the perks, the  hotel conveniences, were covered in the nicest way by Leslie.We never felt like our questions were an inconvenience. We got great advice on all our questions, with  a happy, kind attitude. In addition to Leslie ,the  people at the front desk were always kind and helpful, but she was \"amazing \"with all our family arrangements. Everyone in the family remarked about her efficiency, kindness and excellent help.The housekeepers on floor 14 were also \"great.\"  The rooms were very well cleaned and prepared. Every time we passed one, or had a need, they were friendly happy, helpful, never intrusive. I was carrying 2 cups of hot coffee and one lovely housekeeper rushed to help me when I needed to reach for my key. Another lovely lady, helped get us an elevator, and I had left a polite note that the shower curtain liner smelled  musty. It was changed as soon as they came to clean my room. I think the only thing that was not perfect was the person on the second floor during coffee time. I  have dairy issues, so just have coffee, not the breakfast. We asked if any non-dairy  products were available for the coffee, such as nondairy  substitutes, soy milk , or anything?? We looked, but only cream and milk were out. She seemed very annoyed and just said no, pointed at the craft thermos and said just milk. We have been going to  Affinia\"s for about 15 years. I thought in the past, they may have had some nondairy  source, ( really, not a big deal drank it without ). It was an attitude that we were an inconvenience so different than the front desk and housekeepers, who were OUTSTANDING. Not really a big deal, perhaps, I misunderstood or , maybe I was one of a very  few that  made this request in a  long time.)Also, the doormen were  wonderful. They were attentive to every detail, kind, helpful, and made the social experience of visiting the Affinia fun , and very very efficient!! Thank You!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The overall hotel is ok - based on their website and photos I had higher expectations honestly. The staff was very nice. The rooms were large for NY (we had 2 queen superior room). My main complaint is the air system - we could not get our room to cool down to our satisfaction, the AC kept running and running and the thermostat would never change or after we were in the room for a while, it would go up. There was not a fan in the bathroom so the room quickly became humid after someone showered. It was pretty uncomfortable at times. I called the front desk 3 times on this and they supposedly sent someone to look at it while we were gone during the day. They told us to keep it on auto (which we did) and it should cool off. There never really was an improvement. The room used some energy saving feature on the thermostat so I'm not sure if that was the issue or not. They never followed up with us to see if there was improvement and after complaining 3x we gave up. The room itself was in need of updating and the carpet seemed dirty. Overall the price was good however we would not recommend this hotel or stay here again, there are many other options in the city.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Looked at dozens of hotel reviews and decided Fifty NYC was the place to stay. Great location and decent rooms. All the employees were very friendly, especially the doormwn. They were funny and one of them was showing us magic tricks one night. Overal, the hotel is on the small side, but it was fine for us. The lobby and lounge upstairs were very nice. Wine tasting at 5pm on the 2nd floor every day. You get a $10 credit for the pantry every day, so make sure you use it. \n\nPlenty of restaurants in the area. There is a nice little luncheonette around the corner that serves food all day long...we ate there twice and it was a cool little NYC diner. And a bagel place is right across the street.\n\nThe room was a decent size and bigger than your average NYC hotel room. It was clean and, most importantly, the AC worked well. It was very hot the week we were there. 95 the first day and we came back to cool down a few times. The bathroom was small, but just fine. We did like the walk in shower. We hate those shower\/tub combos many older hotels have.  My only gripe about the bathroom is it didn\u2019t have an exhaust fan. Now we have been all over in big cities and noticed this a lot in many hotels. You would think the building code would require a bathroom fan. Without one, black mold starts to form on the ceiling.  And there was spots of mold on the ceiling and along the corner of the shower. Management should have this cleaned off regularly....it is a health issue. \n\nAnother small issue is the noise at night. We we on 15th floor, yet you can hear everything from the street. Especially sirens and car horns. It seemed like our window was open, but it wasn\u2019t. We heard what sounded like construction every night until about 1:30 am. This wasn\u2019t a huge thing...we are in the heart of NYC...but just something to mention. \n\nBut all in all, a great hotel and I would certainly recommend it.

Your kindness and care was so appreciated. Our suite was more than we could have expected and it made us feel like we had our own NYC apartment for the weekend. Leslie THANK YOU for continuing the care by getting us settled. And although I didn\u2019t get her name, the other woman working with you - I witnessed her get reamed out by what can only be described as the Guest From Hell. Your professionalism was amazing and you should be commended for staying firm yet courteous. \n\nThe hotel itself was fantastic and the location couldn\u2019t have been better. There are so many great restaurants and bars close by and you are a short walk to the subway and GCT. While some may balk at the resort fee, it\u2019s VERY common in the city and does cover WiFi, a daily $10 credit to their snacks and drinks in the lobby (oh and YES to the Martinelli\u2019s apple juice), and a daily complimentary wine hour. It\u2019s a little on the high side, at $60\/day but I would gladly pay it for the service received. \n\nOur room was a 7th floor studio corner suite overlooking 3rd Avenue, which proved to be an excellent vantage point for watching the line at Ess-A-Bagel. There was a separate ikea-esque kitchen, spacious bathroom with a huge window - I love a nice breeze while in the shower. The bed was comfortable, with tons of pillows. The room itself felt huge, with a desk, armchair, builtin closet\/shelving unit and kind sized bed. \n\nFor a hotel with over 200 rooms, once you got upstairs, you wondered if anyone else actually was there. It was so incredibly quiet, even with the expected noise from the street below. \n\nI hope I have the opportunity to stay here again soon!

Prior to my stay, I visited the hotel in person, met the management, and took a peek at the public space available. I explained that I would be having a small welcome gathering for folks coming from out of town and asked if our room wasn't available by midday, was there a public space we could use as a meeting point? The manager on duty showed me the 2nd floor lounge space, which she explained was open to the public. I let her know that was totally fine; we didn't need much time and were happy to share our snacks with anyone who wanted to sit with us!\n\nUpon arriving, our room wasn't ready, so we did set up our welcome gathering in the lounge area. It was a small gathering -- four people -- and we had some cute little photo booth props sitting on a table. A manager entered to tell me that this was a \"family friendly\" hotel and we had to remove anything that didn't fit that didn't fit that bill. I was pretty surprised and confused in the moment by her statement -- what could have possibly been \"not family friendly\" about girly, pink photo booth props that said \"Bride to be\" and had glasses and lipsticks on them, and jazz music playing in the background? In the moment, I was so confused, but I went back downstairs to the desk later to as what she meant and she said one of her staffers saw some \"penis props.\" There were no penis props. She simply made an assumption about us -- hopefully not because of our race -- possibly because we were celebrating a bride to be. There were no penis props at all, only girly lipsticks, veils, etc.\n\nThe hotel was also very unorganized -- a member of our group had booked the hotel, and added a couple of our names to the reservation so that we'd be able to check in without her, but the hotel couldn't find the record so our friend had to repeatedly do this while she was attending a conference and couldn't be present. It was a tremendous nuisance.\n\nThe hotel itself was nice -- nice location, rooms, space in general -- but the staff and our treatment would ensure that I never return and would not recommend it.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":502408,"title":"Going Downhill Fast","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-06-02","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I've stayed at the Fifty Hotel & Suites five times since 2016, but the last visit will be the last.\n\nWhat was once a nice boutique hotel with service, facilities, amenities and price on par with other mid-town East competitors is now a poorly-maintained, dirty, and over-priced hotel with inexcusable hidden charges.\n\nFirst, know that the rooms vary widely. I've stayed in a good size (for New York) room with two queen beds, a suite with its own kitchen and balcony, and a tiny room about the size of what you get in a New York City \"pod\" hotel.  \n\nSecond, the cleanliness and upkeep of the hotel is sorely lacking and, in my experience, getting worse. Every surface of my room on the last visit seemed stained, from the black (mold? mildew?) surrounding the tub, to the smudged door handles, to the sticky TV remote control.  My room smelled like marijuana smoke and the bed smelled like it had just been sprayed with insecticide. \n\nThird, the hotel still can't seem to provide basic soundproofing from doors slamming. The noise and concussion from closing doors literally shook my bed. Conveniently, the hotel provides free ear plugs -- the only free thing they do provide (more on this later.) It should not be difficult to provide some sort of sound dampening device on room doors.\n\nFourth, this hotel does not provide even the most basic security found in every other NYC hotel in its class and in most suburban hotels I've stayed in around the country. While most hotels require a room key to use the elevator (sometimes only at night), the Fifty's elevators are wide open 24\/7 and the fact that elevators are only a few steps from the front door makes this security lapse even more glaring.\n\nFifth, and this was the last straw for me, the hotel charges a ridiculous \"facilities fee' that is now $35 per room, per night on top of the room fee.  Looking at previous reviews, it seems that this has, over the past year or so, gone from $25 to $30 and now to $35.  What is this for?  1) access to a free wine sipping every night from 5-6pm. 2) A $10 daily credit to use in the tiny snack bar near the front desk that has extremely over-priced bottled water, juice, and soda, chips, candy and granola bars that can all be bought at a fraction of the cost from any of the stores within a block of the hotel. 3) Free local and long distance calls (who uses a hotel phone in 2018?). 4) Access to the gym. 5) WiFi.   These are ALL things that other hotels offer for free or provide as paid options not as paid requirements, whether you use them or not.  This type of hidden price gouging is the last straw and I will not be returning to the Fifty Hotel & Suites by Affinia. There are many other options for hotels in this area of New York City and they will now be getting my money.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There are two subway stations located nearby. However, it is right at the intersection of 3rd avenue and E. 50th street, which is a very busy corner.  The noise of the street was quite significant inside of our room which means that we had to sleep every night with ear plugs, which is fine I guess but gets annoying after a few days.  On the positive side, it is a good and safe neighbourhood with a wide rage of restaurant options.  We enjoyed the area very much.\nOtherwise, the room was clean and the beds very confortable.  The shower was OK but nothing special (no shower head though...).  We had a studio with a small kitchen.  I was disappointed that there was no microwave, the toaster was so basic that we could hardly put the bread down and there were very few (2!) pans and pots to cook anything in the room - which is why you rent a room with a kitchen, right?  The fridge was of a good size.\nThe staff was lovely and helpful.  Overall we enjoyed this hotel but if we come back to NYC we might look for another one in a more quiet street next time.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Reliable three-star level, and in a good location. \nNot the best atmosphere on arrival after the horror that is flying into the US. Three staff around and none of them served us for a while. The person who did serve us apologised and was very friendly and helpful. The reception area is a bit scruffy, but OK. They have a strange system where $10 of your price each day is credit with their little snack shop. A nice idea but in practice not easy to spend and you need to register your choice with the desk each time so leads to queues. \nOur room was big and comfortable and a big bathroom with bath and shower. Most things worked fine (except my reading light.)The road outside was noisy. Perhaps everywhere in Manhattan is. They provided ear plugs, but because it\u2019s a constant drone it didn\u2019t wake me up. \nLocation is great. It\u2019s a hotel area, near a Metro station, easy walking distance of Central Park, Fifth Avenue and Times Square. \nNice touch is the free wine hour in the main club room at 5-6pm. The guests didn\u2019t talk to each other - just stared at their phones but can\u2019t blame the hotel for that! \nAs with lots of US hotels breakfast not worth paying for, but there is a great local place - New York Luncheonette -  a few doors down and that was where we ate each morning.  There was no restaurant in the hotel though you can get room service. There aren\u2019t lots of restaurants locally, we ate at Toscana 49 which was pricey but fine, and the Oyster Bar in Grand Central station. There were other options. \nI would stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The front desk crew was, for the most part, extremely professional and very helpful. The bellmen were fantastic, and the lobby was lovely. The room seemed to me to be more spacious than the typical NYC hotel room. Beds were very comfortable. I only rated it a 4-star because the a\/c was not working on the day we arrived. I called the front desk who sent someone up after a delay. We were told the a\/c was fine and to just let the fan run. An hour later, the thermostat was still reading 79 in the room (it was a muggy day). I called again and then again; the front desk finally had someone come up who adjusted the valve. The a\/c immediately began working. By this point, we'd been in the room two hours, and it was very uncomfortable. We got ready and left for the theater. When I arrived back in the room late that evening, the thermostat was registering 79 or 80, again. My father had returned earlier and was asleep so I went to the front desk to report the issue (the third report), but we had to sleep through it that night. I did not sleep well because of the heat and the humidity in the room. The next day as we left, I asked the front desk to ensure someone fixed the a\/c. When we returned in the afternoon, it was running and almost chilly--a welcome change! Apparently the thermostat was the issue and had to be reset. They left us a small, chocolate wrench as an apology. It was a nice token, but I found it galling that after a sleepless night (at approximately $400 a night after you calculate taxes and fees) in a  hot, humid room, that's all we were offered--a chocolate wrench. No credit, no discount. A chocolate wrench. Not even a word from the manager. Apart from that hiccup, it really was great.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}
