The welcome I received was exceptional. \n\nHowever, my experience took a sharp downturn when I visited the breakfast room. I encountered Carol, whose behavior was nothing short of appalling. She was extremely rude not only to me but also to other guests, creating a hostile environment for everyone present.\n\nCarol's demeanor made me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. It seemed like every move I made was scrutinized and criticized, leaving me feeling like a child rather than a valued guest. Her comments and attitude were completely uncalled for and tarnished what could have been an otherwise enjoyable stay.\n\nOne incident that particularly stood out was when I inquired about the taste of the milk, to which Carol responded dismissively, suggesting I go elsewhere if I didn't like it. Additionally, her unnecessary remarks about how I handled food items only added to my dismay.\n\nSuch behavior is unacceptable in any hospitality setting and greatly detracted from my overall experience at City Club Hotel.  Despite the warm welcome from Manager Jennifer, the negative encounter with Carol left a lasting impression and significantly marred my stay.\n\nI sincerely hope that the management of City Club Hotel takes steps to address issues of staff behavior and ensure that all guests are treated with the respect and courtesy they deserve.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Booked deliver king for 4 people.  Room soooo small and only sleeps 3.  Bed was so old and uncomfortable.  Bathroom entry was so tiny so if you are more then average size, you won\u2019t clear the doorway.\nSo now we have 1 person who has no place to sleep, we all are in such close corners, and the bed was horrible.  I will say room was clean.  Older hotel so some marks on the walls and imperfections were acceptable.\nNo outlet in the bathroom for hair dryer to be used.  Mini bar hidden behind picture on the wall so that took some time to find.  Window in bathroom broken and didn\u2019t shut all the way so let in lots of cold air.  No bathroom fan.  Staff was not friendly.  Asked Roberto at front desk for pillows.  He responded he would bring in 2 minutes, we never saw those pillows.  Our wonderful \u201cview\u201d from our room was a brick wall about 10 inches away from our window.\nSo the good, close to Times Square.  No bugs seen.  Looked clean.  Old carpet throughout rooms and elevators.  Shower was nice and big with good water pressure.  Basic breakfast but nice to have available.\nOf course upon our checkout staff seemed caring and wanted a review left.\nI would never go back.\nDefinitely not a room for families.  It was at best a clean place to stay for business for a night if you don\u2019t mind an old crap bed and no where to plug anything in the bathroom.\nThis is far from a 4 star hotel.

First the hotel charge the full amount of both rooms. When we arrive the front desk person ask for the security deposit, which for us was us 300, and for other customers was us 200, which felt a little discriminatory. Then instead of putting the hold he reversed all the charges and try to charge on the other card the rooms. Everyday we tried to fix the charges, and pay the amount that was supposedly were going to get back. The last night when we walked in to the  hotel they had blocked our rooms, even though we have been trying to resolve it every night, and also tried to charge the facility fee  that was included. We even had to call the police cause the person at the front desk wasn\u2019t even listening and the manager didn\u2019t want to talk to us. The police gave us the reason but we have to pay for the third time the amount of the reservation. And the front desk person took a picture of our card cause it was \u201cobligatory\u201d Up to today we still have not receive the amount back, and that has given us a lot of trouble for the whole vacation. We checked out from the hotel at 7:00 am and up to 4 in the afternoon they still are trying to charge something that is already paid in full. The treatment of the personnel from the hotel was very bad. On the other hand, the publicity of the hotel was not all the way accurate; the hotel was not clean, the curtains were dirty, the carpet was stained,  the elevator was dirty, and only one was working, the hotel smelled like marihuana a lot.

Not only did the entire 8th floor smell like a man who really needed a shower, my room seriously smelt worse. I was suspicious whether someone exhausted actually caught a nap on a bed since there were marks of someone who could\u2019ve laid there and the odor was just horrible. It was past 9:30PM but I packed up and left the hotel at 10PM since I couldn\u2019t handle the smell. The lobby staff did nothing for me. I left a voicemail the next day and got nothing. A waste of several hundred dollars and a real exhausting journey home waiting for transportation in disbelief. \n\nDo NOT stay at this hotel if you want a decent stay in the city. I would have liked to walked a few blocks on Thxgiving day to see loved ones but was super exhausted and disgusted on Thxgiving eve. Never again!","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

The big problem is this:  Even my extremely recent e-mail confirmation included gushing about the restaurant that doesn't even exist.  This is false advertising of the highest sort.  [There is now no restaurant, but countless delivery options exist.]\nMy second reason for choosing this was the location.  I always stay across the street at the Royalton (who can get lost finding it with an address of 44 W. 44th?), but I decided to try something different.  55 W. 44th is just as easy to remember, and the location is the exact same when it comes to proximity to Broadway's theatres and restaurants.  I'd rather Times Square not be quite so close, but oh, well.\nAs for my specific experience, it was, overall, Very Good.\nI had taken my mother on the QM2 for two weeks for her birthday, and I decided to add some NYC Magic at the end.  This means that--because passengers disembark early in the morning--the hotel was not ready for us, just as almost any hotel would be.  It proved tedious to wait around all day (my mother has mobility issues), but there is a great diner next door that shouldn't be missed.\nThe staff was uniformly fantastic from desk to bellman to housekeeping.  In retrospect, the rate for the first two nights--albeit Friday and Saturday but booked far in advance with a non-refundable rate.  We received a great rate when I added a third night, so that was handy.\nThe room is not too small and very nice--the bed and the daybed both proved comfortable enough, which is particularly important to my arthritic mother.  She praised her rest.  Tip--the closet and minibar are behind hidden doors, so it took a while to find them.  BOTTOM LINE:  This hotel does not have the advertised club-like feel, despite its location amongst some of NYC's most exclusive private clubs, but it is very nice with a great staff and an excellent location.  The hotel is surprisingly quiet, too.  My only caution would be to confirm that the price is truly competitive prior to booking.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When we arrived, we were given a spiel that it is a historical hotel and older hotel, and it may not be what expecting.  That was an understatement!  The room had a distinct odor, the air was blowing at 62 degrees, the couch had visible stains that looked like human fluids.  We tried to turn off the air conditioning and switched it to heat.  We figured that it would switch over after some time.  Since we arrived after 6:00pm, we went to dinner (over 1 1\/2 hours).  We arrived back at our room, the air conditioning was still at 62 degrees.  We contacted the front desk, and the bellboy came up with two old, smelly blankets.  The bellboy eventually fixed the heat, but we were too traumatized by the room to stay.  I immediately called Booking.com to complain and ask for another hotel, and I was told that I had to ask for the refund at the front desk.  I went to the front desk and was told that since it had been some time since we arrived, it would be difficult to provide a refund (we went to dinner and had only been in the room a total of 15 minutes).  As I was at the front desk, another guest arrived, and I noticed the receptionist gave the same spiel to her about the hotel being \"historical\".

We were attracted to this hotel because of its proximity to the Harvard Club and this unique room configuration option.\n\nThe hotel itself is tiny but makes effective use of space.   No place to sit in the lobby but the second floor landing looks down over the lobby and has plenty of seating and tables (though the lighting was a bit lower than it could have been).  Signage could be added stating availability of second floor lounge.  The elevator is classically slow for an old building but gets you where you need to go - be sure to build in a few extra minutes.  \n\nMinibar AND fridge were both subtly located behind a painting and impressively stocked with good snacks and good quality wine (red, white and champagne).   A cursory glance didn't yield a price list but I am certain one could be obtained in short order.  The front desk\/bell staff were very friendly and helpful (and in the later hours, a shade quirky, though not prohibitively so).   We called down twice from the room for extra towels and another blanket, both of which we received within moments and neither of which it turned out we really needed.\n\nThe daybed itself was comfortable enough, and unexpectedly warm for the seemingly limited setup of just a fuzzy blanket and a bottom sheet.   It was not *not* an upholstery cushion, which is more intended for sitting for brief periods than it is for long hours of sleep.  It would be an impressive upgrade to swap out the foam padding for memory foam or other mattress-like material.  \n\nOnly bit which caused a raised eyebrow was the state of the bathroom floor - the tiles were lifted in several places and the floor around the toilet was noticeably spongey.   Admittedly I neglected to mention its condition to the staff.  Management, if you see this, our room number was 206.  \n\nOur gratitude for the very serviceable accommodations!

You could hardly get around the bed. Granted the room was advertised as a Petit room however it is still sold as a two person room. The bed is what I believe to be a queen bed in the US however it was smaller than a UK double which is designed for 2 people. The bed measured 5ft long which for a 6ft person is completely ridiculous. \n\nThe filth and dirt in the room makes me wonder the last time the room was cleaned. I actually wore shoes the entire time I was in the room as to avoid the dirty floor (wipe your feet on the way out!). The walls were dirty, full of black marks, ripped wallpaper and brown stains. The aircon vent continually fell off only to reveal a thick layer of dirt behind it and sticky bug traps that were riddled in lice and insects. \n\nThe bathroom was OK, but by far roomy, there was no where to put washbags or anywhere to hang clean clothes. The towels were clean (that was the only thing about the room that was clean). If the tiles weren't brown they would have no doubt shown the dirt! \n\nWe were offered a complimentary breakfast on check in however I wouldn't let a dog eat in the restaurant. That was very dark, depressing and lacking in any appeal that would make you want to dine in there. And if the room cleanliness is anything to go by god knows what the back of house standards are like.\n\nWe had 3 nights booked but only stayed 1. We wouldn't have stayed 1 if we weren't so insanely tired from a long trip over and lack of alternative accommodation. On check out the receptionist was not surprised at all we were checking out and did not offer to refund the cost of the first night - instead she proceed to charge my card in front of me (including the tax) and then said I had to cancel the rest of the stay through booking.com. No compensation or apology was given which leads me to believe this is a regular occurrence.\n\nDo not believe the reviews!

DB Bistro is closed and the hotel has seen better days. You can still spot signs of creative design - the wall lamps are low and the art is still nice. But paint is chipped and wallpaper is peeling.\n\nOn the other hand, it has a great location near Times Square, it's clean and acceptable at a low price point. I paid about $200. The room was a fine size and the handicapped bathroom was quite large. It was fine at that price.\n\nMy view of NYC hotels is that I only sleep there. I don't care very much where I stay, as long as it's clean and fairly nice. I have stayed at the best hotels - Pierre, Lowell - and paying a lot is just a waste of money to me.

The website states that the room includes a desk, which was not the case. There was space only for the bed and one small nightstand. We switched to a larger room with a queen-sized bed on our second night, which was much better and included all amenities outlined online. Although I paid more for the petit full room than the listed rate online for the larger room, the staff was reluctant to switch us (they initially told us they were sold out when I could see multiple rooms available online).

In between 5th and 6th on 44th is good enough to be good enough for tourists (Times Sq, Empire State etc) and business traveler.  Bu the biggest advantage of this hotel is that the rooms are large. Not one is the same (this is my second time here and I've seen a few rooms) as it's been converted from an old building and the layout and furniture are eclectic and a bit unusual.  This is certainly not the cookie cutter borefest of the standard chains.  It's not modern in any way and feels a bit thrown together, but that's part of its charm.  Bathrooms are well equipped and function very well, if rather dark (black marble everywhere). Service is homely and very friendly people work here. You get a warm, personal welcome every time you walk in the door, which is great. But in a city where tiny rooms are the standard, the biggest advantage here is the rooms are huge.  I mean really big. Not New York sized at all, which is great. Comfy beds, a chair that's slightly too low to type at the table (told you it was quirky), and all the standard amenities (safe, wardrobe, fridge with expensive stuff in it).

I will say that each and every staff member at the front desk went above and beyond whether it was just answering questions, checking on me, and the check in was extremely smooth.If you need a taxi for the airport they do have someone that works with them upon availability \nHouse keeping: The room was very clean I did have a room that had a balcony the balcony area was very clean as well they did also provide towels extra blankets and everything that I needed during my stay and their service was great. The one thing I will say is that our air conditioner did not work when we first got there but the maintenance came first thing in the morning and fixed it in less than 10 minutes I say that as a positive thing to show that maintenance was very efficient and fast of course things happen. \nRoom :A lot of people don't know this about New York but most of the hotels are a lot older and they are not new so there will be some things like little small cracks in the wall or a very modern style bed. The room was amazing the location of the room was great it was a wonderful view.\nLocation : The location of this hotel is directly in Times Square it's about a 2 to 4 minute walk to the middle of times Square it's an amazing place and it is also next to the subway access and it is convenient if you have never been to New York.\nOverall service : The overall stay was great everything went well. I cannot remember the person who checked me in but he was extremely nice his hospitality from the time I got there to the time that I left was just amazing sometimes you don't know what people are going through especially during a time like this pandemic to  receive this Nice nice customer service it was a pleasure for me. \nI hope to come back to new York in the future and hopefully I can get the same room style ! \nThank you all so very much","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's a combination of its location,  a cozy atmosphere and a superb hotel staff!\n\nFrom the minute you arrive, you feel well taken care of.  You are greeted at the door by Darnell Harden, the bell man. You can't help but smile--- Darnell goes out of his way to make you feel welcome.  From handling your luggage,  arranging for coffee, or delivering your take-out orders to your door, Darnell is always willing to help.  I once asked him why he is always in a good mood, and he told me \"because I love my job.\"  How refreshing!  (And what an asset to the hotel!)\n\nAnother treasure is Alisha Depino, who is at the front desk.  Alisha's bright smile (complete with dimples) and positive energy is simply contagious.  She handles every issue with such poise and respect that even the most difficult guest becomes friendly.   She is the perfect person for a job that requires quick thinking and the ability to change plans at a moment's notice.

It was not only the room that smelt like smoke the corridor did too as there was a lively party happening at the end of the corridor. We spoke to the concierge and asked to change rooms.. they then lied to us saying the hotel was fully booked - it 100% was not, as other than the party guests we saw no one else in the hotel. The concierge also said it\u2019s an old building which is why it smells like damp...! They were also aware of the party but said it shouldn\u2019t be too loud. The view out the window was of a brick wall and the paint was peeling off the walls.

Not sure if that makes sense but it works! Each room had a king or queen bed and also each a daybed, one for each child. So really great for large groups\/families. The only thing was our side (the king) was very musty\/dank smelling. I was very stuffed up while there through the nights. The other room complained of loud air conditioning (but I enjoy the white noise -we should have switched rooms) and they did see a mouse. But it\u2019s New York and inevitable they are around.  \nThe wifi didn\u2019t work in most of our room either, you had to stand in the doorway. No views from the windows but you\u2019re out and about to see that stuff anyway. \nAll that being said, overall it really was a great stay, I just like to give all the details. The restaurant downstairs was convenient with good food. The location can\u2019t be beat for all your manhattan adventures. There\u2019s also a great diner (red flame) about two doors down, we ate breakfast there a few times. The doormen were eager to help with anything (getting drives, umbrellas, etc).

Sadly, not great anymore.  \n\nCity Club used to be one of the family's favorite.  My family stayed at City Club years ago, more than once, over several trips to NYC and loved it!  We have'nt been back in awhile, at least 3\/4 years.  This hotel is apparantly that not being maintained, and being allowed to crumble, simply age, and fall apart. Everything from the unclean appearance of the sparse lobby (even though sparse, the lobby used to be squeaky clean)..to the elevator, rugs, door jams, peeling wallpaper, old mattresses with deflated springs,....nothing is being repaired, refurbished, repainted...nothing is being done!  The interior decorating is very nice but,  it is the same as it was years ago, and not being maintained. This hotel is sadly dying on the vine.  \n\nPrevious visits, used to find warm chocolate chip cookies at night in the room. No more.  \n\nIf you stay, do not get a room facing 44th street. Extremely noisy due to the original windows in place without any insulation from the breeze blowing thru the cracked window pane, and no insulation from the noise on the street.  I felt as though I was sleeping on the sidewalk outside.  Get a room away from the street if you stay. \n\nTV in the room did not work. Weak or no signal was the error on the TV screen. When I called the front desk, they grumbled about the storm, and when there was a storm the TVs lost signal. It was raining lightly outside. No major storm. Overcast. When I said , \"Oh so you have satellite tv?\"...the person on the phone had no idea.  Regardless, the next morning, despite no storm outside,  the TV still did not work. Same error. Meanwhile, when leaving the room, we saw the room next door had an operational TV.  Bad front desk service, and obviously no one really cared if the TV did not work.  It was not \"the storm\" .\n\nSadly, looks like the era of our happy stays at the City Club NYC are over. Time for us to find a different hotel.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":224226,"title":"Good Value in Midtown - Would Stay Again","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-10-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I struggled whether to give this hotel a 3 or a 4 rating, and decided on a 4 because of the quality to price ratio -- i.e., the hotel is a very good value and I have done a lot worse in New York City at similar or even higher price points (I'm looking at you Yotel and Algonquin, two of the most horrible hotels I have ever had the displeasure to stay).\n\nI was in New York during a week with very high hotel rates and was despairing about whether I would be able to find somewhere semi-reasonably priced when I stumbled upon a last minute deal for City Club. 44th Street is a great location - right in the heart of things, but a relatively quiet street -- and I have previously stayed at the Algonquin (horrible), the Sofitel (was once nice, but I have refused to stay there for a couple of years after I got a horrible room, badly in need of refurbishing, for over $500 a night) and the Royalton (another hotel not showing its age well). However, despite being a 44th St. veteran, I had never previously stayed at City Club.\n\nGiven the price I paid, I opened the door to my room expecting the worst, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the room was not a shoe box and was nicely laid out with a huge bathroom. There were a number of nice details, like an ironing board that popped down from the closet, a nice mini-bar hidden behind an attractive painting, a robe in the bathroom, a full length mirror in the bathroom and plenty of space in the bathroom to lay out toiletries (the latter being hard to find in New York except at very high end hotels). \n\nThe problem with the room -- an interior Queen -- was that there were only two small windows, both of which looked out at air shafts, so the room was quite dark and the interior lighting was not bright enough. One afternoon I tried to read in the room and even with the windows open and all the lights on, there wasn't enough light and I had to add a flashlight in order to see the text. (However, on the positive side, because the room looked out on air shafts, it was dead silent at night and you would never know you were in the middle of Manhattan). The shower in the room was heavenly, but rather than a glass door, there was a half door\/shower curtain arrangement which did not contain the water, leaving the bathroom a wet mess after my shower.\n\nI'm a person who generally likes to spend a lot of time in my hotel room when I travel, but on this particular trip, I had meetings from morning until night and thus didn't spend a lot of time in my room. So the room turned out to be fine for this particular trip, but I wouldn't have been as happy if it were a trip where I wanted to hang out in the room during the mornings and afternoons and work or relax.\n\nI stayed 7 days and for the last 2 days asked if I could move to a room with more light. For a $25 nightly upgrade fee, I was moved to a King room facing 44th Street, but that room turned out to have some downsides as well. The King room was bigger and since it was not an interior room, did have more light, but it still wasn't bright and sunny because the smallish window had scaffolding in front of it and just looked across the way at the building across the street and 44th Street is a fairly narrow street. Surprisingly, the bathroom and shower in the King room was smaller than the bathroom and shower in the Queen room, although the King room shower, despite also having only a shower curtain, didn't flood the bathroom when I took a shower.\n\nThe King room also had the downside that instead of the mini-bar being tucked behind a painting, it was placed in the closet, which made it awkward to get to and which cramped the closet space. The other problem was that you couldn't open the closet all the way because of where it was placed in the room -- when you opened the door, the door was blocked by the angle of the day bed in front of the window. It was the final two days of my trip and I had moved from another room so I didn't bother unpacking and instead lived out of my suitcase, but that closet would have been an issue for me if I had been placed in that room initially. Also, the angle of the closet made the ironing board on the closet door unusable.  I didn't need to iron anything for my last two days in the hotel, so it wasn't of consequence to me, but still something to note.\n\nThe biggest problem with the King room was that it was much noisier than the dark interior room and you could hear street noise from 44th St. This particular room was also right next to the elevator, so you could hear guests loudly returning to their rooms late at night. I didn't think the room was worth the $25 a night upgrade and asked to be moved back to an interior room, but alas none were available.\n\nHousekeeping at the hotel was great and I loved the turn down service and the delicious chocolate chip cookie they bring you each night from the db Bistro restaurant downstairs. If you leave housekeeping a tip, they write you a nice handwritten note thanking you, which was not something I had ever seen before and which I thought was a nice gesture.\n\nI tried laundry service and it was good and efficient.\n\nThe staff at the front desk was very pleasant, as was the doorman who helped me with my luggage both coming and going.\n\nSome neighborhood tips -- the Red Flame diner is a door away. I have seen people on TripAdvisor rave about what a find the Red Flame is and I guess it is okay if you are a family of 5 looking to save money, but the omelet I had there was horrible. If you are by yourself, do yourself a favor and pay $3 more for an omelet at db Bistro, the restaurant attached to City Club, and you will get a delicious, properly made omelet. db Bistro also has excellent \"Reserve\" wines by the glass which they serve using the Coravin system, so you are getting pristine wine. Pricey, but worth it for a splurge. I also had breakfast one day at Gaby Brasserie next door at the Sofitel because I love Gaby's egg white, asparagus omelet. Again, if you like good food, much better than the Red Robin diner.\n\nAll in all, I would stay again at City Club despite the room issues because the location is great and I would rather spend my money in New York on good food and wine than on a super high end hotel room. Yes, you can get a much better room in New York, but be prepared to spend a couple hundred dollars a night more for it. So far, City Club is the best hotel I have stayed at in New York at its price point.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The closet was small, half of it was taken up by a 30 deg shelf which was obviously covering something but made the closet unusable to store bags etc.\n\nThe bar fridge that was also located in the closet had a freezer section that couldn't even keep 4 ice-cream sandwichs firm\/frozen.\n\nNext I opened the window shutters to see if we had a view and I nearly died from the stench of rotten mouldy wood. When I tried to close them, I thought they were going break with how much force I had to use.\n\nThe air conditioner was noisy, the beds weren't too bad and while the bath room looked to start off with, it soon came apparent it would very tired and need renovationing.\n\nIt took some photos of the cracks in the basin, the taps that had been cleaned so many times the brass was showing. The shower had an old fashion plastic shower screen and my kids managed to flood the bathroom but seeing it had no drain in the floor the water ran out to the carpet. Looking at the bathroom door and carpet, this isn't the first time this has happened.\n\nThe lifts haven't been inspected since 2014, but where inspected every year prior. The lifts were very noisy and I always wondered if I was going stop working when we were travelling in them.\n\nThe front desk we very friendly and professional but the maid service never gave the right number of face washer for the five of us staying there, even after asking the front to remind them. They did not leave spare toilet paper when there was only a third of a roll left and we had to get the front desk to bring some up.\n\nThey also did not notice the tissue box being empty, so we had no tissues on the last night.\n\nFinally at the end of our hallway there was a large curtain, when I pulled it back to see view all I found was a damaged wall with bits of wall paper hanging from it.\n\nAll I've got to say is I'm thankful there is a lot to do in NYC as I would like to be stuck in that room, awake, for very long.

Cabs seemed to be in abundance too. \n\nThe room is two stories so that in itself was pretty fun and memorable for my kids. Having a balcony was pretty neat especially at sunset. Kids said the pullout couch was comfortable but one adult would sink it.  The hotel had set out a rollaway bed but we didn\u2019t use it so we asked it be removed for more space and they did. Loved having a half bath on the first level. The full bath upstairs is gorgeous. The king bed comfortable. Everything was very clean but a little aged but I didn\u2019t mind. It was all in working order. \n\nOne note of caution: this room is very, very loud. The street noise you would expect but it\u2019s amplified because you trade off pretty, older windows for zero soundproofing. And the walls to the other rooms must be paper thin. You could hear anything above quiet talking. So the guy talking on his phone, the kid playing at all hours of the night, the parents squabbling - heard all of that as if they were in our room with us. I made a noise complaint call once and the front desk called them right away so I appreciate that.

At the end of our trip we had a full day before we was collected to go to the airport and the staff was more than happy to store our cases for us until we had to go. \nI agree with some of the reviews that the hotel does look a little tired and is in need of some TLC but it was clean and everything you need when your in New York, for the amount of time we spent in the room it was fine. We had a queen luxe room, the bathroom was spacious and this includes the shower, never got the reasoning why there was only one bath robe though, not that we had time to lounge around in bathrobes! We had fresh cookies left for us daily which is a nice touch.\nJust a few niggles.. the view from our room, oh dear the worst hotel view I have ever seen (lucky for us we hardly spent any time in the room so just left the blinds closed) nothing like the views shown on the website! \nThe toilet was extremely noisy, I am surprised our neighbours didn't hear it flush, again this is just a minor gripe!

Every single person I interacted with was pleasant and helpful, and went out of their way to provide excellent service.\n\nThe price was good for the area (check out the Algonquin if you don't believe me), and if you have some flexibility, you can score a great deal. Keep in mind that many of the less expensive hotels in that area only provide a shared bath. \n\nThe petite room was compact, but still quite roomy for one or two people, with a large, tiled bathroom (shower only) with bidet, a modest desk and comfortable chair, three-drawer bedside cabinet, deep built-in shelves for folded clothes, books, electronics, etc. The small closet was amply supplied with wooden hangers, and included a table-top ironing board and iron. They even provide a lovely terry cloth bathrobe and an umbrella to use while you stay -- and a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie every evening! The room was very quiet; I almost forgot that I was in New York. \n\nI only have two criticisms : No coffee maker and not nearly enough outlets at the desk for electronics. I like a cup or two of coffee first thing in the morning, but I'm not about to pay a $10 delivery fee in addition to the price for a pot of overpriced room service coffee (all room service at all hotels is overpriced).

To be fair to the hotel, they put me in an upgraded room for my first night, and then moved me into a room with a terrace for the rest of my stay. However, both rooms that I stayed in were tired and tatty.

It ticks every box. Excellent, central location and very walkable to a lot of things like Rockefeller, Grand Central, 5th Avenue Shops and much more.\n\nThe room (King) was huge by NYC standards. We traveled with our 5 year old son and the hotel staff had the sofa converted into a comfy bed on arrival without us even asking, fantastic!\n\nThe room design is pretty clever and fun. The way they've made use of every nook and cranny is pretty impressive. The mini bar is hidden behind a painting on the wall, the closet door is nearly invisible and blends in with the wall, etc. \n\nThe staff were all very friendly. My only few, small complaints were the noise of the plumbing. When you flush the toilet it's excruciatingly loud and shrill. Fortunately though, the rest of the room is super quiet. We didn't hear our neighbors once during our stay.\n\nMy other, very small, complaint is the doormen. I know it's winter and it's cold, but more often than not they were standing inside at the front desk chatting with the reception staff rather than tending to the door. They are super friendly though and have great suggestions on best and cheapest transport options.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Midtown area. We will most definitely be staying there next time we are in NYC!","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was assigned a petite room, which was really petite: my height is 5'5\" but my feet was dangling over the bed! And the room was so dated and small that I could hear the door slamming, people talking in the hallways etc. Also there's only one electric outlet you could use. On the first night I was abruptly woken up by a call from the front desk saying some family came to visit me. I said, \"Who?\" and they were like, \"oh, maybe it's not you\". Seriously? It was 3:30AM. I was so mad and so tired that I just hanged the phone. And after that long ringing and ridiculous conversation I couldn't sleep afterwards. They ruined my night's sleep completely. Now, if this was a legit 4-star hotel, they should have apologized to me the next day. When I went to the front desk in the morning, they were clueless. Even if the night-shift front desk assistants have finished their part-time job and left, they should have communicated amongst themselves to cover for the accident. Unfortunately I had to explain everything, and all they did was to offer a breakfast voucher for tomorrow. When I told them I don't need that (because I usually have one apple for breakfast) and rather I would like to move to another room, they told me I should pay $25 more. They've done things wrong and wants me to pay? I declined and decided to stay calm, trying to understand that these things can happen... just to realize that after I came back to the hotel room in the afternoon, the housekeeping came in. I put the sign \"Do not disturb\" but I guess they don't know what it means. Privacy please! They even took the bath mat and didn't replace it. Then later they called me again and asked me \"You need room service, right?\". Excuse me, I said \" DO NOT DISTURB\" can't you read? It's just so ridiculous. 4-star hotel? Are you kidding me? I moved to another 4-star hotel right after this, and oh boy, their services and the rooms! I've been traveling to NYC on a regular basis and also other cities around the world and this hotel should be a 2.5 star or at most 3 star. Just go to another hotel if you want to get some respect as a guest.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

It is quite good hotel (not 4 stars). In my way to leave the hotel in haste cos I was afraid losing my flight, I forgot some money and items in the safety locker and I remembered that in my way to the airport. So I contacted the hotel and infromed them that a guy will come to receive my items which suppose to be safe and bring them to the airport. I was really worried about losing my jewelries and finally I received my things in transparent zip bag  (any one can see the money and that could attempt any one to steal it). I was in hurry and I didn\u2019t count them (as an usual habit) but I counted them in the airplane (I felt some thing wrong) and I discovered that the money is shorted 100KD which equals almost 331 USD. In any hotel the customer items shoud be safe because honesty is a quality of high stander hotel. I know how much I have that is first. Secondely, I know the driver who picked up the money and I got his car and phone number. If he tried to steal money, he would be caught. Thirdly, my items were in the locker with a code no body knows it (I was alone in the room). If there is no honesty and loyalty for the work and  no respect for the customer\u2019s personal matters, then it is not qualified hotel to stay in or to choose.

A nice find. \n\nOf course for  NY, and Europe, hotel rooms are small. My room was as well, though a surprisingly large bathroom. Estimating, the main area was 11' by 15', the bathroom 6' by 11'.  When staying in these smaller rooms it makes one wonder how much space is actually needed. Not a lot really. \n\nStayed alone, with a full bed. This room was great for me, but too small for a couple, cause of the bed. Very clean. Quiet. Staff quite friendly, smiling (that maters), chatting up the theatre with Pete. Tiny street lobby though apparently a larger one on the second floor. Looked forward to the fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie awaiting me each night. \n\nI timed the walk (yes, I do that) from Broadway, the heart of Times Square. Around 4 minutes. (One busy intersection may add a tad if hit a red light.) \n\nMy work schedule caused me to book late. I typically book direct through the hotel (don't know why), now and then using hotels.com. Ended up getting a \"secret\" rate or something. Total around $550 for 3 nights. Great deal. \n\nPrice always matters. Assuming can get a good deal  would highly recommend. I have stayed in grand hotels here and there, with large rooms, stunning lobbies. But for value and such in NY, this hotel is impressive. \n\nOriginally intended to book Hotel Mela on the same street but  because I had to delay booking, price jumped $100 over night. But that is less than 2 minutes from Broadway, gets good reviews, and also seems reasonably priced. Lobby seemed fine. Another to consider and price.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

The mattress sagged into this area.  The doorman kindly assisted us by finding 2 pieces of plywood and inserting them until it could be fixed\/replaced.  We were not offered another room or replacement bed.  \nDay 2, no follow up on the bed.  I had to call front desk again and was told 'an email was sent' and said  'oh...its not fixed?'.

We were mortified and at 4 am packed up and checked out.  It was dark and we were exhausted.  Did not have  a good night sleep on any of the nights we stayed (beds were extremely uncomfortable).  Since there was an incredible amount of walking during our stay, all we hoped for was a restful sleep...which didn't happen.  Old noisy air conditioner.  Carpets not the cleanest.  You'll get an instant musty old smell in the hallways, although rooms smelled ok.  Linens were clean.  Once we lifted the mattress to see why it sagged so much we noticed little black speckles of something on the boxspring, which we now know to be rodent feces.

Pensemos que los hoteles en New York, mas espec\u00edficamente en Midtown son hiperconcurridos y la mayor\u00eda habitaciones diminutas. En este caso realmente me sent\u00ed sorprendido cuando entre a la habitaci\u00f3n. Muy por encima de la media en tama\u00f1o, aplia, con caja de seguridad, frigobar, y el protagonista el BA\u00d1O, super amplio con bidet y excelentes amenities. Si bien no es econ\u00f3mico, se puede decir que una excelente opci\u00f3n con na ubicaci\u00f3n excelente. Sin dudas volver\u00eda. El personal es Maravilloso y hay gente que habla espa\u00f1ol.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Bathroom was dark tile, clean...and had amazing water pressure in shower....it was wonderful!  The desk staff were lovely people, really kind and helpful and there is a great restaurant connected.

The location of this hotel absolutely cannot be beat - close enough to the tourist zone to walk to just about anywhere, but far enough away from the glaring lights of Time Square that you feel off the beaten path.

On the same block is the Red Flame Diner which is cheap\/cheerful\/clean for a fast bite to eat.

The room was big enough with the king bed, a couch\/day bed and a rollaway bed.  The bathroom was different with chocolate brown marble and the shampoo, conditioner, etc were in generous sized bottles.  The d\u00e9cor was contemporary and the room was in good shape.  We had room 501 in the front of the hotel with a window over the street.  It was a little noisy with occasional sirens, truck noises, etc., but that's to be expected in a big city.  The room was right across from the elevator so there was some noise from people waiting outside the door, but there weren't many rooms on the floor so that only happened a couple of times.  Someone left 2 chocolate chip cookies in the room while we were out (turndown service) so that was a nice touch, but it would have been even better if they left one for each person in the room.  We ate twice at the Red Flame diner 2 doors down and it was fine.  We wound up there for dinner Sat. night because every other place near Times Square had long wait times (find a place that takes reservations) and we had dinner there Sun. morning.  There are a few other hotels on the block so the diner was crowded Sun. morning.  The front desk staff and bellman were nice and helpful (gave me a map of the city).  The hotel is in a great location - 3 blocks from Grand Central and Times Square so close to the subway, near the Broadway theaters and lots of restaurants.  The only minor negatives we found were:  had to wait until 3:50 for our room to  be ready (check-in is supposed to be at 3:00), the king bed had a mattress or box spring that made a noise when you shifted on it, and no tissues in the bathroom.  We had to wait for our room on the 2nd floor in a small lobby\/lounge area that had 5 or 6 tables with 2 seats but no room for a couch or seating area. They gave you the wifi passcode to appease you I guess.  There was scaffolding over the building entrance so you had to look close to find it.  We arrived early, around 10:30 AM, so they stored our bags while we went sightseeing. Overall we liked this hotel and will come back for our next trip to NYC.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The bathroom was a very good size with a full sized bath and combined shower. \nThe room  its self was clean and showed no signs of wear. My only comment would be that whilst the room that we booked was advertised to sleep 5, the room really wasn't suitable for 5 adults. The double beds were small doubles, and with the daybed being used there wasn't sufficient space to pack away the suitcases and all the clothes. We ended up stepping over the cases to move around. This isn't a major issue, however, I thought it worth mentioning if anyone is travelling in a group. \n\nThe hotel is positioned in a great spot to access all the touristy and non touristy parts of NY. Armed with our lonely planet guide we did a lot of walking during the stay and found some great spots..... The Highline, a great Irish bar themed on the Gangs of New York film called the Dead Rabbit. La Colombe coffee shop which has an insightful history, Bathtub Gin, 65 at The Rainbow Room... just be mindful if its misty.. the view is non existent... and the usual sites. \n\nAs a final note the bus stop to catch the airport bus is just down the block by Bryant park, for those who want to save on a cab fare.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I booked the hotel room because it looked nice from the pictures and it was a quick walk from Grand Central Station. \n\nI had a very late arrival, but was so surprised when I arrived to find out that my room had been upgraded for free. The room and the welcome cookies were amazing. I paid a very low price last year, but the room was worth two or three times the deal I found.\n\nThe location was perfect - close to Grand Central and Times Square. \n\nI did walk past it however, at first, because at night it is easy to miss and set back from the sidewalk a bit...thank goodness for GPS!! Anyway, I had a friend visiting from Italy and he was very impressed by the hotel room. \n\nThis week, I was again looking for a room for tomorrow night and I searched the usual websites. Once again, I saw a deal for City Club Hotel, however, it was not nearly as good as the one I found last year. That being said, I was more than willing to pay an extra $50 this year just to stay there again! \n\nFor this stay I requested a room with a bathtub, because the tubs at City Club Hotel are very luxurious...so much so that I fell asleep in the one last year. I guess this could count as a negative, but I did wake right up when my head fell in the water! :-) It was a very relaxing experience even though I was only able to stay there for one night. \n\nHonestly, I didn't want to leave the hotel room! I'd stay there for a week if I could afford it some time! \n\nI'm so looking forward to staying tomorrow night and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice relaxing break in the city.\n\n(Full Disclosure: my stay was in late August of last year (2015), but the nearest option from the drop down menu here was September 2015).","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Suddenly they are overbooked and do not have the room we booked anymore. According to the reception they already knew earlier, but apparently they didnt bother to call or email us. \n\nAs it was a saturday night in NYC and we already had plans for that evening, we decided to go with their \"best option\" to take the last room with a small discount and have extra bedding sent to the room. I would think the best option is send us to another hotel or give the night for free if you suddenly are overbooked and you know we were coming.\n\nThe room turned out to be a tiny 2 person room which we had to sleep in with 4 people. And the extra bedding turned out to be a blanket and a half inflated kid mattrass so 2 of us SLEPT ON THE FLOOR!!! Absolute horrible night and spent the next morning in tears of being treated this way in a 4* hotel nonetheless and not getting any sleep.\n\nThis is not what we expected and since we did not make any mistakes here we make a complaint to the hotel manager Pete Cullim, who then says \"we will not do anything and your card has already been charged so bye\". No sympathy whatsoever for what they did to us.\n\nNever ever had a worse treatment and hotel experience in my life (by the way i went backpacking in SE Asia and Africa).

That was really bad, because of that the room was always dark and always needed lights on. From the window you could not tell if the sky was bright sunny or totally dark.

I've been going there for years, now, which kind of says it all.  It is a little gem tucked between 5th Avenue and the Theater District with a host of excellent restaurants on the same block.  If you're doing a short trip to New York for some shopping and a show--and a couple nice meals, of course--it would be hard to do better and very easy to pay much more.  Rooms range from New York tight to moderately spacious and, no matter which way you want to go, they are immaculately clean and well-appointed.  The place is quiet.  It is next to DB Bistro Moderne, which serves as its pretty fancy breakfast offering (with an interior door so you can get lunch, dinner and late night drinks, too), and on the same block as other favorites like Triomphe, Kellari, The Strip House and Blue Bar at the Algonquin.  If you want something a little less ethereal that will get the job done in the morning, there's coffee at Gregory's across the street or breakfast at The Red Flame a few steps to the right when you go out the door.  You can hold your breath and walk to 5th Avenue to shop or walk a couple minutes in the opposite direction to get to a Broadway show.  On the trip referenced in this review, I went there alone but I've gone many time with my wife who I know would echo all of my observations.  Best of all, as with any excellent hotel, the people really make the place.  I have always had unfailingly friendly and helpful service here--they even remember me when I come back, now, which I do whenever possible.  If you're driving, there's an Edison Car ParkFast right across the street.  And, hey, they put a pretty fine cookie in the room for each occupant every day!--a nice touch.

I must not be very particular.  Yes, the noise was inconvenient; and, yes, I got only four hours of sleep.\n     All of this was over-ridden by many factors in the hotel.  A clean room, with a comfortable bed.  A large bathroom (with bidet!) and an ample, invigorating shower.  The unfailing friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, from the door to the desk.  In fact, the doorman went out his way to get a taxi for a friend who wasn't even staying at the hotel!  Finally, the Peter Cullim, the front office manager, gave me a 50% discount on the room for the nigh ofthe alarm.\n     So ignore the negative comments.  Things happen when we travel.  If we expect the comfort of home for $300 a might in NYC, we should stay home.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I called the reception and they were sold out so they did not have anything else to give me. So, I decided to take a shower and find another hotel for the night. Big surprise... no hot water at all.

She said there wasn't anything that could be done that evening, but they would move us the next day. I'm sorry, but if someone is allergic to smoke, they should be accommodated sooner than later. For the inconvenience, she gave us passes for \"free continental breakfast\". There was no conditions listed on the card as to how we needed to use them. We ordered from the door hanger menu and ordered 2 continental breakfasts for the next day. When the \"food\" arrived, they told us the \"complimentary\" breakfast coupon wouldn't work unless it was specifically stated upon ordering......Um...this wasn't told to us so we were out 50 bucks for a few croissants and some terrible coffee that we didn't even eat or drink.

We ended up going for a breakfast\/lunch at Cafe Un Deux Trois which was only a block away and then walked around Times Square. Right as we were deciding on what to do for the rest of the day the hotel called (at around 1 pm) to tell us that they had a room ready for us. We went back to the hotel and Pete checked us in and told us that we were getting a free upgrade to a room with a queen bed and a balcony. The room wasn't very big but probably still bigger then the room we booked to begin with and the balcony was a really nice touch.

This hotel was like a little secret, in the way that it is so small you could easily miss it. But we really enjoyed our stay, we originally booked a petite room but was upgraded to a king size. Which was awesome! The king size was  pretty small so I can't even imagine the petite room. So that was a really nice upgrade, the room was nice and the bathroom decor was really cool as well! We couldn't get the internet to work though and the tv was  messed up the first day but they fixed it. It may  be a bit overpriced based on the size but you can't beat the location! The first day we decided to walk to try to find some food and we literally just stumbled into times square. We didn't realize how close we were! It was awesome! I also would recommend the Cafe and Deli down the road, really good sandwiches. The staff was nice! The doorman was helpful, as well as the guy who fixed our tv and recommended a few places to get food.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We parked across the street in a garage that charged us $45 us per day but $20 more for my full size pickup , still nice and secure in the high rent district . The City Club was directly across the street from the garage and next door to the Sofitol Hotel ( did I spell that right ?) . We chose this hotel mainly because it was listed as pet friendly and honestly after reading the complaints here did not expect much . That's probably why we were so overwhelmed from the door . The staff warmly welcomed us when we arrived or my two Australian Shepards , I still think they were happier to see them . Either way we felt extremely welcome and comfortable immediately and I can't say enough about the attentive courteous staff throughtout our visit . These people really cared about our enjoyment of New York . Be it directions or referrals to eat they never once acted too busy for any of our many questions , superb folks!\n We were given a room on the 3rd floor, a Queen suite, which would allow me to smoke if I wanted . We were simply amazed by the room . It was brilliantly laid out as so we never once felt we were in a small room . It had a delicious looking mini bar although we didn't partake as I am cheap , maybe next time . On the farwall they had what appeared to be a custom built in window bench seat surrounded by upholstered wall framing and a nice comfy cushion with big throw pillows , just an exceptionally well thought out functional amenity that looked great too. The bathroom was large and very well stocked with everything you would expect from any hotel , sewing kit , blow dryer etc. . The entire bath was done in turned stone tile and the water pressure was super . The shower was probably the nicest shower I have ever used and honestly I didn't want to get out . The tv had more stations than you could possibly watch with the free on demand viewing . We watched three episodes of what else Gordon Ramsay Hotel Hell . Once we were settled , we went out on the town and really did not need to leave 44 st .. We walked around until we found a show we wanted to see , Misery , ate at a New York Deli , had some New York Pizza , in the morning had coffee and donuts all on 44th st .

So my trip was great! I got to the hotel at 7am, check in isn't until 3pm. Bell man at the door was so nice. James was nice too at the front desk. Okay could we do an early check in, well if there is availability call us and we will let you know. For now we can hold your luggage until your room is ready! Great. Called the hotel about 14 times because we had a 2pm show and wanted to change our clothes. Nothing was ready the whole day. Okay. Not a huge deal. Get to the room. It's extremely hot! Very small! Okay fast forward to bed time. Checking for bed bugs. Room is clear. Open the covers there is a comforter under a regular sheet that is staged as the fitted sheet for the mattress. So when your in the bed the sheets come off, the comforter that your laying on moves around...Not even sure why that was on the bed maybe as a \"foam\". It wasn't a foam at all. Then we had the thermostat on, which was louder than a truck. Around 10:45 the vent covers decided to fall off. There was cracks in the cover. I went down stairs to speak with the attendant, the manager was not there and the bell man could send up some box fans. So we slept with box fans the rest of the night. The room was not cleaned appropriately. The phones were not working since December...We paid over 250 dollars for this!!??? I was kind of embarrassed, however relaxed knowing how close we were to times square. Not a bad price for the location....But the quality and atmosphere was horrible. Had to park across the street in a parking garage which was 45 dollars for 24 hours. We could've gotten early bird special if we went to another garage...if you are 5 minutes passed the 24 hour they add another 18$ so it was almost 63 dollars, until my boyfriend gave the \" scary face\" and they let the 5 minutes go. Pictures from other travelers, for other rooms seemed to be much nicer than the room we got....and the hotel clerk said we were upgraded!! LMAO. Terrible!!!! Oh 1 more thing, when they took our luggage in the morning, I received my luggage and coat back, along with someone else's coat....feel bad for that poor person who almost lost their coat, however the coats had been cleaned up a bit.

Since very few of the rooms face the street I was not at all surprised to find that the view from the window was of the brick building next door.....but then again, unless you're booking a hotel near Central Park who needs a view from the room!\nThe King room was large for NYC standards...a very comfortable bed with high-end linens, a large marble lined bathroom, over-sized towels, and a strong shower.

Directly across the street from the Parking Garage at the Hippodrome Building...$41 for overnight parking (in Mid-Town that's a bargain!).

It was recommended. Check-in was good enough and staff were friendly.\n\nI was given a King Luxe room on the 6th floor. The shock was when I went into the room and looked at a brick wall from both the windows. After looking at the \"view\" for a minute, I then became aware of a noise similar to an A380 with its engines idling.... At first I thought it was the air conditioning but that turned out to be off.  Going to the window, I soon found the noise to be exhaust fans and air conditioning units from the adjacent restaurant and the hotel. Given there was only 6 feet (2m) of space between my window and the wall of the next building, the noise came straight up.\n\nI went back to reception and explained the situation. The two staff on duty were fine with my request for a room change - and said that they knew about the noise problem. I can only assume I wasn't the first one to speak to them about it.\n\nGiven a room on the 8th floor on the opposite side of the building, this one was a Queen Room - and yes, there was another brick wall to look at, but this time of the building on the other side of the hotel !  Six feet away and yep, noise from more air conditioning units.\n\nGood size bathroom and inclusions. No tea\/coffee making facilities.\n\nMy travelling companion, who had a King Luxe on the 6th floor (with a street view)\nsuggested we go to the nearby Sofitel and stay there - but having been to New York on many occasions before, I said not to bother and just took a photo of my new wall.... :)\n\nSo, fan noise 24\/7 - it was along 5 nights. There was no breakfast included in the room rate, so it was into the adjacent restaurant for a $US20 cup of tea and some toast. \n\nThis hotel is fine for a night or two if you are a business traveller and can use the corporate credit card . If you are first time visitor or tourist to New York - you will be disappointed. Yes, it's walking distance to Time Square and the theaters, and between 5th Ave and 6th Ave. They are the only bonuses.\n\nIt's not a boutique or luxury hotel by any stretch.\n\nOn the day of departure I got an account under the door. A room charge of \n$US 471.20 + four loads of taxes, turned a per night stay into $US 544.20. Put simply, that was for a bed.\n\nAfter a quick check on the hotel's website, I saw that the Queen room I had been downgraded to (at my request) was $US 417.00 pn. A $60 difference. I went and spoke to the duty manager and he said he'd deduct $30 per night off the rate. Well, (as I said to him) \"thank you, that's better than nothing\".\n\nGiven the number of hotels in NYC,my suggestion is to shop around - particularly if you are a \"first timer\".  There are far less expensive hotels on offer and you will be able to get more than just a bed.","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

I am not very particular about mattresses and usually sleep well on a variety of densities, but this one felt like the really, really old thing in your grandparents' house, that had settled unevenly over the years so you slept on what felt like a sloping angle off the sides of the bed, and was so hard and lumpy, I kept shifting around all over it during the night just trying to get comfortable, Perhaps the mattresses in other rooms and\/or other sizes aren't as bad so I still really recommend this very nice hotel.

No view - you are looking at solid brick wall of neighboring hotel.

They need to stop using the word 'luxury' or 'boutique' hotel to suggest it is more than it is.  This is an older, dated hotel with no facilities.  There is no lobby, just a hole in the wall (literally!), the room has a tiny desk that barely fits a computer, no coffee machine in the room, exercise facilities are at the business next door and I had to ask 10 times for a pass.  Finally, I gave up.  Wi-fi was slow to the point of useless, so I had to go to the next hotel and use their free wi-fi to get any Internet service.  No business printing facilities \u2026 basically you get a room albeit the bathroom portion is nice - great tub!  I did ask the manager for a room upgrade, but he never got back to me so I stopped asking after the 3rd time.  They claimed to have in-room spa services such as a massages \/ facials, but again, I was send down the street 9 blocks to another business.  The bottom line is that we need more accuracy in rating hotels \u2026 for the price this is completely excessive and any 4 or 5 star hotel in NYC at the same price would be much better.  Trust me \u2026 I am in NYC 3 times per months and this hotel is not worth the price - it is a 2 star, 3 at the very most.

I'm usually put in crappy rooms by the elevators at hotels.  When I entered the room, there was a large floor length mirror by the bed that seemed to be in a weird spot and looked different than the rest of the mirrors in the room.  The weird appearance caused me to look at it closely, and after shining my phone's flashlight directly into the mirror, I discovered the MIRROR WAS ACTUALLY A TWO-WAY MIRROR SET UP WITH A CARVED OUT AREA BEHIND THE MIRROR with cords hanging down.  I didn't see a camera set up, but it was immediately clear that the \"mirror\" next to the bed was really hiding a bunch of electrical wires and wasn't a real mirror like the other ones in the room.    After leaving the room and going to the front desk to confront the gentlemen working, they didn't express any real concern and moved me to a smaller room (the one I had actually paid for).

We planned to see a different show every night and we were able to walk to each theater within 10 minutes!  (and I'm not that fast a walker.)  That made this hotel a perfect choice.\n\nCity Club Hotel is very small and nondescript - our cab driver couldn\u2019t find the entrance even though Google maps on his iPad mini led him right to the front door. I recognized the lower case CC logo from the Hotel\u2019s web site so I was confident the driver delivered us correctly.  A doorman in a blue shirt let us in and helped with bags.  The lobby is exactly like the picture - no line with two people behind the desk who friendly greeted us..  I reserved a smaller room but palmed a $20 and doing my best Sean Connery burred, \u201cwhatever you can do will be appreciated.\u201d The young lady checked us in and said we have an upgrade.  Score!  \n\nAround the the desk and to the left is their Bistro - elevators to the right opened with no wait.  Anxious to see our room I realize it\u2019s still one of their smaller rooms - the bed is a full-size. Oh well. Perhaps that tip was insulting and we were downgraded. \n\nThe bathroom is nice, clean, big and shiny. The water pressure in the shower is strong and the ledge from the shower to the bathroom floor is low enough for excellent puddle accumulation.  Beware wet shiny floors barefooted. (tip: make good use of the floormat and the extra bath towels! especially the ones by the toilet!) The toiletries are high end and I particularly liked the mint shampoo.  There is a table with towels and reading material that is dangerously close to the toilet\u2019s splash zone.  A mirrored wall is directly across the toilet giving yourself a strange uncomfortable\/comfortable view of business.  \n\nThe wifi is fast.  The TV is big with a few HD channels and the remote is new looking enough for me to handle without encasing it in plastic. There is a closet behind a secret panelled wall that also includes a fridge and nicely stocked mini bar. There is small window that gives you a nice view of brick and darkness. The carpet is clean and feels safe to go barefoot. There are no bureaus or cabinets so we lived out of suitcases stacked on a loveseat built into the wall.  This room is cozy but not claustrophobic and the fluffy full-sized bed perfect for cramped afternoon naps. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t forget the aforementioned cookie (from other reviews) during turn down because the one time they forgot to leave some, I felt dramatically rejected and ripped off.  Oh the suffering being denied a cookie!\n\nEach time we left or entered the building there were no more than two or one (or none) groups of people checking in or out.  This felt like our own personal hotel.  During the week we walked into the lobby of Hotel Pennsylvania directly across from Penn Station and that place was a madhouse. There were multi-lines of people ready to check in or out.  Families were camped in the lobby around their luggage waiting like it was Disneyworld or Circus Circus.\n\nA few doors outside and to the left of the hotel is a diner that serves a decent breakfast and stays open till 11 PM..  Across the street and to the right is what seems like a 24-hour falafel stand.  I bought a sketchy-sounding chicken shawarma at 3 in morning that was absolutely delicious. Around the corner on the same block is a drugstore in case you want something less scalp-tingling than mint shampoo or for some milk to go along with the you know what. And then down the street, less than a minute walk away is the Belasco theater where you can watch Hedwig and the Angry Inch - which perfectly dates this review.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was a last-minute booking, we didn't know much about the hotel and we took a chance on it given that this hotel one of a handful for less than $200 a night. We hit the jackpot with that one! \nPERFECT LOCATION. The hotel is a mere 3 to 4 minutes from the action of \nTimes Square.\nEXCELLENT SERVICE. In our haste, we had actually booked a room with a double bed. They upgraded us to a queen at no charge. The room was NOT spacious, but super-clean with toiletries and guest services one would expect for a lot more than $200 a night. It was cozy and comfortable and (most important to me) I could not hear any street noise... which was fantastic. That made for a great, restful night sleep. \nPARKING. They do not offer parking (as far I knew), but that was fine because directly across the street there is public parking which we used without having to pay through the nose for valet parking.\nOTHER AMENITIES. They did offer wifi, but we never used it, so I can't comment on how fast or slow it was. Also the 'business' area was quite small, consisting only of one desk and a computer. But I guess people don't go to Times Square for business, so that probably works out just fine. They did offer to print out tickets or whatever documents we needed - again the personal attention was just superb!\nMy wife and I both just love this hotel and we will definitely book with them the next time we visit the area.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I picked this hotel because the price was right, it had free wife, and booking it on Rocketmiles gave me 5000 AA miles. The hotel is located close to Times Square and lots of restaurants and Port Authority Bus Terminal. When I arrived at the front desk at 12pm, I was told that the petite room that I booked would not be available until 3pm but I could upgrade to a queen room for $50 (normally I would have refused the offer but I decided to treat myself since I was only staying one night). However, I had a feeling that they normally tell guests this in order to get them to book a larger room for more money. The room was a medium sized NYC hotel room (which made me wonder how small the petite room I originally booked was). I was really impressed by the marble shower, huge wall sized mirror, and bidet in the bathroom. And I really liked that the maid (I am saying maid because she was dressed in a traditional black and white maid's outfit) came by in the evening with a plate of chocolate chip cookies. A few things that I didn't like about the room was the lack of counter space in the bathroom. There was so much space in the bathroom but nowhere for me to put my toiletries. I also was a bit unnerved by the fact that my bed (although very comfy) did not have a fitted sheet over the featherbed and mattress. The featherbed was covered by a sheet so if you move in your sleep like I do, you will see the mattress in the morning. I just thought it was strange for a hotel with bidets in the bathroom that they don't have a complete bedding set on their beds.

It was wonderful from start to finish. The highlight of this hotel is a tie between impeccable service and insanely good location! We could literally stand out on the balcony (duplex suite, third floor) and watch the Marcy's Tgiving Day Parade go by...it was on the street half a block from our balcony! Two blocks from Times Square, three or four blocks to Broadway, we walked everywhere! The service was amazing, very helpful and quick with any request. My daughter even left her boots there by accident, not only did the hotel find them but they mailed them to us! \nPros: Location, service, clean.\nCons: (if I had to be picky) Room service was limited. There is a Bistro next door that also delivers up to the room but again it is limited (and WAY expensive, $13 for two eggs, really?). But, there is a coffee shop right across the street (room service coffee was $5, $9? Something like that, definitely NOT what I would pay for coffee). The room was a little noisy, walls were thin. We had a VERY excited 5 year old in the room next to us at 6 a.m., the hotel was quick to ask them to settle down and they did. Little bit of street noise too but hey, it is basically in Times Square. \nI would definitely stay here again, this hotel was wonderful and went out of their way to do whatever you ask, quickly. Oh and the duplex suite cannot be beat, especially if you have a teenager with you...there is a spiral staircase, the master is upstairs with a full bathroom, couch and sitting area downstairs with a half bath...perfect for our family of three.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I knew the room would be a bit small, but I figured location would make up for that.  Before finding City Club I had made a reservation at another hotel in the upper east side.  Reasoning that the better location would give us a couple of precious hours  by saving us travel time to the upper east side, I cancelled the first reservation and went with City Club.  We arrived at 10:30 am and were greeted warmly by the front desk staff and the doorman.  We left our bags and told the we'd be back at 3pm for check-in.  We spent most of the day walking (lots of walking--all the way down to Union Square and then back!).  When we returned, at about 3:15, we were told the room wasn't ready but would be \"just a few minutes\".  It was disappointing, but we decided to wait. We were sent to a waiting area (tables and chairs) and waited...and waited.  At close to 4pm my husband went down to check on the room.  It had been more than \"a few minutes\" and the kids were exhausted.  We also were losing the time I had hoped to save by staying in mid-town.  The woman at the front desk apologized, but said she couldn't give an estimate on when the room would be ready, telling us, 'It'll be a few more minutes\".  Supposedly, because we were waiting for a more rare \"double room\", it was harder to get the room ready. At 4:15 we had to change our dinner reservation because we didn't think we'd have time to regroup, dress, and get to the restaurant by 5:30.  At 4:25 -- finally -- someone came up to tell us the rooms would be ready \"momentarily\".  We got up to the room a little after 4:30 (an hour and a half AFTER check-in time) and were given free passes to breakfast at the restaurant.  This excited us until we went to the restaurant and were told the \"free\" breakfast was either a bowl of oatmeal, a yogurt parfait, or a muffin\/pastry combo.  It was nice -- and free -- but hardly made up for the inconvenience of waiting that long for our room and losing over an hour waiting.  The room itself was fine -- the double is about the size of a standard non-NYC Marriott and the extra bed for the fifth person is a window-seat type of bed.  The beds themselves have nice bedding but the mattresses seem older.  The room was clean (I would hope so, since it took them 90 minutes to get it ready!), and the bathroom spacious. Our room faced 44th, so it was loud at night but we were tired so it was fine.  We know that things go wrong -- people check out late or it gets more busy than expected.  And we appreciate the apology from the staff. We were upset, though, because they knew we were there at 10:30 am...and even if the room wasn't ready when we returned, it shouldn't have taken another hour to prepare the room.  I wouldn't stay here again -- even though it is hard to find a 5 person room in NYC, I would try something else. The best part of this hotel is the location -- easy walking to most sights and shows.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

After speaking with the front desk, we learned that this happens a lot when booking through a 3rd party and were told we could upgrade our room for an extra fee.  We decided to do it and it made all the difference.  The new room was a great size (bigger than other rooms I've had in NY in the past), with a big bathroom, fridge, closet, safe, couch, comfortable bed and amazing wireless internet.  I would definitely recommend the hotel based on this room.  The view wasn't great (brick walls) and there was noise from the attached restaurant on Friday night but it ended at midnight so it really wasn't bad.  The hotel was in a great location and close to restaurants, stores and a subway stop.  All in all I would recommend it.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had booked a petite room through Rocketmiles.com, but on arrival they upgraded us to a queen room at no extra cost as our original petite room was not ready for us at check-in time and the front desk staff thought it would be too tight a fit for 3 of us in a petite room, Great start already! Staff were really friendly and customer focussed - they accomodated all kinds of requests that we had for the baby during our stay. Rooms were compact, but had almost everything we needed. No coffee in the rooms. There was evening turn down service, and they leave you with 2 decadent chocolate cookies every night! Huge bath rooms, however we only had a stand in shower, which it made it a little complicated to bathe the baby so remember to ask for a room with bath tub if travelling with young ones. We also a bedae which reminded us of Europe. Our room was on the 2nd floor facing another hotel - so you don't really get any natural light in the room which is some ways is a good thing coz you sleep like a baby! Wi-Fi was not working on our last night. Location was ultimate - walking distance to all of the attractions (Grand Central terminal, Bryant Park, New York Public Library, Central Park, Time Square) but away from the chaos of Time Square. Taxis are always available right outside the hotel. Try the amazing coffee across from the hotel at Gregory's.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Petite room was a disgrace. Tiny-basically a double bed w\/a night stand attached to the wall, like a hostel, not hotel. It was also shabby (cracks, peeling wall paper, etc.) and the bed felt like a box spring w\/a mattress topper (I'm pretty sure that's what it was actually). The air conditioner was so noisy, it would literally clang periodically. Bathroom was also tiny which was OK except for a bidet-total waste of space and disgustingly less than a foot away from the tiny sink-rather strange to even have one for US hotel. The next day we paid another $30 a day for an upgrade. I'm not giving them a 1 star as this room was great-large with a huge bathroom and much better maintained. Quiet air con-very comfortable, and we were glad we moved even with the extra cost. However, I also feel I need to ding them because I later actually spoke to a desk person and advised them that the petite room we had initially had was really unacceptable and they needed to attend to it. She said that she had had maintenance go check it out (the bed, air con, general I suppose) and they found nothing wrong with it. She explained that it was basically for business people traveling alone. (Who I guess are considered to be oblivious to their surroundings.) Although every one behind the desk was really nice, this interchange smacked of a bit of a snobby attitude. Personally, I think that every room in a hotel should be of a certain standard- I really think they should be ashamed to have any room in such poor condition. The location is great for sightseeing tourists. I lived in NYC many years ago so I was bothered by having to fight the craziness in Times Square whenever we went to the west side-tourists probably enjoy it though. I would consider staying there again-although I would have to compare prices given that we'd have to go with a more expensive room.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":224226,"title":"Perfection Revisited","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-07-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"City Club Hotel is a sweet little boutique hotel a couple blocks off of Times Square and tucked next door to the much more obvious Algonquin.  I I have to say, I would live here if I could make it happen without breaking the bank.  From the minute you walk in you are encased in an otherworldly calm from the streets of New York.  The low-lighting in the lobby and elevator help with this.  You just know that you will get a good night's rest when the time arrives, be that time 10 p.m. or rolling in sometime after sunrise.  \n\nThe room is really quite lovely.  As this is my second time, I thought perhaps I had imagined the greatness of the room seven years before when I came on business, but I was not mistaken.  It is spacious, has a small suite-style sitting area that (in my case) overlooked 44th street, a gorgeous dark marble bathroom with luxurious Bigelow bath product, a mini-bar stocked so well with snacks and beverages it was like Pandora's box, docking station, comfy king-sized bed, black-out shutters, a paper every morning, and the list goes on!!!\n\nI almost don't want to go on because I'd rather keep this place a secret but then again, always give credit where credit is due.  From getting theater tickets, recommending places to eat, to obtaining transportation and making calls to friends so clients can feel like special guests at hard-to-get-into clubs, the front desk staff is stellar!  I am amazed by the level of customer service offered here. Housekeeping also does an amazing job cleaning up and being respectful of your sleep hours.\n\nLastly, the price is really reasonable for Gotham City and every night when you show up with aching feet, too many packages of cheap souvenirs, and the need to sleep off whatever your ailment, you find warm chocolate chip cookies for each guest waiting in your room.  I love you City Club.  I take this hotel, to have and to hold, forever and ever, until end-of-vacation do us part.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We originally booked a petite room, but the lovely young woman who booked us in upgraded us to a queen suite. It was absolutely beautiful, and though we only had a dark, somewhat dingy view of the back courtyard, this only ensured it was quiet during the night. We weren't there for the view, after all! The room was spacious and the bathroom was HUGE! Gorgeous bath and lovely toiletries, and the robes were very comfortable. The bed was comfy, the minibar had a great selection and the little touches like the umbrella and newspaper service was very cute. Not to mention the freshly baked cookies every day! They were delicious!\n\nThe staff were extremely friendly and polite (the same lovely woman who upgraded us complimented me on my hair and the flower accessory I was wearing, which was really sweet). \n\nFabulous location too, only a short walk from Times Square. We turned on Good Morning America every morning, and if there were any cool celebrities then we dashed down to see them leave! We even saw Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy!\n\nDefinitely recommended, and we would stay again should we return to New York. Thanks, City Club!","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I booked based on the star rating, the reviews and the price.  Apparently the deal wasn't really a deal.  I opened the door to see a full size bed in a room half the size of my walk in closet. This room (on the 4th floor but apparently there is one on every floor) had an a\/c unit that was so loud I might as well have been sleeping on the runway of JFK.  The wallpaper was stained, the ceiling was crumbling, the two foot opening that the hotel may call a window looks out onto a brick wall and the a\/c seemed to have two setting: meat locker and suffocating. If this is four star,  the reviewer must have come out of a homeless shelter. \n\nShame on the front desk for not giving us any warning when we arrived.  We most certainly would have upgraded or better yet, canceled given the choice but he claimed the only upgrade was $100 extra for a room with two full beds.  We didn't need two beds we wanted what you advertised not what you trick people into buying to fill your vacancies. Add the $100 to the advertised price and I would have stayed at a real four star.  I am disgusted at how we were treated.

The friendliness and service of the hotel staff well exceeded higher star establishments I stayed in recently.  They are faultless in that regard.\n\nHowever, the room was ridiculously tiny.  There's nowhere to undress let alone open a case.  They did the best they could given the permanent wall structure of the room.  But a bit more in the right places would have gone a long way.  The wallpaper covering the cupboard\/wallspace was totally worn out and needs urgent replacement.  It's weird how there's literally nothing behind the window.  Maybe you can do some sort of clever adhesive mural or something - anything - on those windows to trick the eye, maximize feeling of space and allow the blinds to actually be opened.  It also felt really dark in that little cave.  Even brighter wattage lights may help as the design of lighting was good fundamentally.  Maybe it's the color scheme, I can't say for sure, but the bathroom didn't have such a cramped feel as the room.  What about getting a moveable wall stand for the TV so it can be angled out in the right direction for viewing?  \n\nHere's what they did right: having little books in the room to read, a random selection, this was unique and cool; wonderful staff; good cleaners and standards of cleanliness.\n\nI think if this place was upgraded I'd give it a 4 or 4.5.  Unlike other places, the key fundamentals are in place so I really hope the hotel rethink just a couple of relatively inexpensive and small changes to help make this the little gem it could be - even in the tiny rooms.","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

In fact, this was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. \n\nAs a note, this was also my second trip to New York and I've previously stayed at the Club Quarters in the financial district that trip.\n\nWe stayed in the duplex suite which is an extremely spacious, lofted two story suite with a small balcony. The couch on the bottom floor folds out to a comfortable queen bed and has it's own half bathroom and it's own big flat screen TV. \nWalk up the spiral staircase and the top floor has a king size bed with its own gigantic bathroom with an absolutely incredible marble tile shower. Once again with it's own huge flat screen TV. \n\nThe high ceiling has molded Art Deco ornamental filigree designs that as an artist of the art nouveau style really made me happy and I couldn't help but stare at it when we were nestled in the comfortable cloud of a bed. \n\nThe staff were absolutely amazing. We got there late at night after the last day of the convention. Check in was smooth, the guy helping us was so courteous and professional. When we got to our room, everything was setup the way I had asked them to (I had them make the couch into a bed since we were supposed to be a party of three,) and they even had cookies (which were absolutely amazing,) waiting for us on the bed with a breakfast menu in case we wanted breakfast delivered in the morning. \n\nThe location was perfect too. Close enough to Times Square (a couple blocks,) but not too close because we all know it gets absolutely insane over there.\n\nWe stayed there 2 nights and it made me wish we had stayed there the entire trip. \nI now have no questions as to where to stay when in New York. \n\nThank you to Irene and everyone at City Club Hotel for making it such an amazing memorable experience.

Complimentary Wi-Fi so we could use our I-Pad for internet. Reception staff were all very pleasant and helpful, and welcomed us back every time we returned to the hotel, and we really felt that nothing would have been too much trouble for them. Be aware that there is no 'business centre' in the hotel, so nowhere to print tickets or boarding passes yourself, but when we asked about this at reception they were only too happy to supply an e-mail address for the hotel so we could forward our boarding pass information. These were then printed and slid under our door for us the evening before we departed. No hotel bar which would have been nice, but then it's not as though NYC is short of bars! Very gorgeous-looking restaurant attached to the hotel next door, although we didn't actually eat there.

The bed\/linens were excellent, the bathroom was huge (with nice plush robes), the TV had dozens of (free) channels, and there were good reading lights above the bed (never a given these days).  There were chocolate cookies on my bed at night, and a newspaper on my door in the morning. And the staff were nice and helpful.\n\n44th St. between Fifth and Sixth Avenues isn't New York's most beautiful stretch, but it's extremely central. And if you're going to the theater, it's a much better location than staying right in the middle of Times Square, with all its commotion; you can be at any Broadway theater in 10 minutes.  \n\nIn short, I'd recommend this place, at least for a nice, relatively affordable weekend stay.","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

The front desk was friendly and did their best to welcome us. We had booked a double room (as it was labeled on Hotels.com) The reception referred to it as a petite room, that was not very suited for two, but they were fully booked. But we could get a upgrade for 50 USD the next day. The room where tiny, there is no room to open your suitcases, you had to open them on the bed. The bed is small, i am 192cm and i had to sleep with my feats hanging out. And it was nearly impossible for two people to sleep side by side. This is a bit like false marketing in my point of view. The response from the front desk told me that this is a common thing, and it happens often. Since they where very fast in offering an paid upgrade. We stayed one night in the petite room, and then upgraded to larger room. The room we upgraded to was OK, but a bit worn. The room we had was on the 9.th floor, and there was a horrible noise from the ventilation system for the whole hotel.

Other offers had us paying daily for that.  Glad we worked that out.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":224226,"title":"Boutique hotel with European Feel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-05-24","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"What a hidden gem! This hotel is sandwiched between two New York iconic hotels on west 44th street. The hotel location is perfect for businessmen due to its midtown location and outstanding for theatre goers thanks to its spot in the theatre district. We were there for the latter. No valet parking but the garage directly across the street is manned 24\/7 and reasonably priced. When we checked in I had mistakenly chosen a room (\"the petite room\") with a full bed. The front desk kindly gave us a complimentary upgrade to queen without batting an eye. Now. This is a wonderful vintage building that has been re-vamped into a boutique hotel. While it's exterior is vintage New York, the interior is clean and modern favoring a more European design. With that in mind we found the rooms to be perfect for our purpose. It was on the smaller side but very well laid out with a fully stocked fridge and mini bar replete with snacks,sodas and plenty of alcohol for those who enjoy a pre-show cocktail or after dinner drink. The desk had plenty of room for working if one chooses to do so. Halls are a bit narrow much like small European hotels but very quiet despite the closeness to the street( we were on the second floor and heard NOTHING!) the bathroom was spacious and again well designed with marble and large walk-in shower. It had excellent water pressure and high end toiletries. One wall was floor to ceiling mirror and while it is frightening to be faced with full length images of me coming out of the shower, it is a classic design trick to make the space look larger and lighter. Successful on both counts. Staff was friendly, helpful and at the same time unobtrusive. A perfect combination in my opinion. Lovely to find two fresh chocolate chip cookies on our bed upon our return from the theatre. Speaking of the bed, the queen size bed was comfortably appointed with crisp sheets and duvet and plenty of pillows. The room was spotless. \nWe were 1 block or so from Times Square and 2 from the theatre. A fun after-dinner treat was stopping for dessert at Sardi's! Known best for its collection of caricatures of the rich and famous. Restaurants abound in every price range. We did not try the bistro associated with the hotel but will save that for next time..... And there will be a next time!\n\n","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Then we get to the real negatives: minimal space to store luggage, a closet which will not allow slacks to be hung by their cuffs - the length is too short and the worst - a light directly below the thermostat for the HVAC  - turn on the light and the bulb warms up the temp to 82 degrees F which then turns on the AC and freezes you out. Clearly the design was done by those of limited intelligence- retards but perhaps I am giving them credit too much credit.

Check-in was quick and simple. The room came just as promised -- we had two double beds and a sofa fixed up as a bed.

But they had some comfortable chairs and a marble-top table. The tile in the bathroom was very handsome, and they wisely used a mirror on one wall, floor-to-ceiling tile for the shower, and a clear shower curtain to make the bathroom seem even bigger. The location was easy walking distance to the theatre, Restaurant Row, the stores on Fifth Ave., Times Square and more, yet the street is relatively quiet (for NYC). One caution: Don't expect a lot of hotel amenities. The lobby is very small -- not much more than the check-in desk. But it was great for us. One last note: The room was very clean. It had had a high shelf with some books and decorative boxes, and I have to tell you that I fully expected to find dust when I pulled down one of the books.

We stayed for 2 nights and split the cost, I did one night, he did the other. When we arrived the lady at the front desk put one night on my card and the second night on my boyfriends. There was also a 200$ security deposit, which was a surprise to me. Did not mention that when I called to make my reservation, so we split that too. The room was 383$ per night plus 100 for the security so 483 per night. When we arrived at our room we both checked our bank statement to make sure everything went the right way, and it did. I was charged $483 and he was also. The next morning we went down the street for breakfast, when we were done I gave the waitress my credit card and she came back saying it was declined. I started to panic because I knew I had money. I then checked on my bank statement and I had TWO charges for $483.00 at this point in time my account was withdrawn because I only brought a certain amount of money with me so I didn't spend to much. I then asked my boyfriend to check his bank statement and his 1 night which was $483 was BACK INTO HIS ACCOUNT. We then went right to the hotel and I explained the situation to the man at the front desk, which he wasn't very helpful at all. He had told us that it was a system fault because at the end of the night the system did not recognize that we were splitting the cost. Since I made the reservation my card number was the main one and the computer saw that my card was not charged enough for 2 nights and automatically charged me for the second night. The mam at the front desk still continued to not help me. Told me I had to call my bank. After being on hold for over 30 minutes with the bank I explained to her what had happened. She told me I needed them to fax overt information and what amount they needed to take off my card. After wasting about 2 hours with this, it was half way resolved. I am still waiting for my security deposit and the rest of my money to go back into my account. VERY UPSET AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. I do not recommend staying there because they just screw you over. To add to this the noise from outside was VERY VERY loud. Woke me up multiple times a night.  ","travelDate":"2014-02","tripType":"NONE"}

So we got a pretty good deal on it.  We opted for the queen luxe room instead of the standard 195 ft2 room, which I've read was too small to walk around.  \n\nROOM: Our room was cute.  Decent size.  Queen bed, sofa, closet, desk.  The bathroom was large and I agree with other reviewers that they probably could've made the bathroom a bit smaller in order to make more living space, especially if we were in the smaller room.  There was a bidet in the bathroom, which the hubs (of all people, loved).  It had 2 windows, but you looked directly into the next building.  We couldn't tell if it was cloudy or sunny outside.  \n\nSERVICE: We arrived very early in the morning and our room was not ready, but we left our number with the receptionist who a few hours later, as we were at lunch, called us so we could check in earlier.  That was VERY nice.  They were extremely hospitable.  They left cookies on our bed each night as well as a card for room service and a weather report for the next day.  \n\nLOCATION:  We took the subway from LGA to the hotel.  It was so easy to get there.  Their MTA is crowded but very efficient.  THe hotel is on a quiet street but only blocks from TSQ, which was great.  It was also near Grand Central Station, where we took a shuttle to the airport when we left for an early flight.  \n\nOverall, we had a great experience and really enjoyed the hotel.

The bed and linen was very comfortable..the bathroom stylish and the shower had the hottest and best pressure I have experienced in NY. \nReturning from dinner I was greeted warmly by the front desk and in my room was a plate of delicious chocolate chip cookies. In the morning attached to my door was a small linen bag that held the daily newspaper..a nice touch.  The closet was a bit hard to notice in my room as the door is built into the wall next to the front door. The wall and door look pretty much the same. Plenty of room to hang clothes and in the closet is an iron and iron board along with a full size umbrella that can be used during your stay..however you are charged if the umbrella finds its way back home with you.\nMy room had two windows, both covered by the drawn curtain and neither with any view...which is fine by me...I don't book a room in NY for the view.\nI was very pleased with finding this hotel and will definitely plan on staying here in the future.","travelDate":"2014-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our room was on the ninth floor, and upon getting in the elevator, we noticed the 9th floor button was added on after the elevator was built, which made us feel a little uneasy.

Got incredible deal of under $150 - the location is on a little side street (44th) around the corner from the mayhem of Broadway and Times Sq. Arriving on a Friday night after a snowstorm, I was able to get street parking across the street from the hotel for $3.50 an hour while I checked in with my little dog. (After 6 I was able to park for free overnight) They were very welcoming of my well-behaved pup which I appreciated. Check-in so easy, the lobby is tiny and check in counter the size of a drive-through (not a bad thing). The hotel seemed like a small classic old-style broadway hotel, yet with several nice touches, updates, and finishes. Nice service as well.\nThe room was small and faced the \"courtyard\"\/alley. I kept the windows covered the whole time so no biggie. There was no view out the front anyway.\nDouble bed was comfy, and linen was crisp and clean. Nice feather comforter. Bathroom was HUGE, but simple. Nice toiletries. I thought they did a good job with the layout of the room. It had a nice little settee space built in to the wall, that looked like it could also double as a twin sleeping space. Also there was a nice desk area that I was able to comfortably do some work.\nThe restaurant downstairs ambiance looked good but I did not try it. I did though stop into The Red Flame diner a few doors down from the hotel at the corner of 6th Ave for a late night snack after seeing \"700 Sundays\".\nThe next day I took a meander into the Diamond District on the 5th Ave side of the hotel and up a few blocks. After check out I was able to remote start my car from the lobby and when ready, drove off to do some business in SOHO.\nOverall I found this to be a cute little place if you need to be in midtown. I generally like to stay in the less touristy places like the meatpacking district or Soho to get away from the mania of mid-town, but this place was intimate enough to make me feel like I was in a quaint neighborhood.\nI have no idea what subways are nearby, but I'm pretty sure they are close by.\nThere are some other hotels on this street as well, but I would absolutely stay here again as long as I needed to be in mid-town and the price was right.","travelDate":"2014-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

You are in the thick of things without the chaos.\n- Once we spent the $50 per night and upgraded our room to a street facing king luxe room on the 6th floor, it was a really nicely decorated and comfortable room with good amenities.\n- The freshly baked turn-down choc-chip cookies are awesome!!!!!\n- The staff were generally pretty friendly and the experience was good.\n- Like many of the other reviews have mentioned, the Red flame Diner is a favourite and so is coffee from Gregory's across the road.\n\nThe not so good - \n- We booked a queen luxe room and were given a room with a window that overlooked a wall about a meter away. Whilst the room was reasonably pleasant, it was extremely dark and miserable. We had a lot of work to do whilst we were there and being in a dark hole was a problem.\n- There is nowhere to really put your bags without cluttering the room\n- There is nowhere to sit in the hotel aside from your room.\n- There is no coffee station in your room which is unusual for a 4 star hotel.\n- They hang the towels and face cloths on a rail above the toilet. We lost two face cloths to the toilet. They should consider putting the face cloths directly on the rail and not on top of the hand towels.\n- The windows do not seal too well so the room gets pretty cold at night. We tried to put on the heating but it is extremely noisy\n- Finally, the rooms whilst being attractively decorated, are starting to show wear and tear with the wallpaper coming off the walls and the linoleum on the bathroom floor starting to bubble.\n\nAll in all, the hotel was definitely worth staying at.

I stay at City Club frequently when I'm in Manhattan on business and need to be in midtown.\nOverall, the hotel is, as other guests have noted, clean, friendly, and pretty well run.  The rooms are fairly large for Manhattan.  I stopped staying at CC when the on-premises restaurant, db Bistro Moderne, was about to undergo renovation and started slipping badly (this is important to me because I often need to entertain clients and it is most convenient to do so at the hotel restaurant).  I tried CC again on a recent trip and also ate at the remodeled restaurant (posting that review shortly).  Overall, the experience was pretty good, although I noticed on this trip that the hotel, which seemed chic and well-appointed a few years ago, is now showing some wear and tear.  Also, I was reminded that the front desk resembles a teller's window in a bank, which means that you may have to wait when checking in or seeking help.  For example, on this trip I stood in line for some time behind another guest who was getting information, even though there were three front desk staff standing behind the counter.\nFor the reasons above, I always look for alternatives but keep coming back to City Club because the value is very good at the price point, and the location is unbeatable.\nIf you decide to stay there, check out the pre-theatre menus at the Algonquin, which does a nice dinner for the price and has a wonderful history and atmosphere.","travelDate":"2013-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We booked  a king size bed and received a room with that, plus a day bed. We really did not use the day bed for anything more than piling our stuff on it, so it wasnt a useful feature for us. If you enjoy a lobby as a place to hang out, this hotel has no lobby. We were a bit worried when we checked in, as you walk in to a tiny vestibule area with a tiny \"front desk\". The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, providing recommendations and directions. Our room was on the eighth floor, facing 44th street. As with everything in New York, right across the street are other building with full views of whatever is going on inside. Our room had rudimentary shutters, not drapes, to block out light, provide privacy and probably to protect against the cold in winter. The windows are old single pane glass, and even though the days were warmer for October, we could feel the chill due to the old windows. The room was a bit tired re decor, and wallpaper needs replacing, but arent they all? There are no bureaus, just bedside tabes with drawers, which is where we stored extra clothes. Flat screen TV mounted on the wall. Lots of lights, and the bathroom, though small had a huge shower, with awesome water pressure.  The bed. Sigh. Why hotels do not realize that beds are THE priority is beyond me. Ours was an older mattress with a down pillow topper. No elastic bands to keep it in place, so it slid way down during the night. My husband spent the whole weekend hauling it back in place in the middle of the night. So, sleep was just OK due to quality of bed. Even though we were directly across from the elevator, the hotel only has 44 rooms, so the elevator noise wasnt constant. The main reason I would recommend this hotel is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Just 5 minutes from Times Square, 5th Avenue and all that Manhattan has to offer. A twenty minute walk to Central Park. There is a diner down the block called The Red Flame, a strange name for a basic diner, but the food is amazing! Big servings, quality ingredients and friendly staff. We ate breakfast there every day, but it is super busy so be prepared to wait. So, I would recommend this hotel simply due to location. While there were lots of other hotels on the block, I am sure they were more expensive, with bigger lobbies, etc., but for the amount of time you spend in your room, save some money and stay here.

The other room had a king and a day bed and another huge bathroom with a large shower\/tub combo.  The room didn't have any view to speak of, but that was a nice help in the morning when the rooms stayed dark for sleeping in after a late night out.  We were able to park right across the street in the Hippodrome garage which was one of the nicest and cleanest parking garages I've ever scene.  I've never driven into or parked in NYC before so I was worried about security of the car before I went.  My worries were put the rest when I saw a $300K Ferrari parked a few spots down.

One of the women even remembered my name the next evening when I had a question.\n\nThe room (a queen) was small but did not feel cramped or claustrophobic in any way.  The two windows opened to a dark alley and faced a brick wall, but room was bright and this was not a problem. In fact, it kept the room very dark in the morning, which made sleeping-in so much more pleasant!.\n\nA delicious, freshly baked cookie was waiting upon our arrival and each evening as part of out turn-down service.The bathroom was fantastic and the shower was most excellent -copious amounts of high-pressure water of any temperature. The only addition I would like to see is a shaving mirror, the double-sided kind on a swing arm. The sink is large and far from the mirror.\n\nThe room also included some interesting books about The City. The WiFi was free and strong in our room. The only \"con\" was the size of the TV. It was very small (maybe 24\") but of no consequence since we never used it. We didn't come to the city to watch TV (that and we have an iPad and a laptop.)\n\nThe neighborhood is also quite unique and historic. The City Club hotel is located at the heart of The City's cultural renaissance of the early twentieth century, surrounded by such landmarks as the Algonquin, the Iroquois and the Harvard club.

I get excited by value...an excellent experience for a fair price.  It's hard to find value hotels especially when you are a family of 5 which in NYC usually means getting 2 rooms.  But I stumbled upon reviews of the City Club in NYC and they sounded really great. I am extra picky about cleanliness especially when making a decision where my little children will sleep for the night!   I saw reviews were good (re clean rooms) and I also ran a check on bedbug registry- all clear! The price was right (about $487 for deluxe double double)- so we booked it and kept our fingers crossed.\nUpon arrival I was a bit worried by the appearance of the lobby. But I had read a review about this so I kept the faith. My husband however, raised an eyebrow like \"really, you sure?\". A few minutes later though I was pleasantly surprised when we got to the room and saw that it was clean, nicely decorated, and a decent size for our family of 5 (2 adults and kids ages 4 through 8). \nThe location was perfect- walking distance to Rockafeller Center and a short taxi ride to the \"touristy\" spots we had planned to visit this trip.\nThe comfort and cleanliness of the room was great. My only complaint is that I had a tough time sleeping because of street noise but the rest of my family peacefully slumbered through the night- so maybe it was just me? \nAnyway- I felt this hotel was a real value and would recommend it to any families wanting to visit NYC and not sacrifice their kids college money;)\n\nOne disclaimer....if  the hotel were to raise the rates it would change my perception. Let me be clear- this is not The Ritz or Four Seasons. It is a very charming, clean hotel for a good price for a family of 5. I would stay there again. I will tell my friends about it.

Of course most of us don't need a huge lobby, and the really outstanding thing in he lobby is the personnel behind the desk, as well as the doorman\/bellman and any other staff we encountered. They make all of the amenities just that much more special. They were very friendly, helpful, and efficient and a credit to their organization. Just behind the lobby and to the  left is an attached restaurant. Marvelous French inspired food, and again, wonderful service and friendly faces. The decor is stunning and yet quietly so. If we had somehow had to eat every meal there we would not have been shortchanged! Everything-breakfast, appetizers, wine, entrees, desserts, service-fantastic! Upon getting familiar with our room it became evident that the decor and art in the lobby, some of the hallways, the restaurant, and the rooms was subtle in its coordination. Had it not been it would have been fine, but what it said to me is that the City Club Hotel PAYS ATTENTION TO DETAIL. And that is very comforting and helpful when you are away from home. The location is also tops. We were about 1 1\/2 blocks from Times Square one way, and about the same distance in the opposite direction from 5th Avenue. And the theaters were all around us! We even saw Tom Hanks leaving \"Lucky Guy\" on our way back from \"Phantom\"! The subway stations were all around us, and one can walk to Saks, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's, Grand Central Station, etc. I have stayed at Ritz Carlton's, The Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island (in the room\/suite named after and furnished by President and Mrs. Ford), Pinehurst (NC), The Grove Park Inn,(NC) etc. and many hotels internationally. While not historic nor as large, or as well known, the essence and the experience is much the same. We HIGHLY recommend the City Club Hotel! And on any return visits to NYC, we will absolutely NOT look anywhere else, and look forward to staying there again.

We originally booked a double bed room, however, as soon as we entered the room we knew it was way too small for our 5 night stay, so I called the reception for an upgrade. We was advised the cost would be an extra $30 a night, which we was willing to pay because the room we was allocated was too small. Unfortunately, their system was down so they wasn't able to upgrade us until the next day. When we went downstairs the next morning to enquire about the upgrade, we received a very nice surprise and they were willing to upgrade us to the queen sized room for free!!! We were very grateful for the free upgrade and was pleasantly surprised at how much bigger the room was. Furthermore, they helped us move all our luggage, so on our return to the hotel having explored the Time Square area, all we had to do was retrieve the keys to our new room. \n\nThe bed in the double\/petit room was more like a large single bed and my husbands legs were hanging off the edge (he is 6'1) and there was no room to put our two medium sized suitcases nor were there any space to hang our clothes. The double\/petit room literally just had a petit bed, with no additional space for desk or chair. However, the queen room that we was upgraded to had a queen bed, with additional seating section by the window as well as an additional section for a desk and chair. Needless to say we were very happy with the upgrade to the queen room and the fresh cookies we received every night was a bonus. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel but only the queen room (if staying for more than 3 nights or more) and the staff were friendly and polite to us during our stay. However, if you are only staying for one or a maximum of two nights by yourself then the petit\/double should be sufficient.

Pulled off West Side Highwy at 96th street and began search. My thinking was that  I would book something with last minute prices but now nothing was coming up in the Upper West Side which is where we wanted to be. Found nice price at City Club totally unknown to me and I've been in NYC and envirions since 1996. A call to the hotel I learned that the quoted price on my iPhone would only work if I could book it over the iPhone but it would not work. More frustration and my wife and I now getting hungry. I asked if I could book it on the phone with him and after a wait, he agreed but that the room advertised was a 'petite suit' and when I asked could two people use it he was reluctant to agree. Then  he said if I booked it now with him he would take that rate and give us an upgrade. Now that's a real 'pig-in-a-poke' situation but I decided to trust him and booked the room for two nights to celebrate my b'day weekend. The hotel was in the East Theater District. The drive was a nightmare but we got there with almost all our wits but hungry and angry at all the traffic snarls and totally exhausted. Now we had to hope and pray the room was at least a haven. Phillip was at front desk and very pleasant so we did the biz and  madame went up to the room while I took the car across the street for fifty-percent off parking rate. \n    Then I made my way up to the room and knew I was going to be greeted either by a crazy crying woman or a happy woman. Fifty-fifty. The room was MAGNIFICENT...Stunning Japanese motif, black marble bathroom from the movies, great water pressure. No view but who cared. All the amenities including cookies by the deco nightstand and an incredible mini-bar hidden behind a huge Japanese painting. Needless to say Phillip got a nice tip and we were home for two glorious and very quiet days after much celebrating. Never forget this place and plan to go again next time New York City calls. This place is literally hidden. There is a small door on north side of 44th street between The Algonquin and the Iroquois hotels. Used to be a private Club in the 20's I think. Go, enjoy, ask for Phillip then step into Manhattan the way it was meant to be for night-life. Jimmy's bar towards Broadway is not to be missed. Thank you Tripadvisor app. Thank you Phillip.

City Club reminds me of Room Mate Grace, but is less trendy and more comfy\/quiet.  Check in was easy and I was surprised to find that there is a small bar adjacent to the reception area.  The room was typical NY size, perhaps a bit smaller than Room Mate Grace but fine (I was in a queen size room).  I have to believe that the \"petite\" is really small.  The room featured a small desk, queen bed, and a small sofa built into the window.  Flat panel on the wall, iron\/board in the closet with the mini bar but NO coffee pot.  Bathroom was nice - a big bathroom (or not small) and marble always make you feel spoiled.  Free internet.  Bed was comfy, but the bed felt a little short (I'm 5'10\" and my feet were down on the end).  Overall, I had no major complaints.  I did notice some foot traffic in the halls (no carpet out there), but the amount was small and didn't bother me.  I could see it being a problem if the floor was busy.  I also could not hear any of the guests in the adjacent rooms.  \n\nPrice - I saw some reviews talking about rates in the $200s and even under $200.  I paid $330 for a queen, which I thought was reasonable for City Club.  If you are able to get a rate here under $250 for a queen, I think you got a deal.\n\nOther items to know - there is a 24hr pharmacy around the corner in case you forgot a few items and there is also a greasy spoon next door that opens at 6am and I think is open late.

The not so good: what is UP with the shower? Separated from the rest of the bathroom only by a half glass wall and a clear shower curtain, we flooded the entire bathroom every time we took a shower until we jerry-rigged a barrier; rolled up a bath towel placed on the floor to act as a barrier. Plus, it took ages to get the water to the correct temperature, and to top it off, we had to call somebody up to help figure out the lighting. This is obviously an example of paying attention to design at the expense of comfort.\nAlso, the dark hallways felt sort of creepy.

I had to make a quick trip for personal business and didn't want to spend a lot on a hotel, so I took advantage of a very good deal ($169) on Jetsetter.  The location is very convenient, and just far enough away from Times Square to be relatively noise-free.  The service was unfailingly friendly and efficient.  I was upgraded from a Petite to a Queen room, and thank goodness--the Queen room is tiny so I wonder what the Petite would have been like!  But the Queen was perfectly comfortable for one.\n\nThe hotel is a bit odd.  It is very dark--there is almost no lighting in the hallways and the dark floors don't do much to help illuminate things.  The floors are cork tile (in the hallways and the rooms), and are a bit sticky and rather worn (and faded near the windows).  I would say this is not a great flooring choice for a hotel.  \n\nThe bathroom in my room was immaculately clean with a GREAT shower--fantastic water pressure and a super shower head.  As a whole, the bathroom was adequate, but you can tell it was designed by a man--dark brown\/black marble wall tile, the dark cork floor, and dim lighting, so forget doing anything in there that requires you to actually see, such as putting on makeup.  Still, there were lovely and plentiful toiletries from Bigelow, great towels, and nice robes.  And again, I was just there for one night so how far wrong could I go?\n\nThe bed was way too soft for my liking and a bit lumpy, and the sheets were a little cheap and had a couple of small holes in them.  The air conditioner was incredibly noisy and rattle-y.  There were only two accessible plugs (2 plugs, not 2 available outlets, so if you have more than a phone and a laptop, don't plan to charge everything at once).  I was on the penthouse floor and had a small terrace attached to my room, which would have been quite nice if I had spent more time at the hotel.  The large sliding doors to the terrace also meant the room had nice daylight.  The wallpaper was peeling, which gave a kind of seedy feeling to an otherwise quite well-kept room.\n\nThis is not a luxury hotel, but you will not pay luxury prices.  It appears that the rack-rate for a petite room at this hotel is just shy of $300.  That would seem like a LOT to pay for a room like the one I had.  But for $169, it really can't be beat in the middle of Manhattan.  I would probably stay here again for a rate of under $200.","travelDate":"2012-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":224226,"title":"Small, a bit shabby, but safe and a good location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2012-08-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I stayed here for business for 10 days in June 2012, chosen because it was close to work as well as being close to attractions, and it was significantly cheaper for the dates compared to other hotels close by that I had stayed in previously. I'd actually give City Club 3.5 stars.\n\nWhen walking in, the hotel lobby is tiny, and you may have to help yourself in with bags. However the service was excellent, very friendly which was appreciated after a long long journey from Melbourne. And I received friendly and helpful service the whole of my stay. \n\nThe room itself was even smaller. Even by NY standards, there was barely room to put down my suitcases on one side of the bed, and if there had been two people, someone would have had to crawl out the end of the bed to get out. And it had the smallest wardrobe I have ever experienced, it was tiny, and with the snacks attached to the shelf in there, by the time I had hung up some dresses and trousers, they were covering the snack shelf, as well as my pants being folded over at the bottom. There was nowhere to put smaller garments or to store luggage so I ended up living out of my suitcase, and being creative in using other spaces to put things like toiletries (there weren't many options). The bathroom while pokey had a big shower, but with a shower curtain (which I really detest), the toilet was kind of unbolted from the floor so moved a bit, and there were no shelves to put anything. There was a separate bidet, if you like that. For me I would have preferred the space to be used for storage. Forget a work table. Funnily enough one of my colleagues was telling me how small her room was and when I saw it, it was a comparative palace. So if you want a bit more space, make sure you go for the slightly bigger upgrade.\n\nThe bed was comfy but it was a short double, not a queen, so my feet hung over the end, and there was just enough space for one small side table next to it. The power points were in strange locations. The room was well serviced every day, and I received complimentary chocolate chip cookies every day, which was a nice treat to come back.\n\nThe air-conditioning was incredibly noisy, but needed it on during the night as the room was too stuffy. And speaking of noise, you could hear everything that went on in the corridor (people walking passed), as well as hearing people talking\/TV in rooms as you walked passed them which was a bit off-putting. The upside was that the room was not facing the road and was incredibly quiet. Overall the hotel itself was quiet and didn't disturb my sleep.\n\nThe hotel is marketed as \"boutique\" and I think they have the right intention. While a little shabby and strangely laid out, the room decor had a cool vibe, the linens were nice and the free toiletries were all good quality. If you're in a hurry, the lift is ancient and slow, and one was frequently being worked on when the other was (thankfully) going.\n\nThe hotel guide was out of date (in room dining menu was not correct) however the food was from the attached DB Bistro Moderne restaurant - which was excellent. Typically, breakfast was expensive and you're better off going to the diner just down the road or get great coffee from the coffee shop across the street. However, for dinner, the restaurant was one of the best restaurants I have ever been to attached to a hotel, and stand-alone an excellent restaurant. Really fantastic food. A great wine list, with an enthusiastic and helpful Sommelier, and we had brilliant service. A definite recommend if you want to spend the money on a nice dinner. Also a good bar if you just want to go in for a drink (good cocktails).\n\nSo you might think a lot of what I've mentioned above was negative, but really they were little things, and once I was used to my setup I really had a good stay for the limited time I was actually using my room. I felt safe, great location, good service, and if you just want a bed to rest after a exploring the city, then I would recommend the hotel.","travelDate":"2012-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Most important to me when booking was cleanliness and location - i wasn't disappointed.  The majority of the reviews for this hotel were positive, with a lot of comments about the small rooms.   We went expecting something very small, but we were pleasantly surprised.  I was traveling with my 4 teenagers and I can say we found the size just right given that we didn't spend a lot of time in the room - it was small but they made the most of the space.  Big plus for my taste - no carpet!!  That was great for cleanliness.  The bathroom was large with a big shower.  The staff was wonderful.  We arrived early and they checked our bags so that we could head out and enjoy the city until our room was ready.  They even took my cell number to call when the room was ready.  We got the same treatment on our way out - we checked out and they stored our luggage until we were ready for a pick-up at the hotel many hours after our check out.  The best chocolate chip cookies were waiting for us each night when we returned to the room - what a great touch to make you feel welcome.  There were videos to borrow from the front desk if you have time.  The location was wonderful - between 5th and 6th avenue - minutes to Times Square and the Toys R Us.  Keep your eye out for the door when you are looking for the hotel - it's easy to miss.  Just can't say enough about the staff, the hotel and the room.   Staying at City Club Hotel was wonderful.  Go in knowing the rooms are on the smaller side and you will see that the hotel is BIG on service.  We were on the second floor above the restaurant - no problems with noise at all - we slept great.

Squeezed between two larger hotels, and with the absence of the brown \"CC\" awning that I had seen in the photos, the only things that identified the presence of the hotel was the square nameplate on the wall and a glass door.\n\nThe petite room is exactly what the name implies, so there were no surprises in that regard.  The bathroom, however, took up a third of the whole room, which was great.  The flat screen TV was huge, and the closet was one of the smallest I've ever seen, so the room had a strange disproportionate feeling to it, but since the building is over a hundred years old I'm sure they did the best with what they had to work with.  The stifling heat outside meant that the air conditioning had to work pretty much non-stop, but the bed was really comfortable.  My room was facing the back, so there's not much to see except the back of another old building.  But I didn't spend that much time in the room anyway so that wasn't a big deal.\n\nThe room service comes from the adjoining restaurant, db Moderne Bistro.  I ordered dinner on my first night and it was great having restaurant quality food in my room.

The location is definitely walking distance to many points of interest for tourists like Times Square, Rockafeller Center, Grand Central Station, to name a few.  \n\nThere were five of us and the room we booked had 2 full size beds and a day bed, so no one had to sleep on the floor or a cot, which was one of the main reasons why we booked the hotel.

After a day of sightseeing, we returned to the room to find the ipad was missing.  We searched every corner of the room and everyone's luggage but no luck finding it.  She called the front desk and reported the missing item, and soon after 2 men knocked on the door to investigate the room and question my friend with the missing ipad.  They left telling us that this \"wasn't the first time this has happened\" and they would speak with the cleaning staff and check the security cameras.  They also said that it's their policy that cleaning staff never touches the guests' belongings, including their luggage.  Yes, we assume that is their policy, doesn't mean it can't be broken...\n\nAfter some back and forth between my friend and the hotel staff on duty, she requested to speak to the manager.  Because it was a wknd the manager was not there but would give her a call on Monday.

We had booked 2 rooms, next to each other, and one of them smelled distinctly of old smoke. We noticed it every time we returned to the room.\n\nWe had booked the suites and our rooms were small-ish, bathrooms were large in comparison, which was odd.

Which I must say we enjoyed.\n\nThe elevators or at least one of them was a little temperamental too. Seemed to want to go in the wrong direction half of the time! And they were both HOT! Keep in mind it was around 30 or so degrees C when we were there.\n\nRooms had air-con, one of our rooms was always too cold and no way to adjust it down no matter what we tried, the other was a touch too warm.

It was a perfect fit for us because we were able to stay in a queen luxe room which had a very comfortable queen size bed and also a single \"day bed\" for our son.  Most NYC hotels only offer 2 \"double beds\" so this was a benefit for us.  A good nights sleep is very important after walking the city all day and then getting up the next day to do it all over again!  The room was quite small, but the bathroom was huge! Nice amenities, and closet and mini bar were hidden behind the wall! ( our 14 year old thought that was so cool! )  I have to say, it was a nice change from our usual \"Marriott\" kind of hotel room.  It enhanced the whole NYC experience!  We did have one problem though. Our air conditioning broke on the second night, and the staff was there with a fan but couldn't do anything about it until the next day, and the hotel was completely booked!  Luckily the temp was ok.  The fan helped,  and by the time we arrived back in our room the following day it was working again.

Although we didn't have a chance to eat at DB Bistro Moderne the restaurant on the street level of the hotel, it had come highly recommended by a friend of ours.\n\nWe loved the City Club Hotel and would definitely return the next time we're in NYC.","travelDate":"2011-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel was recommended to me by my brother, who stays here frequently.  Still, I was surprised to step off the street into this sort of large hallway that passes for the lobby.  At the end of the lobby\/hallway is the reception desk - stepping up to reception feels more like buying a ticket than checking in to a hotel - but then you get your key and around the corner you go to the elevators and up to where a normal-sized hotel awaits you!  Pretty neat!  The room was nicely appointed, the bathroom marbled to a fare-thee-well.  This is an efficient, high standard urban bolt hole and I liked it a lot.","travelDate":"2010-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I've had frequent stays at the Sofitel, which I love, but a great deal on Expedia made me decide to try the City Club. \nThe staff is professional, discreet, very pleasant and helpful. They are the hotel's biggest asset. I had opted for a queen room, as a reviewer suggested those rooms faced the street with good daylight.  Mine did not.  Both windows faced brick walls and a small alley. The room is small, ok for one person, two would make it very tight, and the television is small and old fashioned, no flat screens here! The bed linens were a good quality, and the bathroom of  black marble contained an exceptionally large shower (where a wonderful soaking tub could have been!). The bed was not firm, and actually sagged a bit in the middle. Time to replace it!  The free WIFI was a plus, I had not difficulty with it in my location, and my ATT cell phone had decent reception.\nThe big plus for the City Club is you can  order room service from the menu of DB Bistro Moderne, next door.  Which I did, and was served by the course, as requested.  \nAnd the room was very clean, and small can be cozy. And did I say that the staff is wonderful?\nBut if you do not like very dark \"moody\" corridors in hotels, (poor night vision need not stay here), and you want spacious and airy, don't consider City Club. BUT  if service, and location are important, do consider this more than adequate boutique style hotel. I will probably try it again for another stay with a specific request for a front facing room, just because the staff is that  great.","travelDate":"2011-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I decided to return to see if my experience could be replicated.  It was not, it was exceeded!!!  As usual the doorman was ready with both assistance with luggage and advice about things to do.  I booked late and through a third party site, during a very busy time in NY.  While I was prepared for a broom closet with a bed, I was upgraded without request upon arrival.  Later in my stay I met the manager who seemed genuinely welcoming which seems almost surreal in NY.   I had to come back to the city the following week, and mentioned this to the manager as I was checking out.  I had checked the 3rd party site, but the City Club wasn't showing any availability.  Not only did the manager secure a room for me, but also at an extremely competitive price.  He also gave me his card.  I shot him an email the next week to inform him of my arrival time and BOOM.  Another upgrade, this time to the two story suite.  All I can say is don't die and go to heaven without staying in one of these unique rooms which bring the original crown molding casts into arms reach, boast two story windows, and a spiral staircase that is ultra hip....amazing, and would be well worth the standard suite price.  Let me give 2 more quick asides about this place.  1.  I was running late when i realized that I had forgotten a toiletry item.  A call down to the front desk rendered a knock on my door within 2 minutes - this is the advantage of a truly boutique hotel.  Larger 5 star properties would be hard pressed to match that response time.  2.  The front desk called to tell me that my driver had arrived.  Then a few seconds later called back to inform me that it had begun to rain lightly and I should be sure to bring my courtesy umbrella from the room.  The City Club is still in a great central location, with great design, and amenities, but it continues to shine because of the great service from the staff top to bottom.  My wife wants to see the Yankee's in the playoff's for our Anniversary.  Anybody wanna guess where we'll be staying?  \nCheers","travelDate":"2011-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Judged against other mid-town, theater-district hotels, the City Club Hotel is a good, functional choice.  Positives: The excellent location on 44th Street's \"club row\" right between the venerable Algonquin and Iroquois Hotels; a wonderfully helpful front-desk staff; reasonably spacious rooms (by New York bed-in-a-closet standards); good bedding; excellent, flexible lighting; two glorious chocolate-swirl cookies with the turn-down service (one of the very few times I've been impressed by such \"freebie\" snacks); thorough cleanliness; and no sign of bedbugs (a serious problem in Manhattan today).  The negatives: Rooms need refreshing (getting just a bit tatty here and there); gloomy, horror-movie-dark hallways; and, despite trading on the location in the former City Club, there's no trace of the old club atmosphere or interior architecture.  The rack-rate can stun out-of-towners, but it's the best deal on this still-distinguished block.  Bottom line: I would stay here again--not least, thanks to the great front-desk staff.","travelDate":"2011-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I had cancelled at The Mansfield down the street because of poor reviews about the size of the rooms!  Lord knows how small they must be.  For example, the foot of the king bed is TWO feet from the wall.  I literally had to walk sideways in order to get from one side of the bed to the other.  The \"separate sitting area\" served as the only place to put our luggage.  There is no drawer space for those anticipating a longer stay, and the closet is so small that we ended up hanging most of our clothes from the shelf over the seating area.  Elsewhere you'll read reviews about the TV behind a mirror.  Well, there's a reason.  There isn't enough space in the room to have a TV on a stand or even to hang a flat screen on the wall.  Nice idea for space saving.  Best I can tell from peering through the mirror it also is an excuse for providing nothing more than an antiquated CRT TV instead of the flat screen that is now standard fare in even most Hampton Inns.  Here's my suggestion.  I got a peak at a queen room, and it seemed bigger, but if you want a king size bed either demand (i.e. a request won't do!!) a guaranteed King Luxe on the street side of the hotel (which also presumably includes some light from outside) or stay elsewhere (unless you like accommodations like the cabin on a boat) and come to db Moderne bistro to eat.","travelDate":"2011-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I tend to stay at upscale hotels on my own dime (ritz \/ W \/ upscale boutique hotels) and when I travel for work, I am limited by expense restraints. Which is how I first ended up finding this place. Since it's not a 'known' chain, I wasn't sure what I was going to find. What I love best about this place: 1) The service - Kelsey at the front desk person has literally been there every time I arrive - which makes this place feel more B&B, less impersonal chain hotel. Pple that work here start with \"yes\", do what they can to accomodate, and overall really seem to love what they do 2) warm chocoloate chip cookies on your bed at night: I mean, every hotel should do this. Amazing. 3) decor - sleek, mod decor and unique touches (interesting books) make each room slightly different. If you are not from NY, you may say the rooms are small, which some are, but honestly, you aren't spending that much time in the room so it doesn't really matter that much. 4) DB Bistro Moderne downstairs - super good restaurant which is sister to well known super upsacale Daniel, also in NYC. the salmon tartare is to die for. I don't usually write reviews btw. I just really love this place. I am willing to give up starwood points for thsi place, which is saying a LOT.","travelDate":"2011-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The building next door is super quiet, and the street is not a busy street at nights. You won't hear anything from the outside.\n\n2) Clean\nDefinitely one of the more modern hotels at this price range. The rooms were clean, and the bathrooms well maintained (except for 1 thing, I'll mention in the cons)\n\n3) Courteous staff\nThe front desk was nice, usually has a door man there to open the door for you in the mornings, will hold luggage for you if you need them to on day of checkout. They also drop off fresh baked chocolate chip cookies around 5-6pm each day!\n\n4) Size\nI list this under pros even though I am writing about it being small. Reason being is that you're not going to find a BIG hotel room in this area at this price range.  True, people can whine and complain that the room is small, but try and find a bigger room that has all the other advantages (listed above) at this price range, you can't.\n\nCons:\n1) Clean: Back on the topic, I did notice that the spout in the shower had some black stuff near the holes. Not a dealbreaker, but a little WD40 would do wonders! City Club Hotel staff, read this!","travelDate":"2011-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I really liked how the staff was attentive but not overbearing, they were just great! and I loved the little \"party closet\" that's stocked with everything a gal would need!","travelDate":"2011-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

When we arrived we were given the keys to  our room.  We walked into our room and it was the strongest smell I have ever encountered.  I thought is was fresh paint.  We went down to the desk to change rooms and they gave us another key. That room - even though it was labeled as a non smoking room, wreaked of smoke.  It was shockingly bad.We went back down to the desk only to request yet another room they told us that was all they had.  We went back to the room I thought was wet paint.  I took someone from the hotel desk to ask what it was , they said it smelled like brass polish.  We opened the windows that overlooked a nasty ally with trashcans and went out for an hour or so to let the room air out.  It didn't get much better.   Don't know what it was but it made me really sick to my stomach.  The appearance of the room was fine but I think they had 3\/4 beds because I am 5'6\" and my feet hung off the bed from ankles down.  Not comfortable.  I did have to catch a cab in the evening when it was raining and a fellow hailed be a cab and held an umbrella over my head when I got in.  That was nice.","travelDate":"2011-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Big choc chip cookies and morning paper at the door were a surprise bonus. Staff were great, always greeted you when you came in and were helpful with advice on lots of things. More friendly and forthcoming than most NY hotel staff.  Good value especially when we got a free upgrade from a petite room.  Central location with several restaurants nearby. No tea\/coffee making in room, but that's something all Australians expect in a hotel and you rarely get in NY.","travelDate":"2011-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room is small, but it has a small balcony and the bathroom decoration is pretty nice. Amenities from CO Bigelow and free Dean & Delluca\u00b4s cookies every night.

When we arrived there had been a mistake in my reservation (I had cancelled the first day by phone, but made the original reservation online).  They coudln't find me in the system, but the person at the front desk (Lauren) kept trying different things, and eventually she found it. Unfortuately our Double Double room had already be taken by someone else, so Lauren immediately upgraded us to the 2-floor suite.  We didnt' have to ask or push for anything, she just kept working until she found a good solution for us. The rooms were wonderful and quite \"homey\" in an urban way.  It felt like we had moved to NYC for a few days.  We are planning on staying there again when we go back this summer.","travelDate":"2011-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

With about 65 rooms, the hotel itself is small and quite intimate; it does show its past as a men's club in the rather dark hallways and elevators, though my room was light and bright. I was lucky enough to be offered an upgrade so my room, which overlooked 45th St, was luxuriously spacious. It was also nicely laid out, comfortably appointed and immaculately clean. The bathroom was large - no tub, but a huge shower. The wireless internet worked very well and the connection was easy to establish. And yes, the chocolate chip cookies were delicious.\n\nStaff, from the manager to the reception staff to the housekeepers, couldn't have been pleasanter or more helpful. I made a number of requests and each was carried out quickly and cheerfully. When I called down on Sunday morning to ask about a Times, one of the desk people was at my door with the paper in literally two minutes.\n\nThe only disappointment was the db Bistro. While the food was certainly acceptable, I'd expected more than that given its reputation. Further, the coffee on the db Bistro room service breakfast, while hot, tasted as if it had been made much earlier in the morning and held over. But the hotel itself was terrific, and it immediately catapulted to  #1 on my fairly extensive list of favored NYC hotels.","travelDate":"2011-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

I really do like boutique hotels when done right.  However, sometimes there are little flaws and quirks that can ruin a boutique hotel experience.  All in all I would say my stay at City Club was okay.\n\nPros: (1) The modern decor was refreshing compared to some other sterile hotels; (2) great location - on a no-so busy street but close enough so that I could get everywhere that I was going very quickly; (3) very helpful front desk staff - I had them store my luggage and get it out twice and while they were a little disorganized, they were very accommodating; (4) very comfy beds; (5) delicious room service breakfast; (6) on that note, great restaurant, DB Bistro, attached to the hotel - really good food and great service; (7) turn down service with chocolate chip cookies!; (8) free internet.\n\nCons: (1) Tiniest room ever!  I mean, it is New York, so I wasn't shocked or disappointed.  I just found it comically small.  Pretty much just enough room for a bed and that was it; (2) on that note, no space to put my luggage.  Like I said before, I didn't really mind the smallness of the room, especially given that I was only staying one night, but there was literally no room to put my suitcase anywhere.  I ended up setting it on top of the air conditioner\/windowsill.  This wouldn't fly if it had been hot and I'd needed the AC.  They should really figure out a way to incorporate a luggage rack or something; (3) window that opens to the wall of the next building - why even bother having a window?  Next time I would definitely request a street-facing room and just live with the noise; (4) my room had ants on the floor.  Gross; (5) why have a bidet in such a small room?  What is the point of having THAT when you have so little space for anything else?  Remove that and put a luggage rack in the bathroom; (6) show curtain that did little to prevent water from going onto the floor.","travelDate":"2011-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
