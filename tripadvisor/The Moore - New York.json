Decent size and very clean room, particularly by NYC standards.  The patio deck we had to ourselves was really a great space with a nice view, only problem was the weather !!  Not the hotels fault.   Really a great location, super clean in the lobby, nice place to sit and have a coffee while you plan the day, and the help up front was great.   The cleaning staff was very friendly.  The maintenance guy when my wife dropped her ring down the sink was great..  Front desk with Anaise and Destiny was very, very helpful with tips on best ways to get around  and local spots for restaurants, bagels, pizza and a drink.    Place was spotless.   \n\nOne thing we really liked was the lobby was small but really useful with a coffee bar, pastries, wine\/beer, etc..   ice on command..   open 24 hours.   Much more useful and nice than a large hotel lobby or lounge space.\n\nOnly small nit was it would be nice if the rooms had a mini fridge.  You can use the fridges downstairs 24 hours but not nearly as convenient.  Other than that the room had all the necessities so you don\u2019t have to bring them from home.  \n\nThanks again to Anaise and Destiny for all the help.    We\u2019ll be back.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Moore has three key things going for it. First, location. A 10-minute walk from Penn Station and a block from two different subway lines, The Moore is also perfectly placed for exploring Chelsea and Greenwich Village. Second, the staff. From our first interaction, the staff literally could not have been more friendly and helpful. So much for the old cliche about New Yorkers being rude! Third, the rooms. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are definitely on the small side, but they are smartly furnished and perfectly designed to maximize use of every square inch of space. And we don't go to New York for the weekend to hang out in our room anyway. Our room, overlooking 22nd Street just steps from 8th Avenue, was also unbelievably quiet for a New York hotel room. Our only complaint on that front was that the other rooms' doors made a loud sound when they closed, but all of The Moore's other plusses more than made up for that.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

She acted like the cold water was the guests' fault. A simple, we are sorry would've sufficed. A few hours later, I received a message that the hotel was offering 1 glass of wine from 5 to 6pm as compensation. That is not adequate.

This was my first trip to NYC, so I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nThis hotel is a hidden gem that absolutely nails the basics. It's a small hotel, but extremely well-run and quietly luxurious (I was pleasantly surprised by the heated bathroom floors, soft sheets, and comfortable mattress). It's also super quiet - I was originally going to go with an internal-facing room, but the thick windows and blackout curtains muffled most of the morning noise (to the point where I didn't even notice). I had a 5\/5 stay here and I'll definitely be coming back for future business trips.\n\nThe location is great - some of the best restaurants in Chelsea are within a 10-15 minute walk, and there's a Brooklyn Bagel just around the corner, which I'd highly suggest checking out for breakfast. There's also a well-connected subway stop basically next to the front door - I had no problem going all over Manhattan on my days off.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Here\u2019s why\u2026","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-16","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"This is a very nice, very modern and very clean hotel which is located in a really lovely neighbourhood. \n\nI stayed at the Moore for a work project but had plenty of downtime so made the most of it. \n\nIt\u2019s so clean and the staff are lovely, it also feels really safe which is exactly what you need in NYC. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never been to NY before, some helpful things to note\u2026give this a screenshot. \n\n1. Taxis and Ubers are bloody expensive! Walk if the weathers nice, or, get the subway. The subway takes some getting used to but after a couple trips you soon get used to it. Use the maps feature on your smart phone, the iPhone one is genius. It gives you all the information you need and even tells you when to get off the subway as you have full signal on it. (Select your location and then select \u2018Public transport\u2019). \n\n2. The poverty & seriously poor health conditions means there are a lot of people on the streets, on the subways and out and about. It\u2019s a deeply upsetting sight. I say this as someone who has spent a lot of time in a lot of cities. NY is by far the worst for it (in my experience). \n\nBecause of this, there are many weird and wonderful characters constantly trying to catch your eye. If they catch your eye they\u2019ll be onto you. Money, questions and whatever else. Do your absolute best to make zero eye contact. It feels odd and rude but you\u2019re less likely to be approached or have any issues. \n\n3. Places to know about: \n\n- Times Sq is the most overrated location in NY. It\u2019s uncomfortably busy & it\u2019s full of scammers and pick pockets. Unless you\u2019re desperate to go, just avoid it. It\u2019s bloody rubbish. (If someone asks you to support them and buy a CD\u2026say NO THANK YOU).\n\n- If you want to watch Sport whilst you\u2019re there, there\u2019s and amazing place called \u2018Smithfield Hall\u2019 a 10 minute walk from the hotel. It is an amazing bar with 20+ screens and they show EVERYTHING sport related. The place is run by an Irish family and a Londoner runs the door called \u2018Fitzy\u2019. He\u2019s a lovely man who\u2019s accommodating and helpful.\n\n- If you\u2019re coming from the U.K. I can guarantee you for the first few days you will be waking up at the crack of dawn, or earlier. Not a lot is open until 10ish in New York. Chelsea Market is a 10 minute walk from the hotel and has some little cafes open for breakfast from about 08:30\/0900. It\u2019s also an amazing place for dinner in the evening, the buzz about the place is terrific.\n\nLastly, generally, the food in America isn\u2019t great. However, an Italian restaurant which is outstanding. The absolute best food I\u2019ve had in the states in all my times visiting is \u2018Salumeria Rosi\u2019 283 Amsterdam avenue. It\u2019s not cheap but it is worth it. I promise you. \n\nI hope all of that helps and you have an amazing trip. It\u2019s a bit nerve racking going to NY but it\u2019s worth it, a truly magnificent city.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

But the Moore is especially \u2018less\u2019 in room space. Small rooms are the norm in major city hotels but this one was TINY. Let\u2019s just say careful side-stepping was required to negotiate the one foot space between bed and wall without banging shins against the bed frame or shoulders against the wall mounted tv, and the desk chair could not be pulled back without colliding with another side of the bed.

After all of my reserach, we chose the Moore and were very plesed with our choice. \n\nWe were looking for a hotel in Chelsea as we wanted to walk the High Line, visit the Whitney and catch a train to Rhode Island to visit friends.  The location was perfect for us.  An easy 10 minute (or less) walk to Penn Station\/Moynihan Train Hall for the train, a few blocks to the High Line and one block to the 23rd Street Station.  The neighborhood was quiet for NYC and we felt very safe, no issues walking back at night from Korean BBQ on 32nd Street.  It's an easy walk to the Meat Packing district (don't miss Chelsea Market but go early!), Little Island and Greenwich Village, we continued down to Ground Zero.\n\nThe first night we ate at Dim Sum Chelsea right across the street which was fantastic!  Gristede's (a grocery store) is right next to the Moore, convenient if you want to grab some snacks\/drinks (although only beer, no wine) and for a classic NY breakfast, we highly recommend Zucker's Bagels just across the street.  My husband also enjoyed the option of grabbing an early morning coffee in the Moore Lobby.  The cups provided were too small for my required large morning breakfast tea dose but it was easy to find it at one of the two Starbucks within two blocks either direction on 8th. \n\nThe Moore staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. As many reviewers have noted, the rooms are small.  We booked a queen room with a view which provided some nice light for the small room which we found otherwise somewhat dimly lighted.  The room was clean and functional, with an outlet\/USB charger on each side of the bed. There was a desk across the length of the window wall  but the desk lamp had no easily discernable switch (so never worked for us ) and there was no easily visible outlet for a laptop, which was odd for a desk area.  We found the outlet after getting down on our knees and looking underneath the desk behind the curtain.  \n\nThere was limited room around each side of the bed and the bathroom, while very mordern and clean, was small as well, limited \/no space to put your toiletries\/clothes.  Lighting was somewhat dim with no lighting option on the mirror...not an issue for us.  We found the bed a bit small for a queen (I'm 5' 11 and my husband is 6' 2) as our feet hung off the end. But it was firm and comfortable with firm pillows.\n\nAs there was no room to lounge other than the bed, we made use of the cheerful lobby and there was always plenty of space at the tables, chairs and sofas even with the other guests.  We didn't check out the rooftop but am sure that would be a lovely place to lounge in good weather.  As we had a full schedule to cover in three days, we hadn't expected to hang out in our room so the space was fine for our needs.  For a longer stay or if you need to lounge a bit in your room you'd probably want a larger room with a sofa\/chair. \n\nBottom line for us is that It's a great boutique hotel, safe area, reasonable price for the area, easy walking distance to many things and great food options nearby.  We'd defintely stay at the Moore again.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Online check-in was easy and smooth. Upon arrival, the room felt quite small (we were in room 407, we booked an \u201caccessible queen\u201d) but once we stashed our suitcases under the bed (a convenient feature), the room felt less tiny. Though the bed did not seem to be queen-sized\u2026it felt more like a full. We asked for a tea kettle, so we were able to make hot drinks in our room (I recommend traveling with a collapsible  pour-over coffeemaker if you need coffee as soon as you wake up), but the coffee & beer and wine bar downstairs was perfectly convenient. The elevator could be heard from our room, but it was not terribly loud, if you are a light sleeper, earplugs should take care of that problem. The gym was nicely equipped for weight training or cardio workouts. For the deal we got, I think the Moore was super convenient and comfortable and we appreciated the simple decor and modern design touches. I think if I were on a work trip, it would be 10\/10, though a couple small surfaces would improve the space.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was on the 4th floor. \n\nAnyway, it's a great little hotel! Good location. Super clean, fixtures and everything look brand new. Loved that they had a coffee bar and pastries in the lobby in the mornings, plus a large table, chairs, and couches so you can work from there if you wanted to. \n\nStaff was really friendly and helpful. The front desk is staffed 24\/7. \n\nJust note that the rooms are very small. Think Tokyo small. When I first walked into my room, the front door blocked the entrance to the bathroom so I was like, wait...is there no bathroom??? Plus the bed was *right* there once I walked in. So yes, small. Once I shut the door, I saw the bathroom, which is pretty good-sized!\n\nBed was comfortable, linens were comfortable. Great water pressure in the shower. I'm thinking really hard about something to complain about, and honestly, nothing comes to mind. I do recommend bringing earplugs if you're a light sleeper though. Because the rooms are so small (or the walls are thin), you can def hear your neighbor. I was waiting for the elevator in the hallway and a woman was on a call in her room, and I heard every word she said, very clearly. I bring earplugs with me when I travel, and I slept fine. \n\nTL;DR: If you're looking for a hotel where you could hang out in your room for hours on end, The Moore likely isn't the best choice. But if you're in the city for work or sightseeing and won't be spending much time in your room, it's a great choice. ","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Staff were generally friendly and helpful. Very calming stylish decor on the lobby where they offered coffee for a fairly reasonable price. Nice that they had a small gym too. The rooftop is a great asset but is under-utilised and seems like a forgotten area of the hotel, contrary to the social media images. On the few occasions we went up it was empty and felt a bit eerie. There is a bar, which isn't stocked or staffed.\n\nAs for the room - it was too small. My feet were hanging off the bed and we had to tiptoe around our cases due to lack of floor space. Within 5 minutes of coming into the room it turned into a sweatbox due to the small space. The only alternative was to put the A\/C on which then made it freezing. On the plus side we didn't have any problems with noise from other guests.\n\nAnother disappointment was the area. I appreciate this isn't the doing of the hotel but I just didn't feel entirely comfortable. 22nd is in the middle of Chelsea which still has that dodgy vibe that carries down from the Penn Station area. I think Chelsea is way overrated in general. There were a number of suspicious characters hanging around the corner from the front door. One morning we witnessed some guy abusing and threatening to beat up his girlfriend a few blocks uptown from the hotel. We also saw another tourist being harassed by a street hustler outside Joe's Pizza, which is a 2minute walk from the hotel. It was only a few blocks further towards Greenwich Village that the area felt safer. Not necessarily the hotel's fault but still worth bearing in mind.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent experience. Nothing more. We had looked at a lot of the social media uploads by the hotel prior to arriving. If I'm being honest we almost felt catfished, but not quite.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Chelsea is a great neighborhood, and the Moore is located on a classic, tree-lined side street.  Super close to the Highline and the subway.\n\nFriendly staff that were welcoming and warm.  Young and hip atmosphere, with a stylish and small lobby, serving coffee and wine. My room had a view of the Empire State Building.  Small and cozy, it was plenty of space for one.  But, with a sliding door to the bathroom at the foot of the bed, it would be a little too intimate for two.\n\nLGBTQ friendly.  \n\nVerdict: Highly recommended for solo travelers looking for a good value in a stylish, boutique hotel.  The suite would be a great choice for couples or those able to spend a little more for more space, a balcony, and bigger views.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I can only say that the staff--those lovely people--made this hotel stand out from all the other cool, dark interior, hip boutique hotels. Christina who seemed to know everything was amazing & charming & her goal is always to make you feel warm & welcomed. The rooms are tiny--I mean there is no room to exercise & your neighbors are close (& some are loud) BUT the beds are super comfortable and the bathroom stocked with brand toiletries & excellent showers & frette bathrobes. The Chelsea location is perfect. The public spaces make this hotel. There's a rooftop deck and a lounge-like lobby with a coffee\/wine bar and a large gathering table and two curving velvet couches. I met my friends in the lobby that last morning for coffee before I caught the Acela (10 blocks up 8th Ave) and they, born & bred New Yorkers both, kept asking how I found this charming place. Trust me--cosy, warm, welcoming with a dash of hip and personality plus! It's the people who make this place worth it.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

It is such a beautifully designed hotel and the atmosphere was warm and friendly thanks to the staff and the special touches.   Our group had two rooms - a view queen and a corner queen.  Both rooms were sophisticated and impeccably clean (seriously, these rooms were so clean and well cared for!)   As is the case in most of NYC, the rooms are smallish  but these were both cleverly appointed with wardrobes, a full desk, and nicely sized bathrooms.  We had plenty of storage for four adults on a four day trip!  We didn't hear a peep from our neighbors at night and the beds were very comfortable.    The rooftop bar and the lobby were charming and so welcoming - we spent hours hanging out in both areas making our plans over  glasses of wine and delicious americanos.  Room service was easy with a  wonderful collaboration for food delivery that had great food.  We ordered a couple of times through their service and it was fast & easy.   Chelsea is a great neighborhood with plenty to see and easy access to all parts of Manhattan.   The clincher for us, and the reason we will definitely go back  is the staff - everyone was so friendly and the recommendations from the front of house team were fantastic. Every place they suggested was a win - from local spots right around the corner to across town.  They have a genuine love for the city that is infectious :)   Thank you for everything - we are already planning our next visit back to the Moore!","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

This hotel is perfect!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-10-30","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"If you\u2019re looking to get around all of Manhattan, this hotel is in the absolute perfect spot. It was so convenient to get to and from the airport because it is right by the subway E train, (which also takes you all over Manhattan! We used it a bunch, we didn\u2019t have to take a single taxi or Uber which saved us a ton of money) and the hotel was also right by the High Line, the path along the pier, and is a short walk to Times Square but far enough away where you get a neighborhood feel and not a tourist one. My boyfriend and I seriously were able to cover the entire island in 3 days thanks to the perfect location. We walked basically everywhere and took the train home in the evenings. It has a lot of nightlife within walking distance (Tao, PHD, Somewhere Nowhere, 1OAK, and more are all within 10 minute walking distance) but you didn\u2019t get loud and drunk people nearby. Seriously can\u2019t rave enough about the location.\n\nThe rooms are small but that\u2019s what you get in New York\u2026 I don\u2019t know why people would expect anything different. The rooms are super cute though!!! Updated with SUPER cozy beds and really fancy showers! The rooftop area and the little coffee shop downstairs is awesome to have to!\n\nLastly, everyone says New Yorkers are mean but the staff here totally proved that incorrect. Christina in particular was beyond helpful and an absolute riot\u2014my boyfriend and I loved her! Seriously, they did everything to make you feel welcome and right at home. Good vibes all around. \n\nEverything about our stay was amazing. There\u2019s no point in staying anywhere else because this hotel is perfect.

Everyone we encountered could not have been more friendly and willing to help in any way (shout out to Christina for her recommendations and enthusiasm). One caveat, the rooms are small; but who goes to NYC to hang out in their room. Great bed and great shower and don\u2019t miss the rooftop space for decompressing from your city activities.
