Be sure to let them know you\u2019re staying at Sohotel to get a discounted price. The location was perfect we\u2019re in the middle of Little Italy and China Town with easy access to the subway (the boys loved that).The only reason I gave this a 4 was because the tiles in the bathroom had some leftover hair from previous stay but other than that the bathroom was clean and updated.

It seems all NYC hotels are charging \u2018resort\u2019 fees - so I suggest that you be sure to look at the total charges carefully before booking - thankfully, the hotel website and most booking sites seem to be clear about any added fees \u2013 if we pay attention.\n\nThe decor at Sohotel is colorful, fun and funky - unless you are craving brand new \u2013 (there are several newer hotels in the area, some quite trendy!) \u2013 this hotel has a warm, boho feel that is homier than a big chain \u2013 if you aren\u2019t going to miss the points you may earn with a big chain, this is a nice alternative.\n\nWe enjoyed the complimentary coffee and hot water\/tea each morning- although the hotel website mentions water availability in the lobby - be sure to ask one of the very friendly staff members \u2013 there is no water dispenser set out in the lobby after the coffee and tea are removed. \n\nThe bed was quite comfortable, there was a safe in the room and the ceiling fan and temperature controls all worked well.\nC.O. Bigelow shampoo, conditioner and shower gel available in the bathroom were all very nice \u2013 the lavender mint scent is subtle, herbal-fresh without being overpowering \u2013 I would have purchased these if they were available! (C.O. Bigelow is a classic NYC pharmacy - but it's not close to the hotel).\n\nI feel I should mention that the Standard Queen room was a bit cramped \u2013 we felt we got a decent deal and were ok with it \u2013 but if that\u2019s an issue I\u2019d advise booking a bigger room. From the website I gather the premium rooms have refrigerators \u2013 I would have loved a hot water kettle right in the room \u2013 but that\u2019s down to my endless tea habit.\n\nThe location is very convenient to multiple subway lines \u2013 in good weather the walk from the hotel\u2019s edge of East Village\/NoLita location to SoHo and even Chelsea is enjoyable. We loved that many really nice plant-based restaurants abound in the area and there is a Whole Foods within easy walking distance that is open until 10pm.\n\nAlthough check-in times are listed as 4pm - it seems post-pandemic, check-in times have shifted later from the usual pre-pandemic 3pm \u2013 the hotel sent an email of the morning of our stay requesting our estimated arrival and we were able to check in at 3 \u2013 which we really appreciated. Due to helpful staff, we were able to check out at 11:30 am instead of the stated 11:00 am checkout time at no charge. We were also offered free luggage storage on check-out - which we didn\u2019t need \u2013 but it was nice to have the offer. Overall, the very friendly and accommodating staff helped to make our visit enjoyable.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is perfect in a very lively, cool neighborhood with many shops and restaurants and a 2-minute walk from the metro. The size of the room (for 5 people) was ok. In the morning there is coffee and tea ready opposite the checkin, not the tastiest coffee but it is the service that counts. I don't know if I would book it again, price\/quality ratio was ok, but the inconveniences such as not being clean and noise pollution are disturbing. The beds were ok.\n\nAs a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children aged 14, 10 and 6), we were allocated room 210. This room is on the first floor behind the reception as there is a Mexican restaurant on the ground floor. The view from room 210 is a messy courtyard with a gigantic air purification plant that runs 24\/7 and therefore makes continuous noise. The bathroom had not been cleaned properly as there was still hair in the bath\/shower from previous visitors and the TV did not work properly because it froze every time. Went to reception with these complaints and we were assigned the room directly opposite, room 208. This had a great view of the street side, but also the noise from the street and from the noisy Mexican restaurant below, which later in the evening turned into bar\/caf\u00e9 with loud music until 3am. What was also very annoying, the radiator in room 208 starts whistling 4\/5 times a night because it needs to get rid of its air, this is so loud that it wakes you up, especially because it is next to your bed! I reported this to reception but they said there was nothing they could do about it and it was normal. We had no problems with this in room 210. The power of the shower jet is mediocre and the lack of heating in the bathroom is also a downside.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms are nothing like the communal funky pictures, no wardrobe a rail on wall so clothes rub against brick work, paint  coming off walls The curtains in the room don\u2019t fit and therefore sunlight comes through onto your face as sun comes up as the top of the bed is directly under.  No yea or coffee in room , no room service unless specifically requested.But our main issue was the broken sleep due to the fire alarms, our first night we were woken in the middle of the night, we were confused and scared , there wasn\u2019t an announcement telling us it was a false alarm so my daughter started to panic. It took far too long for everyone to be told. By this time my daughter and I were unable to get back to sleep so we were tired for our days sightseeing. The next night we were asleep when around midnight the same happened again, we ran into the hall along with other guests again no one seemed to know what to do as we were not being informed, several minutes of confusion took place before we were informed it was another alarm. Why this wasn\u2019t fixed after the first I don\u2019t know? Again my daughter was apprehensive about sleeping and I couldnt get back off worrying about if it should go off again and the lack of direction, again lack of sleep had an adverse effect on our sightseeing.

First, at 350$\/night (excluding taxes!) this place is a total rip-off. Second, they don't have an elevator, nor any accommodations of people with disabilities. The rooms are dirty, the beds have hard mattresses and bad-smelling pillows. The bath tub and the shower head were both in a poor condition - we reduced the number of showers taken in that place to minimum just to stay away from the shower. The location is very dirty and with plenty of homeless people around - especially in the evening. At 1 a.m. on Saturday morning we got a street gang of drummers making a ton of noise just under our window - obviously with the intent to wake up the hotel guests. No one from the hotel has done anything about it. We called the police but eventually they left (about 30 min later) before the police arrived at the place.

Very weird.\nRoom was very quiet and blocked out NYC outdoor noise which was awesome but all this was ruined by the obnoxiously loud housekeeping. At 7:00 AM, we heard doors slamming and literal stomping on the floor above us, which may have been guests? Hotels should enforce quiet hours until a certain time... After about an hour of LOUD stomping of boots or heels above us and constant doors creaking open and slammed closed, I realized it was housekeeping moving around. I tried to sleep-in since we had a late night but from 7:00 AM till 9:30 AM, it was just so loud. I could hear yelling and it was definitely not guests, but workers. So ridiculous! I'm dying to come back to the wonderful hotel but only when the rates are low because the noise is just so loud so early in the morning.\nCheck-out the next morning was a little hectic. Lobby was packed with people and luggage. I wish the staff directed the traffic better and let people know where to stand and wait to check-out and to store luggage. There were issues with the guests getting help before me - one guest was rude to the staff and acting very entitled, then the next guest had a language barrier issues, so by the time it was my turn to check-out the front desk attendant was clearly overhwhelmed and a little irritated. She quickly recovered and ended up helping with  a smile in the end and got me checked out very quickly.

The lighting was terrible both in the room and in the bathroom. No phone in the room to contact the front desk to speak to anyone about the major problem, which was the size of the bed. It was a full\/double bed NOT a queen. We spoke to them twice before leaving for the evening and got the run around. They said they do not have any doubles only queens and kings but there were no available rooms to switch.\nThey said they would send housekeeping to check (in the morning). We measured the bed and showed the manager - Donelle- a picture of me laying on the bed with my shins hanging over the edge and I am 5'1\". My husband is 6'2\" so it was a very uncomfortable night. Donelle said that the mattress supplier was at fault during the pandemic for the size. She said they would be correcting this in the future. The truth is that a queen bed will not fit in the room. The length will not allow passage around the end of the bed. It is barely passable now with under 2 feet. In the meantime the website has only queen and king beds listed as options. Buyer beware.

Also prices of the rooms were reasonable.  It is indeed a charming building with the brick stone walls and pillars and the old wooden floors with rugs on it. So far so good. Then the rooms. We have stayed in many NYC hotels and we know the rooms are usually small. The standard queen room in the Sohotel is no exception. The size of the room is the size of the queens bed plus about 2 feet at each side of the bed and perhaps  2.5 ft at the foot end. The surprise was the bathroom. The bathroom itself was very tiny, the shower in it the smallest I have ever seen. The recess with the toilet would have made a nice towel cupboard but was even for us, \u201cnot so big\u201d people, tight. But everything worked notwithstanding it was all a bit outdated. \nThe room had a well working ac unit almost on the floor at the foot end of the bed so I needed to keep my feet covered. Also there was a tv. No unnecessary extra\u2019s. \nAll in all it was not bad but for us it has nothing to come back for. For those who do want to try a queen room in the Sohotel we recommend that you book a room for three people. They are about the same price and at have a slightly bigger bathroom (shower in bathtub) and some space to move around.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Drawbacks for the high maintenance traveler would be: thin walls, sub par pillows, small room and bathroom(it's Manhattan and an old building that should be expected), lack of a hotel bar, the stairs, large king side bed was overly springy, no true closet and lack of views from the rooms.

I was looking for a different part of town to explore. The advertisement I read for the Sohotel seemed interesting. Everyone at the hotel went out of their way to be of assistance to me and my family. The room is large by Manhattan standards and attractive. The floor of the bathroom is heated, which I loved. The mattress was very comfortable and accommodating.\n The immediate neighborhood , historically industrial, now has coffee shops and an abundance of excellent restaurants. It is a short walk to the Tenement Museum and the New Museum. It's it's a stones throw from Chinatown and what was historically Little Italy. It is a short walk to Canal and a slightly longer lot walk to Houston.  For other sites the subway is easily accessible with a short walk in any direction. You can eat, and go to a pretty good neighborhood bar, without really leaving the building.\nA couple of small things to consider-1) there was no phone or clock in the room. In a world where there were four cell phones in my room that was hardly a problem, it just seemed unusual.\n2) There was a refrigerator, but no microwave. I don't need a refrigerator or a microwave in my hotel room in New York. The fact that there was one without the other, however,  just seemed a little strange. 3) Due to the historic nature of the hotel ,there is no elevator. We were three flights of stairs up. It was not a huge problem just something that you need to be aware of. They graciously offered to carry all of our suitcases up and down for us. There  is an accommodating staff. I have no doubt had we have known of the lack of elevator when we made our reservation, they would have placed us on a lower floor.  I have  strayed all over Manhattan in the the last 40 years.

I checked in to my room. I left for 2 hours for a meeting downtown when I came back my entire room was under water. Water was pouring from the ceiling! Some of my luggages got wet on the floor. My computer was on the desk, I got lucky enough to arrive after 2 hours and not 3 hours later I would have lost my computer....! When I realized what happened I packed my belongings urgently and left the room to tell the team about the terrible incident. But while arriving at the desk the same lady was alone with lines of clients, I had to interrupt her as the water was running in the hallway but it didn't seem to worry her. She eventually send someone to take a look and they came back 20 min later. Not feeling so worry about it, replying that it can happen from time to time when someone is leaving the bath running upstairs, really???\nThen they rebook me to another room much smaller, I had to go there with all my luggages without help (did I tell you that they do not have elevators?) when I came back questioning the room as I didn't even have a place to position my computer (it was a bed and a wall..) the lady told me that I was too shaky so she just relocated me fast somewhere... honestly this is the worst experience I had in my entire life and I am travelling weekly to hotels...

The receptionist was helpful about my being early for checkin.  I requested to stay on the 2nd floor, and when I returned, my bags were already in the room.\n\nThe room was small, the bathroom quite compact, the decor was fun.  Plusses:  ceiling fan, firm mattress, clean room.  Things I expected that weren't there:  coffee maker; closet (there was a pipe on the wall near the door, with hangers overlapping); someplace to open my suitcase (I used one of the two bedside tables, since I was traveling alone) or to store clothing (there was a long narrow shelf table, but the single drawer in the room was the under-shelf safe); a chair (there was a stool).  Because of COVID, there was no daily room cleaning, though I was told to ask the desk for whatever I needed.  I was too preoccupied to ask for a coffee maker, but I think that they meant bathroom amenities.\n\nThe bathroom came with 2 sets of comfortable towels, on the one towel rack, and soap, plus three dispensers in the little shower (shampoo, body wash, conditioner), all scented with peppermint and lavender.  \n\nI was very tired when I slept there, so the noise of the steam pipes and perhaps traces of music from a restaurant or bar below didn't bother me.  I could clearly hear conversations and footsteps from the hall in the morning.  \n\nI've walked by and admired the lobby in the past, but didn't end up spending time there on this trip, because COVID and because it wasn't a leisurely trip.  Perhaps the lack of a comfortable chair in the room would be compensated for by the lobby, in a non-pandemic time.  Similarly, I do not fault them for lack of daily room-cleaning.  The bed was easily made.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

There isn't an elevator (which we were aware of) and they will carry your luggage up to your room.  We had 2 different type of rooms.  My daughters room was \"Deluxe\" and I upgraded to the premium.  The Deluxe was literally right next door to the front desk.  She could hear every person checking in . Not just noise, but the entire conversations.  I can't imagine where they put the folks who opt for the \"Standard\" room.  The \"Premium\" is on the 4th floor (remember: NO elevator :)  The room was nice and probably renovated more recently, but the mirror was cracked, the window wouldn't lock and stay shut and the TV kept losing sound.  The TV issue was a connection issue, not TV specific.  The biggest issue at this hotel.. NO COFFEE!  It's seems absurd that it's not provided anywhere in the hotel.  If you don't want to put coffee makers in the room, at least serve it in the lobby.  The closet place to buy coffee was the next block (not far) but they don't open until 8:00 a.m.  Just seems like a weird thing to skimp on.  Ultimately, it's a nice hotel.

Be aware: We walked past the front door twice before venturing in, STILL unsure if this was actually the hotel or not. Better street-level and front-door signage is sorely needed.\n\nWe booked a \"family room\" with two queens and one single bed; a great option for families. The beds were very comfortable and the room was clean. However, the bathroom and shower were significantly smaller than average (even by NYC standards), so larger people should find other accommodations. \n\nAlso, perhaps because of Covid, there was no housekeeping service, although we could have requested extra towels if needed. Another thing to keep in mind: Request a room higher than 2nd floor if music from the downstairs bars could be an issue.\n\nTraveling to this neighborhood again, I would be willing to stay here again, but would also explore other options.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel is in a great location in lower Manhattan. They provide a great value in that can accommodate 5 grown people in one room - something that usually requires a large suite or two rooms in a hotel, or a larger place in an AirBNB. The hotel is a walk-up. Reception is on the second floor, and there is no elevator, so youi will need to carry your bags up stairs to get to reception and your room. The vibe of the hotel is great with the furniture in the lower lobby and throughout the floors. The staff was very nice. We arrived around 12:30 in the afternoon hoping to store our bags and explore the local neighborhood, and they were able to check us into our room early, which was a bonus. The room we had was clean, as was the bathroom. While not used, they provided full sized bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the shower. ","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff was very friendly. I thought the room was spacious compared to other NYC hotels I\u2019ve stayed in. I was concerned about managing 5 suitcases in a NYC hotel, but our room had 4 industrial shelves that worked perfectly to store our open suitcases without taking up any floor space. The hotel and room were exactly as pictured on the website. If you would like housekeeping services, you have to request it. I actually prefer this and hope this becomes a permanent thing post-covid. They did a great job when we requested it and also promptly took care of a maintenance issue. It was very nice to have 3 beds for our family of 5. There is no shortage of restaurants since Little Italy, Chinatown, and Soho are all a short walk from the hotel. \n\nCons: The complimentary coffee service is discontinued due to covid. This was kind of a big deal for our coffee-dependent family since it added another $25+ to each day. I think it is a bit of a stretch to say the hotel is in Soho since it is definitely not on cobblestone streets, surrounded by trendy boutiques and restaurants. We had no view at all from our 2nd floor room, facing north. I don\u2019t know if other rooms had a good view though. Since there is a bar in the hotel, I\u2019m not sure when\/if the door to the hotel is ever locked. There was often no employees in sight, so it seemed that anyone could wander in at any time. \n\nOverall, we were very happy with the hotel and would consider staying here again.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel has great ambiance, texture, character, and location. The staff is outstanding and took care of our every need. Even more importantly, they had something to offer. Instead of a soulless corporate drone, each staff member we encountered had soul, empathy, depth, character. We were staying in the hotel for two separate business trips\u2014my wife\u2019s and mine\u2014as well as for having family join us in a pre holiday gathering. That\u2019s complicated. The staff was understanding at a basic human level and made it a stay we will never forget. And at the same time, they got their jobs done with efficiency and verve. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. I hope the hotel management rewards and retains them. Relatedly, the hotel itself has great character\u2014from its historical heritage to the preservation of its brick walls and quirky spaces and creative use of natural light and recycled wood and multiple levels. No room is the same. Each room offers its own uniqueness and level of sophistication and price point. (We had quite a few). The hotel and its rooms are as clean as can be.  It is a refreshingly interesting hotel in a city that is the most interesting city in the world but a city that suffers from a surfeit of cramped boring often less than clean hotel rooms.

Amanda was delightful, listened and investigated and corrected the error for me and a business partner I was traveling with. Next was a gentleman named Singh who is kind of the jack-of-all trades from greetings to carrying luggage up 2 or 3 floors - yes there are no elevators here. But Singh was always at the ready to help and with a smile.\nOther folks were pleasant but at times inept - ask for extra towels from a young fellow at the desk, he writes down all the info = no towels. Another front desk person is constantly telling you about \"better rooms\" which cost more but we'll give you a bargain. Really - I've traveled to 33 countries in my career and stayed at all sorts of places, please don't play games.\nThe room - entire room was less than 100 sq.ft. - barely able to walk around. there is no desk, just an old short plank on the wall with a rough surface and an old kitchen chair which doesn't reach it anyway. No desire no closet - but there is a 20\" case iron pipe flat on the walk to hang clothes on = really! The initiation floor boars are really contact paper - in my room it was bubbling up. Mildwe in the shower and the walk-in shower easily overflows into the bathroom surrounding the toilet if you don't stop it with a towel = really.The towels are pretty much like fine sandpaper..Oh yes don't go looking for CS or NBS there are only 7 stations of cable news, old movies and stuff - the TV is so high that when you try to watch it from the bed, because there is no place to sit in the room, the image is of course blurred = really. And on and on.\nThe shame of it is that the folks are pleasant, Amanda and Singh are great, location is wonderful, downstairs and upstairs lobbies and seating areas are pleasant, plants actually have names=cute. But ask questions before you reserve and don't think rooms like the one I had are bargains.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There is no restaurant inside the hotel, but we did take advantage of the restaurant (the name escapes me as I type this) out the lobby door to the right. My daughters and I grabbed some wine, chips, and a bowl of the most expensive guacamole I've ever had at a $28 price point - pricey even for New York City! (ridiculous). The guac was yummy, and they refilled the chips, but geez - seriously.... $28 for a bowl of avocados???? This was a perfect location for us as we were shopping for a wedding dress, and we were able to walk to Grace Loves Lace (amazing bridal boutique).

We were in town for the San Gennaro festival and sightseeing. \nI will start with the positives about the hotel.\n* I've encountered friendly staff at many hotels before but there is almost always an element of fakeness to the friendliness. At Sohotel, the staff is GENUINELY friendly. They were helpful and sincerely wanted us to be happy and to have a good vacation. \n* It has a unique, warm, and comfortable atmosphere.\n* I prefer boutique hotels and this is definitely a boutique hotel.\n* Room was clean and well appointed\n* We had a junior suite, and paid handsomely for it, but it was a nice size. Worth the money for a special getaway.\n* We ate at only one of the onsite restaurants - the food was delicious. Priced fairly. We had drinks at 2 of the onsite restaurants and felt the drinks were fair.\n* The entrances for the hotel and restaurants were kept clean and hosed down. \n\nSo... now for the negative:\n* While this did not affect us, as we were aware of it from reading reviews prior to making reservations, there is NO elevator. The reception is on the second floor. All rooms are on 2, 3 or 4th floor. They don't have this anywhere on their website (at least not easily found) and there was a couple who checked in while we were there. The wife was recovering from knee surgery.  I think it is a little bit sneaky for them to not disclose this fact in a more upfront manner. If you are healthy, the stairs are no issue.\n* You can hear hall noise and adjoining rooms quite clearly. The floors are wood with some area rugs. Hope that your neighbors aren't wearing high heels - if they are you will surely wake up to that when they arrive back to their room at 3 in the morning.\n* I read all about the heated bathroom floors. I was, in a nerdy way, excited about them. The days were warm while we were there but the morning was cool and our room was cool. I did not notice any difference in the floor. I had the staff ensure that I was turning it on correctly. If it was working, it surely is nothing to brag about. I told them I didn't think it was working- twice. Nothing was done about it. \n* The bathroom was nice - open concept. The shower was very open with one high showerhead. Because of the open concept it is impossible to keep warm unless you are directly in the flow of water. There are no shelves or bars in the shower so if you have any of your own products for showering they have to go on the floor and you have to get out of the water to reach them or a washcloth. And forget taking a romantic shower with your significant other. There is no way 2 people can be in the shower without one of them being cold at all times. Just not impressed with the shower situation at all.\n* Ladies  -  if you wear any makeup, bring your own makeup lighting. The lighting in the bathroom is on the ceiling directly above the sink. This causes shadows on your face. There is no lighting from the front. \n* Speaking of lighting - don't think about reading in bed either. There is no bedside lighting. The lighting at the bed is also in the ceiling directly above the bed. It shines right down into your eyes. No Bueno.\n* The website advertised turn down service with chocolate. We didn't get that.\n\nWe had a nice stay there, but because of all the negatives for the price I don't see myself going back there again.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed here for 3 nights. The history of the area was the resin for our stop. I won\u2019t discuss the area (Chinatown and Little Italy, Bowery, Five points etc), it was dirty with a lot of refuse on the streets, smelt very bad and was somewhat disappointing. The food in the area was good and is easy walking distance to other scenic items such as Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall, Federal Court, or up to union square the other way(all no more than 25 min walk with kids) Subway took about 50 mins from Canal St to Coney Island (Luna Park). Anyway everyone wants to see different things so......the hotel.....\nHotel was great but small room, we had 2x double beds and 1x single bed so perfect for our family sleeping arrangement but no room for anything else, including leaving our 5 suitcases open, need to get your things out and pack it up again. That said the room was authentic with wooden floors, the bathroom ample with body wash and shampoos. Aesthetically we enjoyed the hotel. It had a comfortable relaxed feel and was furnished somewhat rustic modern, almost a retro\/Art Deco design. Lemon water available during day and coffee\/tea also, all at reception, not in room. No elevator in the hotel so consider that if stairs are not your thing or ask for a room on second level. There is a restaurant directly off the lobby and a couple others just outside. Given the convenience of fitting our whole family in the room it was great for us. The family room (standard family room) was small and if you intend to try and relax in your room for the day with kids there is not much space. We are generally out from breakfast until dinner and really only use our room for a shower and sleep so definitely not a problem for us. Overall we enjoyed it and it suited our need. I would definitely recommend the hotel for families wanting to stay in the area and not wanting to sit around in your room.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and the room was excellent for its price and location!\nI have been to New York once on a class trip, and I decided that I would bring my family of five as well since I know a little bit on traveling around in NY. The one thing I worried the most is hotel. It was hard to find a hotel that would accommodate 5 people with an affordable price. Most hotels only have rooms up to 4 people. Plus, booking a hotel in a place like NYC makes me feel like I could be booking into a scam or a place that does not actually look like what is advertised.\nI was not looking for anything fancy but a simple and clean room that could accommodate for my family of 5. Well I have to say, that was exactly what the Sohotel gave us, which I was really happy about!\nThe service was great. We were catching a game on the first day and have some spots to visit on our last day of stay, and we were able to store our luggage before we checked-in and checked-out with no problems.\nLike I said, the room was simple and clean, we had a room of five that has 2 beds for two people and 1 bed for one. It has plenty of charging stations which we liked. The bathroom wasn't big but it wasn't crowded, and taking a shower didn't feel like trapping myself in a tiny room. The only tiny issue was that there is nothing to stop the water from going out from the shower to other places in the bathroom, but the hotel put a towel in between so the water would not come out. My family did not perceive that as a huge issue. The room had little space to walk around, but we didn't mind. It's NYC. The bed was nice, maybe it was also because we were exhausted after walking so much each day, but both my father and mother said that they slept extremely well both nights.\nThe location was pretty good. It was not too loud nor too quiet. Subway line JZ was nearby within 5 mins of walk, transfer are usually required for us to connect to the other lines to our destination, but it was still pretty convenient.\nI love the staff!!! They were friendly and patient with us and always had a smile on their face. My parents are not from the states, so they carry an accent and are slow to understand sometimes, but they were always helpful and willing to repeat themselves.\nWe had a good time, and for a family of 5, I definitely recommend the Sohotel!!!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location was super convenient for both walking to other neighborhoods and taking the subway uptown, and it felt very homey and neighborhood-oriented instead of the very busy, touristy sections of further uptown Manhattan. Note: if you've never been to the city, I would definitely recommend bringing some ear plugs - this hotel is on a main road and can be noisy at night, but that should be expected in Manhattan.

We chose it because it was the most reasonable price for lodging in its class, and we booked direct. Friendly and helpful staff (we arrived early and they happily held our luggage until check-in time while we went out); within walking distance of restaurants and coffee shops. Even the most basic rooms have comfortable beds and fun decor. Perfect for able-bodied guests who enjoy a hip atmosphere. If you're are toting large luggage or looking for elevators\/escalators, breakfast on-site, coffee\/tea maker in the room, or large rooms, it may not be right for you. The more expensive rooms have more amenities (upgrades are offered for a fee multiple times on check-in). There is free coffee and tea in the lobby most hours, or on request. The wi-fi is fast. Because it is an older building (part of its charm), the heating system is hard to regulate in some rooms. Ours was so hot the first night we couldn't sleep and we received a free upgrade, which we appreciated. We did hear a little noise at night. But generally it was quiet for New York City.

Local food choices are mind blowing and plentiful.  The hotel is quiet, yet in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood.  On our most recent visit, we visited the Tenement Museum on Lower East Side, and the Whitney (meatpacking\/west village.)  We walked everywhere. The hotel itself is clean, decorated with a quirky flair, it smells great, and it has a friendly and helpful staff.

We had to walk down several flights of stairs in the morning to get the complimentary coffee and hot water, which is only available at certain hours of the day. For a hotel that doesn't offer breakfast or food services, we feel that they could at least provide this service all day. There should be tea and coffee complimentary all day on every level so you don't have to walk up and down the stairs - otherwise, provide coffee machines or at least a kettle in the room so you can make your own tea and coffee. For people with an early morning flight, it isn't possible to get a coffee. \nWhenever there were guests walking in the hallways and children running and slamming doors, or in the room above you could hear everything, so consequently, we had trouble sleeping due to noise.\nOne thing that was really bad was that the hotel is saturated with a strong fragrance in the hallways that is overwhelming and common areas that is obviously toxic because it gave us a headache. It is not healthy to be breathing in chemical fragrances 24\/7. \nThe staff were friendly but we just didn't feel that what they are offering is what we expect from a boutique hotel.

Whole Foods right there, and b+h dairy just a quick walk up chrystie to second ave.  \"the real\" soho is just a few blocks away, with its tony shopping and stunning iron facade buildings.  two blocks from mulberry st, where they were just setting up for the san gennaro festival this week.  my impressions?  quieter than I thought it would be.  less freaks.  more friendly people.  clean spaces.  trendy furniture.  vending machines, but nice ones.  exposed brick.  neat spots to sit and people watch, if you have the time!  bar downstairs, nice Italian restaurant, no elevator.  but like most travelers, walking is no problem.  no noise in halls.  good windows that minimize sirens on the street.  not the best view, as they're ripping up one of the streets.

We all booked separately as we were all coming from different parts of the world so it wasn't a group booking as such.    \n\nWe stayed in a Deluxe King room which was a fair size and after all you are really only sleeping in there!   The hotel room is designed in a very industrial chic style which I thought was rather unique.  The aircon worked well, bed was very comfortable, the safe was big enough to put laptops in and the large shower was a bonus!    I was surprised that there was no tea\/coffee making facilities in the room which I thought would of been a standard thing in all hotels??   Nevertheless there was complimentary tea\/coffee in the lobby everyday as well as cold lemon water.   Some of our friends stayed in the standard rooms which they said were very basic with small old aircons and no fridge which is another thing I thought would of been a standard.\n\nRenovations where being done at the hotel which we didn't hear, but also this was not listed on the their website nor were we told when booking or checking in.   A number of our friends had to change rooms due to the noise.\n\nAs other reviewers have commented there is no lift in this hotel so be prepared for a lot of steep steps.   The porters are very courtesy and helpful and will carry your bags for you.   There are no phones in the room so you will need to either try and carry your bags downstairs or go to reception and ask for someone to go up to your room to get your bags.   Being a small boutique hotel there is also no room service but there are restaurants below the hotel where I believe if you show your room card you can get a discount.\n\nLocation wise, I thought it was excellent!   It was my first time in NYC so I really had no idea of good or bad locations and as it was recommended I just went with it.    Little Italy and Chinatown are only a few streets away and there are SO many great places to eat!  I'll put those in another review.    As you would expect there are a lot of famous nearby - Robert De Niro's restaurant Tribeca Grill, Hugh Jackman's coffee shop The Laughing Man, Katz Dinner for it's brisket sandwiches and  The Mulberry Bar used in many movies.  The list is endless!    If you walk out of the hotel, turn left and within 6-7 blocks you are on Broadway!   Greenwich Village is also only about a 20-25 mins depending on how many times you stop to look at the shops!    All in all I found it to be a very convenient place to stay and would highly recommend it.\n\nI booked directly via the website which requires upfront payment.   I needed to change the dates for our stay and the staff were very helpful via email to adjust this.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Sohotel is unique in its creative interior design, layout and furnishings. The staff were professional and polite without being overly gushy and appearing insincere. The hotel does not offer a huge range of amenities which is good as it means we're not paying for stuff we don't need or are unlikely to use. The hotel, however, does offer free storage of luggage, an invaluable perk that should not be overlooked if you arrive in the city before check-in or have a flight later in the day. They also provide super fast and stable wi-fi, complimentary coffee\/tea\/water during the day and cosy places to sit and gather your thoughts. In our view these small extras make a huge positive difference on a busy schedule.\n\nOur family room had two queen beds and a proper single bed with enough space to move around and place cases\/bags without tripping over them. Comfy mattress with quality bedding. The bathroom was a little a bit too compact but well designed and colourful but most importantly: super clean.\n\nThe hotel is in sight of Bowery subway station with other stations (namely Canal St & Spring St.) close-by which do have better connections to Midtown & Uptown. The immediate area around the hotel can be busy on account of an adjacent bar and several eateries which we found to be a good thing. The hustle and bustle of activity was never intrusive and we were not disturbed during the night despite having a second floor room that overlooked the street. It also makes the area feel safe. The hotel is close to many places to eats and drink with 'Little Italy' and 'Chinatown' as alternative options a short walk away. Both of these neighbourhoods offer a totally different experience of NYC when compared to the glitz and glam of Time Square and 5th Avenue.\n\nWe'll be back!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Bathroom decor was chic, modern and very clean, great smelling toiletries provided with plenty of towels for all 5 of us,constant hot water with dryer in bathroom . Abundance of power sockets dotted around the room.  Dressing mirror above desk for hair and make up as well as a full length one provided. Rooms are serviced at guests requests. AC system in the room which was easy to operate, but  a bit noisy at night when sleeping.   Teas\/coffee and water provided at set times in the lobby, felt this could have been provided throughout the day to accommodate guests or at least have this facility in guest rooms.  Although it was lovely to meet and greet fellow guests in the morning for coffee, I did not appreciate queuing behind guests whilst they dithered with their teabags in cups as well as this we did feel awkward in our PJs in public and hotel gowns\/slippers would have been welcome especially as the te\/coffee was in the public lobby.   \nGreat wee seating area beside the tea area and downstairs at the entrance. \nLocation of hotel is around 25 mins from Laguardia Airport and there are lots of eating places for breakfast\/dinner and drinks all within walking distance.

I know boutique is just one of those terms that's gotten slapped around so much it's lost its purpose. \nNow you do offer a decent accomodation, but boutique it is not. A splash of differe t vibrant colors on the wall does not make it boutique. Neither the fact that the rooms are so tiny that a double room can barely accommodate two normal sized individuals and their simple luggage, thanks to no closet, cupboard or anything to store a bag in. \n\nAlso I'm curious about the boutiqueness in two windows facing a stone wall, barely letting sun in, and next to some form of machine constantly humming. \nWe could talk about the bare amenities in the room and the boutiqueness of it. Agreed that soap, shampoo and conditioner should be in any hotel charging 200$+ a night, but boutique and upscale it is not to chuck the basic ones in large containers on the wall..... That's very La Quinta Inn Kentucky..... No extra amenities? How so?\n\nThe free coffee, tea and water are a nice touch, but the coffee was barely drinkable at a few occasions, simple nescafe instant in a thermos is not that exciting. Could I suggest a real filter brew or perhaps two pod machines?\n\nNow this little 4 day adventure started badly already at check-in I'm afraid, with a lady trying confusingly sell a twin room to a couple and that after confirming what bed type we were looking for. I don't see the point in selling a twin to a couple for 50$ more when they already booked the king they wanted.......\n\nSo there's a few mishaps to correct and the sohotel just might flash to its boutiqueness","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If you are over 150lbs (I'm 5,9\" 125lbs) you will have a hard time getting clean.

The bed was very comfortable but you can hear everything in hallway because the bed is about a foot 1\/2 from the door (no peep-hole).

Overall, the functionality was good and it was quite modern. The bed was also among one of the more comfortable ones on my trip.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and very helpful in carrying bags up to and down from the room. This is important cause the hotel doesn\u2019t have any elevators, and that can be a pain, if you\u2019re on the 4th floor like I was (but it was quiet). This is something to keep in mind, if you have mobility issues. \n\nOne other point that I didn\u2019t like was that the front desk worked really hard to persuade me to upgrade for a fee...which seemed unnecessary. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel for a younger hipper resident looking to plug into a great party and food scene in the neighborhood...it\u2019s a bit painful, if you have to get up to Midtown for work. However not extremely so, as several subway lines run within a 2-5 block radius of the hotel.

With countless places to eat and drink and walking distance to Brooklyn (via the bridge), Broadway, 5th, Battery Park etc it served my needs very well.  \n\nI had a Junior suite which was a reasonable size with a decent bathroom and overall a nice room.  It had also just been refurbished and I was the first paying guest to stay in it which was nice.  Nice T.V although I didn't use it and a nice sound system I connected my phone to to play music.  However with such thin walls I was reluctant to do this too much as I am sure your neighbours will hear it very easily.  In fact it is fair to say that generally you hear a lot of noise because of the lack of sound proofing which was a little annoying at times as there are renovations currently taking place.  It wasn't horrendous but hard to ignore as well.\n\nThe room had a safe and a fridge although there was no minibar which I really do not understand in a 'suite'.  The hotel takes a $250 dollar deposit for incidentals but with no mini bar, laundry service, room service or any restaurants where you can charge to the room I fail to see why they need to do this at all.  \n\nI found the fact that there were no additional services provided like a laundry service to be rather poor.  There is also no form of room service available which does not appeal to me at all.  For the price I paid I am not sure I got value for money.  A lot of people seem to use this hotel because you can have 3 or 4 people in a room but as I was a single occupant I would still have liked some level of basic service for the money I was spending.  I could have stayed in 5 star hotels up by the park with full services for the same money or less.  I had a long journey from Singapore and to not be able to rest in my room and have food and drinks brought to the room is a little disappointing.\n\nHowever I did like the area and because of that I would consider staying here again but I am not sure there is any value in paying for a suite in future.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Well done to the housekeeping staff. We agree with the previous comment about the hotel smelling wonderful as soon as you walked in! In the room there was a huge TV, a small fridge and a digital safe. We enjoyed using the drinks in the lobby. Please note that there are no drink making facilities in the room. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times. The hotel is located in the Little Italy and China town areas and so there is an excellent choice for eating out. We were not particularly bothered by street noise at night. The subway is a 3 minute walk from the hotel. It takes approx 15- 20 mins on the subway to get to the main sites such as the Empire State etc. It is an approx 20 mins walk to the 9\/11 memorial which is breathtaking.

We were in a standard family room.  The staff we interacted with were all positive and upbeat.  They all answered our questions cheerfully and with good knowledge of the area and hotel.  However, the cramped nature of the room and the ridiculously small bathroom make this a hotel we would not visit again.  With no exaggeration, you can literally wash your hands while you sit on the toilet.  The bathroom is so small a person can barely move around.  Drying and dressing are an adventure in body parts bonking into walls, fixtures and the door.  The sink is on a pedestal and there is no place for a family to set their bathroom gear.  There is a small shelf under the mirror that you can set your toothpaste and toothbrush on but forget about setting hair dryers, curling irons or any number of other things that come with family traveling.  As for the actual room, only one person can move about while the others sit on the beds.  There are no desks, no chairs and only 2 end tables between the beds.  It's basically a galley type room where the beds consume all the space with narrow walkways around the beds.  To end on a positive note, the location is very close to Little Italy and the subway.

They kept our luggage for us the day we checked out so we didn\u2019t have to worry about it- which was extremely helpful. Loved the neighborhood and it is right next to Little Italy. Great location.\n\nOur only complaint, and it was minor, is that we were on top of a bar playing loud music till quite late. It was hard to get to sleep. The room had 3 beds, which we loved, being a family of five. But the loud music would make our room not so great for younger families. Our kids are teens, so we were fine. Luckily, because the beds were so comfortable, we were able to sleep.\n\nI would highly recommend this hotel and have already told my friends and family that they have to stay there next time they\u2019re in the city!

We stayed for 4 nights and 5 days at the Sohotel. We were in a family room (the smaller kind) and it was perfect for us. I'll admit we were not there much. It has a shower (no tub) which was fine because our son is used to taking a shower with hubs in the morning. There are lots of hangers but no drawers. Our suitcases fit under the beds, so we'd pull clothes out of those at night before bed. It has 2 queen beds and one twin. And they were very comfortable. There were more than enough towels for everyone (including 2 towel hogs) and they were large and thick. They provide shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner in the shower which all smell amazing. \n\nThe people there are all young and hip (it's a very hip hotel) and 90% of them genuinely seem to like their jobs and like dealing with people. A far cry from most hotels where 90% are surly at best.\n\nThe hotel is 2 blocks from a subway and right on the boarder of Chinatown and Little Italy. Food options are abundant (try Two Hands for breakfast) and it's a lively area.\n\nThe coffee and tea in the mornings and coffee and ice water at night were really nice.\n\nThere are a lot of stairs, so if you have mobility issues, this might not be the hotel for you.

Midtown is the best for tourists, so unless you\u2019re wanting to explore little Italy etc, I\u2019d book midtown. \nThe rooms we stayed in were incredibly noisy. You can hear word for word conversations of the rooms next door, reception, everyone\u2019s doors opening and closing, toilets being flushed, staff conversations, the radiators hiss all night long unless you turn them off and have a cold room. \nOur first two nights we stayed in 305 and my mum couldn\u2019t sleep one wink it was so noisy, so we asked to leave the property. They offered us a free upgrade to 314 which was quieter in the sense you couldn\u2019t hear other rooms (staff told us they were empty at the time) but you can hear all of reception, people walking up and down the stairs, toilets flushing etc. \nThey also only have tea and coffee in reception, not your room which we thought was odd. There\u2019s no phone, fridge or an information pack in your room. There isn\u2019t anywhere in the hotel to eat breakfast you have to go out and look for it (we recommend the grey dog) and the staff only mentioned one place, the egg shop, which was packed every time.

Piacere does amazing pizzas. The Queen rooms are quite small but I think that is typical in NYC and it was fine really. I have seen some comments about it being too dark in the rooms and they aren't the brightest but we found them cozy and it didn't really bother us and you are out a lot of the time anyway and there are nice communal spaces to hang out in in the lobbys. Having no breakfast wasn't as much of a problem as I thought it would be as there are plenty of places nearby - we especially enjoyed Grey Dog and the portions are so big we didn't really bother with lunch so it didn't end up being too expensive.

So first off the staff were fantastic- warm, accommodating and full of local knowledge about places to eat, drink and visit. I sometimes find that when staying in large hotels you miss out on those casual chats with the staff, and it's often in those casual chats that you get a good recommendation for something interesting to see or do. \n\nThe rooms are comfortable, not too large but definitely not too small either. Everything was clean and I slept very well in the bed. I've noticed a number of people here writing about the noise from the streets and whilst I don't disagree that the streets do generate some noise, I think anyone staying in New York needs to take into account that it's New York and there is always activity here.\n\nI'm really happy I chose this hotel, and when I was waiting for my taxi at the airport a lady came into the hotel with her friends because she'd stayed at the hotel on a previous trip and simply wanted to show her friends around.

Thankfully we managed to check in early by upgrading our room for a nominal fee (normally $100 but gave it to us for $50).\n\nThe only drawback I really see for some people is that there is no elevator in the building. Staff will assist with luggage up and down the stairs. However, the stairway is narrow so I would not recommend this hotel if you have physical issues with stairs.\n\nReception is up one flight of stairs from the street entrance. The staff is very pleasant and helpful. They have free coffee and tea in the reception area; wifi is also free for guests (info is on the keycard).\n\nWe were given room 425, which looks out into the corner of Broom & Elisabeth. I'm a fan of exposed brick, so that was a nice design touch. Our bed was king sized, clean and comfortable. Power outlets were common throughout the room. The bathroom in this room came with heated floors and a walk in shower. Climate control is on the wall, but also can be controlled via the TV remote. You can also use the remote to order any hotel services. The safe was easy to use.\n\nThe Grand Street station is nearby and Spring Street station is not much further in the opposite direction. Plenty of places to eat in the area.\n\nAll in all, if you're planning to stay on the lower east side, give this hotel a try.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The building is located in the historic Bowery Neighborhood and gives off a funky modern Gangs of New York vibe if you can imagine that (I highly suggest reading the history portion on their website). The lobby has fun d\u00e9cor and a lively atmosphere.\n\nThe location is easily walkable to East Village, Greenwich Village, Little Italy, and the Brooklyn Bridge.  If you've never been to NYC I highly suggest walking the Brooklyn Bridge, day or night, for some stellar views of the city.  If you want to venture further into Brooklyn I suggest checking out the Smorgasburg food festival they have on summer weekends. \n\nIf you're debating whether to Megabus\/Boltbus VS drive, I suggest driving and  using the SpotHero App to prepay for parking. Its is very inexpensive and I was able to find parking $18\/night just 1 block from the hotel at 106 Mott St. Valet garage.   I have used it numerous times when traveling to NYC and it is accepted at the majority of garages in the city. \n\nOverall I highly recommend the Sohotel and I would definitely stay again.

Being 5 of us in total, 2 adults and 3 kids trying to find somewhere that could accommodate us all in one room was proving difficult - but this place has family rooms that fitted the bill - two queens and one single bed which, although the room was small (to be expected for New York City) - our stay was extremely comfortable.\nWe originally looked into AirBnB but found the prices quoted at this hotel were cheaper than what some hosts on AirBnB were trying to charge.  Plus, finding a hotel lit up with blue neon late at night was easier than trying to find some private apartment building elsewhere; especially after getting off an 8 hour flight - we arrived, met at the stairs leading up to reception by a member of staff who quite happily took our suitcases up to our room and crashed out ready to explore NYC - loved it!\nDecor to the hotel was superb - had a certain style to it that made it feel classy but not pretentious and all the staff were very friendly.  The free tea, coffee and hot chocolate (which the kids certainly enjoyed) was very welcoming.\nLocated on the edge of Little Italy, and a short walk to China Town it certainly has a lot in the local area.  We tramped around on foot during our four days in NYC, and this hotel was a great location for getting to the main tourist areas - when we got too tired, Uber was a great way of getting back to the hotel with little fuss.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I asked if I could pay my part only and the rest of the group payed later but they refused. I proposed to leave them my credit card and computer, I just wanted to relax and take a shower. Nothing. I had to wait 7 hours before getting my room. I am currently sitting in their hall waiting for my friend's  flight to land.

There was always coffee available and the cold lemon water and mints in the lobby were nice. The Grand St. subway stop is just a few of blocks away, not as convenient as other hotels we've stayed in, but not bad at all. My biggest complaint would be that our room (341) was right by the custodians' closet so housekeeping would congregate right there and be in and out of the closets and the stairway at the end of the hall, which was loud at times. The smaller downsides were a loud tapping noise in the bathroom related to the water, poor water pressure in the shower, poor TV reception (on the few channels they got), but really those issues were fairly inconsequential since we were mostly out and about. We loved being right there by Chinatown. The sights and sounds and smells were enlightening and invigorating for all of us, especially the kids (4, 6 and 8). We would stay in this hotel again. Food-wise somewhat nearby, we enjoyed Baz Bagel and Landmark Coffee (and Pancakes) for breakfast, Parisi for lunch (oh my gosh, the best and biggest sandwiches--one could've fed our family of 5), and Barrio Chino (pricey but tasty) for dinner.

There are two nearby metro stations that will get you anywhere you want to be in Manhattan. \n\nThe not so good -\nIt's a big city and we visited just after the blizzard. Finding a way to get the car unloaded wasn't for the weak. Five of us and five bags with snow on the banks and a busy street made our first interaction with the hotel unappealing. You enter on the ground level. Someone walked by and said another person will be with us. There isn't a check in desk on the floor level that you enter on. Also there is not an elevator. A staff member got our five bags and carried them up the stairs to the second floor. \n\nDo NOT stay on the second floor near their public restroom. Down the narrow hallway that fits only one person there is a public restroom at the beginning of the hallway for the rooms. I'm not sure if this restroom was the cause or not but all hours of the night the pipes knocked, LOUDLY. Forget about and forgive NYC for the car horns and loud voices all hours of the night; it's a big city that's to be expected. But those pipes. Stay in the interior and on the backside.

I arrived after traveling all day.  I was told by the reception group that there was \"some construction\" but it would be done by 5:30.  I had an event that evening that I knew would end late. I was a bit leery and should have been because when I was shown my room on the forth floor there was not only construction but loud drilling and banging noises from the room next door!  I tried to read, putting in my headphones to drown out the noise, but couldn't and ultimately went down to reception. I just wanted to ask as it seemed my floor was the only place (after walking the others) where the construction was taking place. The manager told me there was nothing he could do, but fear not, the noise will only last 45 more minutes. The other receptionist actually rolled her eyes while I was talking.  I travel extensively and I am sure like others, whether for business or leisure, a hotel is a resting place. I was lucky there was no construction on Saturday, had there been, I would not have stayed. I'm astonished that a hotel of this caliber would not isolate the construction areas (not use the floor, close for a few days).  Too bad I wanted to love it, but when I come back next month to NYC with my husband we have too many options in the neighborhood. ","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}
