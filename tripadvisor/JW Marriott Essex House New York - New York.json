Upon entering one side of the lobby was curtained off for renovations. Lobby that was left was full of flowers and really beautiful. We were checked in right away and the front desk was nice. \n\nThe hotel annoyingly charges a $35 location fee which is a food and beverage credit or you could use it for other stuff in the city. We live in Brooklyn so basically had to pay an extra $35 to go to get drinks at the bar which we didn\u2019t want and then wound up spending more on mediocre drinks, and sad hummus in a old stuffy environment (see more below).\n\nWe got to our room and it was fairly large for a NYC hotel room with a great view of a brick wall. If you moved close to the night table and really squinted you could see a sliver of the park. \n\nBed was comfortable and room seemed pretty clean, then we got into the bathroom and the vent was disgusting (see photo) there was also a bath mat in the shower hanging up to use that was soaking wet. We weren\u2019t sure if it was used or if there was a leak. Either way it was gross.\n\nShower pressure was fine and the bathroom was large.\n\nThe restaurant was the strangest part, it is in dire need of a gut renovation. Between the awful wallpaper, old carpet and furniture it was just stuffy and old. There was also a giant tv playing golf which didn\u2019t fit into the old stuffy decor of the rest of the room. It was like a pub decorated by a Grandma in the 1950\u2019s.\n\nThere is a ballroom next door  which is serving as the executive lounge where they had some food at 5pm and then the breakfast. It was super old in there as well and looked like it was untouched since the 1980s. Breakfast was a buffet with a decent selection but reminded me more of a Courtyard not a 5 star hotel. \n\nLater on I see around 1am we wanted to watch tv, there were multiple streaming services to connect to but nothing worked. I chatted someone on the app and they checked with engineering and apparently streaming just wasn\u2019t working in our room. So they called up at 1:30am and asked if we wanted to move, which in theory was very nice but we were already ready for bed and didn\u2019t want to move rooms. \n\nThe staff was nice but Marriott really need to gut this place. It has worn out its grandeur and ambiance. There are so many other places you can stay at the same price level that are nicer.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t come back.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

An hour later, my wife and I used the main bed comforter for our toddlers on the pull out couch since they still hadn\u2019t arrived.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":455186,"title":"Wouldn't Stay Here Again - Very Disappointing","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-01","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"Extremely disappointing rooms, spotty customer service, and no true acknowledgement of Bonvoy status.\n\nI stayed here for two nights mid-August with two rooms booked. The website promised connecting Junior Suites. Prior to arrival, I saw that this was instead going to be one Junior Suite and one regular King with a hallway connector. When I contacted the hotel via email, I was rudely told that I was mistaken, and this is what we get. \n\nI am Ambassador Elite and my mother traveling with me in the second room is Platinum for Life -- big statuses. We were put in our (incorrect) rooms on the lowest guest room floor. Our views were of the back of other buildings. (The plus side to that was they were very quiet.) I'd asked in advance for a coffee maker for each room. Mine had one, hers did not. The bellman promised to ask for hers. When we returned from dinner at about 9:30pm, it still wasn't there. All I got for my Ambassador status was a card. I've not stayed in any other hotel where I didn't get a small acknowledgement gift of some kind along with the card. (And typically an upgrade - the St. Regis even upgrades me to a Suite.) I understand upgrades aren't guaranteed, but frequent travelers know that you're always told shorter stays are more likely to get them. During housekeeping, they also don't replenish that coffee maker. You have to call room service, which we didn't know until that night.\n\nWe dined at the hotel the first night because of a somewhat late arrival. The food was mediocre, and my mother had to send hers back because it arrived cold. The second night we had a cocktail at the bar before leaving for dinner off-property. I asked what kind of glass the cocktail I ordered would come in. I was told a Martini glass. I requested a rocks glass, the bartender then proceeded to give me a Martini glass... we were the only people there.\n\nThe Concierge team was helpful before we arrived with arranging transportation; however, after I got home I saw I was charged $50 more than quoted. When I contacted them, I was told the company charged me a waiting fee. I responded asking if they could explain why, since my flight was early and we immediately met our driver at baggage claim. I have never received a response, and it's been almost a month. I gave up. (BTW - The company was Empire CLS, which I swore off of using a couple of years ago because they pull this scam constantly all over the world.)\n\nThe website also lists a Spa on-property. Prior to arrival, I contacted the hotel to see about getting two pedicures. The person who assisted was extremely helpful, but it turns out they weren't at the Spa, which is only open when necessary, I guess. A vendor set up in-room pedicures using freelance aestheticians. This meant I technically didn't qualify for the Spa credit promised with my check-in materials. My mother's pedicure was ruined by the end of the day. The company happily sent the lady back out the following morning, but I was still charged a ridiculous $500 + for this service (which I was never quoted). \n\nSo back to my first comment -- This is a very disappointing hotel. The location is excellent, but that's its redeeming quality. From other reviews, it also appears that if you are lucky enough to be deemed worthy of a view (or you pay extra for it), you're rewarded with street noise. There are too many options in NYC to stay here again.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Terrible experience. We spent 1 night on August 26th in a Central Park View Upper Floor we had booked - price was 1000 $.  Experience was horrible from the time we stepped into this \u201chotel\u201d.  Receptionist present on August 26th at 3:30 pm was unfriendly and cold.  Our room was on the 14th floor (1406): tiny, dirty and small windows - the only plus was the view. The rest looked like a student hostel\u2019s room. Dirty and old carpet, dust everywhere (see pictures), water did not evacuate from the shower so it was left like a cesspit.  1 single chair looked like a second-hand office chair from the 1980\u2019s with stains.  1000$ for this \u201croom\u201d is a fraud.  We asked to change rooms and were given a slightly better \u201croom\u201d on the 22nd floor.  It was still shabby-looking, dark and small but cleaner so we ended up staying there.  There was constant background noise coming from the air conditioning or the elevators nearby.  Checkout was quick but again, receptionist was cold, unfriendly and couldn\u2019t care less about the poor experience we had and told her about.  It was a relief to leave.\nAdvice from seasoned travelers:  AVOID THIS PROPERTY at all cost.  Needless to say, we will never be returning here and suggest that you do the same.  Perhaps this can encourage Marriott to thoroughly improve their staff management and rooms.  Overlooking Central Park should not be an excuse to sell a dump.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It has an entrance hall, a large sitting room with couch and chairs, and another hall with closets leading to bathroom and bedroom.  \n\nThe bed was very comfortable and the room it self was large.  The bathroom was a bit cramped, especially the sink \/ toilet area, but there\u2019s a large shower and seperate bath. \n\nThe room was showing a lot of wear and tear however which should be addressed for a 5 star hotel.  \n\nLocation - across from Central Park and lots of subway.  Very central.  \n\nFood - I was disappointed, not necessarily in the fare provided, but just the process.  The executive lounge itself is under renovation, so it\u2019s in a large open ballroom. When I used the executive lounge for breakfasts, there were some times there was no one \u201cmanning the gates\u201d and the place was jam packed, making me wonder if people who weren\u2019t entitled to it were able to get in.  \n\nService - same complaint as a lot of people.  Trying to get ahold of people takes forever.  Requiring multiple calls.   At one point we tried to use our elevator to get to the lobby, but it wasn\u2019t working, so we had to walk down from the 30th something floor to a floor quite a ways down that used a different elevator bank. When I tried calling from my floor, they intimated they were aware of it \u201coh yea someone else mentioned that\u201d, but didn\u2019t give any solution or that anyone was working on it.  Thank goodness we didn\u2019t have to walk back up. \n\nOverall - 4\/5.  Great location.  Good hard product in need of a bit of TLC.  Service and executive lounge needs a bit of work.

I had a one night stay here Dec. 17-18, peak Christmas time in NYC. I just booked a standard room for my husband and I, but was pleased to check the app the day before my trip and discover that I had apparently been upgraded to a Central Park View room. My husband and I arrived around 10 am the next morning to check in. The front desk clerk said that our room as available- great!- and we could go straight up. I swiped my credit card for the standard $150 security fee and proceeded to the room. Imagine my surpise when I opened the door to our room and saw the view of another building\/alley way. I don't know if the clerk just decided on her own that I'd rather have a room then as opposed to waiting for the Central Park View room indicated in my app, or what, but that was certainly disappointing. We decided just to ignore it and proceed about our stay anyways. The room was the typical tiny NYC size. Bed was comfortable enough, towels were nice. The room seemed slightly dated and like it hadn't been updated in a while. I was VERY surprised to see this room had a shower curtain... not even glass paneling for the shower. At $1000\/night peak rate, you could at least upgrade the shower.\n\nThe real fun with this hotel started after I checked out. I had booked my reservation using a Marriott free night certificate of 85k points that was set to expire on 1\/1\/23, plus an additional 15k points to hit the 100k point room rate. Imagine my surprise the day after I check out when I discover that my free night and 15k points have been refunded to my account, and the hotel billed me for $1022!! And not just pending, a POSTED charge in that amount, PLUS an additional room's night pending on my card. What has ensued since then is absolutely absurd. I've been on the phone with Essex House or Marriott Bonvoy almost every day since then while one blames the entire situation on the other person. Essex House told me that I booked the room on a AAA cash rate. I don't even have AAA. Then Essex House tried to tell me I booked the entire thing on points. Also a lie, and I have the confirmation email to prove it. Bonvoy insisted the case was in Essex House's hands and there was nothing further they could do. The only person who seemed to be even remotely interested in trying to assist me was Vuong in Accounting with Essex House. I finally received an email Christmas Day from Marriott informing me that the refund would be on my credit card by 12\/28 and if it's not there to respond to their email to let them know. I wake up 12\/28 and, shocker, the refund is not on my credit card. I try to respond to the email to inform them and, shocker, mail to that account is undeliverable. I then called Marriott again and, after being hung up on while transferred three separate times, reached a supervisor who told me she'd have the manager of Essex House call me that day. I finally received a call from Madelyn in the GM's office who told me a refund was being issued to my card that day and it would show up in 5-7 business days. I asked her to please email me confirmation of that and she said she would. I reminded her that my free night certificate would expire on 1\/1\/23 and that they needed to redeem it from my account prior to then. She then called me back approxiately 20 minutes later to tell me my entire booking was on points. I assured her it was not and that I, again, had proof of that. She assured me she would get it straight and email me confirmation of my refund. Two hours go by and it's now 4:50 and still no email from Madelyn with my confirmation. I then had to call Essex House AGAIN and speak to someone in Accounting and ask that the email showing the refund be sent to me immediately. I finally received that from them. At this point I have no idea if they will even redeem my free night certificate before it expires--that's their problem, not mine. If the refund does not appear on my credit card in the stated time, I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company for fraud. At this point, Marriott and Essex House have no excuse for this whatsoever other than sheer incompetence or willingness to defraud their customers. Spend your money elsewhere when staying in NYC. The Hilton Conrad and Thompson Hyatt are both delightful and will get my business again after previous stays.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":455186,"title":"Great location and character, comfortable, expensive, patchy service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-04-25","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I'm a big fan of hotels that have a venerable history but have combined modern conveniences with the character that comes from those bygone days. Since the Essex House dates from the 1930s I understand, and has managed to achieve this balance well. \n\nWe were here for a 3 night stay, 2 rooms. A stay here, like this, will cost you. There is no escaping that and for the amount of coin one drops here, the service had better be impeccable. More on this below. One of the benefits of an historic hotel, is that not all rooms are the same and judging by the two we had, this is certainly the case here. Rooms can be quirky but both of ours were very nice, comfortable and easy to spend time in. One of our rooms had a delightful, deep tub which is rare in US hotels in my experience and very welcome. Our second room had a shallower bath but still just enough to soak in but I wish hotels would put in a deep tub or else opt for a walk in shower over the shallow, over the tub shower option that seems standard in far too many places.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable, sheets clean and crisp. Obviously, although the hotel faces the park, not all the rooms do, so higher and front facing are obviously best but, I assume, the most expensive. I am not a fan of pressure sensitive minibars and those featured here. Come on. Really? I don't want to risk getting charged for something that I pick up to look at and then put back, only to miss it on my bill. At this level of hotel, at this price, this is bordering on the offensive.\n\nOne of the great benefits of being a Titanium member of Bonvoy, is access to the lounge which was major during this stay as we were able to partake of the excellent breakfast laid on there daily, and at no extra cost to us. This was well worth it and the lounge was spacious and well appointed. Too many TVs including one displaying the Fox propaganda service but I suppose one can't have everything.\n\nThe hotel is 44 floors and has a bank of elevators some of which serve floors 1-19, some 18-44 and the system works well although there are some differences in that one elevator seemed to allow access to all floors although that wasn't obvious until one was inside. The system is pretty secure, requiring a room key to proceed upstairs, and with a ubiquitous security guard quietly, and somewhat unsmilingly on duty at all times. Well done Essex for managing the elevators so that we never waited more than a minute or so at any time, either in the lobby or on our floor. This is an important facet that not all hotels pull off.\n\nNow to the cons of the Essex which, in addition to the aforementioned minibar issue are infuriating at this level. Firstly, there is a $35 dollar per room, per night \"destination fee\". Nonsense. Outrageous. This is akin to seeing a \"resort fee\" on the bill. Honestly, what on Earth is that? Basically a \"use it or lose it\" fee that you can't stack so one is basically forced to spend $35 a day on room service, mini-bar etc or you will be charged it anyway. I HATE this practice. If you want to charge me more for the room, put it on the room rate and don't play these games. It's sharp practice of the worst kind, unworthy on Marriott and especially one of its premium brands. It caused a lot of heated discussion as guests were checking out.\n\nMany of the staff were very friendly, especially those in housekeeping BUT on a number of occasions we had questions about potentially moving our rooms to be closer together (at least on the same floor), late checkout and luggage storage and the person on the end was brusque and unhelpful on more than one occasion to the point of rudeness. If this is how a hotel treats its guests with Bonvoy status I wonder what they do to others? I realize the pomposity and entitlement inherent in that statement but honestly a premium brand, at these prices, should do better. \n\nAnd that's the thing. This is a very nice hotel and it is an excellent base from which to explore NYC but these missteps, blamed with a shrug by the staff on \"COVID\" and \"Staffing\" issues should not happen at this price. I've had better customer service from hotels charging me $129 a night and trust me, the Essex is way, way, north of that in price. It didn't particularly translate to that in terms of service on this visit and that's a shame. Will I stay here again? Probably not. I think there are better options in the City.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":455186,"title":"Never booking at another Marriott again.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-04-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"TLDR: They were overbooked and gave me an inferior room while attempting to charge me the price of Junior Suite until I complained about it, took 2 days to give me the actual room I wanted, Cockroach on bed, back to inferior room, left the hotel and went to another hotel.\n\nType of room booked: Junior Suite\nLength of stay: Supposed to be 7 days\nPrice Quoted: ~$5,265.08\n\nCHECK IN: I arrived to check-in at the hotel at night after a long flight for my anniversary trip to NYC. There was a small line and one person at the Front Desk. After a few minutes I was checked into my room and notified that they needed to charge my card instantly (prepay) because they would be changing the computer system. I agreed, no big deal I had to pay that amount regardless. Service was acceptable, nothing fancy.\n\nARRIVE AT 1ST ROOM: We were escorted to our room by a bellboy who pushed our single bag, he wasn't very talkative although he did answer our question of when the hotel was built. As soon as I saw the room I questioned whether this was a Junior Suite. The room looked like a regular king bed room with a small desk. After a $10 tip I asked the bellboy if this was a suite, he replied \"yes\" and promptly left the room. I was not convinced and went online to look for any pictures referencing the different types of rooms at the hotel and found that the room I was in one of the rooms of something they called a \"Family Connector\" which is basically a Regular King Room.\n\n1ST COMPLAINT: I called the front desk several times with no answer so I decided to make my way down there. When I arrived I spoke to a different person than the one who checked me in. I showed them my reservation, which was done directly through the Marriott official website btw, and politely asked if there was some sort of mistake. The person at front desk told me they did not have any suites available and since I didn't want to cause problems at the beginning of my trip I said I wanted to be charged the appropriate amount for the room I was in and I asked to be changed to the correct room (Junior Suite) as soon as possible. I was told at front desk that this would happen in 2 days so I had to sleep in this room for two nights. I agreed and left. It's important to note that no apology nor courtesy was offered subsequent to this first event.\n\n1st ROOM SERVICE: Back in my room with my wife, we wanted to order some in room dining; thus, called room service. When we asked for a menu, we were told they were about to close the kitchen and were given a few options to choose from. I found it kind of odd that a 5 star hotel wouldn't have 24hr room service but we ended up ordering two burgers and the rest of the night went without incident.\n\nCONFIRMATION: The next morning I went to confirm that the room change was scheduled properly for the next day (can't ever be too careful after the wrong room incident). I was told by front desk (different staff now) that it said I would be offered a suite \"If available\". I explained the situation to the front desk person, I was told everything would be scheduled automatically and that I should leave my bags packed because they would take care of it. They did as promised.\n\nJUNIOR SUITE: On the 3rd day, we arrived late to the hotel since we went to a Jazz Club, we asked for our new room keys and after a small back and forth and explanation were given our keys. We found our bags in the suite and everything seemed fine until we decided to take a bath after a long day. As soon as we opened the faucet to the bathtub Yellow Brown disgusting water came out, we let it run for a little while and decided to cancel the bath time.\n\n2nd ROOM SERVICE: We then decided to order room service once again and no one picked up the phone for some time. Eventually someone picked up the phone but they just dialed some numbers and hung up. We decided to order Pizza.\n\nCOCKROACH: After the pizza arrived, we ate in the living room part of the suite, wife went to bed, turned off most lights and I followed her about 10 minutes later. When I moved the bed sheets to lay down I felt something sting my hand, I jerked away the sheet and saw a large cockroach crawling on it. I shaked the bed sheet to make it fall from it and killed with my shoe on the floor. (attaching picture)\n\n2nd COMPLAINT: I called front desk multiple times until someone picked up. I asked to please talk to the manager on duty. I very calmly explained to the manager the situation from day 1 until this moment, I explained how this was not the experience I expected from a 5 star hotel I told her I really wanted to leave this hotel and asked what she would do in my case. She told me she wouldn't want to sleep in that bed and that she was sending me keys to a new room immediately. Since it was late already, I agreed.\n\n3rd AND FINAL ROOM: We were moved to another room but it was once again a regular room not a suite. I decided to research a little and find somewhere else to go the next day.\n\nCHECK OUT: The next morning we came down with our bags to check out before the 7 days we were supposed to stay there. I asked once again to speak to the manager on duty and explained once again the whole story which by now she seemed to have received some sort of note from the night manager.\n\nI told her I wanted to check out and was planning to move to another hotel and asked if they could hold my large bag until I checked into a new hotel. She apologized for the experience and told me that \"every night you didn't spend in the room you booked, I won't be charged for.\" to which I replied \"that's every night\" and she said: \"Yes, your stay will be complimentary\". Without further ado I moved to another hotel, which was amazing from the beginning and a true 5 star experience.\n\nFINAL CHARGES: Even though I was told the stay would be complimentary by the last manager I spoke to, there seems to be a permanent charge in my card for a partial amount. I don't know if I will be reimbursed or not in the end for my whole stay,  but for now some charges are there though not all.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n1) I expect a proper apology and maybe some type of courtesy note from management to let me know they're sorry for this mistake. At least in a 5 star hotel in front of central park in Manhattan.\n2) This is personal, but I have decided not to stay again at a Marriott property in the near future. This experience has shown me that their top management doesn't have top quality customer service in mind.\n3) Even though the hotel managers resolved the issue at the moment and were very understanding and kind, I cannot recommend staying at this hotel to anyone because you run the risk of a similar situation happening to you and could ruin a potential vacation.\n\nSorry for the long review but it's a series of events that needed to be unfolded.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Spectacular interior, hall, elevator.\n\nTHE \u2018story\u201d:\n\n- We arrived very late at night, waiting for the transfer at JFK in vain. We asked the hotel to send a taxi for us, they did not send anyone, although they asked what extras we needed. No problem. Welcome!\n\n- There was a beautiful snowfall, minus 2 Celsius, we were freezing a bit\u2026 we would like to have had a hot tea or hot soup in the hotel at arrival but were told there was no longer a CHEF in the kitchen.\nInteresting answer... a hot tea could have been solved somehow.\n\n- It was barely 20 degrees in the suite, no heating at all. The marble bath has no heating (neither technically and physically), the hot shower would heat you up.\n\n- One of the curtain did not work. Never fixed.\n\n- We asked for a private driver and guide for a sightseeing next day.  The driver was only a driver, no guiding, we thought it was a kind of 2 in 1. It wasn\u2019t. He is only talking about how expensive the city is.\nHe took us twice along the river.  Where we asked him to take us, he did not want to go because there was a lot of traffic on the bridge and he could not park there.\nAfter it turned out we understand HUGO's native language, he hung up the phone with \u201cAMOR\u201d.  He seemed to be offended, we should rather run away from that point. We only requested the service for 3 hours (that was the minimum ride), so another insult for him.  He decided not to talk at all, if\/when he did, he was more unfriendly, almost aggressive.\n\nWe have made a feedback at the hotel about the SIGHTSEEING that we asked for BUT we were informed by the Concierge (who organised the tour) that we misunderstood her\u2026 the tour with a guide would have been more expensive. What? It was barely $ 90 for an hour.  The 3 hours still came out at $ 320.  Oh yeah, HUGO -originally from Columbia - was a real unintelligent one who hated his work, in the end he does not even say goodbye to us.\nWe thank you for the \u201cwonderful\u201d absolutely and definitely tourist scraper production.\n\n- Returning back to the hotel in the evening, frozen again, decided to sit in the bar for a hot tea. After waiting 10 minutes at the table for someone to come and to at least great us (in vain of course),  went back to our room. The bar was overcrowded with a total of 3 people but the staff was far too busy to ask us what on earth we were sitting around.\n\nWe are THE  problem again.  Fckg European tourists!! They want to be served. Incredible. Even the idea. In a 5-star hotel ?? No way.\n\n- Hotel cleanliness : There is no particular problem with except that my clean pajamas were put on the dirty suitcase after cleaning.  No worries.  Covid, virus, pandemic, quarantine\u2026 take it easy !\n\n- Room service: perfect, polite. We drank a lots of hot tea with honey in the evenings.  The only one star I give is only for them.\n\nSoooo sad because we have wonderful memories of the same hotel chain in Vienna, Europe.  There is no \u201cwe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here, we\u2019re grateful you chose us\u201d feeling here in New York.\n\nLast night we got a farewell (means: thank you to leave finally and don\u2019t bother us more) champagne and desserts that we couldn\u2019t consume because we went for a covid test.\n\nIt is a shame because the organization of the trip itself and the whole paperwork is very complicated and expensive due to the covid situation.  BUT we wanted to go.  Maybe he should not have to.\n\nI have waited 30 years for this journey, this travel was my birthday present, we wanted to bring out the most and the most beautiful memories of these 3 days and I decided that I will enjoy every minute\u2026 But overall unfortunately I am we are disappointed.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We have been to NYC many times an always trying new hotels throughout Manhattan & Brooklyn.  \n\nReason why it's 4.5 due to shortage of bathroom amenities and lack of responses with advance request via Mobile App.  We had to contact housekeeping upon checking due to advance request did not happen.  Staffs quickly delivered the requested items.  Throughout the stay, hotel did not have body wash due to supply shortage.  We also did not have any view even with advance booking and a Titanium Lifetime member.  I also have suite nights upgrades and did not happen.  I understand the holiday season, so this is a slim to none unless you pay full price for the room upfront.\n\nNow that the negative feedback is done, the positives are location, staff, services and decoration.\n\n- Location: definitely convenience of walking to key attractions, shopping, restaurants, museums.  Of course, taking the subway is only a 5min walk to Columbus circle and other stations nearby.  10min Walking over to 5th Ave to experience the Xmas window decoration was nice!\n\n- Staffs & services: Genuinely friendly, especially upon check-in.  Front desk staff took the time to acknowledge and provide explanations of why my suite upgrade request could not be accommodated along with the view of Central park rooms.  Housekeeping and the rest of the staffs are also friendly with a smile!   Room is well maintained, clean upon check-in.  \n\n- Restaurant:  It's odd the hotel restaurant does not open to serve foods\/dinner before 5pm.  You could order drinks all you want but not foods until after 5pm for dinner.  We found out due to one night we wanted to eat at the hotel restaurant due to Broadway show time.  We ended up rushing to a nearby restaurant we had dinner the night before for a quick bite before heading to the show we booked that evening.  Services is great but it does get very busy pretty much every night.  We always stop by for a drink or two and desserts after coming back from a show or sightseeing around town.  Nice way to \"chillax\".. before calling it a night.\n\n- Execs lounge: Only open for buffets breakfast and not in the afternoon for happy hours or Hors d 'Oeuvres due to COVIDS.  Good foods and services with a smile.  Love the option of drip coffee and separate coffee machines for express, cappuccino, etc.  Lots of options including fruits and healthy options to choose from so you do not have to repeat eggs with bacons or sausages every morning.\n\n- Room:  Clean, comfortable beds, no noises could be heard from adjacent rooms or above which is wonderful for a good night sleep\/rest!   \n\n- Wi-Fi:  The room we stayed in has practically no or very poor Wi-Fi connection!  We did contact staff with the problem but could not resolve.  You have to stand near the entry or the hallway in front of the bathroom to good connectivity.  When sitting on the beds, signal is in and out.  The rest of the time, we ended using cell phone service provide signal to check emails or travel itinerary.  I hope this issue could be resolved in the future.  I understand some rooms will have this issue, no matter which hotel and we happen to get this room on this trip.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel itself is beautiful and is what you would expect of an older NYC hotel. \n\nOur room (the Manhattan Suite #3310) was beautiful. At approx 700 square feet, we had plenty of room. The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. The bathroom was well appointed, however the shower was a little on the small side - but had great water pressure! The bathroom amenities were also great. \n\nThe room did not have a mini bar or coffee making facilities - something I\u2019d expect from a five star hotel. Maybe it is a covid thing - not sure, but a little annoying. You can always call room service for anything you need, just be prepared to pay for it.\n\nWe also had access to the Executive Lounge during our stay. We visited it once during the day and it was a little disappointing. There was only coffee\/tea on offer and everything else was out of stock. \n\nThe staff we encountered during our actual stay were helpful and friendly. \n\n\u2014- The experience \u2014-\n\nWe had booked a one night stay via the Marriott Website. My husband is a Platinum Elite with Bonvoy (Marriott\u2019s loyalty program).\n\nWe booked a Central Park View Room (King) - for our stay, this room was charged to us at just over $1000 USD (including taxes). \n\nAfter booking we decided to use one of our Suite Nite Awards to see if we could get an upgrade to a Junior Suite . This was honored pretty quickly by the hotel and we got upgraded to the Junior Suite (King), \n\nUpon confirmation of the upgrade, I messaged the hotel to request a 4pm checkout. According to the Marriott Bonvoy app, Platinum Elite are Guaranteed a 4pm late checkout (see picture from Bonvoy app). The person I was chatting too via the Bonvoy app (at the hotel) told me that we could have a 2pm as late check outs were not Guaranteed - even though their own app tells me it is! After a discussion I simply asked them to leave a note on file that we\u2019d like to chat with a manager during checking. \n\nThe person I was speaking to (a manager apparently) was not very professional nor helpful. \n\nWe\u2019ve been with Bonvoy for years and their program really doesn\u2019t deliver on the benefits they advertise and after spending $1000 per night for this room, I was not about to let it go! I do not like having to beg to get the advertised benefits, the hotels should know what each member is entitled to and deliver on it without question. If hotels have an issue with it, they need to take it up with corporate. \n\nAfter giving them a bad review on Facebook, we were quickly contacted and given a 4pm checkout. Upon checking our booking we noticed that we had been further upgraded to the Manhattan suite - I\u2019m guessing they had already sold the Junior Suite to another customer on the day we were checking out. We also got an email from the hotel advising us that whilst late checkouts are not Guaranteed, they would honor it this time.\n\nThe hotel also included a web link to the benefits of Bonvoy by tier. Whilst every tier did state \u201c*subject to availability), it did not state this for the Platinum Elite group and the data on this website differs from that in their own app. Their attempt to prove a point failed (see attached). I\u2019m going to take a guess that the genius responsible for their websites\/app had missed the \u201c*subject to availability) note on the Platinum Elite section. \n\nI did point this out to the hotel, but it seems they were not interested, rather they will have to constantly deal with issues like this. \n\nI\u2019m constantly disappointed by Marriott hotels and their Bonvoy program. The Bonvoy program was clearly created by a marketing team with zero ability to consult with hotels. This entire experience was the last straw for us - we\u2019ve now decided to ditch the program and focus on AirBNB or a status match with IHG or Hilton. \n\nSo to sum up, hotel and room would have received a 5\/5 rating, the experience should receive a 1\/5.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Managers (Housekeeping and Front of the house) did not resolve an urgent matter that could have resulted in much more - Infant found broken glass, and no one cared to do anything about it.\nSituation: My 15 month old son found broken glass on the floor of the room (grabbed it near a chair and threw it near me). Managers were told about the situation (all of them present at the lobby of the hotel on 11\/17), apologized, and promised to clean the room again in 40 minutes when we would be away at dinner. When we came back the room was the same, but what was even more surprising was that we found a, even bigger, sharper piece of broken glass (thankfully before our son did). I called service immediately and when I spoke to the Manager, she said 'I remember you from earlier, you are saying the room was not cleaned? I am surprised because the Housekeeping manager was there when you let us know about the broken glass.) Given the time of day, my wife spent 10 minutes looking for more glass before we could put our son to bed. The manager let us know they would clean the room thoroughly next day in the morning, however, no one came to clean anything until noon. The manager threw some 'Bonvoy' points, which I did not even ask for or agree to, this to 'fix' the situation.\nI would not recommend this hotel for a family stay.

The location is a favorite being directly across from Central Park.  While this is my second stay at the property, neither time have I lucked into a room facing the park.  To be transparent, both of my stays were booked using Marriott points.  Anytime I book with points, the room is hardly ever the nicest they offer.  \nBy New York standards, room 1222 is a spacious King with nice closet space.  It is appointed with a desk\/chair, chase and the counterpace in the bathroom is plenty for one person.  The shower is on the small size but worked for me.  The bed was comfortable.  They fulfilled my request for foam pillows as I find all Marriott properties pillows less than ideal but the foam provides a little better support.  The bathroom products were of good quality and plentiful.  Never did I need to request additional soaps, towels or such.  The robe and slippers were comfortable as well.  \nThe room faces a brick building so the view is nothing worth commenting on other than to say it\u2019s private.  No worries of anyone seeing into your room.  I could look up and see sunshine but it would have been nice to enjoy a view, even of a street \u2013 if nothing more than to let a little light in.  I found it odd that there was no clock nor in-room coffee\/tea.  I thought certain in-room amenities were standard for such a property.  There also is an empty space in the tv cabinet that seems to have once stored a mini-fridge.  However, there is a cut out in the bottom of the cabinet which makes it unusable for storage.  \nWhile the room is near the elevator, I didn\u2019t find there to be any issue with noise.  Even with weekend travelers, it was quiet.  While the elevators are on the small size, there are several of them, and I never had to wait more than a minute.  The executive lounge adjacent the lobby restaurant offered coffee, tea and breakfast options.  I only went down each morning for coffee and to grab a couple bottles of water.  It was a spacious lounge.  The coffee is Lavazza which is fairly good.  The tea was limited to a few Tazo selections.  It would have been nice to see a higher quality tea and a little more variety of flavors.  While I enjoy coffee in the morning, an evening cup of herbal tea would have been lovely.  I did not eat breakfast but the bagels looked delicious.  \nThe staff was pleasant.  Nothing to note, good nor bad.  The JW Essex is a historical hotel and I can say that at other historical hotels I have stayed, the staff was a little more personal.  \nI would stay again at the JW Essex.  As mentioned, the location is lovely. The accommodations are nice.

They were running on what felt like skeletal staff, there was hardly anyone around and we were put in the smallest room which barely fit the travel cot we requested for our daughter to sleep in. There was no fridge in the room - we had to request one so I could store breast milk) - when it arrived it didn't actually fit in the cupboard designated for it so it had to be placed in under the desk so you could no longer sit at the desk. I asked guest services if it would be possible to have a kettle in the room so I c an prepare my daughter's food and was told that guest services was closed (its was 5pm) and that I could purchase a bottle warmer from Macy's as the hotel couldn't provide boiling water( the restaurant was also closed) and they don't have kettles 'to her knowledge'. After complaining about the terrible service and the tiny room for 2 adults and a baby we were upgraded to a suite by the lovely manager Alan. He was great and profusely apologised about our experience and was able to locate a bottle warmer for us. However, inspite of the lovely upgrade I hated the entire experience. The rooms felt dirty and weren't cleaned properly, the decor of the hotel as a whole but also the rooms was very dated and honestly for the price we paid ($750 for 2 nights) it was really not worth a penny at all!\n\nIn addition, the breakfast - a. JOKE! They trick you by telling you on arrival you have $30 towards extras at breakfast because we opted fro breakfast to be inclusive and I'll tell you now that $30 only covers a drink for 2 people. The buffet breakfast was vile and flies were all over the pastries, they had a selection of continental breakfast options but everything looked stale and not fresh - we went down fro breakfast at 8am and it opens at 6:30am. In the end we ordered from the menu at the restaurant and everything came out cold and tasted very below average. Sadly, I will never stay at this hotel again and considering its supposed to be such a well known hotel I was thoroughly disappointed.

As the highest level of Marriott Loyalty status (Ambassador Elite) I am still dumbfounded by the Essex house\u2019s lackluster dedication to customer service and health concerns. In June, I booked a stay at this property to celebrate my wife\u2019s birthday. I had my Ambassador assist me with this booking in hopes of having the best possible stay. At arrival I was greeted by a lovely receptionist. Her name escapes me, but she was Filipino and was the only reason this review was given more than 1-star. Unfortunately, the rest of the stay was incredibly disappointing. Typically, with status I have access to the lounge, which was only partially true, at the Essex House. The first afternoon of arrival they \u201cclosed\u201d the lounge for some unknown reason. When I inquired, no one had any answers. For all the reviews about how knowledgeable and helpful the staff that I\u2019ve read about this property it could not have been further from the truth during my stay. Onto the most egregious and unbelievable experience was upon my return home the following day. Shortly after having arrived home I noticed my leg was itchy. After further investigation it appeared as though I had bug bites. The same was found on my wife\u2019s legs as well. BED BUGS! I contacted the hotel promptly to notify them of this. During my phone conversation with the receptionist, I was told that the manager on duty was gone for the day and that a message would be left for that person when they return the following day. I emphasized on this call the importance of making sure that any other guests who might currently be in our same room be notified. I was told the manager would contact me the following day. To my surprise two days had passed before, I had to follow up. ME! The hotel guests who had bites on OUR legs had to escalate the concern with A SECOND phone call. The hotel then tried connecting me with the manager. Her name is Laura B. Laura shared with me that other hotel guests were staying in our room and that they could not enter to conduct a bedbug inspection until they checked-out. Once they did, she would have their \u201cspecialist\u201d come in to provide an assessment and follow up with me regarding the findings. Guess what happened next? NOTHING. No follow, yet again. Quite the showing from management here so far, right? Anyhow, after I called to personally follow up again because our legs were still itching, I finally hear back. I was told that the inspection found no bedbugs, but the official report could not be shared with me. Instead, Laura offered to open a case and pass me onto Lourdes M and Carlos M. After multiple email exchanges and scheduled call times to discuss \u2013 no one ever followed up. Shocking? Not really. As previously stated, this lack of concern and follow up doesn\u2019t quite live up to the JW name most of us have come accustomed to. Bottom line - do not stay at this hotel. You\u2019ve been warned - if you get bedbug bites during your stay at the JW Essex House no one will care.

This July was horrendous. Pre pandemic we traveled extensively. Now, wanting to dip a toe into the travel scene again, we have booked a few trips. We still do have our Marriott platinum status. \nI can\u2019t begin to describe the horrible nature of our recent stay at this hotel. We were given a room after a long flight that had been flooded the night before. There were four intense hot blowers in the room blowing hot air everywhere, and yet we were given this room. We went to the front desk they gave us another room. This room was like an icebox box - literally. The temperature would not go above 63\u00b0. We finally had the engineer come, and he said oh well the heat is off in the hotel. Nothing I can do. Finally our third room was acceptable but we had other problems. There was no staff for the front desk, with one person and 30 people trying to check in. No room service. The restaurant was open limited hours with limited food. Our problem was just a total lack of personnel or any interest in making our stay even minimally acceptable.  I won\u2019t even mention all the details about the valet that did not deliver our car for 45 minutes past the requested time and we requested it the night before. Needless to say, our drive to Newark airport was filled with anxiety due to their lack of competency.  \nRun run run away!!  Do not stay here!  ","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were there Memorial Day weekend and mask wearing was still required inside the hotel. The hotel restaurant was closed. This hotel has a great view of Central Park from almost any floor. We, unfortunately, were using Marriott points and had a view of the inner shaft. If you stay here, the rooms are expensive to begin with. You should pay a bit extra and to have a view of the park. The service was lackluster. When we arrived at the front door, there was no one to take our car or bags. We went inside to check in and waited about 30 minutes total for a valet to take our keys. My wife and I wanted to attend mass our first morning there at a nearby RC church. The lady behind the front desk was very cheery but she spent at least 10 minutes to find a church. She handed us a sheet of paper that had the name and address of the church but not the mass times. She was clearly new and not well trained. The room was spacious for New York and had the look of faded luxury. There was a marble bath but the grout was missing between some of the marble on the floor. A chaise lounge was very worn with material missing on a section of the piping. There was a covid breakfast at no additional charge. The breakfast selections were limited by covid restrictions, but there was a good selection of fruit, cereals and pastries. The coffee was self service with a multi-functional machine to dispense espresso, cappuccino, etc. While sipping our cappuccinos, we missed the barista made brew we are used to almost anywhere in France and Italy and at most upscale hotels in America.

During the pandemic, we have stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel, Aloft, Hilton Millennium, and JW Marriott Essex House is hands down the most comfortable, safe and beautiful place to stay. Not only is it perfectly located on Central Park South so you can get all the exercise and fresh air you need every day, but you are also a block or 2 from Columbus Circle where all the shops are open and the best Whole Foods I\u2019ve ever been to is located downstairs. We were able to get groceries for our son any time because WF is open early and closes late. If the endless cold and hot selection at WF is not enough for you, we were able to order anything we craved from DoorDash and UberEats AND the hotel staff would bring our orders to our room. Housekeeping was available every day until 2:30pm but we didn\u2019t bother because our suite was provided with enough amenities and towels from the first day. I have Marriott status so we were upgraded to a junior suite from the King room I had booked and we were given a beautiful room (no view, but a girl can\u2019t get everything she wants in Manhattan all the time) but we needed a bathtub for our baby and the room was huge but we needed to work so some division of space was preferable while our baby napped and played during the day. The staff was incredibly responsive and moved us to another suite immediately. Although the restaurant and other facilities was closed, there was always someone at reception and a bellman\/security at the front doors to help in whatever way they could. The hotel has a very convenient back entrance on 58th Street as well. Tons of COVID testing sites are around the hotel which was appreciated since we needed to get PCR and rapid tests to return to Europe, and the hotel staff printed out all our necessary documents we may need for our flight. The manager also approved a late checkout for us since our departing flight was at 8pm from JFK and so we were able to have our baby nap in our room and have sufficient time to pack up and tidy up before calling a Lyft. Drop off and pick up is also very convenient at this location because Centra Park South has so many lanes unlike most other NYC blocks. We benefited from very mild weather so we meandered through Central Park to feed the ducks, watch ice skaters and even walked up to the Museum of Natural History on 80th St which was open to the public by reservation. For the more touristy people, Rockefeller Center and Time Square are a short walk away.  The Apple Store is a block away as is the Plaza where I used to enjoy a fancy afternoon tea. Lincoln Center is also very close but closed because of COVID and for renovations. Our room provided a much needed respite and was very quiet and came with 2 big TVs so we were able to play YouTube kids videos on one while I watched HBO on the other! Lavazza coffee, bottled water, fresh fruit and other snacks like KIND bars were provided every morning until 11am and was much appreciated for us jetlagged travelers! The hotel is gorgeous and incredibly clean and well kept so we enjoyed our stay thoroughly. We have stayed at the JW Marriott in Hong Kong so it was nice to see some familiarity\/consistency like in the Aromatherapy bathroom products. On our second day, the hotel staff gave our baby a puzzle and little stuffed animals which he absolutely loved, so thank you again! I would recommend booking this hotel before prices go up again once borders open up and tourists flood back into NYC!","travelDate":"2021-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We drove our car to the hotel and valeted it. While we reside in NYC, I am initially from the Midwest, and therefore, my photo ID reflects that. The hotel associate asked me for the airport paperwork that must be filled out when visiting NY and I told her that I live in NY and therefore do not have paperwork. She accepted my response and promptly checked us in and even gave us late check out at 1 PM. We then rode up the elevator to our room. We walked into our room and found the bed covered in about 50 throw pillows and numerous stacked ice buckets and trays piled on the desk. I called down to the front desk to ask for a room change, as it seemed that we were accidentally given a room used for storage. An associate met us at our room with a new key for a new room on the same floor. I was secretly hoping for an upgrade at this point since the initial room was not acceptable. We were shown to our new room which was the same size as the first one. We quickly unpacked a few things and ordered an Uber to go to our dinner reservation in the Financial District. As we waited for the elevator to arrive, the same hotel associate reappeared and to our surprise, he said that his manager had approved an upgrade for us (we had not expressed our interest in one) to make up for their mistake with our first room. We were already running late to our dinner reservation so we accepted the upgrade as well as his offer to move our belongings to the new room. \nThe new room was slightly larger and had a gorgeous view of Central Park. However, I did find the room to be rather outdated in its design. Additionally, the bathroom was outfitted with a bathtub\/shower combo and the bathtub was very high. At seven months pregnant, it was difficult for me to step in and out of the bathtub. There was no fan in the bathroom, resulting in the bathroom getting rather foggy and steamy when showering.\nThe TV responded quite slowly to the remote and did not have such a great selection of channels. \nLastly, throughout the night we were able to hear noise from the street below and it disturbed our sleep.\nWhen it was time to check out the following day, the hotel associate at the front desk offered to email me the receipt for our stay. Once in the car and on our way, I opened the email and found that we were charged a $382 room change charge as well as $95 oversized car valet charge (the car in question is a 2016 Honda Pilot). I immediately called the front desk to dispute the room change charge and after much back and forth they agreed to refund the $382. \nFrom all the glitches and lack of professionalism displayed by this hotel, I would not return or recommend this hotel to anyone. I sincerely hope that the category 8 Marriott hotels reopen soon.","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Beyond the location, this hotel pales in comparison to the Grosvenor House in every other possible measure. Despite being lifetime platinum members at Marriott, we received extremely poor service from the front desk. Makes me wonder what service non members can expect to receive. We had complained about the service the previous time we stayed there too and were dismayed to see that there had been no improvement. We arrived pretty late - past 2am after almost 24 hrs of travel. Despite there being 3 people at the front desk, not one of them raised their head to acknowledge the fact that we were there. We eventually went up to one of them and without raising her head to greet us her first response was go to the next person. This next person made it feel like we were interrupting her more important work and dejectedly asked to see ID - no smile, no welcome, no how can I help you. We complained about this and asked to see the manager who was more welcoming and understood our level of disappointment given how tired we were. The rooms were tiny, the Grosvenor House makes us feel special especially because of our status and always goes out of their way to give us the best available upgrades. No such luck at the Essex house, we got a tiny room on the 3rd floor. Service doesn't even stand up to Courtyard standards, let alone JW standards. Front office staff is extremely poorly trained and unfriendly. Overall - avoid. Stay at the Ritz on CPS if you have to be on the park instead. Service","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

We were here on business and pleasure. Our room was on the 5th floor and faced 58th street. We've stayed at other JW Marriott hotels, but lately, we've noticed a drop in the level of service\/quality.\n\nPros: location, the staff was attentive and friendly. Our room was well-appointed and supplied robes, slippers and bathroom amenities. The hotel was decorated nicely for the holidays.\n\nCons regarding the room: no full-length mirror (only 1 mirror in bathroom), very small closet, drafty (windows not sealed) to the point of us catching colds even though windows were closed and blinds were drawn the entire time.\n\nCons regarding the executive lounge: 2 out of the 4 days shoo-ed us out right at 11 a.m. so they could use the space for a reception for a conference. On another day they ended breakfast an hour early. On 2 of the days, we were not allowed to enter the lounge until 5 pm (we usually have access to the lounge all day to get drinks and snacks).  Management decided to prioritize some company's conference's needs over the Customers who pay for the Executive Lounge. This was not a good move on Management's part - I was not the only upset customer.  Finally, the Executive Lounge (during breakfast on Friday) felt more like a circus\/Marriott-like as it was filled with mostly families with young children.  Having stayed at JW Marriotts elsewhere, we've never seen either of these things happen before.\n\nNote: charging $35 per day \"resort fee\" was a bit ridiculous, in my opinion.  (This is another thing that made it feel more like a Marriott than a JW Marriott.) We didn't have time to use the gym, so what is that fee for?  We found out we could apply a portion of it to charges made in the bar (charged to our room) and to laundry.  The prices in the hotel bar were high, even by San Francisco standards ($16 for a shot of Frangelico).\n\nThere is a back door in the hotel that opens onto 58th street which is useful, especially when it is raining. This is a nice hotel, however, it appears the JW Marriott brand is being diluted - it's not in the same class as the St. Regis which is a truly deserving of a 5-star rating.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":455186,"title":"A lot of room for improvement ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-11-28","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"So, we typically stay at the Parker meridian when we stay in midtown manhattan but now that hotel is not longer a Starwood property and is, in fact, split into 2 hotels. So, this time we chose the Essex house b\/c we can earn & use marriott points. There were 5 of us: a teen son & our adult son\/girlfriend, my husband and myself. We need to have 3 separate living spaces with preferably 3 bathroom options [like double room for our adult son & gf and perhaps a suite with 2 bathrooms or adjoining rooms for the teen and us]. But best we could do during this thanksgiving week was a suite w\/ pull out be in living room, and two doors into the 1 shared bathroom + the double room for adult son\/gf. The hotel was sold out so we did not have a lot of options\u2014that was the set up for our 5 night stay.\n\nThe good: the suite was quite large, both the bedroom and living room and fairly nicely updated. Since we could not get a 2 bathroom suite & they had no more adjoining situations, the 2 doors into the bathroom were helpful. [It is much more awkward when the teen has to go thru our bedroom to get to bathroom]. The bathroom had a separate walk in shower & tub, also preferable, but it would have been more functional if the toilet was separate from the main bathroom so someone could be showering while someone else used toilet. Bed very comfortable, the safe big enough for anything you want to store electronics wise. Walk in closet, desk, all laid out well. Very quiet too, though i will say our room overlooked basically to interior of utility area of hotel. Some machine clatter but pretty muted with windows closed. Not sure what it would\u2019ve been like for room overlooking street with traffic noise. Also, good location b\/c right across street from central park & about 10ish blocks to Times Square & broadway [which is why we were here to see several shows]. Staff is fairly responsive, if a bit slow, to requests but see below.\n\nNow the bad: lobby was a bit dowdy & dead. There is a restaurant off the lobby but we couldn\u2019t for life of us use it b\/c it always seemed about to close when we might want late bite\/drink\/snack etc. there was an area outside of the restaurant to sit and maybe have drink but the one time we were there, there were dirty glasses and dishes on every table\/coffee table etc. and we sat there for almost 2 hours one evening about 9-11pm and no one came out to move dishes, offer us a drink or whatever. It was just odd & off putting. We ended up going into restaurant and just harassing people to give us items\u2014water, menu drinks & then we would carry out. No one offered to help or come out or ever walked out the door. Just odd.\n\nThough the rooms are fairly roomy and nicely decorated, i found it a bit shabby at the corners. Chipped baseboards, some discoloration on tiles, grubby grout-not new looking bath mats etc. wouldn\u2019t take much to make it look crisp but clearly no one cared. I also had a problem with cleanliness of bathrooms. Debris on the floor, not very clean under toilet. That old bath mat actually had specs of dirt or something on it and the next day when the room was \u201cCleaned\u201d the specs never got vacuumed. Finally, i just called down and asked to replace bath mat b\/c who wants to walk around barefoot on that? The pull out couch in living room was VERY uncomfortable with old mattress with springs almost poking through and it kind of curled up like a lumpy taco. The first morning after my son slept on it, he talked about feeling really uncomfortable all night & usually he sleeps like the dead. So we tried to see if they could bring in a new mattress and they couldn\u2019t. They offered a rollaway but then the whole point of a EXPENSIVE suite with living room would have become moot with bed set up in the free space. Finally, they brought 2 mattress pads & then you could not close the pull out with out stripping off the pads & piling in the corner. Anyway, you get the picture\u2014just not a functional situation when you are paying through the nose for a suite. Last thing, housekeeping was VERY sporadic and in the 4th day of being there, our room was not cleaned at least once, we made up the pull out at least 3 times, and, when cleaned, dirty dishes were not cleared etc. it was just not a thorough cleaning. So, i dont think i will stay here again. It was as expensive as a top tier hotel, but not run like a top tier hotel.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We didn't actually take it, so we were credited. Room service was $50 for coffee, 2 English muffins, fruit and \"homemade\" granola--which came in a Kellogg's box.

However, the price of a suite went up to $3k there and it's just not worth that.  So we tried the Essex House and it was great.  It was a third the price of the Mandarin and just as nice.  We had a one bedroom suite with a Central Park View.  The view was out the bedroom window only for the park but that was adequate.  We asked and there are some rooms that have better and more expansive views.  The bed was comfortable.  The suite only had one bathroom but we managed without the powder room we usually had at the MO.  The shower was extremely powerful and it heated up immediately.  There was no hand held sprayer.  There was a sprayer next to the toilet like you see in some countries.  We had room service breakfast every day and it was perfect.  The mini bar was extremely expensive so I wouldn't recommend that.  It was $10 for a small bottle of water.  Club soda was $20!  Whole Foods is just down the street.  It is in a great location for walking to tons of things.  It's easy to get a cab or uber from there.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

We were welcomed at the front desk and asked if we wanted an interior room or one that overlooked Central Park. The staff member even walked us to the elevator and gave us a little mini tour of the amenities. The room was lovely, the bathroom was clean, with ample towels, and the plush terry cloth robes were hung on the back of the door ready to be used.  I requested a room away from the elevators and quiet. That is exactly what we received! So thrilled!!! We had drinks in the bar after we return from the opera. The bartender was very busy but very attentive...a true professional.  The housekeeping staff was wonderful and helpful. We had breakfast in the Executive lounge and it was probably the most extensive buffet that I have seen in   an executive lounge.  The offering of an array of high quality fresh fruit and breads\/pastries was impressive. The usual scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon was on par. I have to comment that the valet service was so helpful and professional. We really had such a lovely stay from start to finish. The location of this hotel is also a high point. We walked to dinner and then to Lincoln Center to the MET Opera. We also walked to   Columbus Circle for lunch at Bouchon and for some shopping. It is an easy walk to 5th Avenue and a bit longer walk but manageable walk to Times Square. It\u2019s also great for families eith the close proximity to the Natural History Museum, MET Art, and Central Park.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is no view, it\u2019s very plain, just like a little diner or something.

And each time I leave feeling like they are doing me a favor by allowing me to stay there. And honestly, that's really just due to the attitude of the front desk staff. It's as if I'm trying to gain access to some exclusive Hollywood Club, and the front desk is the bouncer. Why do I say that? \n\nOver this past year, I've seen my Bonvoy status grow from a baseline \"member\" to silver elite to (now) gold elite. And yet I've never noticed any difference in the treatment or welcome from the front desk. Now, I realize I'm not a super high level yet...but you'd think a little recognition would be nice. I'm not asking for special treatment. Even an explanation of what my status will get me at that property would be nice (even if it's nothing). And this past week the front desk agent greeted me with, \"have you stayed here before...or been here many times?\"  Seriously? You can't take a moment to look and see that I've stayed there many times? A simple, \"welcome back\" would be appropriate. Is this the end of the world? No. But seems like a baseline effort could have been made.\n\nAs far as room assignments, it's always a challenge. My simple request (quiet room not up against the elevators) seems to challenge them every time I check in. It took at least 7 minutes to find me a room. (Next to me, people were being checked in left and right...with no issues.) Again, I feel like they are doing me a favor. And why do I make this request? Because some rooms are up against the elevator and so it's hard to sleep. And some rooms on lower floors near the busy street so they are loud. Is this unique to NYC? No. But when soundproofing isn't great, it makes it hard to sleep. Also, some rooms have much better layouts. That can make a huge difference having extra space...or an actual shower stall (rather than bathtub combo). Over the many stays I've had, I've learned that asking for a quiet room is incredibly important. The response I got from the desk agent, \"we are nearly sold out tonight.\" Fun fact...I've heard that response every time I check in. Sigh.\n\nThe front desk sets the tone for the visit. And unfortunately after years of giving this place a chance, I've decided to shift my stays to another property. So after checking in, I promptly called and canceled my upcoming 4 night stay in November and shifted to another hotel. \n\nThere are lovely folks working at the hotel...from the staff in the restaurant, to housekeeping to the concierge desk...but the front desk is really the face of the hotel and they need to make some improvements there from an attitude standpoint. \n\nNot much more I can say. No turn down service (unless you request it - which I did and they still didn't come). I noticed room service trays in the hall in the evening and the same trays still in the hall when I left in the AM. The end of the world? No...but for these prices that shouldn't happen. \n\nLots of room for improvement, especially at these prices. Until that happens, I'll have to stay elsewhere.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location is about as good as it get in NYC--on the park, close to many venues and restaurants of interest and many of the GREAT museums.  The traffic in front of it can be very heavy and it messes up the cabs and Lyft drivers--they can't seem to figure out how to get the car pointed in the right direction to drop you off at the front door!   I had the Lyft drive drop me off at the park side and waked to the light to cross--as did a number of people I talked to.  To Jay walk here is to have a death wish!\n\nThe lobby is nice, but not a great one.  The front desk is efficient and does the hotel proud--no stupid mistakes.  Checking bags is a piece of cake--the bellmen are alert.  The elevators are conveniently located and there is a guard to make certain you are staying in the hotel--it makes you feel safe!   \n\nThe coffee shop\/restaurant on the first floor is a good one--very expensive, but attractive and has good food & service.  If you can get to eat in the Gold Member lounge, do it if you know someone staying at the hotel.  The breakfast food there is really good!\n\nThe rooms are \"standard\" but nice.  Very quiet for being in a major city.  The decorations are very good.  The prices are over the top expensive and the \"add on's\" are killers!   The taxes have to be the highest in the world!\n\nThis is a great hotel if you are on an expense account.  For what we were doing--meeting a lot of people one on one and in small groups--this was THE perfect hotel.  We had no complaints.  I am not certain I would use it for person travel--it is nice, but at that price.....","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We came in at around 11 35pm after the US Open tennis matches were over hoping to grab a glass of wine with some friends before bed.  We were ignored for 15 minutes after we sat down and finally I flagged the bartender.  He told me we are closed.  I asked him when they close and he said midnight, however last call is at 11 45.  I told him you have been watching us sit here for like 15 minutes and not waited on us??  His manager and his manager's manager all came over and instead of taking 5 seconds to pour two glasses of wine for us they argued with us for 15 minutes telling us to call room service..  Really pissed me off to pay $3000 to stay at this place and they can't comply with a simple customer service request???  The lobby manager looked like he was 18 yrs old and was very rude.  The wine itself is completely overpriced $25\/glass for a very poor cabernet, however I was willing to pay for it if someone would have waited on us....

With so many offers for a Marriott Bonvoi Titanium member, it's difficult to chose the \"right\" place. And my past experiences in NYC were quite a mixed bag. \nSo we decided to use the positive experience of my husband some years ago and booked the Essex House. \nFirst disappointment was the neglection of using our suite vouchers, due to zero availabilities. Then, when we checked in, we did not even receive an upgrade, as the hotel was fully booked. Unfortunately it was the US Open tournament and it seemed like everyone related to tennis was in this hotel...\nDespite my initial disappointment, I was positively surprised in the end! The king room we booked was a really good size and lovely decorated (seen much worse in NYC.  The bathroom was spacious and elegant, incl fluffy towels and bathrobe. I appreciated the gym classes at Exhale (part of the destination fee perks) and the executive lounge. Although I have to say, that the choice, quality and presentation of the food rather reminded me of a mass tourist hotel. \nStill it is nice to have breakfast and evening drinks sorted, in the hotel, if you don\u2019t go out.  The location is fantastic and the attitude of staff was very friendly, which I also had seen very different in NYC. \nSpecial thanks to Yamira at Front Desk and Michael and Kevin at Concierge Desk for adding a positive flavour to our enjoyable stay.

We had the family suite which had a large living room with a sectional sofa that pulled out into a bed, a desk and a walk-in closet.  The master bedroom was equally spacious and comfortable.  The view is not great when you get a family suite. You are probably looking down to a back alley, so request a high floor and look up at the sky. :)  The upside is that you will not likely hear any traffic noise.  Our suite was very quiet. \n\nWe took full advantage of the amenities provided with the daily $35 resort fee. I get why people have balked at the mandatory fee. But since you have to pay it, I figured we should get our money\u2019s worth.  my daughters took turns taking a daily exercise class at the Exhale studio which is a couple of doors down.  One class would usually cost more than $35. We also made use of the daily $30 laundry credit - very useful when we\u2019ve been on the road for two weeks. Lastly, we definitely used the $35 daily food\/drink credit at the restaurant or for room service.  \n\nI should recognize some staff members who made our stay extra nice. Yamira, Felix and Melvyn at Reception were exceptionally helpful, kind and responsive to my requests and questions.  The guys in the executive lounge, including Robert and Charly, worked hard, always with a genuine smile.  Concierge staff, including Michael, were very efficient and friendly.

After the ridiculous $35 daily resort fee, you will still find yourself paying for extraneous things with a sub-par room. If they give you \"executive lounge\" access for your Marriott status, don't be thrilled. It's nothing more than a sub-standard hotel breakfast that would almost match a Residence Inn. They don't even have an espresso machine to make espresso, lattes, or cappuccinos. And if you ask for one, they have to charge you. Only American, dirty water coffee is available. What sort of \"executive-ness\" is this? Additionally, in the evening, their appetizer offerings are barely edible and they have an \"Honor Bar\" where you are required to PAY for your drinks. I just came back from staying at a REGULAR Marriott where I was given access to their M-Club Lounge, and all drinks, wine, beer, liquor were complimentary. And now here at the JW in NYC they make you pay for them...I believe it was $12 for a glass of wine. I was appalled. \n\nAdditionally, when I checked in, the lady told me that my \"request\" for a high-floor room was honored by putting me on the 15th floor. Honey, the building goes up to 40-something floors and this isn't even half way up the building. Furthermore, I was in a tiny room that faced the back - to 58th street. No upgrade or mention of anything as I am a platinum elite member of Marriott Bonvoy. \n\nOH! And if you need to print something in the business center, YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT AS WELL. They charge you per sheet if you need to print something other than a boarding pass. I'm sorry, I thought this was the JW Marriott, not a Motel 6.......You pay more than $500 a night, and they charge you for a glass of wine in the lounge AND if you have to print something at the business center. What a rip off. \n\nThis JW Marriott is a fraud, and I won't be staying there ever again. You shouldn't either. \n\nPS - dont use the hotel Valet parking service because it is something ridiculous like $80 per day. You can park yourself a block away on 59th Street for half the price.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The woman from accounting who I spoke to offered very little concession in her stance on the matter expect to state that she would take it up with the hotel accounting department.

The location of the hotel across from Central Park and steps from all the Columbus Circle greatness is the best in NYC. \n\nNow the only negative and it was a dealbreaker. I was given an interior room for my 4 night stay with my family. After the first night I went to ask for a park room view. After unpacking for 4, this is a big decision. The lady at the desk was super accommodating and said they would move us. We just needed to pack and the luggage team would move everything for us. Nice touch. After a day in the sun and enjoying NYC we went back to re-check in. The man looked at my family and said \u201cyou need two beds?\u201d I agreed and was then informed that ALL rooms with two beds were interior... I asked if there was a suite where I could pay to upgrade. Nope, hotel full. It was a busy weekend. \n\nIf I would have known all rooms with two beds were interior I would have moved on to another property. \n\nIf you are looking for a room with one bed, I highly recommend this hotel.

Rooms are cozy, bathrooms are big and bright\n\nSerious Cons:\n1. No TEA MAKING HOT POT IN ROOM!!!!..ridiculous, totally ridiculous. If you paid i excess of $500 to stay here per night, they should be giving you this basic amenity of hot coffee of tea whenever you want , right in your room\n2. Staff is really lazy of non existent. If you phone reception from the room, they actually NEVER picked up. I tried 5 times at diff times.\n3. Room service menu is VERY TINY and VERY VERY expensive. We ordered 2 salads and they cost around $60 after adding in all their fees.\n4. LIFTS to the rooms are ancient and VERRRRRY slow.\n5. Concierge needs to IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY. = we took several of their suggestions and each was a huge flop..eating at various restaurants they suggested..so don't follow them, maybe they get commissions from their top suggestions or they havent eaten their in a while. It was truly a flop every single place they said to go. So do your OWN research and try nice places reviewed better\n7. There is NO WATER to DRINK in your room. YOU HAVE TO CARRY YOU WATER FROM THE RECEPTION UP TO YOUR ROOM or got to the gym and take a backpack and fill it and bring back as often as you need. NOT A LUXURY STAY for sure. be prepared. service is very poor here. Housekeeping was great room was clean enough, though we found a cigarrete butt under the sofa while searching for our shoes..\n8. They charge you a mandatory $32 fee PER DAY which is a super pain.\n\noverall I would say, that if you can use points and stay here do so, KNOWING you cant have hot water in your room, have to carry drinking water and also the unnecessary fee will be levied.\nOtherwise a great location.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I do think they should take out the mini fridge full of items & put in a usable mini fridge and coffee pot.  You'll pay $20+ in the morning to order a small pot of coffee from room service.  Finally, instead of guarding the property like prison wardens perhaps a better use of the doorman would be to put them by the doors & have them open the doors when people are obviously arriving with their suitcases.

We had a great time in the city but I give a very low score to this hotel because of the level of service we experience. I constantly stay at Marriotts, and in general get good service. This hotel has been a disappointing exception. A JW should have the highest level of customer service, mainly with their best customers of the Bonvoy program. This is not what this hotel demostrated. Since the checking the experience was very mechanical, and I had a feeling the staff was not really keen to have families (I have two 9 yo daughters) and is happier with business travelers. The worse part of the experience came on Saturday evening, when I called and asked for Ice and a new remote control because ours had depleted batteries. The lady answering the phone had not patience, and was quick on saying she would send both right away. The remote control came after 20 minutes, but after 45 min, we had no ice. I called again, and this time she was very unpolite saying I had to get the ice myself. No problem with that, but she could have told me the first time I called. She indicated me where to get the ice. I went there, the machine was broken. I called again asking where else I could get ice. She was even more impatient and said she would send the ice. After a while (and with no ice) I called again and told her I didn't need the ice anymore, since it has passed over an hour since my original request. I turn on the do not disturb signal and we went to bad. 15 minutes later, someone knocks on the door, with ice.... I called again to complaint because they woke up my kids, she was even more unpolite saying that I should be happy because I had the ice. I asked to be transferred to the manager. The manager was not much better, was trying to get me out of the phone and offered me some compensation. I was not really looking for anything other than being treated well, and she volunteered to put 45,000 points on my account, I said fine. She never did, so she lied again, she just wanted me off the phone. Terrible service, I have better service consistently on Holiday Inns.

We had a double and I did not feel like we were squished in there. That said, the downsides outweigh the upsides, especially given the hotel's claim that it's been newly remodeled. My first night there, I could hear a spring-loaded thud that would repeat on an irregular basis. I have jet-lag induced insomnia for the first few nights, usually, so you can imagine how this sound was akin to water torture for me. I went down to the desk the next day, thinking it might be the elevator (note that all double rooms are located next to elevators). A desk attendant came up and said that it was the water pressure, because the building itself is old. Basically, whenever someone in the right\/wrong room uses their bathroom, I could hear the sound loudly echo in my bathroom and bedroom. Second complaint is that I was told that I'd have to pay the $35 resort fee for all five nights, but I'd get a $35 meal credit. Turns out that I didn't have to pay the $35 for the last 3 nights (because I was paying a higher room rate), but of course, I was eating at the overpriced restaurant to get the meal credit. So it would have been nice for them to get their information straight. I don't think I'd stay here again--I didn't think service was very attentive and the water pressure noise is ridiculous for a supposedly excellent hotel.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I turned on the light I realized I had stepped on and killed a good size \"cockroach\", about 2\" long.  This was not what I was expecting while staying at at a JW Marriott.  Management was quick to give us a different room and have house keeping recovered the dead cockroach body.  I was told the room would be \"comped\".  As promised they did not charge us for the room however we were still charged all the taxes associated with renting a room in New York City.  I would have preferred not to have been charged for anything while sleeping in a cockroach infested room.   Our stay at Essex was not pleasant as we had to keep all of our belongings and luggage secured and closed.  In fact when we got home, all of the luggage was kept outside and sprayed with insecticide.  Where I'm most disappointed in, is the fact that no one from the management team ever followed up with me. It was just as cold as doing business outside, nobody really cares who you are, just pay me.

Hairs in the bathroom and dusty every where. Since we got the lowest floor possible (I was joking with the wife that they threw us in the basement) we were literally looking past the flags that were above the entrance to the hotel to our \u2018Central Park views\u2019.\n\nThe next day we managed to get a change of room to one on the fourteenth fl but it was the size of shoe box and still filthy and dusty. The normal fridge in the cabinet under the tv was out of order so they decided to put a replacement one that they must have picked up from the local junk yard (it looked like it had fallen down all the stairs of one world tower). Because the room was already do small the fridge had to be put at the end of the bed taking up more space leaving nowhere to walk to access that side of the bed.\n\nThen the wife unpacks only to get an electric shock from the faulty cupboard lights no doubt due to lack of maintenance which is theme that runs through this whole place. So hotel is notified and offers of apology are begrudgingly given making yourself feel the guilty party as if you need to convince them that the complaints are real.  By this time after all the packing and unpacking we get put into an even smaller room on the eighth fl but have already lost a precious night in NY and will never get back. Seeing our dissatisfaction we were given some flowers and bowl of fruit and some truffle chocolates with two small Mo\u00ebt champagne bottles as they probably felt sorry for us on our anniversary. Unfortunately we\u2019re not big drinkers.\n\nService wise the room service receptionist was polite (Rosemary I think) and attentive but the prices are way too high and slow to arrive although food service attendants were generally also polite except one time when we just asked for a few things it was as if you were asking the guy to cut his arm off for you. Food itself was generally ok. Due to all the misadventures the hotel gave us a late check out at 4 pm and when we requested a bit more time were begrudgingly given another half hour. The whole experience can be summed up as a total lack of love. From check in to dealing with staff to the general atmosphere around the lobby you get a sense of unwelcomeness. Actually the feeling around the lobby and property it\u2019s as if your in some high security stakeout given the looks your given by the the staff\/security swat team.\n\nTo sum up will never go back again and don\u2019t mind paying more for the plaza hotel as I\u2019m sure that will live up to it\u2019s reputation.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"NONE"}

In addition to location, and the overall quality of this property, what stood out the most for us was the remarkable level of service provided by staff in all functional areas that we dealt with. The Concierge team is about the best I have ever encountered, and I travel globally on an extensive basis. Kevin and Michael are absolute stand-outs, who provided us with excellent restaurant recommendations, theater tickets to one of the hottest plays in New York, and advice on places to visit. They were instrumental in arranging a post-graduation dinner for our extended family, and several other group dining experiences. The entire Concierge staff was warm, friendly, most helpful and took customer service to a new level. However, outstanding and friendly service was also provided by the Front Desk, especially Felix; the Doormen, Art and Danny; our Housekeeper; and the wait staff in the excellent Executive Lounge.

As I asked the bar tender to offer a suggestion as for a hot toddy type of drink, eggnog or rum, he dismissed me, vaguely pointing to the bar bottle display and immediately turning his back to me\u2026More than 10 mn after I ordered , a hot tea came up from another waiter without anything else ( alcohol) at the same time the front desk manager came to inform me of my room being ready: I left after barely drinking half and paying which should have been offered as courtesy for wasting my time. I later gave my full feed back to the manager of the bar about this rather unwelcoming\/rude and unprofessional attitude and he apologized on behalf of this employee.Needless to say that we never spent another dollar on this restaurant during the rest of our 4 day stay...\nThe cleaning of our room was also a problem: after leaving our room in the 9 am hour, we formally requested front desk to have the room cleaned and twice the room was still untouched upon our return after lunch\u2026\nWe also ordered room service and once a simple herbal tea took 35 mn to be sent after I had to call back and inquire.Another time, we ordered in basic dinner soup and sandwich and were amazed at the pricing of such basics, not to mention the added taxes that make a simple combo like this more expensive than your average good meal at a nice restaurant around !\nEven better, we had the pleasure of a scaffolding coming down in front of our window on the first day of our stay, totally obstructing a window of our front view of the park. On top of that, drilling all throughout the day when you are trying to rest and recover from a severe head cold. When I reached out to the front desk, some back office employee told me that they could not do anything about it although we had clearly booked the Essex House in part for a nice , unobstructed front view of the park.\nI had to talk directly to the construction workers to make sure that they lift the thing away from our widow before leaving the job at the end of the day, which luckily they did.\nAll in all, this hotel is not run at the level of the JW Marriott standard and what you would come to expect from the price point.There seem to be a total absence of management \/ leadership and customer-first spirit. Almost as if the location was already a privilege granted to guests and customer experience the last concern of this crew.\nThe Ritz or Park Lane nearby seem to run a better, tight ship despite their similar prime location on Central Park.Therefore, we will likely opt to stay away \u2013as you also should- from the Essex House till Marriot Corporate realize the shortcomings of this operation and get it back to the level where it should be...","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was very cold and the air streaming through the window was ridiculous and not soundproof at all.   They do have a nice restaurant\/bar , but the bar seating itself is very small.

The hotel itself, a Manhattan Art-Deco icon, originally opened in 1929, and has had several owners since then. With a sweeping, enormous lobby that narrows down into a stunning walkway through the building, the first floor glows with brass fixtures everywhere and classic New York architectural elements such as the black and white tile. First floor has a hotel bar of some sort, though I did not get to visit it, a jewelry store, gift shop, Executive Club, and a few other eateries. One feels impressed walking in, which is important because at present the exterior is covered in scaffolding while the building undergoes restoration. Check-in went very smoothly, with everyone welcoming and helpful. Upon entering my room, it became apparent the effort Marriott has put into upgrading this property. The room, spacious and intelligently-designed, gleamed with crisp white and black lines, an impeccable bathroom with full size tub, and a built-in desk, mini-bar, dresser, luggage rack fixture that looked beautiful while functioning extremely well. The room also came with a couch for visitors, and a large, comfortable king sized bed.  Having arrived very late, I ordered room service which arrived promptly (less than 25 minutes) and tasted delicious. In fact, it was the best chicken Caesar salad I've ever had - came with real anchovies and grilled chicken that had clearly just gotten grilled. The next day, I needed a late check out to work before heading to the airport. The hotel graciously arranged the late check out without issue and arranged my transportation to JFK. I do have Platinum status, and as such was granted access to the Executive Lounge. Due to schedule, I was only able to make breakfast down there, but it offered a terrific buffet spread with a variety of tasty selections. I imagine the other offerings throughout the day are just as good.

It's been a while since we've last stayed here and I'm glad to say that the service and the quality of the rooms have been kept up to standard.  \n\nOur most recent stay was over New Years and we had 2 rooms booked on points (one room for my husband and I and the other for my daughter and son-in-law).  My husbad and I both have Marriott Platinum Elite status as well as my son-in-law. I mentioned to everyone that we shouldn't expect any upgrades during this busy time of year.  In addition, my daughter and son-in-law were taking a red eye flight from the West coast and we were arriving later that same day a round 6pm.  When my daughter and husband checked in at 8am (not expecting to get a room that early) they actually checkd them in and gave them their room key.  It was a small room, but neverthelss and room that still met the J W standards and someplace where they could take a quick nap before touring the city.  \n\nWhen we checked in, the front desk attendant apologized for taking so long but that he's trying to find a bigger room for us.  He did managed to find a nice corner room that was definitely bigger than our daughter's room (maybe about 450-sq ft).  \n\nAs previous posters have mentioned, the lonnge isn't very big and the food selection and quality are mediocre.\n\nThere is a $25\/day resort fee, but they also give you a $35\/day food and beverage credit (you can't roll it over to the next day if you don't use it)  that can be used at the bar, in the restaurant or even for the in room mini bar.  Surprisingly, we found the food in the restaurant to very good.  My husband had the duck and said it was delicious while I had the filet mignon sliders which was outstanding.\n\nOverall, we had a nice visit at the Essex House and would definitely return.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Breakfast buffet in executive lounge was outstanding (included since I am a Platinum member).\n\nNeutral\n1. Although the hotel charges a $25\/night fee (which is NOT waived) for award bookings, one gets a $35 credit each day toward food, drinks and similar expenses.  Hard to maximize because they do not carry over if not used each day.\n2. Room was small - but hey, this is NYC.\n\nLows\n1. Platinum status did not get me much, other than lounge access.   No suite or room upgrade, although web site did show suite availability.  And my room was small and faced an inner courtyard; so no view - of anything,    Disappointed that they could not at least upgrade me to a higher floor with a view.\n2. Lounge was busy eat breakfast time; and on the last day, a Saturday, it was so crowded, that they took names of members entering and informed people that they should expect a 20 min wait!  And they would not allow anyone to take a plate of food back to their room despite the lack of seating availability.    Perhaps a sign that with the Starwood merger; there are so many elite members that benefits may suffer.\n3. Most disturbing, when I checked out, it appeared that they had deducted $25 from drinks\/ dining each day versus the $35 promised (specified in writing in a brochure that each guest received).   Fortunately, I thought to ask about the disparity upon checkout, and acknowledging that an error had been made, they corrected the billing error without any further debate. I asked if that process was automated, and the representative said that she believed so.

I was first taken aback at check in when the desk person regarded me as if I were a piece of gum on her shoe; impatient as I searched through my bags for my ID and credit card.

The girls don\u2019t see each other much and I wanted it to be special and memorable. Kevin Oakes, and all of the concierge team I came in contact with were excellent. Kevin went out of his way to set up teddy bears in the room for the girls. Shortly after arrival the girls answered the door to a special delivery of milk and cookies. They were over the moon and very much felt they were traveling in style.\n\nNot only did Kevin take the time to email with me leading up to the trip to answer my questions, he also offered ice skating and zoo passes. Extremely generous and amenities I would not have known about had he not cared enough to offer them. We did both and the girls had a truly great time making memories together skating and at the zoo. What Kevin didn\u2019t know, was that this trip came after my nieces recently had a baby sister born with Down\u2019s syndrome and some handicaps that will likely cause her to never walk. As one can imagine this came as a heartbreaking surprise and has been a lot for my brothers family and oldest two girls (who came with us to NYC). This trip was my attempt to get the cousins together for a lighthearted, stress free weekend heavy on holiday cheer. I share this because the customer service and kindness of the JW staff was that much more meaningful and appreciated in these circumstances.\n\nHighlights:\n\nRoom was clean, stayed warm, lots of hot water despite 4 little girls and myself showering.\n\nThe hotel upgraded us to a \u201ctwo doubles\u201d room which was large enough for us and brought up rollaway, at no charge. (I am platinum elite so upgrade maybe a result of this)\n\nThe hotel offered us to help ourselves to water bottles from the gym, it was great to have access to water throughout our 3 night stay. \n\nLiterally every security guard we walked passed engaged with the girls and made them feel welcome. I stay in a lot of hotels and travel frequently with my now 7 year old and it\u2019s truly amazing how few hotel staff acknowledge children, let alone crack jokes etc. \n\nWe had breakfast in the executive lounge one of the mornings. While waiting for our table to be ready near front desk I was talking with the girls and mentioned I would check with the concierge desk after breakfast and see about the zoo tickets they had offered.

We arrived at 2PM and the room was not ready. I had specifically emailed the Manager and my Ambassador (Platinum Premier Elite Status) to request early check in, but they are much busier with the holidays. We were told our room is required to be ready by 4PM at the latest so we took off for a little exploring. \n\nWe arrived back at 4PM and still no room. I wasnt pleased, however, the front desk offered us a $100 restaurant credit for the inconvenience (which we know takes care of ~2 rounds of drinks at a JW). Finally, we made it into our room, and I was actually surprised by the size. I have stayed at the Westin Grand Central, the Renaissance, a few Courtyards, the Lexington, and the Marriott by the Lexington. This is by far the nicest hotel, albeit, the most expensive (we were staying on points). \n\nThe lounge is closed in the evenings on the weekend, but the breakfast spread is a great way to kick off your day! It was a nice arrangement and plenty of choices. One note, they do not keep the lounge open for quiet time access (which means no access to waters). However, the Concierge will give you bottled waters in absence of access to the lounge, just ask! \nOverall, great stay. Quiet hotel, well appointed.\n","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Having stayed there at least once or twice a year over the last 6 years, this hotel has experienced a significant change and it's not for the better.  While some of the issues could be explained, a number of changes were deliberate.  In many ways, the services at the hotel looked less like a luxury Marriott hotel and more like a Fairfield Inn.  While not cheap, this is NYC, some genius thought it was a good idea to add a $35 per day \"destination fee\" to the bill.  \"Destination fee\", really?  Does one have to pay $35 just to enter the island of Manhattan?  Specific problems with the room, included a broken cracked window, an un-repaired gash in the inside of the entrance door.  No robe, although one was supposed to be there.  Since this was supposed to be for two people, shouldn't there have been two robes.  Then there were issues with the executive lounge.  They only give one key card per room.  As a result, if one person went first, the second person had to call the other person to open the door and give them access to the lounge.  For drinks and coffee, there used to be regular cups.  Now there are only paper cups (very Fairfield Inn).  There used to newspapers, the WSJ, etc.  No more.  The final issue occurred at checkout.  There was a $10 overcharge on the bill which was obvious when they checked the  receipt.  It should have been immediately adjusted.  No.  it took two of them almost 15 minutes before they could make the correction.\nAs a Lifetime Platinum Marriott member, I have close to a thousand nights at Marriott properties around the world.

This week was the worst experience I ever had. We rented a junior suite, and as a Manhattan \u201cfive star\u201d hotel that is not a cheap room. I am travelling a lot and have 500,000 points on my Marriott loyalty account. \n\nAfter entering the room the first time we saw that the minibar was half empty and there was an opened and half empty wine bottle and an opened and half eaten waffle package. This is just nasty. \n\nThe suite was in the third floor and even when I explicitly asked we could not get a higher floor. So at 6 a clock in the morning every day it was impossible to sleep because of trucks having their motors running or beeping while backing up. I understand that not everyone can have a room on a high floor, but why are there not soundproof windows in such rooms? So after 3 days of this torture I upgrade to an even pricier Manhattan suite. \n\nOne of the most important things for me is a reliable internet connection. In some mornings it was so slow (I booked the \u201chigh speed\u201d plan) that I could not even do email properly.  Sometimes it worked fine sometimes it was unusable. \n\nMy wife booked an 80 minute massage in the SPA and came back flabbergasted. She had never experienced a more unfriendly massage therapist \u201cin her life\u201d. So instead of relaxed she came back stressed. \n\nAfter ordering soft boiled eggs 3 times and getting hard boiled eggs 2 out of these three times we gave up ordering eggs. \n\nAfter we had moved to the new suite we became new keys that stopped working the next day because they where not programmed right. \n\nThe Minibar in both rooms was locked and even in both cases the room service was not able to get them unlocked and keep them unlocked. They locked themselves again. In both cases we had to trick the deadbolt by stuffing some paper in the mechanism. \n\nWhen I asked housekeeping to come at a certain time (even talking to the actual housekeeper in the hallway) it did not work. We came back two hours later to find the room not cleaned. Same happed when we needed the sofa bed set up for a night. Some one came in the room and tossed two pillows on the sofa that was it. \n\nI am not even sure if I remember all the things that went wrong there were so many. \n\nI expect a high quality service in a five star hotel that costs nearly 1,000$ a night. But the management of this hotel does not seem to care about these details. I complained about it but I did not get any better. They called back and apologized shortly and that was it. They asked if they could do something for us and I asked them to set up the sofa bed. Read above how that worked out. What kind of manager are you that you do not make sure that the one thing a disgruntled customer asks for is actually done? This just means you are not interested at all. \n\nIf you don\u2019t care about details, service and are lucky enough to get a room on a high floor so that you can sleep this is still a nice hotel. But for me that was my last stay here. Sad how some hotels go downhill over time. Compared to ten years ago this is not even half as good as it used to be. \n\nRIP ESSEX HOUSE\n\n","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":455186,"title":"Not a first-class experience! Thorough review:","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-10-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I visited JW Marriott on 160 Central Park S, aiming to find a fitting hotel for accommodating employees and guests in NYC. We want a front row hotel to Central Park with an iconic view, which should make Essex House an obvious choice. Its location is exceptional.\n \nHowever, it became a somewhat mixed experience. \n \nWe normally stay in Park Hyatt hotels; otherwise, in Taj hotels. However, I have stayed in JW Marriott hotels in Asia and they have always met my expectations to the standard of a 5-star hotel which encouraged me to try out Essex House.\n \nSince I had made two reservations to try out two different rooms, I will provide a full review on both for comparison:\n \nCentral Park View, Guest Room, 1 King - #1205 \u2013 2 nights\n \nYou do not get nice views without paying for it - I know that. This room was around $600 per night. I had the great luck of being greeted by front desk member of staff, Melvin, when I checked in. When I told him that I was here to check out the rooms and the view, I instantly got the impression that he went out of his way to allocate the best room he had at hand for me. Big kudos to Melvin for being so attentive and going the extra mile to set me off on a good start.\n \nAnd the park view did not disappoint! 180 degrees full view of Central Park. It was absolutely stunning! \nHowever, I was extremely disappointed that the windows were so filthy that it was impossible to take a decent photo of the view - it was like a vintage filter was already added (and not a good one). You do expect clean windows in a first-class hotel - especially one that has THE NYC VIEW NONPAREIL as part of its uniqueness. \n \nOverall, the room itself was small, the bed very comfy, there was a chaise-longue conveniently placed in front of the window and the bathroom contained a nice, deep bathtub. The bathroom amenities were nice, including bath salts and mouthwash.\nThe room did not have a fridge; I called Guest Service and they brought me a mini-fridge immediately; there was really nothing mini about it - it took up quite a lot of space and it was noisy. Talking of noise, by the way, I was happy to find the floor I was on very quiet. The outside street noise on the other hand was noticeable, although I was on the 12th floor; personally, it did not bother me.\nThere was no complimentary water in the room and none was offered, which was a bit odd considering the room rate. No tea\/coffee\/kettle either.\n \nThe rooms were apparently renovated during autumn 2017. My room presented itself as being a little run down already. I guess this reminds us of just how much wear and tear that comes with hotel guests. However, this should not be an excuse for not cleaning the room properly. A former guest's plastic bag was tossed between the chaise-longue and the window. It remained there during my stay.\n\nHowever, the thing that really upset me was the indifferent attitude shown by some members of the staff towards guests. It is important to stress out that this was not the case for all the hotel staff - as mentioned, Melvin from the front desk was great. After check-in the first day I headed for the elevators trying to locate them. A hotel staff member stood in the hallway and simply looked away when he could obviously see that I was looking for directions. Such encounters occurred several times during my stay; a hello, a nod or just some kind of acknowledgement of my presence would have been nice \u2013 and is considered good manners everywhere.\n \nOverall, I am giving this stay 4 stars (not large stars), mainly because, on the plus-size: the amazing view from my room and the location \u2013 and on the negative: the filthy window, no fridge \/ kettle at hand, and the lack of desire on the part of members of staff to help guests or make them feel welcome which was displeasing. (Also, small slips such as forgetting to include my orange juice in the in-room breakfast and still charge me for it was rather inattentive).\n \n---\n\nCentral Park View, 1-bedroom suite - #3405 \u2013 2 nights\n\nFor the second part of my stay I had booked a suite. This was well over $1000 per night. Again, Melvin at the front desk tried his best to allocate me a great room. The suite was spacious and fresh with comfortable sofa and chaise-longue, the bedroom contained a large comfortable bed and the bathroom was nice with both a roomy bath tub and shower.\n\nOnce more, the view from the windows was crucial to me since I specifically booked \u201cCentral Park View\u201d. However, from the suite you could see only half of central park (the western side) and it was solely visible from the bedroom. From the living room one was able to see Columbus Square and a partial view of the park. This was disappointing and should have been outlined in the online room description at booking. \nBoy, was I happy that I got to stay in the much cheaper (but smaller) room #1205 during the first part of my stay and got the Central Park full view experience there, to boot! I would have been very disappointed paying the overall amount of money for the whole stay if that had not been possible. \nFurthermore, just as in #1205 the windows in this suite were filthy; practically ruining any chance of capturing the views in a decent photo.\n\nThe suite did not have a fridge either, so I had to ask for that again. Neither were any water or coffee\/tea facilities available in this $1000 suite and it was not mentioned if there would be lounge access for me. \n\nThe lights in all the lamps in the living room flickered constantly when they were on, making it very uncomfortable in the evening.\n\nUnfortunately, yet again I experienced indifference from some members of the staff. When I came back from shopping with my hands full of shopping bags, struggling to get through the front door - a hotel employee was standing just on the other side of the door looking at me (direct eye contact), but not offering me a hand. When I finally made it through the door (on my own), he looked at me and just said \"Hello\". I was literally speechless and have never experienced such a lack of simple service and courtesy.\n\nWhen checking out from my first room midway through my stay, everything got very confused. Front desk was not able to allocate me the suite until around 4 pm, which was perfectly fair since it is their policy. This meant I used the room during the day while in and out of the hotel. However, housekeeping was not informed about that so I had to explain the situation to the cleaning lady; later in the afternoon a gentleman from the hotel locked himself into the room where I had my belongings and was literally chocked to find me there, so I had to explain myself again and I was asked to spell my name to him. Then front desk called me telling me that a bellman would be up shortly to bring me the key and take me to the suite. I waited for almost 45 minutes just sitting in the room with my luggage packed and ready. I called front desk, but no one answered. Finally, I left the room to go downstairs but then found a rather stressed bellman in the hallway apparently coming to collect me. However, he did not bring a key card; he said he had not been informed about that. He could get me to the suite anyway, he said \u2013 I just had to show ID. Then I offered to go to the front desk myself to pick up the key card, but he insisted that he would be right back bringing it to me. One hour later, nothing had happened, and I headed downstairs to pick it up myself. No apologies were given, the lady at the front desk just said they were all busy.\n\nMore details: This room had a traditional alarm clock on the night stand (as did #1205). However, this one did not work, and it showed 9 o\u2019 clock throughout my entire stay. As with many of the other previous mentioned big and small issues in this review, this just shows a lack of focus on details from various departments in this hotel. \nDuring the first evening in the suite there was an order form available to me for conveniently ordering breakfast, but this was not replaced for the second night, leaving me to have to call room service; again, no consistency. \nThe breakfast was not delivered on time on the last day. The waiter apologized for this and of course these things do happen, I know. However, in my opinion, the problem at Essex House is that there are so many things which do not work out and it really leaves you with an impression of a hotel that is rather unconcerned and unfocused on its guests. \nThis is not how to run an international 5-star hotel.\n\nGiven the above reasons I will give this stay in the suite 3 stars. I did stay in contact with hotel staff several times throughout my visit, but, frankly in 5 star-hotels things are supposed to run smoothly; as a guest you should not constantly be on guard pointing out various issues to the hotel \u2013 they should see it before you do. It presumes a lot if this supposed to be a first-class experience. \n\nWas it worth almost $2500 for two nights in this suite? No.\n\nWill I go back to Essex house? Probably not. Too bad, I loved the location, but this experience did not match what I expect from JW Marriott.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

He was very professional and incredibly kind while patiently answering all the questions I had about the hotel and city. \nMy room was well-appointed, clean, and larger than I expected (King bed, Park view). Once the family arrived, we ordered a roll-away and there was plenty of room to spare. Housekeeping was very friendly, even arranging my kids' stuffed animals in funny ways to welcome us back to our superbly cleaned room. \nThe Executive Lounge is on the lobby level next to the elevators. At first I was a little disappointed that it wasn't high up with a wonderful view. But later I found the location  convenient, especially with kids in tow. While we were visiting the Lounge, Collin was wonderful, providing enjoyable conversation and fantastic service, especially with the kids!\nOverall, I highly recommend the JW Essex House. I travel for my job and spend an average of over 100 nights a year, mostly in Marriotts and Hiltons. That being said, this property is lovely, the location is hard to beat, and the people are outstanding!\nThank you also to Hannah, Felix, Sharlene, and Michael and everyone else!\nSee you next time!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Great location, just opposite the park and a few hundred yards from the retail shops and restaurants at Columbus Circle. Every single member of staff we spoke with was polite and helpful. Melvin, on the Front Desk, set the tone of our whole stay by welcoming us to the Hotel, was incredibly helpful and polite. The room itself, we had a family suite, was extremely sizeable, very clean + the housekeeping team were excellent.\nMy daughter particularly liked the TV's in our room had NETFLIX so she could keep up with shows she is watching. \nWe had access, as I'm a Platinum member, to the lounge and this was just fantastic. The quality of food, breakfast, dinner + snacks were first class, as was the service. A special mention to Jasmin, who we met on the lounge desk a few times, she was always welcoming, accommodating + friendly as was Charly who greeted everyone with his warm smile, you can tell he's a popular guy. To me, this was the best lounge I've been in.\nMelvin also took time to explain to me the $25 resort fee in detail and entails $25 credit (daily) for drinks, $30 credit (daily) for dry cleaning (excellent service also), free (2) tickets to Central Park Zoo (daily). To me, at least the Marriott are not ripping you off but giving back to us, the customers, value on the daily options. many NYC hotels just charge you the resort fee and give you nothing back so well done The Essex House.\nI also got a late checkout with absolutely no issues.\nAll in all, a fabulous hotel, fabulous staff which made our stay so great, we look forward to staying as a family, we're from Scotland, on our next NYC trip.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Because of my Marriott Elite Status i was upgraded to a fabulous park view room on high floor. It appeared that the room and bath had been renovated. It was spacious and i lacked for nothing. As this is an older building and in the dead of summer, i had to keep the AC at 64 to keep the outside heat and humidity from creeping through. The front desk and concierge staff were extremely polite, professional and very accommodating. They made an impromptu reservation at Nobu57 for me on short notice...all the while Open Table and the restaurant itself was claiming no availability. Well done on that front. After reading this you might ask why only 4 stars. Candidly, while i didnt mind my experiences at the lobby restaurant, Southpointe, it was nothing to write home about. Its almost a departure from the rest of the hotel which is classic and rather charming. As well it was evident to me that my room was once (perhaps long ago) a smoking allowed room. All the fresh paint in the world cannot mask it in the right conditions. The humidity of the outside air easily brought it to the surface. Alas it did not affect my comfort level much.

I stayed at this hotel from July 4th until July 19TH, 2018, in room 1436,  and woke up with a few spots of skin irritation on my face. Then every day, these \"irritations\" popped up more and more and I didn't suspect it was a bug bite because it didn't itch and it honestly just looked like a minor skin irritation and that's why I did not report it to the hotel.  I have seven of those spots and now after 4-5 days later, they started to itch like crazy, and it;s been a week now and they are definitely some kind of bites. I had a friend who stayed with me, and she also has same spots that have been itching like crazy. Google image search show they are unmistakably brown recluse spider bites  but what makes me MAD is I've emailed the hotel and marriott twice about this and I still have not gotten a response from them. When I finally did get a call, the person who was \"investigating\" was unpleasant, insinuated that that I had the bites before I came to the hotel.  This has been bothering me very much to say the last, I feel feverish from the bites and they look nasty, not to mention the itch that doesn't seem to be helped with any cortisone cream. I just find this unacceptable, I knew the hotel didn't have a great service, but this is supposedly a \"historic, landmark\" marriott hotel, and the fact that no one has reached out to me after repeated contact with them.  - Addendum: The bites are mostly all healed now but they left me lovely scars. If you decide to stay at this hotel, REPORT AND COMPLAIN EVERY LITTLE SKIN IRRITATION YOU WAKE UP WITH and demand to get a different room, document, take pictures and demand that they compensate you. It's been month, I've gotten a letter asking to investigate it further, I've replied to the email in the letter and still NOTHING.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Also, the lounge was not open 24 hours a day for water, drinks or coffee even when most of Marriott and Renaissance Hotel Lounges globally are. Overall, water and soda selection was very poor. JW Marriott is supposed to be in their luxury category, so this property failed hard in this category. As the lounge was closed, the management offered to bring a Keurig Coffee Machine to our room.

I was actually booked at a different Marriott property for my quick stay but decided to splurge and switched to Essex House last minute.  Knowing how great the rooms and customer service at this property previously were, I was especially disappointed that I left Essex House doubting my hotel choice.\n\nThere were only two parties in front of me at check-in and the wait was close to 30 minutes.  A handful of people in line, myself included, had completed mobile check-in, but there was no designated area to pick up keys besides the general line.  Mobile check-in preferences for a high floor and late check-out weren\u2019t initially honored, though I was ultimately able to receive both.  For rewards status I did receive an upgrade from the base room to a Central Park view, as well as lounge access.  The executive lounge was a beautiful space with plenty of seating and a good selection of food for both breakfast and dinner.  My room on the 33rd floor was nicely renovated and had a decent amount of space for a Manhattan hotel.  The room had a different setup than the Central Park rooms advertised online, which made the room feel a little more like a studio suite than a standard guest room.  However, the room consistently had an odor of smoke (or something trying to cover up smoke), and the furniture was noticeably dusty and showing some signs of wear, despite being replaced during renovations.\n\nThe main thing about my stay that didn\u2019t settle well with me was a housekeeping\/safety issue, and how it was handled by Guest Relations.  I stepped on something sharp in the closet, which turned out to be an old spring coated in rust that was stuck in the carpet.  Fortunately, it did not break skin.  I noticed that there was a designated Guest Relations desk in the lobby and decided to bring them the spring and express my concern.  While the agent somewhat acknowledged the housekeeping aspect, she seemed a bit dismissive about the potential hazard.  Had it been a situation where it broke skin and I did not have a tetanus booster, or a child got a hold of it, I would have left with little confidence that the concern was passed along to a manager.  Customer service overall was okay, but not what you would expect from a 5-star property.  The doormen were very friendly, as well as the older gentleman at the elevators in the evening.  Service from the front desk agents was mixed.\n\nI used Marriott points for my reservation, but if I paid for the room it would have been around $700 for a weeknight.  There are certain brand standards that are expected when staying at a JW, especially one that costs so much.  Despite having a 4pm check out, I ended up leaving at regular check out time due to frustration with the indifference from Guest Relations.  While this is still a classic property in an ideal location, I think significant changes are needed to housekeeping and customer service to elevate the hotel to its full potential and stand out in the competitive NYC hotel market.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

If you can afford a room overlooking Central Park, its well worth it for at least one visit on a higher floor. Absolutely stunning. The housekeeping service is very attentive and circles around twice a day. I haven't been absolutely impressed with the front desk staff as I'm often left waiting even though they have mobile check in that is supposedly rapid - and has never been. The executive lounge tends to be overcrowded by families staying there (parents bring in multiple sets of kids and take up the tables) however you do get access to a plentiful breakfast buffet (the same one the adjacent restaurant charges a hefty price). Its located on the main floor and you have to prove membership although they never seem to check against total number in your party. There is never ever batted water in the rooms like every other JW property on earth - I believe its due to the unions at the hotel which is a shame that the customer experience suffers as a result. Rooms tend to get super expensive. The gym is decent and stocked with waters and towels.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Ive been a Marriott Gold member for 25 years so when I say this hotel needs a change, it's not to hurt the reputation, but to help them live up to the 5* rating they deserve.\n\nI stayed here with my husband and son June 18 - 22.  The hotels in the city were crazy expensive that week, the Marquis and the Renaissance were $575 and even the garbage hotels were close to $400 so we decided to use Marriott points.  The Essex House was listed on Trip Advisor and even on the Marriott site for $735 a night during that time.\n\nAt $735 a night I expect 100% top notch service and it wasn't even close.  We had to wait at check in and I had checked in on the app but it didn't give me a digital key since the hotel was set up yet.\n\nI always order extra pillows and towels, but they were not in the room.  The room was big for NY and the bathroom was beautifully updated with a separate glass enclosed shower and marble tub.\n\nAfter dinner, we got back to the hotel around 11:30 and the extra towels and pillows still were not there.  3 towels for 3 people in NY when the weather is hot, does not cut it.  We called the front desk and they said they would take care of our request.  At 1:00 in the morning we got a phone call asking if we still need the towels and pillows.  Finally, housekeeping knocked on our door at 1:45 in the morning...Unacceptable. The manager did offer us a free breakfast for the disturbance.\n\nThe housekeeping department needs an upgrade.  One day we came back to our room at 1:00 in the afternoon and the room still wasn't made up..again only 3 towels in the room.  But heres what really get me...If a hotel can charge $735 a night, there should not be mold in the shower!  On my first day, I noticed a little bit of mold on the shower knob where the white button logo meets the silver knob, not enough to bother anyone but me and normally, I would wipe it off with a q-tip, but I decided to leave it just see how good the housekeeper was.  Well it was never touched during my 4 night stay.  Also there was dust on the silver arms of the toilet paper holder.\n\nOn a positive note, the location is perfect.  Hotel staff is very friendly.  The lobby is beautiful and my favorite was every night between 11 - 12 when we arrived back to the Essex house, the floor waxer was there waxing the lobby floor and always smiling.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This is a classic historical hotel and we loved every minute of it. Check in took about 15 minutes and our room was not done so we went out and walked to the Met Museum and did that and then walked back through Central Park which is right across the street from the hotel. When we got to our room it was clean, neat, and tidy with good pillows and linens. We had a junior suite with a king bed and sleeper sofa which worked out very well. \n\nOne of the best part about this hotel is the club lounge. They serve breakfast each morning and then appetizers and dinner starting at 5PM. This works out very well for the kids as they sometimes require food on demand. So you can start your day off with breakfast in the lounge and then if you return after a full day of sightseeing you can get snacks or dinner at 5PM before a rest or a trip to the spa. Or if you want to dine in at 5PM before you got out on the town for the evening it works very well. The hotel is right across the street from Central Park and about a 5-8 minute walk to 5th Avenue. Taxi's and Ubers are readily available. La Guardia Airport is a 25 minute drive with no traffic.\n\nThe hotel is still under renovation but it does not effect services. During my stay I did make it to the spa to use the steam room and sauna. They do need to offer more supplies in the spa lockers rooms. This was the only hotel I think I ever been to that did not have shave cream, razors, deodorant, ect. for the guests? I was actually quite surprised by this but worked around it. \n\nI want to give a shout out to the employee's that helped make our stay even better. Denise in guest relations was more than helpful. Rashed in the club lounge was fantastic. Anna in guest relations was a life saver when our flight was canceled and she kept adjusting our late check out time not knowing if we would even fly out that night or not. Also one gentleman at check in gave us the wrong hours of the club lounge by an honest mistake and he tracked us down in the lobby to tell us he gave us the wrong info. I apologize and I just cant remember his name but he knows who he is. \n\n*Speaking of the club lounge please note they are only open on Friday for breakfast and closed the rest of the day. See the photo I posted with the hours and plan accordingly.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Directly across the street to a main park entrance. Also near many subway lines.\n\nRooms: I saw 3 different rooms as I'll detail below. The first room was pretty small (though not horrible for NYC) and faced scaffolding from the 3rd floor but was considered a \"park view.\"  I saw some trees over the scaffolding but it's a joke to call that room a park view.  The 2nd room was on a higher floor and was considerably bigger with a great view of Central Park and northern Manhattan.  And the 3rd room was a junior suite that was quite spacious and on a corner with decent \"city\" views.  All rooms appeared to be renovated.  \n\nAmenities:  The gym is very nice with modern equipment, lots of space, and a full locker room with steam room and sauna.  Excellent hotel gym.  The executive lounge had a very nice breakfast and better than average evening hors d'oeuvres for a hotel lounge.  It wasn't the most spacious lounge so I only stayed in there for meals. And there are no windows in the lounge.\n\nCheck-in:  This is where the hotel gets docked major points.  I'm a Marriott Platinum and it was still a disaster.  I arrived at 11:30pm and there was a line to check-in (granted the hotel was close to sold out that night).  The woman who checked me in was friendly but couldn't seem to figure out which rooms were ready.  I was finally given keys to a 3rd floor room that I was told was an upgrade.  Rather the room was tiny and faced scaffolding on 59th Street. Being on the 3rd floor, it was also quite loud. So I went back down to the front desk and demanded another room that wouldn't be so loud.  I was given a high floor room that faced the park. It was a very nice, bigger room with 1 problem - it either hadn't been cleaned or someone else was still using the room as the bed was a mess, the bathroom was dirty, etc.  So I went back down again and they finally gave me a junior suite which was very nice.  So ultimately I got a nice room and a couple free drink coupons for the hassle, nobody actually apologized for the mess and they just didn't seem to have their act together at all.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Superb location facing the park.\n\nWe had a few niggles on our first night which I wont put on here other than to say certain members of staff including Michael at the Concierge desk were very helpful and sorted things out for us, we also got some complimentary wine and snacks for our trouble and $200 off the bill when we left.\n\nOnly negative was the room we were in (we had a double bed room) on the 7th floor the view was terrible with hardly any light coming in. When we have stayed in NYC before we have been much higher meaning the view was still buildings say but where you are higher up it doesn't matter so much as you can still see sky - we couldn't even see the sky unless we leant round and looked right up so was hard to see what the weather was doing and the room felt dark.\n\nOther than that fab stay, you get what you pay for plus it is one great location opposite that stunning Central Park!

First time I got that treatment as loyal Marriott member.... took us 30 min to settle on a deal. Not sure why this is so hard. Guess the room we wanted was available in the end. Manager had to come done, lots of wasted energy and not the way to start a stay. As said, once solved, we enjoyed the rooms. Sound of neighbors is an issue but the building is old so not a big surprise.\n\nThen there is the luggage room. Wanted to leave one (1) piece of luggage as we would come back at this hotel before traveling home. Big speech that it needed manager special approval, got it all arranged after several conversations at front desk and still at check out got the same speech from a bell boy how difficult this is and if I got the manager approval ?! Not suitable for a hotel of this standing. \n\nLounge as others indicated has a good breakfast but is far from appealing as a room.

Guess what . No call. I will see if this is legal in NEW YORK STATE. Hard to believe. First the $150 which was appropriately credited before leaving less a destination charge of approx. $29.00 but keeping the $269.69 for up to 30 days with no reason and possibly a hotel employee or someone used my card. My credit card company said I will have to wait thirty days on this pending charge before disputing it.

Except, at every turn - they just don't.\n\nThe front desk was very helpful while we were here, the people were very friendly and that was about the only 5-star service we received\/experienced while at the Essex house.\n\nThe rooms are fine.  There isn't anything wrong with them, but plenty other 5-star hotels in NYC offer far more space and more comfortable furnishings.  Probably the most irritating part of the room is that apparently there is a mini-bar in the drawers under the TV.  Never knew it was there until we got the folio in the morning with $40 charges for a pack of M&M's and Raisins.  Went downstairs to let them know we didn't touch the minibar and they kindly took it off.  Went back upstairs, gathered out things and left the hotel.  Looked at the credit card bill a few days later and we had been charged another $50, this time for three drinks.  Again, a lengthy process going through calling the hotel and eventually the accounting department to remove these charges.  \n\nWe paid $800 for the room, for one night - and they are nickel and diming me $40 for a pack of M&M's.  Comp the M&M's Marriott.  Instead of staying here again, there was a Courtyard six blocks away I had stayed in the previous week that was $600 cheaper and supplied free water and chips in the room.\n\nPro-tip to NYC: unless you NEED this central park view room for your Instagram - stay somewhere else.\n\nThe Renissance Midtown is a great new hotel in NYC.  The Renissance Times Square can be a bit noisy but offers a much better experience.  Central park - stay at the Ritz.  The Essex house should be one of your last options in NYC.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Within a few minutes of standing in line, additional guests were queuing behind me. The whole check in process took at least 15-20 minutes.

They had an excellent breakfast in the morning and access to drinks all day. There was a buffet dinner in the evening. All of the food was tasty and saved us a ton of money in the Big Apple! \n\nThe location is fantastic- Central Park is right across the street. The subway is about a block away.

A very small detail to share:   the bath towels at the JW Marriott Essex House are huge and that was not the case at the Ritz.\n\nA random story about the hotel to share:   I had seen a gift package at the front desk with a happy face balloon.   I asked the concierge where I could purchase this balloon because my 2-year-old grandson was joining us for the weekend and I wanted to put a balloon on the gift that we had for him.   I was told that the front desk would gladly blow up helium balloons for my grandson's gift -- at no charge.   Needless to say, the gift was a huge hit and my grandson loved the balloons, too.   It is this attention to detail and caring for its guests that you can always count on when you stay in this hotel.    \n\nIf possible, ask if you can do the breakfast buffet for Marriott Platinum Rewards Members.

I was happy to see that a suite was available and used my Marriott points (and some cash) to book a room at the JW on the park.  I have stayed at the Ritz and Four Seasons before but never at a JW.  I assumed they were on the same level.\n\nI contacted the concierge ahead of time to have a small fridge place in our room since we would get in late after 9pm on Fri and wanted to have milk for the kids in the morning.  I also was intrigued by the Marriott ap and put in a request for more pillows and towels and a blanket.  \n\nWe got in later than expected after 10 and when we got to the room was very disappointed that the fridge was not there (also none of the other stuff).  When I called I was told that they only had one person doing this late at night and it would be a while.  Since the fridge had to go in the room where the kids were on the pull out couch, that meant my kids got to bed after 12....you can imagine how the next whole day went. I didn't have it in me to wait for the blankets, towels and pillows.\n\nOn Saturday I saw the maid outside my room when we left and put the make up room light on but when we got back it still wasn't done 3 hours or more later.  I had to call them to come do it...really?\n\nWhen checking out on Sunday, after seeing the show (which was great), it took over an hour (64minutes) to get our car, so you guessed it, my kids got to bed after 930pm.\nWhile we waited my wife walked into the lobby restaurant to order some takeout food for the road.  She was told they don't do that and would put it on a plate and she would have to get her own container (really?).  She walked out.  Since we had so much time she went to WholeFoods down the block!  \n\nI was surprised that the $16 for ice cream from room service was them sending a whole pint of Hagen Daas up to the room with some bowls.  In an upscale hotel I'd think they would at least put it in a bowl!\n\nThe room was nice (smallish) but clean.  The bell boys, front desk and the manager who fielded my angry message were nice but at the end of the day anyone with a 5 year old (let alone 2) knows that once they don't sleep the next day is sort of blown.  Monday at school was fun too.\n\nWhile they offered me enough points for one night honestly that doesn't make up for the whole weekend experience with cranky kids.

I do not know how high the public can go b\/c the really nice rooms with a super view of the park and the height away from all the honking etc from CPS, are all residences. Most of your nicer hotels have their top floors sold as residences. The lobby is quite pretty and check in went smoothly. Once we arrived on the 20th floor and went into our room, supposedly with a view of the park through the scaffolding, we were thrilled with how large the room was but the view was definitely not what we had expected. We were moved the following day to a smaller room but the view was unobstructed. Perfect. Being a 5 star hotel- well sounds good. Beds\/pillows and linens were super comfortable but disappointed in only 3 towels. Yes you can request more and did. One bathrobe\/slippers and again you can request more and did. For a 5 star, I figured they would know how many guests were booked and would have robes to match the quantity. Yes they always mentioned our name at the desk or on the phone. Cleanliness - I have been to plenty of 4 star resorts that have been cleaner. I expect NOT to find a lick of dirt. THe carpet definitely could have stood a better vacuum job. Had to move the couch, something slipped behind it and found a lot of other things from other guests. Perhaps moving some of the furniture might be a good idea. Amazed for the age of the building that when the hotel was revamped, they did an excellent job. Wish parents of children taught their kids proper hotel etiquette when walking above another's room. Running\/pounding of feet was unbelievable. Quality of sleep - if a sound sleeper you will be fine otherwise, we brought our white noise machines and they blocked the street noise very well. Never had room service (those prices were crazy $$$$). Breakfast - go to a corner vendor. For NYC their prices are great. We found one near Columbus circle heading down Broadway near Maison Kayser. Felt safe due to there is a 'guard' checking keys before entering the elevator area. Been to NYC many times and wanted to stay away from the hustle\/bustle of Times Square.

However, I went ahead anyway (thankfully!).  As many have commented, the location is incredible - it was my partner's first time in NYC and she likes walking and bike riding, so being directly opposite Central Park was amazing.  We also had the nice side-benefit that it snowed for half a day one morning, so we experienced a white XMAS in Central Park in early April!\n\nI wondered about the value for money, as it was $AUD800 \/ night, but it didn't seem overly expensive for that part of NYC, and compared to $AUD600 \/ night places I looked at it in that part of NYC, it probably is reasonable value (we did stay over the Easter weekend \/ start of school holidays).  I guess if you were picky you could say that for the money, the rooms could be a little more elegant (but it is picky!)\n\nThe main positives were the beautiful historic lobby, well maintained rooms, nice restaurant \/ breakfast spot overlooking Central Park, and the very attentive staff - we stayed there for 5 nights, and dealt with 2 managers, as well as many staff, and we only had really positive and friendly interactions.  It wasn't like we didn't have hiccups - I didn't really like the first room we were in re outlook - it was one of the internal view rooms and it honestly really is a matter of preference whether you like it or not - it was very spacious for NY, but overlooked a back alley and the air con was (in my view, not my partner's) noisy.  Even though it was Easter weekend, the manager attentively allowed us to view a room with a street outlook (not CP outlook as much more pricey), which although smaller (more typical for NY), didn't have the noise or lack of privacy re other buildings (my partner probably preferred the original room though for its spaciousness) - the ease with which this move was handled was seamless and friendly.\n\nI noticed reviews querying the state of the rooms - I was told that the rooms were refurbished earlier this year, and certainly, I was impressed with the condition of the 2 rooms we stayed in.\n\nI know many have issues with the resort fee, but it was clearly stated that this fee would apply when I made the booking, so I was comfortable with that - a nice surprise was that it provided a $25 food credit per day, which is quite handy in terms of keeping high food prices more manageable when staying there (whether over breakfast or a late night drink) - it actually made the resort fee feel ok.  There does appear to be a bit of confusion re the terms of the food credit for some staff, so I should also add that this resort fee includes a $30 laundry voucher per day (this wasn't well explained when we arrived, so we didn't get full use out of this).  As an additional smaller bonus, there is complimentary water bottles and apples in the gym, which is a nice touch, given the long walks around central park etc.\n\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience - a special thanks to Louie, one of the doorman, who was always enjoyable to interact with.  A lovely hotel and well worth staying at.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Overall we were very satisfied with the stay but do have two occurrences that we are not happy with.  First the positives....the hotel is very clean and staff is friendly.  We are platinum members and enjoyed the lounge access.  The breakfast was had a nice variety of food and a lot of fresh fruit.  The staff was very attentive.  The location is great!  If you plan on spending time in central park, this is perfect.  There's also many good places to eat nearby.  \n\nOur room was a nice size for New York.  The bathroom was very spacious.  My biggest complaint about the room, we booked a King size bed for a party of 3.  We assumed there's a pull out sofa or something that made this room for an accommodation of 3.  We get there and there is no such thing.  There is a small couch next the the bed. I called the front desk to ask about this and they told me maybe someone can sleep on that couch....it was small like less than four feet long.  They offered me a roll-away bed for $75 per night.  I didn't agree with the extra charges as I booked a room for 3.  I was then transferred twice before I got to someone who made it sound like they were doing me a great favor by waiving the charge.  Also, on the reservation it did say that roll-away beds are not permitted in this room type.  This was frustrating as I felt like the booking information was misleading and our room size so much tighter with the roll-away bed there. \n\nMy second issue, on our last day there, we stepped out to get some breakfast in the lounge.  When we came back, we saw the housekeeping staff coming out of our room.  There was no reason for her to be in our room at that time.  We did not request anything, it was too early for clean up and we had not yet checked out.  It didn't looks like anything was moved.  Just left an uncomfortable feeling that someone was in our room.  I let the front desk staff know and they said they would look into it as it was strange.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We stayed here because we had Marriott rewards points. We\u2019ll definitely return. \n\nThe location, directly across from Central Park, cannot be beat if you choose to stay in midtown. You can walk to literally hundreds of shops and restaurants. Try the Plaza Food Hall down the street for a quick bite. It\u2019s worth it! Fifth Ave is a minute walk. Columbus Circle a minute walk in the opposite direction. It\u2019s a 10-minute walk to Times Square\/Broadway. There are multiple subway stations nearby. If you\u2019ve never been to NYC and you want to be smack-dab in the middle of it all, stay here. If you\u2019re driving in, use the SpotHero app to park. I parked in an Icon garage a block down and across from Carnegie Hall. $65 to park from 9 a.m. one day until 3 p.m. the next day.\n\nAside from the prime location, the hotel is beautiful. It\u2019s what one would expect a fine, historic NY hotel to look like. I disagree with other reviewers that say it\u2019s showing its age. Our room, 1735, was spacious, comfortable, and spectacularly clean. My kids loved that they could watch tv from our Netflix and Hulu accounts. The beds, doubles, were small but comfortable, with plenty of pillows. We had zero view (see picture), which we expected with a reward room. The plus side- no traffic noise. We didn\u2019t hear neighbors above or to the sides so we slept soundly. \n\nThe bathroom was large and very clean. The towels were nice quality. The bath products were ok. My only remark: there was zero air circulation, no matter how I adjusted the thermostat. Luckily it was cool out, so I cracked the windows for fresh air. \n\nIf you\u2019re staying for several days, there\u2019s little drawer space. The fridge has sensors so you can\u2019t store your own drinks. No coffee maker. There are plenty of outlets to charge. There\u2019s a pretty little clock on the nightstand. Put it in the closet if you\u2019re a light sleeper, as it ticks loudly in a quiet room. The hall area of the room begs for a table under which you can store your luggage; that space is not maximized. \n\nThe closet has an iron\/board, slippers, and two umbrellas for your use. \n\nEveryone from the front desk staff to the bellman were professional and personable. We\u2019d return and recommend. ","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Georgine? picked up). Ironically enough, they had hard boiled eggs in their selection. To clarify - I didn't ask for quail or ostrich eggs - just normal hen eggs \n- they charge $25 per day so called 'destination fee' - total outrage, only upon my questioning of the validity of the charge, they removed it from the bill.\n\nFinally, a week ago I happened to visit a Sacher Hotel in Vienna - if anyone from this NYC flagship JW Marriott wants to learn what luxury, attention to detail, supreme customer service etc. looks like - learn from the best, go to Vienna, and implement in NY.\n\nFor now, I am done with this property, not the right return for the money.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I informed him that I was a guest and was checking in, but he could of cared less and started to scream at me.   The doorman came over and hinted that if I gave him a tip that he would watch the car for me, but if I didn't he wouldn't be responsible.  I couldn't belive what I was hearing.   The employee became very loud and told me that he was going to call security....which he did....a man who identified himself as a security person, but refused to tell me his name and he quite quickly took his name badge off told me to move my car.

The staff at the Essex House delivered in so many ways. \nFirst, the manager and people. Sarah Nesbit oversaw our much of out stay and took great pains to make our checkin seamless and added personal touches to make our stay enjoyable. She was incredibly welcoming to not only me, but especially my wife and children. She would greet us by name whenever she saw us. The children loved her! Additionally, guest relations were amazing. They knew the best way for parents to be happy was for the children to be happy. They were so pleasant and patient with the kids. Anna, Jasmin, Megan and Jenny would provide so many warm and hospitable touches--greeting the children as well as us, deliver surprise gifts for the kids (hot cocoa and balloons), free tickets to Wollman Ice Rink in Central Park, etc. Concierge services were also fantastic--great restaurant recommendations and reservations. Also housekeeping, who were uniformly polite, kind, and did a wonderful job.\nSecond, the room and executive lounge. The suite was clean, luxurious and had a stunning view of Central Park. The Executive lounge had great variety for breakfast, was especially convenient--great layout for adults and kids alike! \nThird, location. Can't be beat. Perfect. Right on top of Central Park south.\n\nIn sum, our stay at the Essex House was fantastic, but what really distinguished the experience was the hotel staff, whose warmth and attention to detail made the experience really special.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":455186,"title":"A great experience at the Essex House","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I have traveled to NYC many times, however, each time, I have stayed at a different hotel, mostly because none of the establishments, where I had previously stayed, made a memorable impression. The rates in NYC are typically higher than in most metropolitan areas, yet, the accommodations are not always on par, in my opinion. \n\nTraveling to NYC to partake in New Year\u2019s celebrations, I searched for a hotel that would specifically accommodate three adults, in a single room or suite. I find that standard rooms in NYC can be a bit tight, especially for three adults. I did quite a bit of research preliminarily. I knew finding anything around our preferred dates would be difficult. I also generally prefer staying near Central Park, if possible, which only complicated matters, of course. The only option that seemed to meet our needs and expectations was the Essex House. I browsed multiple booking websites, yet nothing seemed to match the Essex House\u2019s accommodations, either in terms of size or amenities. Therefore, I booked a Family Suite which offered plenty of room for three. \n\nThe checking in process was very simple. The front desk personnel was efficient and courteous. At booking, I had requested a \u201cquiet\u201d room. We were put up in a fourth floor two-room suite, which was adjacent to the elevator lobby. However, the suite was accessed through an entry alcove, which acted as a sound buffer. Therefore, as promised, our room was indeed sheltered from any real disturbance. My only regret, from being on a lower floor, was our room was somewhat dim at all times. The windows faced onto a narrow courtyard. It, however, was not an inconvenience, per se. \n\nThe suites at the Essex House have all been elegantly renovated. They are particularly well planned out, in terms of both functionality and comfort. The beds are particularly plush. The sofa beds are too, which I found very unusual and a real benefit. The bathrooms are quite luxurious. We had to extend our stay for two nights -our flight was cancelled due to the blizzard that affected most of the East Coast-. Our initial suite was no longer available, however, we were offered a Junior Suite, on the 25th floor. It was absolutely gorgeous, in fact, perhaps more so than our previous accommodations. The very ample space was efficiently divided into a sitting room and a separate bedroom, with a full ensuite bathroom. The vistas over Manhattan were mesmerizing. The only negative, as compared to a Family Suite, was the amount of storage space -our Family Suite had a large walk-in closet, as opposed to an in-wall closet in the Junior Suite- which, for an extended stay, may be a significant decision factor. \n\nFurthermore, what makes the Essex House a wonderful hotel, is the kindness, generosity and professionalism of its personnel. For instance, the in-room dining staff was extremely responsive and genuinely kind. We repeatedly ordered the \u201cbasket of pastries\u201d, for breakfast, which, I was told was comprised of three individual baked goods. However, we were given at a minimum twice that amount, each and every time. Upon arrival, I asked if we could purchase mineral water, however, I was directed to the Spa, instead, where individual bottles are handed to guests, at no charge. There were in fact many other instances (from booking transportation to internet access) when, one team member or another, gave tips to find more economical options, yet, providing the same quality of service. \n\nI would highly recommend the Essex House to anyone looking for a perfectly-located establishment, which offers very attentionate services, in a beautiful setting. As compared to other hotels, of the same category, the nightly rate was quite competitive too.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location is great - not far from many subway stations, right across from Central Park, a short walk from Times Square, great shopping on 5th Avenue, and the Christmas market in Columbus Circle. The Lobby is beautifully decorated for Christmas. We checked-in early, which was great - our room was ready around noon. The only hiccup of our check-in was finding someone in our room! The front desk handled it gracefully and promptly, and overall, it was a non-issue for us. The rooms are clean, the bed is comfortable. I wish there were more outlets in the bathroom, as well as additional hooks for towels, but these aren't deal breakers for me. We had drinks at the bar one night (Southgate). Service was wonderful, but the drinks were a little pricey, even for New York. I enjoyed the mixed nuts that were offered with the drinks.

We were in room 3812, a corner suite with 1 1\/2 baths, master and living area.  My boyfriend is a Marriott Platinum card holder and we are vacation club owners, so we have stayed at many Marriott's in many locations.  Every year we start off our Christmas season by venturing to NYC for shopping, shows and of course to see the tree, we typically stay in the heart of times square at the Marriott Marquis, but felt that the marquis was getting run down and far too busy this time of the year, so we decided to stay a little further away from the craziness.  We arrived Thursday night at 8:30 pm, when we pulled up in front of the hotel there was really no designated area for guests to check in, no door man to greet us....I saw a women in the revolving door cleaning the windows so I figured I'd ask her, but before I could, a door man came running out of another door to help with our luggage and to valet the car.  The husband of a couple we were meeting is wheel chair bound and there was no ramp for him to access the sidewalk in front of the hotel, he had to wheel to the end of the road, at night, against traffic to access the corner ramp.  The check in process was smooth, the lobby was beautifully decorated for the holiday season and we were assisted to our room.  We were told on the way to the room that it had just been renovated two months ago, so we were expecting greatness.  The decor of the room was under-whelming, modern, and in tones of gray, black, white and beige.  The suite was a nice size.  The master did not have a dresser so we had to live out of our suitcases for things that did not get hung in the closet.  There were an abundance of outlets and USB ports built into the night stands, which was very convenient.  I noticed several things about the room that need to be addressed, the following aren't big issues, but for the price one would not expect to see the lack of detail.  The small corner shower head pointed directly towards the door, the head had to be turned towards the wall before starting the shower. The knob on the shower faucet was missing the insert, along with the \"cold\" knob in the bath tub.  There was a cut out in the bathroom ceiling that had not been repaired properly with dirty hand prints.  A light cover in the living room chandelier was missing, and another outlet is needed in the 1\/2 bath.  Here is the big issue we had with the room.....Friday morning when getting out of bed we noticed a great big stain on the sheets, down near our calves and ankles....and in an attempt not to offer too much information, there was the presence of little black hairs....This was unacceptable and totally gross!  We immediately stripped the bed and made sure the sheets were changed when we got back to the room.  Saturday morning at 10:00 am we were awoken by housekeeping attempting to enter the room, but could not because the interior latch was in place.  I can't say that the hotel is average, because it is far from average, but I can't give it a \"very good\" rating either because of the stained sheet and lack of detail.  We should have reported the sheet incident, but just didn't want to cloud the trip.  The sheets were changed and the issue remedied.  The housekeeping and maintenance staff needs to pay more attention to detail at this hotel.  Other than this, the hotel is beautiful, actually it was easier to access the holiday attractions from the Essex House then from the Marquis, less congested sidewalks.  All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. And the bar makes a great Cosmopolitan.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was hesitant to book this property because of negative reviews, but I\u2019m so glad that I did.  We still have 2 nights of our 7 night stay left, but I wanted to review immediately in case anybody is unsure whether to book after reading some negative reviews.  Trust me... book now!\n\nSTAFF:  Sharlene at the front desk gave us such a warm welcome upon arrival.  She thanked me for my loyalty (Marriott Gold), gave us a fantastic room upgrade and even treated my daughters as though they were a VIPs.  As a business owner, I would love to have someone like Sharlene as a first point of contact for customers.  She is courteous and professional... a perfect representation of the JW Marriott brand.  Felix and Muhammad at the front desk have also been wonderful.  Be sure to ask Felix about food recommendations in the city!  Juned in the executive lounge is such an asset to the hotel.  He has been so lovely and even treats my daughters to special desserts every night since we leave early for bedtime.  We haven\u2019t encountered anyone here who isn\u2019t friendly and helpful.  When staff heard that we were celebrating, we were treated to flowers and a beautiful handmade card signed by no fewer than 20 staff members.   Service has been superb.  We\u2019ve witnessed some very rude behaviour towards staff members and I can only assume that those are the guests leaving negative reviews.  Be kind and treat staff members well... they\u2019re an exceptional group of people and I\u2019m so happy to have met them.\n\nROOM: Central Park suite with 1.5 bathrooms, 1 king bed and a pullout sofa.  The view can\u2019t be beat and the renovated room is lovely.  Huge room with tons of storage space and great water pressure in the shower.  Aromatherapy amenities smell amazing.\n\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE: great selection of food and beverage.  Breakfast is the same buffet as offered in restaurant.  It\u2019s almost the same every morning but more than anyone could ever need.  Weekend was busy, but weekdays have been very quiet.  Evening offerings are plentiful (pastas, seafood, etc) and we haven\u2019t felt the need to go to a restaurant for dinner yet.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Ignore negative reviews.  Ask for a renovated room.

Exquisitely updated, keeping the best of the old world and mixing in some 21st century treats. The hotel lobby and interior oozes class. We arrived around 4 pm on a Friday afternoon. Our room was not quite ready, so we went to grab a quick bite and adult beverages at Southgate. The bar\/lounge\/restaurant are the most modern part of the building. Very airy, open and inviting couches\/chairs. Great drinks and snacks. While relaxing, we received a text saying our room was ready.  As a lifetime platinum with Marriott, I tend to get treated pretty well. I never have expectations or make demands (like so many pushy people do). When we received our key, we were thrilled to get a high floor room (1804) facing Central Park. Muhammad set us up with access to the executive lounge also.  So many of the older NYC hotels have small (by US standards) rooms. Our room was HUUUGE.  The bathroom was modern. We like the Aromatherpy line of toiletries provided. USB charging is a nice add to any hotel these days. The executive lounge does get crowded around 9 am on the weekends, so keep that in mind.  The lounge offers a very complete breakfast, that may cost you 50 bucks a person if you had to pay for it. Great staff here always willing to help with just about anything you may want or need.  Give the Essex House a try. You will be glad you did. ","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-10-06","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"My wife and I are Marriott Platinum Elite, so one can say that we spend a decent amount of time - business and pleasure - on Marriott properties. For all the hype, the New York JW Marriott Essex House has been so far a rather mixed-feeling experience, a soft way not to call it a disappointment. We believe in the first impression - we are still here for the next 3 days - and the first impression was nothing to write home about! \n\nChecking in: we got at the hotel around 9:20 pm. By the time the check in process was done, it was 9:30 pm. Went straight to the Lounge! It was supposed to be open though 10 pm. Lo and behold, it was a no-man\u2019s land. Nothing left, no drinks or food, not even hot water for a tee. \n\nLounge: this is the first and only place that the lounge is closed on Fridays and Saturdays. For the manager who came with this idea, an IQ test should be administered ASAP! This is called weekend when people come to the hotel! Take the perk away and you will be loved to the end of life on earth! We went next day for breakfast! Other than probably 100 other people - not exaggerating - trying to elbow their way in and a very small place with tiny tables and not enough seats to accommodate half of the population at one given time, the breakfast offering was bland and unimpressive for a JW Marriott. Eggs, some very strange cheese blintzes and bacon! The breakfast of champions. I guess they did have some cold cuts and cheese but at 8:30 am was long gone. I asked one of the lounge waiters were do they have the cutlery and his answer was \u201creally, it is in the other room\u201d! Really, I didn\u2019t know that.  \n\nRoom: small, but this is NY! However, after the first day here none of the glasses we used the first night were washed! Only one pair of sleepers (we have a reservation of 4, two adults and two kids in a room with two queen beds). The view from the room is unforgettable - one side I have lovely scaffoldings and the view of some decrepit building, the other side there is a constant high pitch hum from some - I guess - HVAC units and the lovely view of some old roofs! We are staying at the 16th floor and the only way to see the city is to use the google maps on your tablet! \n\nPeople: we knew that New Yorkers are not a friendly bunch but it seems that JW Marriott made an effort to hire the some disagreeable ones! Asked for the TV remote to be changed - no luck. Asked for directions, got very vague answers. Asked for a good place to eat with the kids within walking distance, got back a dissertation and not a single fact! Asked for a cab, got military orders where to stay and how many inches to move left and right. \n\nAs I said, first impression!

Upon arriving on Friday afternoon at 1:30 pm, we were told that our room was not going to be available (we were given two different reasons for this).  We would be given two king rooms for the same price as the suite.  After about 20 minutes of trying to register, I was told someone would call us when the room was ready.  No one called so we tried again at 5 pm to check in (check in time is 4 pm).  We were able to check in to one room but the other wasn't ready until about 7 pm.  This has never happened to me before.\n\nIn the morning one of the rooms smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.  Also, there was hair all over the wall in the shower.  I explained this to the front desk and they apologized and said they would address both issues.  When we returned around noon, the room had been cleaned, hair was gone, but it smelled even more strongly of smoke.  They sprayed the room a few times which helped but never eliminated the smoke smell.\n\nWe reserved a rollaway bed for $75 per night for one of the kids, but it was the worst plastic mattress I have ever seen so we asked them to remove it, which they did.\n\nAdditionally, our reservation was for a high-floor room with a city view.  We did not get that.  And the final blow was that we were overcharged, which we had to fix at check-out.  \n\nOn a positive note, the location across from Central Park is nice and the king beds were very comfortable.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":455186,"title":"Amazing View!  Waste of Rewards Points...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-08-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"This review is based on my experiences during a 3-night Rewards Stay at the end of June.  \n\nCOST:  We paid 240,000 Rewards Points for three (weekend) nights in the city.  One can get a standard room for 40,000 points\/night, but in order to guarantee a park view an additional 40,000 points\/night.  At 80,000 points\/night we really expected something special - it didn't happen.  Perspective:  A week later, my husband and I had an amazing 7-night stay at a JW property in London (Grosvenor House) and the total cost was only 40,000 points higher than our 3-night stay in NYC.\n\nThis is what I thought about our stay\u2026\n\nARRIVAL:  When we arrived on the morning of our scheduled check-in, we were warmly greeted at the front desk.  The host checked our bags, showed us to the lounge so we could have a nibble, and told us that they\u2019d call when our room was ready.  They could not have been nicer through the entire process.  Around lunchtime, I received a call informing me that our room was ready.  When we returned to the hotel we were handed our keys and told we had been given one the host\u2019s favorite rooms in the hotel.  (In my experience \u2013 as someone who stays 300+ nights a year in hotels \u2013 statements like this are usually a red flag)\n\nROOM:  Two good things.  First, you really can\u2019t beat the view.  As you can tell from the picture I added the view was absolutely spectacular. You can see north past the George Washington bridge.  Second, the bathroom was amazing.  I have friends who have lived in Manhattan for 20 years and haven\u2019t had apartments as big as bathroom it in this room.  The bathroom was well stocked with great products.\n\nEverything else in the room was downhill\u2026  We had been given corner room, but there was a broken seal in the west window, so the double pane was filled with moisture\/condensation \u2013 it might as well have been frosted glass.  Our sheets had little holes in them (see photo), every wooden surface was heavily nicked\/scraped, and the small chaise\/sofa thing had seen better days.  Basically, the room felt dated and dumpy \u2013 something one would expect from a budget chain that offers \u201csuites\u201d but certainly not from Marriott\u2019s flagship luxury brand.  And most definitely not one would expect from a room with an 80,000 point\/night redemption rate.\n\nEXECUTIVE LOUNGE:  Though it got a little cramped late in the mornings, the Executive Lounge was well appointed with classic modern d\u00e9cor.  The staff bent over backwards to make us feel welcome.  Excellent breakfast options \u2013 something for everyone.  Note:  The lounge is only open for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday (it does reopen for appetizers Sunday evening).  It would be nice to have access in the afternoon for water or soda after a day out in the city. We did not try the appetizers on Sunday, but if they are anything like the breakfast, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nOVERALL:  Loved the view.  Very happy with the location.  Walked away from the experience feeling ripped off.  Nothing about this experience made me feel like I was at a luxury hotel.  I don\u2019t feel like this property cares about its premium members; if it truly cared, we would not have been given the room we were given.  This is not a Park Hyatt - unfortunately.   I was (and still am) so unhappy with the \u201cluxury\u201d product we were given that I\u2019m currently booked at Hilton properties for the next three months \u2013 I was given their Diamond status during a match promotion and it is time to give it a try.  It is sad that it was a bad experience with Marriott\u2019s flagship luxury brand that pushed this customer away.  I\u2019ve been loyal to Marriott for years, but I need a reward program that can be loyal to me.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We did a lot of touristy things as well as saw two shows - a lot of walking but glad we stayed here. \n\nThis hotel is located just south of Central Park and is close to Broadway theatres and Times Square but yet far enough away from all that hustle and bustle. \n\nWe were greeted cheerfully and promptly by hotel staff the moment we stepped onto the property. Lobby is clean and very chic. The elevators are very ornate, beautiful and surprisingly fast - push the button and ding, the doors open - I never had to wait for one. \n\nWe had requested for a room on a higher floor and facing Central Park but none of our requests were available at the time of check in. We were instead given a room on the 3rd floor facing 58th Avenue. I did not like this room at all - mainly because, for the first night, all I heard was the ruckus from garbage trucks and loading trucks (and whatever other trucks were on 58th Avenue) the ENTIRE night! The noise sounded like it was directly outside our window. Whatever happened to sound-proofing buildings or noise curfews?! In addition, we were also arms-length away from the building across the street... I can see what our neighbours were watching on tv! Talk about a lack of privacy. We requested for a room change the next morning and they happily accommodated our request. We were moved to the 14th floor - still facing 58th Avenue - but at least it was a bit quieter and there's no one directly across from us.\n\nOur room was beautiful... comfy firm king bed with (too-soft-for-my-liking and it-gave-me-a-kink-in-my-neck) pillows, chaise lounge chair, desk and leather desk chair. The bathroom was beautiful and modern but it offered lavender aromatherapy bath products - couldn't use it because I'm allergic to lavender so I ended buying my own products. There's no coffee maker in the room but if you have lounge access, you can zip down the supersonic elevators in 1 nano second and get one (or three) in there. \n\nWe had Executive Lounge access because of our reward status. The breakfast was delicious - a mixture of hot and cold breakfast items but my FAVE is the smoked salmon, which I had every day. Too bad there's no cook-to-order egg station though. Breakfast also included great fresh fruit selections and it didn't end till 11am which meant no unnecessary early rising just to feed a grumbling empty stomach. I love that they had bottle water and soft drinks available too - great to take a bottle of water to our room in case we get thirsty at night. Happy hour (or as they call it \"evening offerings\") had a great selection of hot and antipasti items - our fave is the honey roasted mixed nuts. \n\nConcierge was helpful and offered commuting advice on how to get from point A to point B. Housekeeping was delightful - they greet you every time they see you! \n\nPlease note that parking is (eye bulging-ly) expensive at this hotel (and in Manhattan in general) so take this into consideration if you're driving to NYC - look to park your car elsewhere. We did and while in the city, we walked everywhere. You'll get nicely toned calves and bust a record on your pedometer.\n\nWould I stay here again? Oh yeah, for sure, but I'll have to save some money (or points) first.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

So for that we will always be grateful. \nBack here yesterday for 5 days and having stayed at various NYC hotels since then this, for the price, is just so disappointing. Yes it has a lovely foyer its in a great location and the staff are mostly helpful ( more in that later)  but the rooms are dingy and worn out with bits missing from various surfaces particularly in the bathroom. The high floor we requested when booking was not forthcoming and we had to ask to be moved- better but not a massive amount although at least we can now see sky. No water in the room no opportunity to put anything in a fridge that clearly assumes all the guests are thieves, no way to make a hot drink without paying to rent a kettle. The small towels in the bathroom are too small to wrap your hair in - annoying! \nAnd in further developments- because we are still here- the kettle saga continues. I rented one that was then removed and asked for another last night to be told- no problem it'll be right up- waited 40 mins feeling jet lagged and just wanting to go to bed- phoned down again to be told we have no kettle for you! When I asked why someone could not have phoned to let me know I was just met with 'it's not my department'. This is not something that works well when you are paying this much a night and Essex House needs to bear that in mind. And so it continues this morning still no kettle available so I asked hopefully 'where can I get the free coffee promised for Marriott cardholders'  'in the restaurant in the lobby' I was told- so got up, clothes on trotted down to the lobby only to find said restaurant doesn't open till 7- would this not have been good information to pass on?  Sadly now even more disappointed. \nSo if you want a faded hotel in serious need of a refurb with staff who do not go the extra mile in a hotel that does not think it good customer service to provide you with free tea and coffee making facilities or even just water in your really quite over priced absolutely no frills room then maybe this is for you. But the icing on the cake is that on Tuesday night- our last in NYC we are having to move hotels- why? Because the price of this same room doubles for that one night and it is seriously not worth it. So we'll be going to the a boutique hotel down the road the Refinery and will report back on that in due course. Something has happened here since our last visit in terms of customer service and not in a good way.

I got married here 22 years ago and guests still rave about how amazing the wedding was.\n\nWe decided to treat ourselves and plan an overnight stay in the city with our kids. It was a splurge, the room was $600+ for one night.\n\nAt this rate, I expected more elegance and more attention to detail. It's \"fine\" (except for the bathroom) but I definitely expected more.\n\nThe stunning lobby has been  marred by large garish color photographs of Central Park being hung as \"art.\" \n\nI paid about $50 extra to have a room with two double beds and was given a king room with a pullout couch for my kids. I wasn't happy about this but the kids said it was fine so I didn't complain. (Noting this because to be fair the hotel did not have an opportunity to make good on this without us bringing it up.)\n\nWe arrived at 10 pm and had to figure out the parking by ourselves. (When the bellman did arrive he was very courteous.) The front staff was not rude but also wasn't welcoming. \n\nThe room itself was cheaply renovated to look like a business class hotel. It was quite spacious and the actual bed was comfortable. The bathroom smelled odd; not at all what I would expect from a five star hotel. Also, our room had views of brick walls. I'm not complaining about the views because we didn't pay for a nice view. However, to cover them, the small windows had excessive drapery, making the room feel windowless, like an inside suite on a cruise if there were such a thing. \n\nI have stayed in the Waldorf and the Plaza, and even though I am a Marriott club member, I would have to say that while the stay was acceptable, it didn't feel luxurious and wouldn't stay here again unless I got a deeply discounted rate.  This grand lady of New York has changed hands at least twice since my wedding, and she seems to have suffered for it. \n\n","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

However, there was room for improvement. When we checked in, our room's AC didn't work.

At 11 p.m. when we returned we called again, a different mechanic came, worked on the unit and said it had never been turned on. He did turn it on, but it made a rattling noise, probably why it had been disconnected.\n\nIt worked, and because we were exhausted from a day of travel we managed to sleep despite the rattle. \n\nThere was no follow up call from the management staff apologizing or asking if our problem had been resolved.

It was once the most elegant of all the choices. along picturesque Central Park South, which made it a great spot among NYC hotels. This seems to no longer be the case. Our disappointment started with check-in at the front desk. It is obvious that the system that the desk staff works with is very slow and it takes a very long time for them to help each person - leading to long waits. We then went to the lobby restaurant for tea and had to get up from our seats to find a waiter. My wife reported that the ladies room in the lobby restaurant was very dirty.\nMoving on to the rooms, the lighting mechanisms consist of some sort of dimming switch that requires about 10 seconds each time you want to turn off a light - assuming of course, that you can figure out how to do it. In the bathroom, the toilet is so low and the flushing handle also so low that I worry for older guests.\nAt Sunday breakfast, the staff member that was busing the table was not-so-subtly rushing us along even though we had been there for less than one  hour.\nI should mention the bright spots - the front door staff, bell staff, and security men were all very polite and helpful.\nAll in all - our experience might have been acceptable at a medium-grade hotel with lower room prices, in a less competitive hotel market. But on Central Park South, NYC, at the prices Marriott is charging, they had better figure out a solution to these issues or they will lose discerning travelers to  competitors.

The staff -the front desk, cleaning staff, concierge lounge and  really everyone who works there were so friendly and willing to help you with whatever you needed. The breakfast in the lounge was outstanding and the staff had huge smiles on their faces ,greeting returning guests and welcoming new ones. I have not had that kind of caring attitude in most of my travels and it made you feel very welcome.\nThe \nSo please DO NOT  worry about this property- you will be pleasantly surprized and if you are really  concerned the hotel encourages you to contact them directly ,as they will answer any questions and alleviate any concerns.

I came here for my birthday weekend and was upgraded from a Manhattan view suite to a deluxe Manhattan view suite. In a prior stay I stayed in a regular Manhattan View Suite and the difference is that you trade a kitchen for a half bath, at least between these two suites. However having stayed in two of them I feel all are unique. The suite was sleek, clean, and modern with plenty of room to stretch out, which was great for watching the NCAA tournament. This is one hotel where suite really means suite, which isn't always true these days. The living room had a view of Carnegie Hall and you could see a sliver of central park from the bedroom. I feel like most of the central park views at this property belong to the condos, although I am sure Marriott kept a few. But if the park is your thing it is right out the front door so there is that. The sofa bed in the living room also makes these suites a great choice for groups of friends traveling together.\n\nIf you have access to it the free breakfast in the executive lounge is excellent, with plenty of hot and cold options and fresh orange juice. It is a great way to start the day off. My friend and I also did late night room service, which came quickly and was very good. Service through the weekend by the hotel staff was excellent.

My wife is a smoker and the doormen made sure she was OK whilst having her early morning smoke. Check-in was fast and efficient, I had checked in online before we left Heathrow, lady provided us with plenty of bottles of water when requested as we had quite a long cab ride from JFK due to disruption from the St Patricks Day parade.\n\nWe were not given any upgrade based on my Marriott status, not sure if you have to request this directly again on check-in. We had a room on the 9th Floor overlooking a side street which was actually OK as I\u2019m sure it would be much quieter than a room facing Central Park. Room was fairly small but we weren't visiting New York to stay in our room and were out most of the time.\n\nMy status gave me access to the executive lounge which we used for breakfast each morning.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":455186,"title":"Surely This Isn't a JW Marriott...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-03-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"My wife and I took the Acela down from Boston to meet my in-laws in New York City for the weekend and needed a hotel for one evening.  My in-laws were staying nearby so we decided to splurge and use points from accrued business travel to stay at the JW Marriott Essex House.\n\nPrice: 45,000 points seemed a little steep, but an essentially \"free night\" for accrued loyalty in a Central Park hotel seemed worthwhile.\n\nLocation: Excellent.  Situated at 160 Central Park South between 6th and 7th Avenues, the JW Marriott Essex House is in a prime location and was very accessible from Penn Station (with minimal luggage, we walked after sitting 3+ hours on the train), and very convenient to Central Park, 5th Avenue, and Broadway.\n\nArrival\/Check-In: Two doormen outside on arrival but neither offered to open the door for my wife - we went through the revolving doors which are a little difficult to push.  Check-in was relatively straightforward - I had checked in on the mobile app earlier on the train and requested a 12 PM arrival.  The lady at the front desk was very gracious and helpful, confirming my high floor request away from the elevator.  Of note, I didn't see an alternative check-in desk for Platinum members - it would have been a nice touch.\n\nRoom: We had room 2505, an Essex King.  The room layout was quite large and the two windows had a view of Central Park (if you craned your neck just enough you could see it).  Since we didn't pay for a Central Park view (and I don't think we got an upgrade), it was nice to have a little view.\n\nBathroom: Average.  the tub\/shower was old and is in need of refurbishment. and the grab handle on the wall was a little loose.  I'm a big guy (6'6\", 275 lbs.) and didn't feel particularly safe holding on to wash my feet.  Water pressure was average and the temperature control wasn't very good (the water barely got hot, even turned up all the way).  The toilet was an odd contraption - a low slung, low flow piece that took forever to flush.  A little discomforting the first time!  The sink was the highlight of the bathroom in terms of design - a pink bowl with better water pressure than the shower!  My wife and I agreed that the bath towels were amazing - so large, soft, and absorbent!\n\nBed: The first time in my life that I have stayed at a Marriott property and not had a good night's sleep.  The bed was so very firm and uncomfortable, even with three pillows.  I couldn't understand why I woke up sore until I got a chance glimpse of the bed this morning - the mattress was sitting on top of a piece of plywood!  This is unreal!  How on earth is this a JW Marriott property?  I generally sleep very well at Marriott properties, but this sleep was most uncomfortable.\n\nWifi: Nearly $20 per night for wifi is ridiculous in 2017.  Thankfully it was provided free of charge to us owing to my Platinum Elite status, but this is one of those amenities that should come standard for everyone two decades into the 21st century.\n\nExecutive Lounge: We received a key to the executive lounge (assume it was the M Club?) at check in, but every time we walked past the door there was a sign out front indicating it was closed.  I assume they're usually closed on the weekends, but curious why we got a key if that was the case.\n\nMinibar: Overpriced, but expected.  Prices aren't readily posted (always a bad sign).  We finally found the price guide on the TV - $9 for a Pepsi, $11 for a beer, $12 for an airline bottle (50ml) of liquor, and $60 for a 350ml bottle of wine.  I had one late night Heineken.\n\nSmell: When we arrived on the 25th floor, there was a work crew cleaning up in the hallway, and the carpet was soaked.  When we came out about a half hour later, there was an industrial blower fan set up in the hallway to dry the carpet.  Thinking nothing of it until we returned to our room after a show, and the 25th floor landing\/hallway smelled of dry vomit.  Quite possibly the worst thing to smell right before going to bed.  The scent lingered this morning as we left.  If that's what the work crew was cleaning up, they either missed a spot or forgot the cleaning agent entirely...\n\nOverall: The Essex House property served its purpose - a place to sleep for my wife and I for our one night trip to NYC.  The location was phenomenal and the service excellent; however, the bed was absolutely horrible, the room felt dated, and the smell in the hallway\/landing was...gross.  I used 45,000 points for this stay, but am having a hard time justifying it.  I would have been furious if I'd actually paid cash for this stay instead.  It's hard to believe that this hotel is a flagship JW Marriott property.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I checked in for one night requesting a high floor and I had to pay an additional $50 for a higher floor on a Sunday... c'mon? We ended up with a lower floor with no view, whatever we were going to be out the entire day. Later for dinner we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant. Oh my.... I wish we chose a different restaurant. Our waiter was beyond rude, and our salads were drenched in dressing which tasted very salty, and finally when we ordered dessert we ordered this chocolate lava ice cream.

Overall, we had a pleasant stay with no major problems. The hotel is historic and has a nice location overlooking Central Park. We had a room with a view of the park. Unfortunately, the room was not very high up. If you are interested in a park view room, request a high floor. I tried the mobile check-in and was notified that I was eligible for an upgrade but none was actually offered. \n\nCheck-in: Polite and perfunctory. The person who checked us in needs to brush up on giving the proper little check-in speech. There was no explanation of the lounge use, amenity hours, how to connect to wi-fi, etc. \n\nLocation: Having lived in NYC before, I can say that this is a nice location but it's really up to the traveler to decide what is a \"good\" location in Manhattan based on individual needs. If you are a tourist or traveling for business I think this is a nice location. Close to Time Warner Center (a mall, meh--but has Whole Foods in the basement); close to several subway stations (A\/C\/E and 1 lines to go downtown on the westside; N\/R\/Q and B\/D to go down to mid-town and beyond; NOT close to the 4\/5\/6). Being a 5-min walk from a Maison Kayser bakery was dangerous but delicious for us. It may be difficult to call a cab or Uber during busy times and you may have to wait in the smallish lobby. Tip: walk out of the hotel and go to one of the other corners with a major avenue (say 8th for going uptown; 7th or 5th for going downtown; avoid Broadway for going downtown so as to not go through Times Square) to call a cab, which is often faster than ordering Uber.\n\nRoom: Some other reviewers have mentioned \"old\" decor. The lobby is \"old\" but it is a historic hotel and it is beautiful in that way. However, it is a small lobby. The wood in our room had wear and tear but it was not terrible. Otherwise I would call the size of the room \"compact\" for non-NY standards, and a decent size for NY standards. If you have a lot of large luggage it is quite tight. We were there on a very cold weekend and it was cold sitting near the window. The bed was a bit too soft for me. The bathroom door really needs to be a pocket door. There was hardly any hallway noise but we heard lots of footsteps stomping from above (must have been a kid). Facing central park, there was some street noise but by Manhattan standards already far less of it than elsewhere in Manhattan. Honking is a fact of life around here. The only feature I really did not like about the room is the carpet. When is the last time you've seen beige carpet in a hotel room? It really showed stains and I don't want to know what else. ugh.\n\nAmenities: The enhanced wifi speed is quite good and is complimentary if you are a gold or platinum member. We did not use the restaurant. We ate breakfast in the executive lounge. The breakfast is  good for a complimentary meal and has hot proteins, high-quality pastries and croissants, oatmeal, cereal, fresh fruits, deli meats, bagels, toast, yogurt, juices, coffee, tea, etc. I did not use the fitness center but it is moderately sized and does not have much more than treadmills. The \"spa\" is very small and is part of the fitness center. My husband had a nice 80-min massage in one of the treatment rooms. Kudos to the concierge Michael Antonelli for arranging this and communicating with us promptly when needed.\n\nService: Aside from the person at check-in, staff was friendly and helpful.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arrival we were met by the door man who was pleasant, but less than impressively dressed due to shirt tail hanging out and ill fitting uniform.  At the front desk, there was one attendant and he was helping a woman who had a litany of questions.  OK, she deserves attention, of course.  But no \"just one moment\" or \" I will be right with you\" from the front desk clerk, rather we received no acknowledgement whatsoever.  Finally, he appeared to complete the questions of the guest he was attending to, only to have him acknowledge us and tell us that he would be with us when completed the various \"tasks\" that the previous guest had given\/requested.  When he got to us, we checked in and asked that the bags be sent to the room as we had a dinner reservation.  No bellman, but the door man was summoned to take the bags up.  Meanwhile, we were left to find our own cab in front of the hotel.  Not a great arrival!  The room helped the impressions a bit as it was large by any standard, not just NYC standards.  Bed was comfortable and TV was new, large, and had plenty of channels.  The bathroom was a bit underwhelming and cramped.  The bathtub \/ shower combo was simply old and in need of a makeover or replacement. Next morning was not much better as we were going to have a quick breakfast in the Marriott Honored Guest breakfast area.  This did not occur as there were more people than tables and a waiting list was established.  Upon checking out later that day we took our bags to the lobby ourselves and  arranged a car to pick us up.  Good thing, as again, no one offered assistance with bags or to arrange a cab or alternative.  Instead, the two doormen stood and chatted \/ laughed with a local while guests managed by themselves. Of late I find myself saying \"not JW Marriott standard\", but perhaps I am incorrect and the standard simply is not what it used to be.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":455186,"title":"Nice start to a business trip","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-02-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Traveling for business I frequently arrive well before official check in time.  I arrived at the property at about 10:30am and there was some confusion among the staff where I should go to check in.  Apparently there had been an event that morning that required them to move check in from one side of the lobby to the other.  They were in the process of resetting things to the normal configuration when I arrived and it took a minute for them to determine which side of the lobby they needed me be.  This was really no problem for me at all, but clearly created concern for the staff as they were very apologetic even though I really only had to walk about 30 steps total before we they got everything figured out.  Given the shift in check in operations there was a bit of a challenge for the staff to get logged in to their system to check me in.  Again, this was really just a minor delay, but the staffs clear concern for my time was evident as they were extremely apologetic.  I suppose if I was in a major rush this may have been a concern and while it was not a concern for me at all I did appreciate that they were mindful of the delay.  It was pretty obvious within my first 5 minutes there that the staff at this property takes customer experience seriously.  \n\nWhile my room was not ready, which I did not expect it would be they quickly stored my bags and provided an access card to the lounge, which was great because I really needed a coffee.  The lounge was well appointed, comfortable and easy to navigate.  My status warranted an upgraded room with Central Park views.  \n\nWhile this wasn't important to me, as I didn't get back to the hotel until it was nearly dark, if you were on vacation or views are important to you, especially if booking and paying for the park view but even if upgraded, I would request 10th floor or above.  I was on the 6th floor and while I faced the park it was pretty much tree level so you really did not see much of the park.\n\nThe food in the lounge in the evening looked very appealing and had a lot of options although I did not partake.  This is probably a NYC thing but all adult beverages where for pay on an honor bar system, many Marriott lounges have some or all free options during the early evening hours, but not this location.  Just something to keep in mind to calibrate your expectations if you are an elite rewards member.  \n\nI did enjoy the breakfast.  The food was great and there were enough seating options that I was able to conduct a business meeting in the lounge at breakfast.\n\nEvery interaction with the staff was positive and while I did not have any issues that required special attention my feeling was that if I had it would have been handled with style.\n\nLocated on the south side of Central Park, the Essex House is a easy walk to Radio City Music Hall, MOMA and I am sure many other NYC areas of interest that I did not walk past on my way to my office.\n\nThe JW Marriott Essex House will be at the top of my list the next time I am booking a trip to New York.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and I won't name names because I don't believe that's fair unless something really egregious occurs.

First advice, DO NOT TAKE ANY ROUTE THAT TAKES YOU THROUGH THE LINCOLN TUNNEL!  Holy Traffic! Once you get to your hotel, let them park your car and leave it behind the entire time you are there, those people are crazy, and sorry, do NOT know how to drive.  Walking is surely the way to go, but since nobody seems to know their way around the city (even when they live there), it's a crapshoot if you'll get where you are headed.  Uber did manage to get us from point A to point B but, well, lets just say those crazy drivers were some of them.  \n\nOn to the hotel.  The JW Marriott Essex House is beautiful upon entering, and the staff was very nice and helpful.  However, when we requested a double room we were told that they don't have such rooms at that hotel and were offered a type of family suite with adjoining rooms.  Our room was directly right of the elevator, and the thin walls allowed us to hear people coming and going all night long.  The room size was totally fine, but the furniture, blinds and bathroom could use some updates.  While standing at the sink, the wooden panel in front fell straight down and hit my foot, lucky for me I was wearing shoes, or I'd have easily lost a toe.  UGH.  All in all, the placement of the hotel is great, the food is right in line with how expensive the rest of New York is and the people were very nice and super helpful, but the hotel itself could use an overhaul.  For the price we paid for these rooms, I can say I don't think I'd stay there again if I were to return, (which frankly, I don't plan on doing, NY is for sure a shopping city, so if that's not your thing, I wouldn't bother.)","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Upon arrival they said we would get an upgrade to a much nicer room.  Well the room was a handicapped accessible room so definitely larger but it was on the back side of the hotel with a view of another building.  While the more spacious room was nice, we didn't need the handicapped accessibility and would have preferred our original booking with the park view.  We went back to the desk and were informed our original room had already been re-booked and they had no park view rooms available.  Strike one.  If you are in NYC on business over the weekend, you have no access the the executive lounge except for breakfast.  They close it Friday and Saturday with only breakfast service.  So if you wanted a place to work other than your room, you are out of luck.  Strike two.  We also booked a late checkout of 1pm on Sunday.  Be prepared to be sitting in your hotel room not yet presentable with your wife in the shower and hotel management lets themselves into your room because they were not informed you had scheduled late check out and when they see you they STILL proceed to enter the room even when you are telling them to stop and leave and they walk into the middle of the room looking at their checkout paper insisting it says we checked out on the paper.

De ligging vind in zelf uitstekend: vlak aan Central Park waardoor voor mij alles op wandelafstand ligt. De kamers zijn behoorlijk oud en zouden eigenlijk een update kunnen gebruiken.  Zo komt de koude en wind bijvoorbeeld voelbaar binnen langs de ramen....De roomservice is correct en alles is vers en warm wanneer het op de kamer geleverd wordt. Dit heb ik in andere hotels al anders mogen ervaren. Het ontbijt is een bevreemdende ervaring: het personeel in het restaurant waar het ontbijt genomen kan worden, is talrijk, maar doet er alles aan om je in de tweede helft van de zaal te plaatsen, terwijl de eerste helft en de tafels met zicht op  central park leeg blijven. De sfeer tussen het personeel is goed, maar je hebt het gevoel dat je hen eigenlijk stoort, hoewel er vaak maar drie tafels gebruikt worden voor het ontbijt. Tot slot, nog een opmerking inzake de kamer: in vraag steeds een kamer op een 'high floor', maar deze keer zat ik op de vijfde verdieping (een andere kamer kon ik niet krijgen) en dat heb ik geweten: enorm veel lawaai op ieder uur van de dag....","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My daughter never got her entree, it took 25 minutes to get our car from valet and then they acted like we were putting them out to put the bags in the car.  The front desk manager Anthony was condescending and rude.  I could go on and on.

In fact I have probably spent more nights in hotels than in my own home. Most of the time this is for business - this time it was an indulgent trip to New York with my 2 sisters to celebrate my birthday.\nTo start off the staff went out of their way to spoil me - upgraded to a ENORMOUS suite, early check in no problem. The day of our arrival there was foot of snow on the ground and we were so grateful to be able to check in and put on warmer clothes before venturing out. Surprise number 2 - when I mentioned to one of the housekeeping personnel Dolores that it was my birthday she smiled and a few hours later room service brought us a bottle of Prosecco and a wonderful chocolate cake.\nWow. \nAnd even my sisters - who were there to celebrate with me - could not get over the incredible service from all the staff - nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed a show the first night and came back to the hotel bar\/restaurant for a nightcap - the server was so flexible and when we agreed that a snack would be good he put together a plate of cheeses, cold cuts and the most delicious chicken wings. \nThe next day was warmer and we were able to explore the environs - what a perfect location. Close to everything (even Times Square - a place I avoid but I know is an attraction for most people visiting the city).\nThe bedding and beds were incredibly comfortable - something I find a challenge at even some of the best hotels I have stayed at.\nOverall an incredible visit - definately  plan to stay here next time I am in the City.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

One thing i have to say is that you can't beat the location, as you have quick access to central park, subway and great restaurants. As for the hotel, I would say that there are better options out there for your money. I upgraded the standard room to a \"Room with a view\" of Central park, which cost me about an extra $100. The room had a view, but that view was meh, and the one window in the room felt like a port window from a boat (very small). As for the amenities, pretty standard. One oversight on the staff was that my room came with an iron, but no ironing board. My personal interactions with the staff were great, but i witnessed a few things that made me think less of this hotel. The elevators are very small, and often packed with people. While the elevator was clearly full, a bellhop decided it would be a great idea to push a luggage cart onto the elevator making everyone squished. Then when a family, with a newborn, tried to get off on a stop, the bellhop didn't move the cart creating a nightmare scenario for them trying to get off the elevator. Finally, stopped at the bar attached to the hotel for a drink. Only thing i can say is that it was the worst service i have ever had. I have stayed at a handful of other hotels around NYC, and my stay has been much more pleasurable than this hotel, and for a cheaper price.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Although a  couple of mornings we took them back to our rooms. Columbus Circle is 1minute walk away offering all the shopping you could want. The Disney store, M&Ms store plus more are on the edge of Times Square (so within 2 min walk). We took a number of strolls through the park at different times of the day which was just stunning. I'd recommend having lunch at the Leobe Boathouse which is in the centre of Central Park. There's not much I can say about the hotel because everything was just so easy. Our holiday consisted of us turning up, (albeit our flight was delayed and I had to phone the hotel as soon as we landed to say we were definitely not a NO SHOW and would be there- but this caused no problem and we had our room ready and waiting on arrival).

I did not make a fuss on site, as this would have upset the family dynamic and wasted precious time, and then we only figured out the thermostat issues late at night - which made for miserable sleeping. \nSo not a JW. I stay Marriott loyally the world over, both in business for arranging events and personally for fun and I have to say, in twenty years that this was one of the biggest disappointments based on brand and cost.

However, because of the location I decided to take a chance.  The JW Marriott Essex\nHouse has great potential to be a landmark quality hotel that would be a gem in the\nMarriott crown.  Simple details seemed to be overlooked, or ignored completely.  When we booked the room we were told we would be on a high level floor with a view of Central Park.  We were given a room on the 7th floor.  We did have a splendid view down the center of Central Park but it would have been better on a higher floor which is what we expected.  When we inquired about the discrepancy, we were told there are\nno guarantees for a high floor and none were available because we were there for the Christmas holiday.  We paid over $400 per night and didn't even get complimentary bottles of water!  We are reward members too! The furniture looks like it needs to be repaired or replaced as there are chips, dents, and scratches in most areas.  The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off the wall, and the area that was peeling seemed to be a very poor patch up job.  When we returned to our room after an outing there was a pile of trash in the hallway by our room, and it was still there when we left for dinner hours later.  By morning the trash was finally gone, but it was disappointing to see in the first place.  The bed was extremely comfortable, although my husband thought it was too soft.  The room was quiet and overall our experience at the Essex House was good. The staff was polite and friendly.  However, for over $400 per night we expected there to be more attention to details.

This hotel gets 5 stars for the location, history, and housekeeping staff.  They seem to have done a nice job preserving the turn-of-the-century beauty and keeping the high-traffic hotel well maintained.  The real downside is the rooms.  They are well stocked and clean, but let me tell you - they are SMALL.  We had 3 people in a double room and it was not particularly fun.  We had to literally roll the desk chair into the closet so that we had space to just walk around the room.  \n\nBut, that being said, you shouldn't be spending too much time in the room considering this hotel's location.  Within easy walking distance you have: Central Park, Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center, Midtown, 5th Ave, Times Square, the Theater District, and Hell's Kitchen.  If you are traveling by train, Penn Station and Grand Central are just a short cab ride away; there are also plenty of subway stations nearby.  \n\nThe other downside is the concierge lounge - it was an utter zoo this weekend!  It was not the exclusive business lounge that I have come to love and depend on when traveling.  I couldn't even sit down to enjoy breakfast because it was so busy and the staff was horridly rude to patrons.  I saw a woman being yelled at in front of a lobby full of people for *attempting* to bring a banana out of the lounge.  \n\nIf you just need a place to lay your head - this isn't a bad option.

(Local beer \u00a312 for about 4\/5ths of a pint, prosecco \u00a318 for a glass not a bottle - yes that's in GB Pounds not $ - calculated at the December 2016 exchange rate and including an obligatory 20% tip). Usually, in Marriotts we make great use of the hotel bars and restaurants but the Essex House was so overpriced we went elsewhere. Midtown will never be cheap, but this was ludicrous.\n\n- Seen from a distance the hotel looks amazing and dominates the skyline overlooking Central Park. There is nothing in the hotel that takes advantage of its location. It needs a bar\/restaurant\/roof garden with views over the park.\n\n- Unlike most Marriotts the Executive Lounge only offers complimentary soft drinks\n\n- The Executive Lounge does not open on certain days\n\n- On one evening they closed the bar to hotel guests for a private party and did not offer an alternative.\n\nSummary\n\nThere are much, much better Marriotts in NYC (I have stayed at four others). This place could be breathtakingly good but, as it is presently, it falls way short. It might meet brand standards but JW Marriotts are supposed to make you feel special and excited by the hotel.

I showed up about two hours after the check in time. The took me away from the main check out area just as I was about to be assisted to a small area down the hallway, it was strange, the way the guy snapped at me to follow him, made you feel like you were not good enough for the main check in area. Total rudeness, put in the shabbiest of rooms, no view, no upgrade of any kind. dirty carpets, awkward layout, she offered my points because she said 10 would not get me anything. The management of this hotel does not understand how long it takes to accumulate 45,000 points and they don't care it is totally clear. The way she talked to me I felt like they wish I had not come and so do I. I tried to express my disappointment I was immediately shut up before I could finish talking with a line I'll never forget saying \"Maybe\" we can give you a nice room on a future visit. \n\nWhy would I risk another 45,000 points just to see if they will treat me right. I will never set foot in here on any future visits to NYC, as a consumer you should trust that the overwhelmingly bad reviews on this site and others are a sign that you should select a different Marriott Hotel of which there are so many. If this is how they treat there most valuable guests imagine how they treat someone who has no status. \n\n","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

But if I'd paid $900\/night I'd have been livid.  The hotel is nice, and the room is large.  But it's not that nice.  I understand that everything in NYC is expensive, and the CP address is even better, but some things felt dated, and a few amenities were lacking.\n\nOn the good side - friendly staff, the proximity to the Park is great, especially if you are a runner.\n\nBad stuff:\n\n1. We arrived Friday night around 10pm and noticed a glass on the floor in the hallway, likely left by our neighbor.  When we returned to the hotel Saturday night, 24 hours later, it was still there.  Attention to detail\n\n2. Mold along the caulk lines in the shower.  Pretty much unacceptable in my book for a hotel at this level\n\n3. We noticed some major dings on the baseboards and elsewhere in the hallways that had simply been painted over.  That's a Motel 6 practice.  Baseboards are cheap, and a 5* hotel should be doing it right.\n\n4. There is no coffee pot in the room, which makes absolutely no sense.  We like to drink hot tea, and usually bring our own tea bags and use the pot for hot water, which of course is impossible here.  They do offer complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning, which would be fine except that they only have coffee - no tea or hot water.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights for a weekend birthday trip. Friends also joined us in another room in the hotel. Check in was simple using Marriott's iPhone app, and the room keys were ready when I arrived. The hotel doesn't have the texting to guest services option turned on in the app as some Marriotts do. \n\nGuest relations had contacted me via email ahead of time to inquire about what brings me to NY. I responded that it was a birthday trip for me and my husband. I am a Platinum member so requested an upgrade when I replied. They were unable to upgrade me, but did leave a handwritten note with two drink vouchers in the room. \n\nWe were in a room on the 16th floor; it didn't offer a view of anything but an adjacent building. Our king room was modestly sized as others have described. The bed and bedding was comfortable. The quality of the furnishings was poor in light of the hype (Category 9) of the hotel and the JW brand. The room had not been updated in a number of years and had a worn feel. This is a historic property with some ornate details (lobby, elevators), but this doesn't fully translate to the room. We appreciated that there were robes provided as well as an in-room safe. We found that our room was turned over promptly each day.\n\nWe had breakfast one day in the executive lounge. There was a full array of hot and cold options consistent with any Marriott lounge- nothing special. It gets crowded, so they manage it by forming a wait list.\n\nWe had a few drinks in the lobby restaurant, but didn't explore the food. At the 5PM hour on Friday, the bar staff was struggling to quickly attend to the bar seating. \n\nThe location of this hotel is prime, directly across the street from Central Park and accessible to trains plus the shops and restaurants of Manhattan. Other than location, it is underwhelming. I had an incredibly disappointing service experience on my last day. I had requested a late check-out upon checking in, so in the morning of the last day, I called to confirm what time late check out was. The person who answered the phone stated the hotel was unable to offer \"any more\" late check-outs. When I noted I had requested it at check-in, she told me they didn't offer \"any\" late check-outs and that I'd need to check out by 11AM. I had to skip my workout then hurry to get myself out by 11, then check my bags with the bell desk. I called my friends to give them a heads up and learned they had a late-check out. I discussed this sloppy service mishap with the front desk attendant who apologized, looked at my account and stated I could indeed have a 1 or 2PM check-out. This didn't help since I'd already rushed around and moved my things out. I stay in a Marriott almost every week of the year, usually in NYC or a major city, and have never encountered such a sloppy service situation (or a problem obtaining a 1PM check out). It was very unexpected and had a disappointing impact to my day's plans. Based upon this, I won't return to this property when on pleasure or business in NYC.

When we requested another room we were told there wasn't a room available. To make matters worse the night manager eventually admitted the hotel knew about the noise AND previous guests had complained, but still put us in the room without any prior disclosure. The night manager came to our room around midnight and stayed until 1.30am trying to stick a duvet to the window with sticky tape to muffle the noise. It was never going to work and eventually he told us he was sorry but it wasn't working. I said there was no way I was paying for that first night as it was ridiculous that a) we had been stuck in a room with a known problem and b) we had been kept awake half the night watching this ridiculous attempt to stop the noise.\n\nThe next day we were moved to several different rooms all of which had similar, or in 1 case worse, noise problems. Eventually the third room we were given was free from this jet engine noise but as it was on a lower floor facing the main road still had traffic noise though this was preferable to the previous noise and at the least had a view of the park. \n\nThe hotel is apparently due to be refurbished and I certainly hope they will get better windows to keep out the various noises from outside to allow guests to sleep peacefully. \n\nWhilst the hotel rooms were terrible for the poor noise insulation as well as being in need of modernisation, the staff were polite and offered as good customer service as they were able to. \n\nWe stayed as a couple but were there to attend an event with other family embers  and friends also staying at the hotel and all of us were equally unimpressed. \n\nMy Amex was charged the room rate for all of the nights we stayed at the hotel even though I made it clear I would not pay for that first night and the night manager on the first night seemed to acknowledge it was unreasonable to charge us for the first night whilst trying to stick the duvet to the window. My card was also charged without discussing the bill with me, which I have never experienced at any other hotel in the world.\n\nFor the rate of almost $500 per night there are a swathe of better hotels you can select in the city. This is one to avoid. \n\nThis year 2016 I stayed at the Starwood in Athens in September and the Marriott in Paris, but after this experience I do not plan to ever stay in a Marriott again.\n\nTerrible experience.

I am a Marriott Gold Rewards member, so I decided to use my Marriott Rewards points for our stay.  I did mobile checkin 2 hours before arrival, and our room was available at noon when we arrived.  Our checkin went very smoothly.  In addition, the clerk informed me that no room upgrades were available.  I did not expect any upgrade to begin with, because the hotel was completely booked for the Macy's Parade.  Plus, I was using my Marriott Rewards points for our stay.  However, we still received a key pass for the Executive Lounge, which is for Marriott Platinum and Gold members.  \n\nMy wife and I were very impressed with our room.  It was classified as an Essex King, and it was about 330 square feet, which is good size for New York standards.  We knew this was an upscale hotel by looking at the furnishings and decor of the room.  In particular, when we walked into the room, a motion sensor light automatically turned the lights on.  There was also a motion sensor light on the bottoms of the 2 night stands at the edges of the king bed.  The floor had carpeting, and there was a nice desk with a comfortable chair at the end of the bed.  Furthermore, the drapes on the windows were very fancy.  Moreover, the bathroom was good size, and it contained an elevated sink. The bed and pillows were very comfortable,  so my wife and I had no problems sleeping that night.  Plus, the noise level was non-existent.  Another positive of the hotel was the staff, which were all well dressed, very pleasant, and helpful.\n\nMy wife and I took advantage of the Executive Lounge that evening.  This lounge contained a diversity of food to satisfy one's appetite.  There was no need to go out to dinner that night.  On Thanksgiving morning, the Executive Lounge contained coffee and water.  \n\nEven though the JW Marriott Essex House is on the Macy's Parade route, hotel guests were not allowed to stand in front of the hotel.  Rather, guests could walk one block up to 7th Ave or another block from there to Columbus Circle.  In our case, my wife and I went out the back door of the hotel to 58th Street, turned left, and went a short distance to the intersection of 6th Avenue and 58th Street.  \n\nIn summary, this is an upscale hotel that my wife and I strongly recommend to anyone willing to pay above average prices.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My flight ended up landing late, and I made it to the hotel just at 5PM. My room still wasn't ready, and while the staff at the front desk was friendly, there wasn't anything they could do about it. If check in is at 4:00, I expect my room to be ready at 4:00. I had to request a coupon for a free beer at the hotel bar while I waited an additional 20 minutes for my room to be ready, and received a phone call later that night letting me know I would receive 5,000 points. That is all well and good, but points don't make up for a bad experience. \n\nThe executive lounge at this hotel desperately needs to be expanded, or needs to stop being sold as an add on to guests. The hotel informed me they don't sell it as an add on, but there is a big page on their website that lists you can add it to your room. After I pointed this out to them, they ceased communication with me. Waits of 15-20 minutes on weekends for breakfast are just ridiculous. The hotel wouldn't even offer breakfast vouchers for the hotel restaurant, so everyone just huddled up at the door to the lounge.

Subway stations bookend the area - we were able to walk from Penn Station to the hotel with our luggage (1.4 miles), and then realized the subway for that route was very convenient (Columbus Circle, 59th and 7th avenue). We used points and stayed in a one bedroom suite that easily accommodated three of us. The bedroom had a day bed\/couch, and the living had a pull out couch, so 4 or even 5 could probably have fit. Service was very attentive. The executive lounge restricts breakfast guests to one plus the card member and charges $50 for any additional person. The buffet was relatively robust, with eggs, bacon, oatmeal, yogurt, sausage, waffles, etc. The eating space in the lounge is too small for the demand, resulting in people crowding the entry way, waiting for a place to sit. But the food was fine. We ate there once and then opted for Le Pain Quotidien across the street for a cheaper meal (if you have more than 2 people).

One suggestion - if you truly want to be considered the luxury brand for Marriott (aside from Ritz), you need better bathroom products - this generic stuff made by Sysco is not going to cut it.

O lounge, onde \u00e9 servido o caf\u00e9 para membros elite do programa de fidelidade, continua o retrato da desorganiza\u00e7\u00e3o: pequeno, apertado, absolutamente insuficiente para o tamanho do hotel. N\u00e3o bastasse o subdimensiomento, os funcion\u00e1rios que n\u00e3o me parecem poucos, parecem perdidos e as mesas sujas se acumulam enquanto os hospedes de apertam esperando para sentar. N\u00e3o sei se \u00e9 o fato das gorgetas aqui serem minguadas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao restaurante principal, se \u00e9 falta de treinamento ou excesso de trabalho. Foi colocada uma pessoa para receber as pessoas mas pelo que pude observar ela pouco ajuda. O retrato da desorganiza\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser notado pelo fato do suco ter acabado e ter ficado sem reposi\u00e7\u00e3o da hora que entramos at\u00e9 a hora em que sa\u00edmos. Poderia ser normal se n\u00e3o tivessemos passado cerca de 1 hora sentados e os recipientes n\u00e3o estivessem imediatamente na frente do hostess. Se o caf\u00e9 no lounge n\u00e3o estivesse inclu\u00eddo certamente n\u00e3o comer\u00edamos al\u00ed. Quanto ao front desk ele me parece incompat\u00edvel com a faixa de pre\u00e7o hotel. Falta cordialidade, pessoalidade e interesse. Em nenhum momento, em nenhuma visita me senti bem recebido, algo que apesar de incomum em NY pode ser sentido at\u00e9 em hot\u00e9is muito mais simples e baratos. Tenho status gold ou superior em praticamente todas as grandes redes de hot\u00e9is o que agrava ainda mais a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de desconsidera\u00e7\u00e3o. Um exemplo foi o check out: liguei perguntando sobre a necessidade de passar no front desk, visto que tinham meu cart\u00e3o e todas as informa\u00e7\u00f5es necess\u00e1rias... para minha surpresa, em vez de ser transferido para o front desk, fui \"mandado\" pelo atendente fazer o check out via tv - que n\u00e3o estava funcionando. Nova liga\u00e7\u00e3o e pedi direto para ser transferido para o front desk, que atendeu, tirou o telefone do gancho e continuou atendendo a pessoa do balc\u00e3o... Mais uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o, relatei o problema e o atendente sugeriu que se eu estivesse ok com a conta poderia simplesmente deixar avisado que estava saindo e ele avisaria a portaria.

We would definitely stay here again. \n","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel was pretty bussy, so it took about 20 min to get to the check in counter. The representative was exceptionally nice and give us a warm welcome. When we got to the room I got a rude awakening and couldn't believe how outdated the room was and how bad the carpet looked, old and full of stains. It's hard to believe this is a Marriott hotel. I will definitely not recommend this hotel unless they do some remodeling. ","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The Art Deco accents and luxurious decorations in the public spaces maximizes the warmth of the surroundings and our room had all the storage space we needed to unpack and have easy to access to everything.  We did have a Central Park view room and I would recommend that no matter the floor.  We were on the 6th and loved the ever changing sights out our windows and tried to devise multiple ways to get the super comfy divan packed into our luggage so we could bring it home \ud83d\ude00.

This is probably my fifth time staying at the Essex House in the past year.    \n\nThis is however, the first time I have been upgraded to a suite, which was very nice.  I checked in via the Marriott app and was pleasantly surprised to receive a nice suite when I checked in.  Because it is such an old building the walls are thick and you can't hear your neighbors like in most hotels.\n\nThe concierge lounge puts out an amazing spread, probably one of the best in the U.S.  The only place I've seen better is in Europe.\n\nLobby bar\/restaurant is nice, but extremely pricey.  $12 for a Coors Light draft is a little much, even at the Essex House.  Food was good and bartenders were friendly.\n\nGym is nice but lacks a good strength area.  Equipment is new, but very small strength area especially if there are a few people in the gym.  Treadmills are nice and on the new side.\n\nI have to admit that I would not stay at this hotel at the price they charge if work was not paying for it, but they are so I do.  I'll continue to stay at the Essex House at every chance I Get so long as it's not on my dime.  Besides A Ritz or Four Seasons this hotel doesn't trail far behind.\n\n","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was told by security it was marijuana! My wife is pregnant and we had our 1 year old son in the room with us so totally ruined the experience for us. I was then told by security they didn't want to point fingers and if it happens again they would deal with it properly, I feel this must be normal in the hotel with how laid back they were about it. For my wife this put her on edge the whole time we were in the hotel and she could not sleep properly as worried it may happen again, she was very upset and it ruined what was meant to be a holiday of a lifetime. \nI know the hotel can't always control their guests and what they do but I feel it was very badly handled considering how serious it was.\nOn a plus not the cleaner in our room did a fantastic job!\nBut it's safe to say I will never be staying with them again. \n\n","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The entrance to the hotel, and the fact it was on Central Park South, was brilliant. That is where the brilliance ended. The doormen took our bags whilst we checked in and then we meandered around downstairs for a while. Only to walk back through the entrance hall to find our cases still there and unattended. Therefore we took them off the trolley and took up ourselves. When we arrived in the room...for that cost per night...they were small, dark & pokey, with quite dated fixtures & fittings. We unpacked & couldn't even fit our clothes for our short stay in the wardrobe. Nor could we fit both average sized cases in the wardrobe, so we had to move the sofa in order to tuck the other suitcase behind it so that we wouldn't trip over it. On not one of the three mornings that I ordered breakfast did I get the correct drink that I ordered, but waiters were unattentive & couldn't have cared less. On one occasion we got locked out of our room - I had to visit reception 3x times as they kept advising that I had to wait for security at my room, but no one came. Yet the room phone kept ringing off the hook. What frustrated me the most was the attitude of the receptionist who didn't apologise once during the whole 30 minute debacle of trying to gain access to the room, and was actually quite rude. Then on the last night, seeing as we were leaving early the next morning, we went to settle our bill, of which there was nothing - which is what we expected. Yet at 5:30am the next morning, we got a bill for one breakfast (our breakfasts were included & this wasn't on our room 8 hours earlier) so even though our airport shuttle was waiting, we had to go and have the charge removed at reception. Every interaction with hotel staff was either riddled with total incompetence or a passive approach to customer care. We would suggest that you don't waste your money on Essex House - a totally dated, overpriced hotel with terrible service.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}
