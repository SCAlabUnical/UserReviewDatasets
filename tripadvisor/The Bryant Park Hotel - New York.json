From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out, we were treated as if we were the most important people there. Upon check in, Jo greeted us as if we were best friends. She was delightful and entertaining and super helpful. Scott was at check in as well and was so attentive to our needs. Thru booking, I had mentioned it was my daughter's birthday which both Jo and Scott acknowledged. Even better - when we returned to our room after going out for the afternoon, they had a beautifully handwritten birthday message with a balloon and 2 cupcakes from Magnolia Bakery. Such a simple gesture with an incredible impact. The room was very nice and clean. Good size for NYC. The bathroom was incredible too. The bed was a queen (I prob should have booked 2 beds) so it was a little tight for us but not horrible. We visited the Celon lounge for a drink the first night. Super cool place in the lower level of the hotel.  And the location of the Bryant Park Hotel is just perfect. Right across the street from Bryant Park.

First is the  staff who are the most genuine. Always happy to help. Starting with John Castillo and his amazing front desk staff, especially Jo and Shannon. The bellmen Ray, Dominic and Ronan are always on top of it as well. (It was fun to learn that several of the staff live where I grew up in Woodside Queens). Second, the building is a marvel in itself. from the Black and Gold Gothic Facade to it's history. Third is location, can't beat it. Far enough away from the craziness that NYC can become but close enough to all the action and a subway station on the corner. Centrally located in midtown very easy to get downtown or uptown. The rooms are large, functional and very comfortable with lots of windows even in the large bathroom. We had a Park View corner room and it had 5 large windows, 3 in the bedroom and 2 in the bathroom. with only 128 rooms and 2 quick elevators it was always quick to get to the room and back to the lobby even with being on the 16th floor. I will say the rooms are in need of an update and my understanding is that is in process. It's not that they are shabby or anything and all the furniture is well maintained and in good shape as is everything else in the room, just the style is dated. Celon bar in the basement is very special and a must try. Ambience, staff and drinks all shine here. Koi restaurant is good and once again the staff, ambience and service all shine here. Food is very good but not great.  It can get very noisy inside so keep that in mind if you need to have an important conversion at dinner. Room rates are some of the best you'll find in NYC given the location of the hotel  and size of the rooms compared to many other surrounding hotels in the area. The free coffee and muffins in the lobby are a nice touch and the coffee is top shelf. I will be retuning to the Bryant Park hotel in May for my second stay and very much looking forward to it.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

She was so engaging and taught him how to be a bellman! When we returned for our luggage she presented him with a little certificate.

Small things -- huge, warm bathrobes. a spare blanket, perfect pillows, heat that you could control (I like it cold at night thus the need for the spare blanket and warm in the day), fantastic room amenities. a huge bathtub and separate shower. Other things that I though were gone forever were  beds that are actually made crisply and pens in the room (I confess, I took them home.) No coffee makers in the room, but coffee and muffins available downstairs in the morning.  I've always wanted to stay in that hotel -- the building is gorgeous -- but for some reason never did. I have already booked a return trip for me and one for my daughter's birthday.  Perfect, wonderful stay. Thank you so much, folks.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Mistakenly I thought the Bryant Park Hotel was the same place but it\u2019s a few meters away, conveniently and charmingly located right across from Bryant Park with its Christmas decorations, winter village and ice skating rink of which we had a glorious view from our room. Unfortunately some ugly scaffolding adorned the Bryant Park just now, spoiling the entry way. But the staff welcome was good and friendly and prompt when we arrived. I didn\u2019t know the Bryant Park was #1 in New York on TripAdvisor (I knew it was highly ranked) but I can see how it got its rating. Slightly dated the elevators need some updating but they worked ok and our room was a very generously appointed suite with two bathrooms and a fabulous view (22nd floor). This hotel is eye watering expensive and could do with a facelift but nothing to dent a five star rating. The bar (Celon) is atmospheric and good cocktails. We didn\u2019t eat at the hotel but we heard the restaurant was very good. You can walk everywhere from the hotel - it\u2019s a great mid town location. Many positives; I would just say place needs an update perhaps and it\u2019s very expensive but I guess that\u2019s the price for being #1.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The weather wasn't great so being able to sit in the room and watch all of the holiday festivities over at Bryant Park without getting wet or being in in the massive crowd was so wonderful. I kept telling myself not to check my phone but just enjoy the view for the few days we were there. I wish we could have stayed longer. The restaurant and bar were closed on Christmas day so we didn't get to try those. Staff most days were amazing and kind. We also loved the Hershey's kisses at reception. Also, there's a privacy button over the one light. We accidently hit it one morning and didn't notice, so we didn't get housekeeping that day.

I also stayed at many different hotels in NYC in the past, including multiple big name \"five-star\" hotels. If you are one of the lucky people reading this review, please do yourself a favor and just stay at the Bryant Park Hotel whenever you visit the City next time. This is absolutely the best hotel you are going to find in the City. The quality of service provided by the hotel staff members is unparalleled. Kieran always makes sure if I need anything before my arrival. At the reception desk, Shannen (who set the whole tone of this hotel for me when I first visited the hotel drenched in rain) always greets me and checks me in with her bright smile. Siobhan, Zaaul, Jo, Scott, Ronan, Veronica are always available to assist and help me have a super pleasant check-out experience as well. If you call the hotel, they actually pick up the phone and answer directly instead of rerouting your phone calls to an automated system. The doormen are polite and always willing to help guests with luggage. The location of the hotel is just perfect. You have everything you need within a walking distance including CVS, and the iconic Bryant Park is literally ten steps away from the hotel entrance. It is equidistant from all the major locations you can name in the City. The cleaning staff keeps rooms super clean, and I appreciate the fact that they always have clean slippers and an umbrella available in every room. The hotel may look a bit dated, but you get a much more spacious room than most 4-star and 5-star hotels offer in the City. I think the Bryant Park Hotel provides the true upscale NYC hotel experience defined by the high quality service and attentiveness. You'll see all these other NYC hotels boasting their brand new rooms and lounges, but it's always the service that makes or breaks your hotel stay experience. The fact that I am writing this review while I'm on vacation abroad shows how much I appreciate the BPH. Give this hotel a try for your next visit. You won't be disappointed.

Jo quickly checked me in to a superb room with a view over Bryant Park which was fantastic.  The hotel is impeccably clean and attention to detail is meticulous.  I met the hotel manager (Siobhan) who was ever so helpful and hospitable and clearly runs a top notch hotel with very happy staff.

In particular, the Bryant park view from the room is awesome and the combination of buildings and trees outside the window is one of the best views in manhattan. \n\nAlso, the niceness and friendliness of the hotel's staff is something I've never experienced at any other hotel. Veronica, Shannen, and Jo know what I need before I even ask, and their attitude and service is better than many 5 star hotels I've stayed in. \n\nIf this place had a resedential contract, I would be more than willing to sign with them instead of looking for another 1 bedroom apartment. \n\nI will be traveling for business at least twice a year and will always stay here.

John, Roy, and especially Scott really made our experience over-the-top good. \n\nThe location was fantastic for us since we were in town to see someone working in Times Square - we were close enough to walk over at any time but it was far enough out of the craziness to be comfortable. Having Bryant Park at our feet was also REALLY wonderful, because any time we had a spare hour or two and we didn't want to be cooped in a hotel room, we could just take an elevator down and be in a beautiful park with lots of seating and wonderful people watching, plus tons of activities in the summer like free concerts!\n\nOne of our party had a birthday on our first day, and we were brought a birthday balloon and wine, which was unexpected and wonderful! \nThere was a maintenance issue in our room, and after fixing it, we were left with a note and a little chocolate hammer for the inconvenience.

Well, it exceeded every great review I read. Let's start with the most important thing any establishment must have when one is traveling-the staff. Everyone I came in contact with starting with check in went out of their way to make my stay the best possible. John, Dwight, Veronica, Rey, Ronan-and the GM Siobhan-made me feel at home at all times. They all knew my name by the first night.\nThe hotel opened in 2000 and is in a historic 21 story skyscraper built in the 20's. The renovations done to convert it to a hotel are amazing. My room was much larger than what one expects in New York. It was spotless, well appointed and had everything I needed during my 7 night stay. The bathroom was stunning with beautiful marble surrounds and floor. It had a huge soaking tub with a separate glass and marble stall shower with a rain shower head and a second extendable shower head. Fresh towels were provided every day if desired and the bedding was also changed by request. I did it every other night as the hotel stresses being \"green\". Very comfortable high thread count sheets.\nThe GM, Siobhan, personally took me on a tour of some updates they're going to do to the rooms over the next yearor so. Wow. Making a good thing even better. The hotel is spotlessly clean. There are 2 restaurants and a bar on the first floor. I can't stress enough how clean this entire hotel was. Housekeeping and the custodial staff are sticklers for cleaning and disinfecting.\nNow about location. Bryant Park is literally across the street. It's a beatiful place with lots of fun activities during the day and at night. Kind of a mini Central Park. The area is perfect for taking walks around the City. I probably walked 10 miles a day. Great restaurants and shops are close by. Close to the Empire State Building, Macy's Herald Square, Rockefeller Center...I could go on. Just a perfect location for everything New York has to offer. Subway station on the same block connects to all the major lines.\nBut this is a review of the hotel and I will finish by saying that every time I visit New York, I will stay at The Bryant Park Hotel.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

I spend 30+ nights a year in Ritz Carlton hotels and I will say the staff at the Bryant Park strives for the same level of customer care.  We did not care for our first room but the staff was very accommodating and offered a reasonably priced upgrade fee to move into a larger room with wood flooring. \n\nWe upgraded our stay to a 1BR corner suite. The suite was filled with light and very clean. The overall decor and furnishings of the hotel are lacking but my understanding is that they have begun a complete refresh of the furnishings to be done later this year.\n\nLocation\n\nThe location is superb! Being right next to Bryant Park the hotel provides an oasis in a busy city. There are a number of nearby restaurants and we particularly like Peccora and The Bryant Park Grill. \n\nThe subway is also located just on the corner and there is an amply sized curb cut for transportation making it easy for Ubers or car services to wait and safe to get in and out of your vehicle.\n\nService\n\nThe staff was simply amazing! The front door was consistently held for our family and we were greeted by name and with a smile. Each day our house keeper Tadshi ensured we had fresh linens, a sparkling room and took extra care to change the bedding on our 1 year olds pack and play and ensure it was \"just right.\" \n\nThe entire team went out of their way to make our stay great. Ronan made my daughters smile each time they walked in, Veronica and Shannen were there for all of our needs but the star of the show was Jo who did not rest until we had all of our needs met.\n\nAt each turn the staff looked for ways to improve our stay.\n\nServices\n\nThe fitness center needs improvement and is awkwardly located across from a guest room making noise an issue. That said Bryant Park offers a wonderful setting for outdoor exercise and on the morning of our arrival had a group yoga event with hundreds of participants. \n\nThe morning coffee service was great and featured locally baked muffins and illy coffee. Throughout the day the team (I believe Keith or Kevin) updated the lobby table with fruit infused waters. \n\nWhen it rained the staff had umbrellas ready which was unexpected but welcome. \n\nThe bar located in the basement is very cool and has a bohemian vibe. The cocktails were well composed, utilized the finest spirits and fresh ingredients.\n\nWe did not eat at Koi but several friends, there for the wedding, did and had good things to say. \n\nOverall\n\nThe Bryant Park hotel is very fairly priced and provided calm on what could have been a stressful family weekend trip. I look forward to staying there again in the near future and experiencing the upgraded rooms. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They even sent some very thoughtful and sweet gifts for our boys, ages 12, 8, and 4. We've stayed at five star hotels before and never had this nice of a welcome. \n\nWe were in two rooms, both junior suites with park view. Room 608 is one of the largest we've ever been in the city. We used to live in Brooklyn and I am pretty sure this room is bigger than most people's apartments. Room 607 was also large but didn't have the dining table that 608 had. \n\nLocation is excellent, especially since it's right across from the park where our boys enjoyed the carousel. We watched a show and it's a very easy and short walking distance from the hotel. \n\nSteven at reservations was very helpful and we appreciate his responsiveness when we ran into an issue regarding booking transportation from\/to the airport. The lady at the front desk as well as the bellman were also super helpful and got us minivan cabs when we needed them (Uber was giving us issues with our party of 5). \n\nWe can't wait to go back the next time we're in the city. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This was my first stay at BPH and because of a flight delay, I ended up staying just one night instead of my intended two nights. I was in a flurry when I arrived, with less than an hour to unpack and head to a meeting. The team welcomed me warmly and swiftly. Everyone was absolutely terrific. Because of my hotels.com status, they even brought me a complimentary bottle of prosecco! My room was large, clean, and filled with light and all the amenities needed.\n\nThe true reason I will always come back is because I fell ill right around check-out time yesterday. I was sitting in the lobby and Jo K. from the front desk noticed that I looked off and came over immediately with a bottle of water. She offered to help get me something to eat, but I wanted to try and walk down the block to get food. I only made it a few steps outside before I knew I couldn't make it any further and had to come back to the hotel, even though I had already checked out. Jo set me up in a quiet, air-conditioned space, made sure I had water and an internet connection for my laptop, and let me know that she would be there for anything I needed! What incredible care and hospitality.\n\nI experienced a long day of food poisoning, but I was absolutely taken care of as if I was family at the Bryant Park Hotel, and not for one minute was Jo or anyone else upset about the true chaos I, unfortunately, caused in this wonderful hotel.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

One place I had longed to try, due to its handy location and the recommendation of a good friend, was the Bryant Park Hotel. That became a reality on my recent visit, and now  I have to rethink my travel philosophy because after spending five days there, I just may have found my home away from home. \n\nThis is the perfect location for a theatre lover: it is within easy walking distance to Broadway, and yet there's not a whiff of the craziness of Times Square here. That's because the hotel faces Bryant Park, the best oasis in New York City outside of that bigger spot of green a little further uptown. Most mornings, I would grab a coffee and something to eat from one of the myriad of choices ringing the park (Ole and Steen, Le Pain Quotidien, Starbucks, Whole Foods, the list goes on) and grab a table in the park to eat, read, and people watch. There are also places where you can sit and have a lovely breakfast. (I highly recommend La Pecora Bianca, only a few doors down toward 5th Avenue.)\n\nWhen I booked, I splurged on a park view room, and then I was given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite. The room was enormous, sleek and clean. The park bustles in the daytime: during my stay, there was a film, a theatrical presentation, and a gigantic yoga class. But the park closes at night, and W. 40th Street is quiet for a midtown NYC street. I'm not a good sleeper, but I slept beautifully on that comfortable bed. My bathroom, too, was huge and included a separate tub and shower. Best of all, when I opened my shades, I was met with a wonderful contrast of the buildings of Gotham and the greenery of the park. \n\nEvery member of the staff that I met, from front desk to housekeeping, was warm and friendly. I wish I knew the name of the gentleman who checked me in, but I want to especially mention Veronica and Jo. Jo knocked on my door the first day to present me with a gift of candy (I think they give something to every guest on their first day), and then she and Veronica checked me out and fetched me a cab to the airport. I know the running of a metropolitan hotel is never-ending work, but both these women took the time to chat and make sure I had had a good stay. \n\nMy deepest thanks to everyone at the Bryant Park Hotel for making my stay so comfortable, restful and friendly. I can't wait to come back!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

It was my Granddaughter's Birthday, and she was presented with balloons, along with a couple special gifts from Jo and the staff. We were then escorted by Jo to our beautiful upgraded Jr Suite. Our room overlooked Bryant Park, which is my most favorite park ever. Bed was so comfy, large bathroom with a tub and shower and the room could not of been cleaner. Heater and hot water work great, no issues at all.\nWe decided to have breakfast at KOI restaurant downstairs, which is a sushi place for lunch and dinner, but serves an amazing American breakfast. Marcos, our server both mornings, was wonderful and the service couldn't of been better. He even taught my Granddaughter how to fold the fancy napkins. He was absolutely fabulous. One morning we had breakfast a few doors down at Le Pain Quotidien. Food was ok, but the coffee was amazing.\nWe were greeted every day by Rowan, the doorman. He also referred to us by name and my Granddaughter just loved him. He was always interested in what we did that day and what our plans were for the next.\nHotel is walking to distance to just about everything. We did take a taxi to Battery Park which was sooooo expensive, but because I was with my 10 year old Granddaughter, I didn't want to take the subway.\nWhole Foods across the street was super convenient to pick up fruit and snacks for our hotel room.\nIt's simply amazing how a wonderful Hotel staff can make or break a trip. This was a special get a way for us, and the way we were treated by Steven, Rowan, Marcos and especially Jo, we will never, ever forget it.\nBryant Park Hotel, I will be back.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

My spirits lift every time I walk in the front entrance.\nI've stayed here solo and with my family several times since 2012. I stayed for an extended period in Dec 2022 and didn't get around to writing my review before I returned for a short visit solo in March 2023. In December, it was magical looking out onto the winter wonderland in Bryant Park and was lovely being toasty and warm in my bright and cheery suite when it was icy and miserable out. My trip ended abruptly in December and I had to rush back on account of a family tragedy. Given that I was in a hotel when the news came, there was no other place I would have chosen to be. Scott at the front desk was so kind and understanding, adjusting the dates of my stay and letting me check out very late the day of my departure. \nI was delighted to return in March 2023. Since I was solo, I opted for a basic room. Jo checked me in and was warm and welcoming. When I asked, she said the room I had been assigned did not have a view. So I expected what I have experienced in other New York City hotels in rooms without views ie, you look out onto the wall of the next building which seems close enough to touch. In one upmarket hotel, my only view of the sky was the reflection in the window of the building I faced. So I was pleasantly surprised by how bright and cheery my BPH room without a view was. As I said to Jo later, a BPH room without a view equals a room with a view in most hotels. The next building was a distance away and I had a nice view of Bryant Park from the side. \nThe BPH bathrooms are spectacular by NYC standards\u2014spacious and well maintained. \nIt's just lovely being on Bryant Park in all seasons. And there are restaurants, cafes, bars (the bar in BPH\u2014Celon\u2014is delightful), a Whole Foods, the beautiful and imposing New York Public Library, a bookstore and more at the BPH's doorstep. And, while not located in the madness of Times Square, the hotel is very conveniently located for theater going. \nI truly feel like I'm back amongst friends whenever I return to the BPH, which is my comfort zone. Thank you to all the staff and a special shoutout to Scott, Jo, John at the front desk, Ray at the front door, Tenzin, and Lundup in housekeeping for yet another fantastic stay. I can't wait to be back. ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

I consider The American Radiator Building to be about the most beautiful skyscraper in Manhattan and it's been a complete dream of mine to stay there! At first we had an 11th floor, Bryant Park view, corner room which we loved. Unfortunately, there was loud construction mandated by NYC happening right outside of our room. We were then offered a generous compensation package. I feared that we would just get an apology, but rather than feeling screwed over that my fantasy hotel had let me down, I truly got the sense that I had rightly placed my trust in the management and stewards of this iconic architectural masterpiece. I felt like an honored and important guest at a first class establishment! We loved our upgraded room even more! Of particular help was JO! She was so kind, gracious, and helpful and really seemed to understand how important it was to me that the Bryant Park Hotel live up to what I was expecting. I was initially upset with the disturbance, but JO \"held my hand\", made everything better, and I fell even further in love with the hotel.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The restaurant Koi serves wonderful Japanese and Japanese-fusion food as well as delectable cocktails. \nThe hotel is a short walk from restaurants, cafes, shops, Times Square, Grand Central Station, Broadway, Rockefeller Center.\nJust writing about the Bryant Park Hotel makes me wish I was back there. I hope I can visit again soon. Rates are reasonable given the location, space, and service. \nThank you to Scott and the team for yet another brilliant stay!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Our room was quiet at all hours and unusually large for Manhattan, with a king bed, loveseat and table and a full bath with separate tub and shower.  Everything was clean, comfortable, and well-appointed, and the staff were warm and helpful.  It's right across the street from Bryant Park, a lovely green space with tables and chairs,  surrounded by cafes, perfect for strolling and picnicking.  They also offered a very good deal on overnight parking at a nearby garage.  We would most definitely stay here again!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Y as\u00ed ha sido aqu\u00ed.\nLa ubicaci\u00f3n es inmejorable, cerca de Times Square, Empire State, Rockefeller center, Quinta Avenida, ... con paradas de metro justo al lado, y el por supuesto parque que te ofrece desconexi\u00f3n, tranquilidad y entretenimiento a todas horas y que se convierte en la perfecta bienvenida antes de entrar al hotel.\nEl edificio donde se encuentra el hotel tiene mucha personalidad e historia, que tambi\u00e9n es un punto interesante.\nEl personal es inmejorable: atentos, resolutivos, educados y emp\u00e1ticos. Especialmente Zaaul, Rey y por supuesto John, quien nos facilit\u00f3 mucho la estancia.\nY en lo importante, las habitaciones son c\u00f3modas, con ventanas al exterior, luminosas, bien aclimatadas, con muchas facilidades (secador, plancha, paraguas, caja fuerte,...) . El ba\u00f1o muy amplio y c\u00f3modo, la ducha maravillosa, y los productos de ba\u00f1o buen\u00edsimos. La limpieza es impecable. El peque\u00f1o desayuno (muffins y caf\u00e9) que ofrecen en la entrada es un buen detalle para empezar el d\u00eda, al igual que el agua fr\u00eda que tienen siempre durante el resto del d\u00eda.\nEl \u00fanico fallo es la insonorizaci\u00f3n del dormitorio. La primera noche pensamos que era por la actividad del parque (que tambi\u00e9n es un factor los d\u00edas de conciertos), pero la ubicaci\u00f3n la pagas en este aspecto: tr\u00e1fico, obras y dem\u00e1s ruidos que para m\u00ed y mi marido, supuso imposible dormir sin tapones para los o\u00eddos. Teniendo en cuenta el precio, tambi\u00e9n esperaba una cama m\u00e1s grande (era de 150cm).\nPor todo lo dem\u00e1s, perfecto. Repetir\u00eda sin dudar.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The soaps & shampoos provided were good quality.  The location of the hotel is fabulous \u2014 right across from Bryant Park, which has lovely cafes and fun things to do, and the NYC Central Library.  Transportation options (buses\/subway)around the hotel are plentiful, making it easy to get anywhere.  The hotel does have a fun cocktail lounge and Asian-themed restaurant attached.  One small downside, is that the hotel does not have a breakfast cafe, but they do offer complimentary coffee and muffins in the morning. (They also have iced water available in the entry hallway the rest of the day.).  But there are ample breakfast options around the hotel.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

El Bryant park es hermoso para desayunar, almorzar, estar al aire libre. Siempre hay o Jazz, o clase de yoga, un \u00e1rea de lectura con libros, o alg\u00fan evento. Es un oasis en medio de midtown, que a veces es demasiado abrumadora por la cantidad de gente, pero est\u00e1 cerca de todo. Nos hicieron un upgrade y nos alojaron en una suite ESPECTACULAR en el piso 21 con living, kichinette con anafe y heladera, ba\u00f1o y adem\u00e1s un toilette. El ba\u00f1o era gigante, con ba\u00f1era y ducha, pantuflas, secador de cabello, batas y todo lo necesario. Muy luminoso todo. Las vistas INCREIBLES. La atenci\u00f3n del personal siempre fue muy cordial y atenta. Hicieron la limpieza todos los d\u00edas. Est\u00e1 rodeado de muy buenos lugares para desayunar o almorzar. Hay varias opciones muy cerca. Mucha gente compra algo y se sienta en mesas y sillas del parque.\nLo que menos nos gust\u00f3 tanto:\nEl hotel no tiene Lobby no hay sillones ni lugar de estar, solo un mostrador. Cuando entramos nos pareci\u00f3 muy decadente, antiguo, el ascensor peque\u00f1o con luces rojas.... pero despu\u00e9s nos acostumbramos y la habitaci\u00f3n y la ubicaci\u00f3n nos hicieron adorar el hotel. En la habitaci\u00f3n no hab\u00eda cafetera ni calentador de agua, que me parece fundamental. El restaurante era demasiado formal para el desayuno y el ingreso era mas bien cerrado. Todas las ma\u00f1anas pon\u00edan una mesita al lado de los ascensores, es una especie de pasillo, con termo de caf\u00e9 americano y muffins (a veces no hab\u00eda) de 7 a 10hs con leche, az\u00facar, vasos descartables como para llevar a la habitaci\u00f3n o al parque. Aunque est\u00e1bamos en un piso 21, se o\u00edan los ruidos de las sirenas o algo extremo. Hab\u00eda tapones para los o\u00eddos en el ba\u00f1o.... no eran necesarios. Estuvimos muy tranquilos.

We opted to stay at another NYC hotel for our actual wedding night, but then transferred to the Bryant Park Hotel for the remainder of our stay (5 nights total). The location is nice and the view we had of Bryant Park was excellent, but beyond that, there was nothing special about this place that would make me come back again...especially considering the price.\n\nOver the five nights we stayed, we had two interactions with staff, neither of which went well. After first checking in and getting into our room, we called the front desk for some extra hangers. We were told that they would be sent right up...five days later, still no hangers. When we were checking out, we left our bags as we had a later flight. We also pre-arranged a car service to take us to the airport at a specific time. When we returned to the hotel at the alotted time, there was no ride. We waited almost half an hour, while being told numerous times that it was running late and it was almost here and that traffic was bad. Well, it was quite evident that they had forgotten to make the arrangements because after waiting all the time, we were told our cab had arrived? No idea what happened to the SUV we had arranged. Why would it take half an hour for a cab to arrive, I could've walked outside and simply flagged on down (which is obviously what they did).\n\nThe lobby was not very inviting. They have a front desk\/reception area to the left when you walk in the main doors; however, there is also a secondary 'security' desk as soon as you walk in, which is the only desk that seems to be used (the other reception area never seemed to be used). They boast about having 24 hour security, well the one night we walked in, the person sitting at the desk was full out asleep in the chair (it was about 1am) and we simply walked by him to the elevators.\n\nAll in all, won't be returning to this hotel. Rooms were very modern and spacious, but not worth the price they charge. They also boast about having muffins and coffee available in the lobby...which they did, but neither of which looked very inviting (small table with a handful of muffins and a coffee dispenser.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We booked a Junior Suite and had amazing views from the 19th floor.  The room was very large by Manhattan standards with a king sized bed, terrace and a large bathroom with separate bathtub and shower.  The location is great -- walking distance from Broadway, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center and other midtown attractions, but not too close to Times Square, which we wanted to avoid.  It's particularly good to visit when the Bryant Park Winter Village is open.  \n\nWe found the bed to be comfortable, however even on the 19th floor, there was a significant amount of outside noise until around midnight.  There's also a lot of light from surrounding office buildings, so don't expect it to be too dark and quiet at night. It wasn't an issue for us (and they also provide a white noise machine), but keep that in mind if you're not a good sleeper.\n\nI've seen several reviews mention the small dark elevators and while they're not huge, they really didn't make me anxious (and I don't love elevators).  The onsite Japanese restaurant, Koi, is very good, but expensive.  If you're looking for a more bargain priced meal, especially for breakfast or lunch, you should check out the Red Flame Diner on 44th street between 5th and 6th Ave.\n\nThere aren't a lot of amenities, but you don't come to Manhattan to stay in your hotel and the room was fairly priced considering the size and location.

We wandered up to Rockefeller Plaza by foot, hopped on the train to visit Chelsea and Brooklyn, hopped on the bus to visit the Met.\n\nThe showers are excellent.  The room itself was good, felt a little dated, but clean and comfortable.  There was a lot of thumping bass noise from something going on in the park each night, and a lot of noise in general coming up from the street and the park through much of the night (they may have been doing some sort of filming or setup for the weekend concerts in the park, adding to the noise).  The windows apparently don't keep out much of the noise, so we were kept awake by it more than expected.  (I think the hotel tried to address it by having a white noise generator available in our room, but I'd rather they upgraded the windows.)  The window blinds were also in poor shape and so we got a lot of light leaking in throughout the night.  The noise and the light made for poor sleep, unfortunately.  Our bed was surprisingly firm but we didn't have any problems with soreness from the firmness.  Each side of the bed (in the junior suite) had 2 pillows that felt like different levels of softness, which worked well for us.\n\nThe front desk staff was very kind and accommodating.\n\nTraveling during COVID sucks, even as the city is starting to repoen.

Used to reserve via Tablet and get fabulous upgrades, but hotel doesn't belong to Tablet any longer so paid full-fare for the Jr. Suite we usually end up in.  Check-in was remarkably unremarkable...not particularly warm or welcoming front desk; very perfunctory and didn't improve when we came and went. No one opening the hotel door, so felt rather impersonal. Thankfully, Jr. Suite was on a high floor, with the usual wonderful high ceilings, and views. That's the positive. Not the hotel's fault, but VERY LOUD booming music echoed off the buildings around the park and killed any sort of romantic atmosphere until it finally ended around midnight (we heard sirens blipping around then which ended the party). In other words, if it is a lovely Fall\/Spring\/Summer night, be prepared that the street noise may be VERY audible even on a high floor. Furnishings seem a bit dated now...the leather accent pillows, for example were probably hip when they first appeared but now just seem kind of strange and certainly not something you would leave on the bed to lean against and relax. The mattress seemed to sag and pillows were flat and rather than sinking into them, were the opposite of comfortable.

Service is excellent, staff is great, room was nice, the shower exemplary.  Location had its pluses and minuses.  Geographically, it offers great access to midtown, Chelsea, and Central Park south-all easily walkable.  However, its location above a busy 6th Avenue also has its downside, specifically with the noise.  If you are a light sleeper, simply do not stay at this hotel, especially if you have window view overlooking Bryant Park.  There seems to be a continuous cacophony of sound and this is why I ultimately chose the 3 over 4 rating as this is an important issue to me.  To their credit, they did have sound machines, but it wasn\u2019t enough to drown out the noise.  If you can sleep through anything, I\u2019d recommend this hotel.  Also, it\u2019s possible that the rooms away from Bryant Park are better for light sleepers.  A couple of other nits: had a great view of the park that was simply ruined by how dirty the windows were.  Also, a small nit, there is no fan in the bathroom.

I'll start with the positives: excellent location, friendly staff, comfortable beds. Now the negatives. Apparently the owners were having a huge family reunion so I was told that all of the room types like mine overlooking the park were completely booked. Disappointing but not a big deal as I was only staying for one night. However, the cleanliness\/state of the room I was given was unacceptable (and I was told that no other rooms were available.) I was laying in bed looking up at what I thought was a textured wall only to discover that it wasn't textured but completely covered with dust (see photos!) The floor was cracked and scratched, the sink was cracked, the faucets were gross, the light switch was broken, the robes were stiff and uncomfortable....the pictures really speak for themselves. The layout of my room was strange, with the small television really far from the bed in a corner which was hard was hard to view? Also, something else that other reviewers brought up about the front doors of the hotel. The doors are extremely heavy and about half the time there was no one there to help including when I was coming in\/leaving with luggage.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-12-09","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"Have stayed here a few times now and I\u2019ve got to say it\u2019s a quirky place. \n\nIt\u2019s got this mishmash of unexpectedly brilliant, with weirdly disappointing. \n\nI\u2019ll give you an example. The restaurant downstairs is Koi. A well known and well like Japanese place for the midtown crowd who aren\u2019t worried about budget. It\u2019s pretty pricey - but the food is good and service sharp. \n\nBut early mornings - the same place is the \u2018diner\u2019 for the Bryant Park Hotel. And when I say \u2018diner\u2019 I mean it. Short order stuff at not great quality. Cold pastries and reasonable coffee. Given that there are a plethora of fancy French patisseries to the left and right of the Bryant Park Hotel, it\u2019s mind boggling that they can\u2019t do a Danish pastry with their continental breakfast. It\u2019s even more mind boggling that guests don\u2019t simply skip next door for better quality food at cheaper prices. Even weirder A SM despite what is says on the room service menu - there is no chef working between breakfast and supper. So only late night stuff is available during the day (club sandwiches etc). \n\nBut that said - they have the most excellent sashimi and sushi on room service (after 6pm only I think) which I suspect is smuggled out from Koi. Recommend the cucumber salad and hamachi sashimi as absolutely top notch. \n\nMini bar is adequate. No surprises. Everything you\u2019d expect. Fridge big enough to fit a six pack from whole foods across the road too. \n\nSee what I mean? Unexpected glimmers of brilliance next to unnecessary moments of disappointment. \n\nThe rooms are the same. Truly fabulous space, airy, well lit, wooden floors with dual and triple aspect suites. Beautiful marble bathrooms with glorious soaking tubs. Bose stereos - the list goes on - but try and get the TV to work. The signal comes in and out on terrestrial channels and the whole google cast thing just doesn\u2019t seem to be connected at all. The telephones occasionally work, but the actual service iand staff are impeccable. \n\nSo IMHO, it\u2019s one of those places that works best if you are simply looking for a spacious, reasonably priced midtown suite. And you\u2019ve got a bit of time to work around the weak points. Get your food from wholefoods across the way (or the chipotle I discovered right next door). Breakfast in one of the excellent French cafes. If you\u2019re going to spend any time in the hotel, be prepared to endlessly get your key recut (they seem to lose their authority at the merest whiff of an electronic device even near them - positively Luddite in their working proclivities!), and be prepared for things not to work occasionally. But then again - if you want The Four Seasons - you pay for the Four Season. And I\u2019d say the hamachi and cucumber salad here is actually better than any room service the Four Season have ever given me. \n\nThe bar downstairs is weirdly eclectic. Hip hop and OG stuff one night - then Moroccan style singing and 50 year old business men looking for naive company the next and fashion week launches the next. Bar staff all super cool and friendly though. \n\nThe gym is much larger than most and has everything you could need from cardio to free weights to weight machines. \n\nSo the whole thing is a bit of an adventure. And NYC is all about the adventure right? Given the alternatives for the price within a 10 block radius - this is the best place I\u2019ve found. \n\nRecommended.

Bus and subway (metro) links across the city are excellent.  There are lots of cafes nearby, but surprisingly few decent restaurants in the neighbourhood (although a short bus ride takes you to any of the city\u2019s many eateries).\nThe only minor drawback is that, if you are travelling as a family, there is no real lounge area in the hotel - there is a cocktail bar but those under 21 are not admitted, and there is also a sophisticated and pricey Japanese restaurant.\nThis minor quibble apart, it\u2019s a truly excellent hotel.

He took us into Yasmin at the front desk, who cheerfully introduced herself, welcomed us back, gave us bottles of water and told us about the changes at the Hotel since our last stay two years ago, which included a new morning coffee and muffin service and a complete overhaul of their bar venue.  The customer service is top notch and we always feel like the most important guest in the Hotel when we stay there.  Yasmin provided us with a complementary upgrade as well.\n\nJavier helped get our bags up to the room, again told us about the morning coffee service and made sure we were comfortably settled in our room before he left.  The room was huge and overlooked Bryant Park. The bathroom had a soaking tub and a separate glass enclosed shower, premium toiletries, fluffy towels and robes -- a spa like experience in our room. In the morning we took advantage of the coffee and muffins to jumpstart our day before heading to Maison Keyser for pastries and Blue bottle for coffee -- both just steps from the hotel, that we then enjoyed in Bryant Park.

They got us in early which we were thankful for after traveling by car, plane and train. There is construction taking place with scaffolding but luckily it didn\u2019t obstruct our views. \n\nFriday nights the club in the basement seems to attract a lot of young kids who wait in line outside to enter. Kind of annoying to have to deal with in all honesty. It\u2019s nice that you need to show keycard to get access to the elevators. \n\nWe left early Saturday morning and arrived back after noon to find the room had not been made up yet. Called to housekeeping and was assured it would be handled soon. We left again and returned around 5, still not made up. We had to call to get fresh towels so we could get cleaned up for the evening. They sent towels and apologized but I have to admit, I was really really disappointed. We had used towels, dishes, garbage in a great room and for the cost I paid, it really tainted my view. \n\nOn our way out to dinner Saturday night I stopped by the desk and requested a late check out to make up for the inconvenience. I wasn\u2019t trying to be a jerk, but I felt like the management could have offered something to make up for the miscue. We got an extra hour before we had to leave on Sunday. It was a hollow victory but I guess it was something! \n\nThe location and the view were what made the stay. The fact we had hard wood floors instead of carpeting and a walk in shower was what convinced me to upgrade to the pricier junior suite.

Bed was super-comfortable (very firm mattress) and room was clean and decently sized by NYC standards. Bathroom is enormous and the tub is big enough to fit two people. Separate tub and shower! They provide robes and slippers. Front desk staff are very accommodating also. My only complaints about this hotel are that they have no coffee machine in the room (though there is free coffee in the downstairs elevator hallway between 6-8 AM), the elevators have a weird red light and make you feel like you are going to a disco, and there is no lobby to speak of. So, for instance, if you want to check out of your room and then hang out in the lobby for an hour before catching your train, or meet up with friends...this is not the hotel for that, though there is a lounge\/restaurant that is open sometimes. But Bryant Park is just across the street and it's lovely, and in good weather you can certainly sit there.

Just stunning! You will struggle to find a great hotel with such a view in New York. The bedroom was minimalist which I do like. It was very light due to the big windows and this pleased us. We had a flat screen TV and everything needed for our stay. The room is small but big enough for our needs and it\u2019s presentation was top. The bed is very comfortable. It can be a bit noisy at night but if you have been out in the City all day you won\u2019t need the ear plugs that the hotel provides free. I slept fantastically.\n\nThe bathroom had both a shower and a bath. I do prefer the shower to be separate so another tic there. \nGreat Molton Brown goodies for those who wished to pamper themselves and the bathroom appealed to the eye. \n\nThe mini bar had everything you could wish for. \n\nI loved the red light of both the lift and the entrance. Gave a \u2018mood\u2019 to the lobby, making it more exotic rather than plain like others.\n\nThe check- in staff were excellent as were the lovely men who wished me good day as I left the hotel. Top marks to one and all! The cleaners too, with a personal touch calling card, they kept our room spotless. \n\nLocation. What can I say? This hotel has the best location in New York. Bryant Park across the road with its restaurant and evening activities. A few minutes to Times Square, 5th Avenue right on our doorstep, a short walk to Macy\u2019s and the subways nearby took you to wherever you wanted to go.\n\nI never got a chance to try the sumptuous looking cocktail bar or the koi restaurant as I walked so much I\u2019d get back to the hotel exhausted and be asleep by 10! Next time though!\n\nI can\u2019t recommend this hotel enough. Do upgrade to a room with a park view. It\u2019s stunning and well worth it.

From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Job on reception who helped us with our check in and informed us of our complimentary upgrade, to the moment we checked out and were helped by Jonathan who called us a taxi, waited with us and helped us with our bags into the taxi, we were made to feel very welcome by every member of staff we met. As soon as we walked through the front doors we were greeted every time and a lift called for us (which came pretty instantly) we stayed on the 12th Floor and had amazing views of the park, library and 6th Avenue. Yes the hotel is a little on the pricy side but the location and the service is worth it. Situated on 40th Street we were a 5 minute walk away from Times Square, there was a subway entrance just at the end of the street, and perfect location to go in any direction to all the districts of Manhattan. \nRoom was bright, airy, clean and modern. Bathroom was huge! Having read other hotel reviews online we were expecting the room to be small and cramped but this was far from it. \nAs you would expect in all areas if NY, traffic runs late into the night and starts early morning so you have to expect you will hear some ground noise but you soon get used to it. However, the walls between rooms in the hotel are paper thin and you do hear a lot of the other rooms doors banging and expect to hear every word of the conversation taking place in the room next door! Luckily for most of our stay we had quiet and respectful neighbours apart from one night \u2013 we came back to the hotel around 1am and found a queue all the way down the street leading to our hotel! There is a bar and club (Ceylon Bar) in the lower level of the hotel. We were ushered through the queue by hotel staff (as we were staying guests) which made many people in the queue looking at us like we were VIPs! Whilst we didn\u2019t hear any noise at all from the bar and club, for that night our \u2018neighbours\u2019 (I believe of only that night) had been to the club and at around 3am came back to their room stopping by other rooms on the way knocking on the doors pretending to be \u201cNYPD\u201d \u2013 however the noise soon subsided with some of partygoers deciding to leave the room to go back down to the party. We didn\u2019t hear them again. The hotel and surrounding pavements the next morning were spotless \u2013 not something you always expect once a club \/ bar has been evidently very busy! \nUpon checkout we asked to leave our bags at reception (as our flights weren\u2019t until much later in the day) Our bags were safely \u2018checked in\u2019 and given a security tag and stored away from us until we returned. \nOverall, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend this hotel and will absolutely stay here again when we return.

The price point is a nice return on luxury and comfort.\n\nWe were upgraded to the Bryant Park Suite with a view of Bryant Park and NY Public Library which was a treat.  The Suite includes a dining area, a living\/sitting area, a large closet, a bedroom with bathroom. \n\nThe bed was super comfortable, toiletries were the luxurious Molton Brown, pretty black bathrobes\/slippers, and separate shower\/tub. It was bliss to soak in the tub after a day at the museum. The design is modern very NY chic, but a warning the elevators are a little bit dark.   The hotel is perfect for grown-up crowd and couples, versus the younger party set.\n\nThere are various coffee\/restaurants\/bars in the vicinity so we did not check out either of their inhouse options.  There are multiple subway lines within 5-8 minute walk. \n\nOur room faced 40th street, so we did hear brief noise past midnight, but they do place a noise cancelling machine in your room.  It was not terrible and I quickly dozed off. \n\nThe staff was gracious and very friendly while assisting us. My husband ordered flowers and they placed them in the room as a surprise.  This is our second stay and given the size of the hotel, I always feel they're always adequately staffed - doormen to help with taxis, bellhop to help store bags, concierge and front desk reception.  It's nice to feel catered and supported. \n\nThe Bryant Park continues to be as charming and perfect as the first time we visited.

First of all the front desk and bell staff at this hotel are super welcoming, friendly and helpful.  They handed us a bottle of water on arrival (and departure) and were extremely pleasant to deal with (not the norm in NYC especially.)  They upgraded us to the most amazing suite that had a full dining table which was awesome as we had to spend our mornings working.  We were worried about being in a room so small that only one of us would have a desk (my husband and I work together).  The only downside is that we faced Bryant Park and there seems to be work going on all the time -- drilling, scaffolding going up or down -- at all hours of the night and day.  They do give you ear plugs so we just wore those at night and it was less an issue.  Pretty near to perfect stay -- great location but really the staff made our stay so enjoyable.

Each time I\u2019ve been with my pre-teen daughter. We had previously stayed in a junior suite but this time I decided to spend a bit more and got a Bryant Park Suite. I have to say, having two rooms was nice just to give each of us a bit of space when we were relaxing in-between excursions. The suite was very spacious, and included a dining table we used quite a bit. \nThe beds in the hotel are way more comfortable than they look, as are the chairs and couches. The bathrooms are great and the products provided are top notch. We ordered room service one night when we got back from a play and even though it was close to when room service ends (11 pm, which is a bit early) the cooked food was freshly prepared and hot and the sushi was delicious. The tv does not have a ton of channels but, when the WiFi was working (it is indeed spotty at times), the ability to steam content from apps like Netflix on our iPad was great. \nThis was the lowest floor we had stayed on (8) and the noise level outside was distinctively higher than on the upper floors, especially given the work being done on the street.

It was all in all, a very convenient location. \n\nPerks:  The hotel provided free \"to go\" (or to bring to your room while you get ready) coffee and muffins in the (small) lobby from 6-8 a.m. and that was a nice surprise.  I didn't eat the muffins, but the other guests did seem to want many of them.  The coffee was strong and there was real cream provided.  \n\nAlso, the elevators are dark with red overhead lights and the walls were covered in red leather with some thumping electronica playing.  It was strange and intriguing.  It made me feel like i was somewhere cool - even when I was heading out with a toddler.\n\nUpgrades and Special Things: I had booked a suite for the week and weekend since my husband and son would be joining at the end of the week even though the primary purpose of my trip was for work.   When i mentioned this to Ashley at the front desk, she upgraded my room to ensure that I had a daybed in the suite area that my son could use.  \n\nWhen I was unable to access the hotel room wifi (which unfortunately happens quite often due to my employer's security settings on my laptop), the front desk sent up the tech guy and he was able to allow me to use another network at the hotel, which worked perfectly.  I have had this issue at many other hotels and no one has been able to fix this issue except for the BPH.    \n\nI will definitely stay here again!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The reason I don\u2019t remember why is that the guy who called me, Darren Sumner, was so professional, pleasant and attentive that he turned a potentially disappointing situation into a positive interaction. In most situations like this my nature would be to get irritated, cancel my reservation and stay somewhere else. Within about 45 seconds on the phone with Mr. Sumner I was recommitted to staying at the Bryant Park.\n\nMr. Sumner said that he would accommodate us with an early check in if our room wasn't booked the night before.  I made myself a note to check with the hotel the day before our arrival to see if we would be abvle to check in early.. Before I had a chance to call, Mr. Sumner sent me an email, confirming our early arrival and asking if there was anything he could do for us before we got there.\n\nThat was only the beginning our our experience in your hotel.  I wish I had made a note of everyone\u2019s name, because ever BPH employee with whom we interacted was the perfect combination of engaging, personal and professional. The last person we saw, Matt, was a doorman, I believe. As he loaded our luggage, I told him, \u201cI have stayed in nicer hotels in NY, but I have never stayed in one with nicer people.\u201d\n\nHere is some additional information:\nThe hotel is adjacent to Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. I would request a room overlooking 40th Street. Those overlook the park.We initially booked one of their four suites with balconies overlooking the park, but those were the rooms \"taken out of commission\" before our arrival because of construction on that side of the building.\n\nWe had a suite, so I can't comment on the size of their standard rooms.  I'm guessing that they are like most NY hotel rooms: small. Our ceilings were surprisingly tall, however - a rarity in any hotel. (Again, maybe this was because it was a suite.)\n\nHousekeeping doesn't decide when to clean your room.  There is a note in the room that instructs you to call the front desk when you are ready for your room to be cleaned.  Nice touch.\n\nThe hallways on the floors are narrow and somewhat dimly lit. No big deal.  The elevators are tiny. \n\nThe place was clean.\n\nBut the reason I will be staying there again is because of the service and people.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Because of the hotel's central location on West 40th Street, just south of Bryant Park, we found it easy to set out in every direction, seeing plays, eating at fine restaurants, and visiting the Whitney Museum to see the Andy Warhol exhibit. Also, since the Bryant is situated just behind the New York Public Library, we toured that historic edifice, which she had never visited. We planned to see the Lion King and My Fair Lady, to eat at Patsy's and Gallagher's, and walk to other shopping areas and restaurants. We did them all. \nThe staff at the Bryant is courteous and the rooms are spacious and reasonably priced. There was a workout facility on our floor and we used it every day.

It is a very beautiful Art Deco building and is one of my favorite structures in NYC. We had a 3 night stay here and we were very pleased with the hotel. The classic feel is definitely there but they were able to add modern touches in the minimalist design of the rooms. The only thing we did not like is the color of the carpet as it made the room looked dark. We booked a king room in the inner side of the hotel. No view; however, even though we had the smallest room it is still very spacious for NYC standards. The bathroom is also a good size with a large tub. We were surprised that there is a turn down service at night. Our room was serviced promptly each day and staff is wonderful. Location can\u2019t be beat and the subway is just a few steps away. \n\nWe enjoyed the experience.

The rates for the Bryant Park were only slightly more than some value chains nearby so I decided to spend a little extra. It was well worth the extra money.\n\nThe check in was quick and easy, I was offered a bottle of water and was quickly sent on my way up to my room.  All weekend long, all of the staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to see if I needed anything.  \n\nLocation was fantastic, easy walk (4 blocks) from Grand Central.  You have good access to multiple subway lines on both the east and west sides of Manhattan.  You are also directly on Bryant Park which makes for rare sense of neighborhood within the city.  Really good variety of coffee\/food options within a short walk in any direction.  \n\nThe room was plenty big with a queen-size bed and two small couches (more decorative than practical.)  I am someone who like a very firm pillow and is constantly disappointed at hotel pillows, not at Bryant Park, the pillows were fantastic.  There were outlets available next to the bed, which is not the case at some hotels.   \n\nThe bathroom was large with a glassed-in shower.  In my experience, those shower doors tend to leak all over the floor, but not this time. The water pressure in the shower was the best I've ever experienced, no exaggeration.  \n\nLastly, I've stayed at several hotels in NYC where the elevators are slow or work poorly.  The elevators here were fast and efficient.  In regards to noise, I stayed over St. Patrick's Day weekend and never heard a thing.  \n\nDepending on your budget, the Bryant Park Hotel offers great value and the opportunity to experience a luxury hotel-lite experience at less than luxury prices.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I was concerned the hotel was too trendy for us. We are rather sedate and the idea of a nightclub put me off a bit. But the location was excellent and the price was right - well, it was where are friends were so that is where we were going to be too. When we arrived it was a later on a Friday night, there was a line at the door to get into the restaurant. Everyone was quite young and hip.  I felt a little out of place but the check-in went very smoothly. I really appreciated the bottles of water after traveling. The very dark elevators with red lights threw me again but I was happy I kept an open mind. We had a queen deluxe room. It was surprisingly quiet, bright and clean. It was a good size room by Manhattan standards. There was a large tub with a separate shower. Nice Milton Brown amenities. The bed was comfortable. This time we had traveled light so the small closet and nightstand\/dresser sufficed. There was turndown service nightly which is always nice. We ordered room service for breakfast and once for dinner. Room service was 30 minutes or less each time. Very professional waitstaff and a follow up call to make sure everything okay. They promptly picked up our trays. The excellent bran muffin was served warm the way I requested it. I especially appreciate attention to details like that. MJ at the front desk helped me with our checkout. She was friendly, warm and efficient. In fact, overall all the staff was quite courteous and they set a great tone to our stay.

The sockets were really loose, so the chargers wouldn't stay plugged in.  When we called maintenance, he came to the room and said although the plugs work, the moulding around the sockets was too bulky.  If you already know about the issue, I would think you would find a way to take care of it?!  The other issue was the heat.  You can't control the temperature from your room.  It was extremely hot in our room, and the only way to \"fix\" it per the maintenance man was to have them turn down the boiler in the basement  They did, and although it was still warmer than we like, it was much better the second night than it was the first night.

L'albergo gode di una posizione strategica nel cuore di NY e nello storico parco proprio di fronte all'albergo vi era un mercatino natalizio e una pista di pattinaggio....davvero caratteristici! Il personale dell'albergo \u00e8 stato a dir poco gentile, impeccabile nell'accoglienza e attento ad ogni nostra esigenza. Non appena hanno saputo che eravamo in viaggio di nozze, al nostro rientro ci hanno fatto trovare un'ottima bottiglia di Prosecco e dei palloncini a forma di sposi (\u00e8 stato un gesto molto apprezzato). Vi era molta sicurezza all'interno, poich\u00e8 essendoci un lounge bar \"C\u00e9lon\" e un ristorante \"Koi\" (giapponese, Asian straaaaaaaaaaaaaaa buono, ve lo consiglio!!) vi era sempre un gentilissimo impiegato dinanzi le porte degli ascensori che si assicurava degli ospiti dell'albergo...oltre ovviamente agli altri presenti nella hall. Per quanto riguarda la pulizia della stanza...beh ragazzi difficilmente troverete una stanza e un bagno (enorme, con una doccia in marmo di carrara...bellismo) cos\u00ec ben puliti, i nostri complimenti a YUMI la ragazza che si occupava della nostra camera. E' stato un soggiorno fantasico e il \"The Bryant Park\" \u00e8 proprio il top ...  ci hanno fatto sentire a casa!","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The huge bathtub was most welcome after long days out exploring in cold temperatures! The location cannot be beaten - it is so convenient for everywhere that we rarely got a cab or used the subway.

The rooms are clean and well laid out. Have stayed here twice on my visits to NY. There is a lovely Moroccan themed bar in the basement of the hotel which is a lovely place to have a drink Monday to Thursday. Friday however... It is packed with young uni students and the bar turns into a nightclub of sorts. I did not hear any music or noise when I was in my room. (apart from NY traffic, which is normal).

In June of 2018, I was in town (my hometown, by the way) because my work was being exhibited at Robin Rice Gallery in the west village. It was important to me that my trip got off to a good start, so I was confident that my request for a park view at Bryant Park Hotel would be honored. As it turned out, and to my dismay, I was initially given a deluxe queen room without a view. Sensing my disappointment, the reservations specialist, Yazmin, quickly jumped into action and offered me a Junior Suite, on a high floor, with a panoramic view of Bryant Park - all for a very reasonable monetary upgrade. On top of that, when I returned from my exhibition the following day, Yazmin had left a present for me in my room - along with a congratulatory note! Her quick thinking turned what could have been a disappointing experience into one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had - and I've stayed at hundreds of properties. Couple this with impeccable service, and incredible sushi restaurant, and a great location, the Bryant Park Hotel ranks, in my opinion, as the best in the US - and I have stayed at the George V in Paris, The Park Hotel in Tokyo, and Gritti Palace in Venice.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I got an email asking for a review and if its any indication of how well this establishment is run, I decided to take 5 minutes of my time and oblige that email. It was my wife's (fiance at the time) birthday so we were headed into the city to see a show and take in the sights.  Called up the Bryant Park hotel at the last minute and they could not have been more helpful from start to finish.  Found us a great room with a killer view. The room was beautiful and the bed was comfortable.The front desk directed us to some fantastic eats, introduced us to their brand new lounge\/bar\/club area (not entirely sure which it was, things were a little hazy by the time we made it back to that location).  Each person from the doorman to the room service to the gentleman who operated the elevators were both professional and charismatic. If we're ever looking to spend a special night in the city, I can't imagine anywhere else providing the same or better level or service. Highly recommend","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}
