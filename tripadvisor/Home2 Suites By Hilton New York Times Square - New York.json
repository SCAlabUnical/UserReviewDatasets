The location was excellent, about a 5 minute walk from Times Square. Breakfast was included. There were two or three hot options daily, generally eggs, potatoes and bacon or sausages. There was a choice of cereals, juices, porridge, breads, toaster, yogurt, waffle maker, fruit etc. They also had breakfast rolls that you could take away. The breakfast area was busy so we went down before 8 am each day. The lifts have a system whereby you press your floor number on a key pad outside the lift and it flashes up which lift to take. The lifts coming down were sometimes busy at peak times. The room was very modern and had a kitchen area with microwave, fridge freezer, coffee maker and a wide range of delph, dishes, cutlery etc. The bathroom was modern too, The room had a sofa bed as well as a bed.  it's a new hotel. We loved the hotel and would stay there again. We used the 50th Street subway as it was quieter than the Times Square one and very close to the hotel. We walked almost everywhere. The only thing I wasn't happy about was that there was a 100 euro security deposit per night payable. While it wasn't taken out of the final room cost, it did mean there was a block of 700 euro on our bank account ( along with the room charge) until we checked out. At that point only the room charge was deducted. This may be standard in American hotels but if you have a limited budget you would be down 100 euro per night until you checked out. As I said it could be standard practice in America. I would still.stay in this hotel and recommend it.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The free breakfast was very crowded with cold sausage and 10 people in line to get orange juice. There was a false fire alarm followed by two announcements saying that it was a false alarm. The snack store self checkout did not work for me. The food available is overly woke with only \"health\" sodas lacking sufficient sugar. In contrast there were many kinds of candy bars. The doors are equipped with mighty door closers that make the doors hard to open followed by a very big slam when they close. This hotel is located in a tourist area near times square.

Hotel reception s completely incapable of running a hotel. I had booked and paid two rooms in full, including taxes and fees. I arrived first and explained my friend , who\u2019s room was booked by myself , paid for with my card would either arrive later that day or next day since she had been off loaded from her flight with her son. Reception had some difficulties looking for her booking , at one point saying it was booked at the Hampton but they share reception. I found this odd to start with since both bookings where made at Home2suites , same type of rooms, but didn\u2019t know if they had allocated next door. Next day my friend got on her flight so I would assist her and check her in, then being told they had cancelled the room because of no show! I had heard nothing of this from either Booking.com , whom I had the booking contract with, nor the hotel. I had stood in front of them explaining her stress of not getting on the planned flight due to storms in the UK day before leading to busy flights etc. I had to find and pay for her at an alternative hotel nearby since she was unknowingly in the air at the time, luckily there was availability. \nHome2suites agreed to honour the booking for the remainder of her stay, only after I pointed out they had available rooms the following 2 nights. \nWe spoke to the manager of the hotel and another member of the reception team who agreed to refund the one night where she had to pay for another room. We didn\u2019t ask for  refund for first night since the room wasn\u2019t needed etc. They said the refund would be returned to the booking card and I had to contact Booking.com for processing the refund back to me. \nOn my return to the UK I contacted Booking.com and they claim Home2suites denies there\u2019s a refund due for the one night. I have again disputed this and they are contacting again. It is a week since our return and no nearer any resolution or response from the hotel. Home2suites has also taken an additional \u00a3318 from my credit card used for my room, despite all taxes and fees included in the full amount I paid Booking.com, checking out on time, no use of any services, no breakage in the room. My friend used her card to check in to her room once available. I have contacted the hotel twice regards to this fee but no reply. I have contacted Hilton on their website with no response. \n\nNext step is to dispute payment with Booking.com ( with their success rate so far I think I might as well skip that option) or my credit card company since this an unauthorised charge and no reply from the company which has charged me.  Booking.com refused to publish my review of the hotel due to a \u201cnon stayed reservation \u201c - which I think means the hotel said I did not stay there!! We were in rooms 1314 and 1312 which had their own hallway with secure door so you could leave doors open in between, as good as adjoining rooms. The breakfast was too busy, the wait for waffle making was approx 20 min every morning and items such as bagels and bananas kept running out.  A table was difficult to find, some mornings we had to sit on chairs without a table.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I'm sure some of the issues are down to impatient people re-selecting but still it's a painful experience.   Twice I opted to walk the stairs to the 36th floor rather than wait for an elevator that may or may not take me there! \n\nBeds are much smaller than most hotels offer (however it was comfortable). \n\nA fire alarm system on floor 36 was going off the entire duration of our stay.  Reported but 4 days later it was still sounding. \n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThe ventilation system in the room is horrendously noisy.  Like a subway train rattling through your room! It also filled our room with marijuana smells one night. \n\nThere's no way of controlling it\/switching it off as we were advised it's centrally controlled.  It starts up many, many times during the night and will wake even the deepest of sleepers.  \n\nDespite all the good points raised, this alone would prevent me staying here again. \n\nIt's hard to imagine Hilton making such a disastrous decision in one of their accommodations but they have and it's insufferable.

The location is incomparable for the price. The rooms are very clean, well-laid out, and very quiet. They are small but most hotel rooms in NYC are small.  We appreciated the clever way that the small bathroom is arranged, the refrigerator, and the comfy bed. \n\nWe went to breakfast around 8:45 AM. We didn't have much trouble finding a table for two although the breakfast room was very crowded.  Choices at breakfast are the standard offering at a Home2Suites or Hampton Inn so don't expect anything too exciting.  On the other hand, it is a huge amenity to have breakfast included in the room rate in NYC. The breakfast offerings were frequently replenished and dirty plates were picked up quickly. \n\nAll of the staff who we dealt with pleasant and helpful. \n\nThe elevators do take a little getting used to but we didn't find them to be the disaster that other reviewers have. However, the elevators are small so be aware that guests on the lower floors may find it difficult to get into the first elevator that comes to your floor at morning rush hour. We were on an upper floor and had to cajole others on the elevator to make room for guests on lower floors. \n\nWe stayed in a water view room.  While we only saw a sliver of the Hudson River in the distance, the room had a small extra window that provided some extra sunlight and a nice view of a portion of Times Square. It was worth the small increase in price over a standard room.\n\nOur only annoyance with the hotel came on check-out morning. We prepared our luggage for check out and then took a walk to Central Park.  When we returned to our room, it was clear that housekeeping had been in the room because our dirty towels and trash were gone. No problem. It was the Friday morning before a long holiday weekend, so it made sense for housekeeping to get a jump on cleaning the room. The problem is that housekeeping took the chilled, refilled water bottles that we put on the counter so that we wouldn't forget them.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":25364280,"title":"A great, new Times Square hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-12-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I have been a longtime Hilton Diamond member and have stayed at Hilton brands, including many Home2 Suites, all across the country. I say this because some of the reviews I read on here seemed to come from people who haven't stayed in Times Square before. I think to fairly rate this hotel you have to be able to separate which issues should actually be attributed to this hotel versus which are typical of Times Square-area hotels in general. \n\nFor example, the lobby is packed at virtually all hours of the day. This is typical for Times Square hotels. The free breakfast is a zoo at peak times. Again, typical. It takes a long time to get an elevator. Typical. Elevators often open for you and are already packed with people. Typical. The front desk is usually so busy you have to wait for assistance. Typical. The rooms are very small. Typical. If you're going to get rattled by these things, I strongly suggest you consider staying in a different area of NYC that's not Times Square.\n\nHere are some great things about this hotel. There's a fast service lane for high-level Hilton Honors members. I never had to wait long to talk to someone. The hotel is brand new, clean, and very nice. (MANY hotels in this area are rundown.) The room size is compact, but well designed and appointed. My two adult children and I fit comfortably with two in the queen bed and one on the pullout. (The pullout is only big enough for one adult. Two small children could possibly share it in a pinch.) The room was extremely quiet; we never heard our neighbors, the elevators or commotion in the hallway. We heard a couple sirens outside but were never disrupted by street noise. The beds are comfortable. The staff is busy and frazzled (who wouldn't be?!!?), but service-oriented and trying hard. There's a free breakfast, which is rare in this area. The location is excellent. Anything you could possibly want or need is steps away.\n\nHere are the critiques I consider true hotel issues that need to be resolved to earn a 5th star. The \"smart elevator\" system simply doesn't work well. I have no idea who pitched this concept and what problem it was intended to solve, but it's a disaster. If I were Hilton, I'd scrap those tomorrow. They're a total mess and you can tell the staff is weary from having to apologize for them. Second, there is no way to communicate with the front desk aside from physically standing in line. No one answers the phone, and the Hilton app messaging is disabled. None of my needs were so critical that I couldn't go to the desk, but it's a concerning safety issue that guests cannot get ahold of anyone at the front desk when they need to.\n\nOverall, I would stay here again in a heartbeat and consider this an above average experience at a Times Square hotel. Thank you, Home2 Suites and team!","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was surprising my senior mother with a trip to NY for Christmas (her dream), and when our flight got changed from arriving at 1425 to 0645, I wanted to see if we could secure an early check-in, especially since I hold Gold, and inquire if all of the alarm and noise issues had been resolved. Richard Taylor finally responded to me, and rather rudely. He told me I would just have to check that morning for early check-in, and then beat around the bush with the other stuff - I should have known then to move hotels, but I only had a few days at the point when I was finally able to get a response. Check in was an absolute nightmare. Seriously, probably the worst I have ever encountered - the staff were friendly, but very obviously overwhelmed, and I was told they were not honoring any early check-in's. Cool, the ass. GM Mr. Taylor could have easily told me that and been honest with the other stuff, and I could have changed hotels right then. They did allow us to eat breakfast, which was nice, but OMG busy and clustered. When we finally got into our room, just after 3, it was nice and spacious (for NYC). It was mostly clean (floors not so much), well appointed, and as most hotels, bad lighting. The shower liked to flucuate in temperature a lot, but had good pressure. The outside noise was blocked very well, but it didn't do anything for the incredibly annoying HVAC and random fire alarms. The rooms were stuffy and you couldn't change the temp, but it went on and off every 5 minutes - it was awful. The elevators were interesting, definitely better if you were in a higher floor, or low enough to take the stairs. Novel concept, but poor execution. You would be told an elevator (no controls on the inside), wait for it, just to get on and find out someone after you requested the same floor and it changed - you then have to get out wherever you land and try again. Now for the good - the location was absolutely perfect, steps from Broadway, subways, restaurants and right next door to the James Earl Jones theater. The staff were all kind and helpful, and the breakfast was an adequate start to your day, especially with NY prices. Overall, if they could streamline their check-in and figure out what the hell is going on with the HVAC and alarms, it could be an incredible property, but as of now, I wouldn't stay again.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We absolutely loved the option for families who need 2 rooms to book 2 separate rooms within a separate hall with a locked foyer door.

For NYC the room size isn't too bad.  \n\nThe weaknesses: Busy hotel and the front desk gets absolutely swamped at check-in time (please consider signage and roping similar to how airports queue lines); we had repeated issues with the digital key on the app and then even with key cards. We literally spent 39 minutes in line to get the key cards after the app digital key failed then had to visit the front desk again after those keys didn't open one of our rooms. The ventilation system did indeed cause a lot of noise as other reviews noted; however, we were able to use the control panel in the room to just turn it off and crack the outdoor window. There was indeed the fire alarm buzzing in the hallway near our rooms as noted in other reviews but luckily we had booked the 2 rooms within their own locked foyer so the noise was lessened since we were separated by our own foyer (I still used ear plugs- consider bringing them).  \n\nThe staff did seem to be doing their best and were friendly.

We complained and requested an alternative room and waited 15 minutes in the corridor on level 23 waiting for a staff member, before heading back to the lobby to find out what was going on.
