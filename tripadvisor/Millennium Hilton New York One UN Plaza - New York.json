I have never written a review for hotels before and the experience I had compelled me to write a review so people are aware. I never understood people complaining about the \"service\" aspect of hotels until I dealt with the staff working at this property. \n\n1. They falsely advertised the 2br suite. When we raised the issue, the manager did not believe our complaint was valid and had to send someone up with a tape measure. The employee confirmed the bed was not a queen, but rather a full sized bed. We could not get a hold of anyone about this issue until the day after making multiple phone calls.\n\n2. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANYONE FOR ANYTHING. We called the front desk to ask for utensils, earplugs, and a late check out. People rarely pick up the phone morning, daytime, and evening. We were told that \"90% of guests are diamond and we can't help you\" along with many interesting comments and behaviors that you wouldn't even see at their lowest level brand, Homewood Suites.\n\nJust save your $ somewhere and stay anywhere but here. We ended up going to a different hotel (arguably a lower brand) and were so relieved that people treat you like guests with a proper hello and eye contact.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It would not have been my choice. I am a Hilton diamond member, but I didn\u2019t reserve the room through the app so we didn\u2019t receive any benefits. We had to book through my husband\u2019s work. I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve made any difference in the quality of our service, though.\n\nIt\u2019s convenient to have the coffee shop downstairs, except that it never opens on time.

They do have some snacks and sandwiches. The woman who works in the morning is friendly, if not punctual.\n\nThe hallways are dark, most likely because they are painted dark gray. The lighting is dim. The front desk staff is surly and you are definitely an imposition when you check in or ask a question.

However, my recent stay at a Hilton establishment has disappointed me. From the moment I walked through the doors, it was clear that this hotel was far from meeting the high standards I had come to expect. The first issue that struck me was the severe lack of organization. The check-in process was an absolute nightmare. With long, understaffed check-in counters, guests were left waiting in never-ending lines, their patience draining away as time ticked by. \n\nAs we finally made our way to our assigned rooms, I couldn't help but notice the hotel's dire need for renovation, from the lobby to the dimly lit hallways. \n\nOn a positive note, one aspect that truly stood out was the exceptional housekeeping service provided at our hotel. Our rooms' housekeepers' attention to detail and cleanliness exceeded our expectations, leaving us impressed. It is only fair to say that the housekeeping staff deserves commendation for their excellent work.\n\nAnother positive is in the bustling city, where coffee is on every corner, the little coffee shop in the hotel lobby had fantastic coffee. There is a single mother who stands out among the crowd. She is not just an ordinary barista; she is a master of her craft, creating the best coffee in town. As the sun peeks through the city skyline every morning, this single mother works her magic. Her dedication and passion for her job radiated as she greeted us with a warm smile and genuine enthusiasm. It is evident that she takes pride in her work, and that is reflected in every cup she serves.\n\nAnother negative, being a Diamond member at a hotel has its fair share of perks and privileges, usually from exclusive lounge access to upgraded room amenities, which this hotel did not have. These benefits make stays more memorable. However, what happens when these perks turn into bad experiences? Let me recount an incident that left a bitter taste in my mouth during my recent stay in a New York City hotel. As a Diamond member, my spouse and I were thrilled to learn that we would receive two complimentary bottles of water every day. It may seem like a small gesture, but after a long day exploring the bustling streets of NYC, this simple amenity brings comfort and convenience. The front desk clerk formed during check-in that we could collect our water bottles at the front desk every day, so we did for the first two days without any issues. On the third day, our experience took an unexpected turn. As we approached the front desk to pick up our water bottles, the front desk clerk said we should buy our own &^*&*(( water and don't ask for anymore. \n\nAs I stated - mixed feelings.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I also missed those small amenities you get in better hotels, like a pen and notepad, a shower cap, a shoe mitt and a bath robe. The amenities were  bare bones.. The room was spacious and had a lovely sofa next to a huge window with a beautiful view over Manhattan, but the walls were completely bare and the room looked rather austere, more like an office than a bedroom.  The bed was comfortable. On the plus side, I want to mention the concierge\/valet staff, Ainsley and his colleagues: they were friendly, proactive and very helpful. They were the ones that made me feel welcome.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My wife is 6 months pregnant and after travelling for 18 hours - I would have really appreciated some help with our bags - none was forthcoming.\n\nThe property itself is nice, although our room was tired. One of the wardrobes had a hole where bulbs were meant to be (so no light at all) the other wouldn\u2019t close properly so shed a constant light into the room. The desk and bedside tables in the room had all seen better days and the lamp on the desk was bent and broken. The computer connections to the side of the desk (USB to charge phones\/tablets) was broken. We had paid extra to have an \u2018illy coffee machine\u2019 - which was just a terrible cafeti\u00e8re and not as described. \n\nThe carpet is absolutely disgusting and we didn\u2019t dare walk on it bare foot!\n\nThe \u2018mini fridge\u2019 is a domestic fridge which did not fit in the space adequately (obviously the cupboard was originally fitted with a hotel spec minibar). This meant that the door would catch on the inner of the cupboard every time you wanted to open it. Whilst the room was adequate, it simply is not good enough at this price point.\n\nOn a plus, the bathroom is excellent, the bed was comfy and the city view - spectacular!\n\nService;\n\nOverall the service from this property was poor almost exclusively at every single touch point.\n\n1 - I had emailed prior to arrival to ask a few questions - the reply was overly direct and set the tone for our upcoming stay.\n2 - Check in was the only exception and the gentleman who checked us in was efficient and helpful but not overly friendly. We were not told about any relevant details (would we like to pay for breakfast for example)\n3 - I had cause to wait in the lobby for a delivery - I asked the lady behind the desk if she had seen it arrive, she didn\u2019t want to help. Whilst I waited, I witnessed 3 separate guests enquire about what time checkout was - the lady behind the desk was rude to every single one of them (if so many guests are asking the same question, this shows a lack of service at check in). She could not have made her displeasure at having to answer guests queries more obvious had she spat in their faces! She was dreadful and is definitely working in the wrong industry! (Management, if you are reading this it was 1830 on December 29th 2022).\n4 - Several guests asked for late checkout and were rudely told \u2018call back before 11am and speak to the manager\u2019 - really quite unhelpful and unprofessional - not to mention unnecessarily rude!\n\nBar Service\n\n1 - Service was slow and we were not made to feel very welcome. At one point one of the 2 barmen simply turned his back and walked away from me, even though I had been stood at the bar for 2-3 minutes and there were no other customers waiting to be served.\n2 - The bar pricing is different to the advertised rates on the website (and the rates which we were emailed prior to arrival)\n3 - The service was \u2018ok\u2019 and there was certainly no \u2018service with a smile\u2019 here!\n\nOverall - the property is \u2018OK\u2019 and the location and views are great but the service was poor and this is what would stop me returning. Having spent my career working for two very large American companies who put the customer at the absolute heart of everything which they do - it was a great shame to see that the staff at this property were not doing this. Put simply, the service was \u2018the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u2019\n\nA special mention to the housekeeping staff however - after a long day of sightseeing - it was lovely to come back to a clean room and their thank you note for being tipped a relatively small amount really meant a lot!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon check in I found the lady behind the check in desk to be extremely rude. She wasn't welcoming towards us and just appeared annoyed we were there bothering her. She asked me to put my card into the machine to pay the deposit which I did but I was using a credit card that very rarely gets used so I had to double check the pin number through my online banking app. To do this I asked her if I could have the WiFi code to which she said in an annoyed voice \"its hilton\" as if she expected me to already know it. I eventually got the pin number and made the payment. Yes I understand that it may have been annoying as I slowed the process down but nobody else was waiting. She was just doing everything in silence not communicating with us whatsoever. When she had finished she told us our room wasn't ready and that we could either wait or leave our bags with the concierge. We didn't realise that it was only 10 minutes until 4pm when check in was so we said we would leave the bags and go for a look around the area. The gentlemen who took our bags from us were extremely helpful and polite and made it appear that nothing was a problem for them. They actually exclaimed \"your room isn't ready at this time\" when we went over to them. We came back at 4pm and I asked to check in as it was the correct time. The entire time the lady was checking us in she didn't say one word to us until she handed us the cards and then said \"breakfast is at the ambassador suit 7am-11am and to get to your room go to the left take elevator to 32nd floor\", no enjoy your stay, nothing. \nThe room itself was quite nice with a lovely view of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. \nThere was plenty of coffee but only 2 tea bags and two portions of powdered milk in the room which I thought was ridiculous so I requested more tea bags the following morning from reception when we left the hotel for the day as I was going to purchase milk at a local shop. That night we arrived back to find we hadn't been given any tea bags so I had to ring down to housekeeping who then brought me 2 tea bags immediately. However each day we had the same issue as they never refilled the tea bags despite it being evident that was the only hot drink we were having. The room generally appeared clean however the carpet was a little bit stained in places and could do with a clean and the bedside light shades were incredibly dusty. The light by the room door was hanging out of the ceiling by about an inch and the bulb at the window light was blown. The bathroom was quite nice and pretty large, it had a large shower but I didn't know how to work the shower head that was fixed to the wall but that wasn't really a problem as we used the other shower head. I am used to hotels providing a guide where they mention how to use things in the room, room service menus, local attractions etc but this hotel didn't have that. We asked to use the reception safe to put some jewellery and cash but we're told there wasn't a reception safe only the safe in our room despite the notice on the back of room door stating we could leave valuables in the reception safe.\nThe first morning we went down for breakfast we were told that we would have to wait as there were no tables available, despite there being at least 10 tables which I counted which had nobody sitting at them. The lady was also incredibly rude to us and other guests and another couple actually asked to see the manager who came over and explained they were short staffed. One member of the couple complaining actually worked at another Hilton hotel and stated that it was completely unacceptable to speak to guests the way the lady had and that there were several tables empty so there was no reason why people's orders couldn't be taken while tables were being cleaned which I felt was a rather good suggestion. The manager then stated that due to staff shortages they wouldn't be able to clean tables and also take orders. When we did eventually sit down to eat 20mins later my partner found a long hair in between his napkin which at this point he wanted to walk out however I felt we had wasted so much time already that we may aswel just stay. My partner ordered sausages which were incredibly salty, overcooked and generally unpleasant. I ordered the Irish oats with banana which I enjoyed. There were also items on the menu which they said they didn't have and it wasn't a case they just didn't have them on that occasion as the waiter said \"oh no we don't have those\" meaning croissants and English muffins. Why have items on a menu if you don't have them or at least tell the customer you don't have them prior to them ordering. We could see one of the chefs eating and it wasn't him tasting the food he was actually having his breakfast behind the pass. The waiter brought us down the bill for breakfast despite breakfast being included in our room rate so we had to explain this to him and he had to go off to check this. Breakfast on the other mornings was an improvement from the first morning.\nDuring our stay we found the concierge and housekeeping staff to be incredibly helpful and friendly. They would greet us each morning when they saw us asking how we were. \nUpon check out the lady (a different one to the one who checked us in) was very polite. She apologised for the wait despite us only waiting 5 mins and was polite to me during our exchange.\nThe hotel is in a good location near to Grand Central Station and you can walk to all local attractions such as St Patrick's cathedral, Rockefeller Centre and Empire State Building.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was especially dismayed to find out after leaving another hotel to check into the Millennium Hotel. I had to present at the UN and there was NO business services.

We could clearly see the one world trade centre from our rooms. \n\nThere was a comfortable king size bed with a writing desk and chair plus a comfortable armchair by the large windows. There was a luggage table, that was most useful and the bathroom was fabulous, fitted in stone tiles with a large walk in shower and cupboards\/safe. The lighting and air conditioning was all controlled from a computer panel and was easy to use. There were plenty of lighting options including a useful nightlight in the door of the bathroom. \n\nThe entrance to the hotel was all finished in black marble and was spotlessly clean with smart, friendly staff. We arrived late having come down on the maple leaf Amtrak service from Niagara Falls, but we were swiftly checked in by reception and soon up to our rooms. I found the rooms to be very pleasant, but the carpet did let it down a little. It was a bit grubby and worn in places but perfectly serviceable. One of the support struts under the bed was broken and rattled as you sat down, but did not impact use. I did find a half drunk bottle of the complimentary water under the bed from a previous guest, so it clearly hadn\u2019t been deep cleaned. That said the sheets and mattress were all clean with no issues. \n\nWe went to the highly recommended \u2018johns\u2019 cafe further down the road for our first morning breakfast, but ate at the hotel for the remaining 2 days as the hotel restaurant was very nice. Expensive, but that\u2019s New York all over! Take more money than you expect for food as even 3 McDonald\u2019s meals was over $70!! \n\nThe hotel is perfectly located by the UN building and close to the river with fabulous views thanks to the rooms starting from Floor 29!

John the manager offered to deduct 1 nights room charge & give us $100 spends in the bar. The suite we eventually got into after 10pm had fabulous views but was dated and had the most stained carpet I\u2019ve ever seen in any hotel. There was no room service, no ice bucket , no plates to eat a take away we had in the room on our last night despite there being a 6 seater round table & fridge in the suite. The elevator was dated and old resulting in us getting stuck on the 34th floor and having to call for assistance. The very best part of this hotel is the concierge staff who are wonderful. Our breakfast was very nice as was the restaurant staff . However we were advised on check out that a Diplomat had overstayed in our room on the first night causing the check in delay for us! So in reality someone more important than us had priority over us gaining access to our room so be aware of this when booking & choosing this hotel.

The staff are great and, through cheek-biting conversation, are fully aware they're doing the best they can with what they've got to work with. The location is excellent with Grand Central Station just an 8 minute walk away and a 10 minute walk to the East River ferry terminal which is a fantastic way to get to Long Island and Brooklyn and also takes you straight down to Wall Street for an exceptional $3 per trip. Very important to note that when it comes to room sizing this is one area where American Hotels decide to go small.  We had a room apparently accommodating 4 adults so naturally we expect - from the photos - to see two double beds.  Double they were not - more like large singles or very conservative three quarter beds.  As the hotel was full - staff couldn't accommodate a larger room - not even able to provide a camp bed - most disappointing.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

I believe he is the Front Desk Manager.\n\nZack told me that he along with a security guard would go into the old room to make sure I didn\u2019t leave the necklace there, and that the room was occupied but they had gotten permission from the current guest there.\n\nI waited for about an hour and I was told by Zack that they couldn\u2019t find the necklace there. \n\nI asked Zack if I should call the police about this incident and Zack advised me to fill out a report with security instead and that they\u2019ll see what the hotel can do for me.

However I showed him photos I sent to friends of my visit to the hotel gym, wearing the necklace on the same night I checked in. After which I did not leave the hotel property that night. I encouraged Sulvino to have hotel security check footage of that night and trace my movement, and also witness me wearing the necklace with their own eyes.\n\nAfter this conversation, Sulvino assured me that he would be contacting me by the end of the day with contact information to the main management and instructions.\n\nToday is June 8th, and I still haven\u2019t received any communication from Sulvino or anyone from the hotel.

It is across the street from the UN at First Avenue and 44th Street in New York City. \n\nIt used to be well-kept. It used to have a gym with a swimming pool, men's and women's locker rooms with a sauna, fresh flowers in the lobby, experienced and well-trained staff, the list could go on. Today almost all of this is gone \n\nStaff are poorly trained, impolite (downright rude), unhelpful, and just make you feel that they don't care about the hotel or it's guests. The hotels itself is unkept with dirty carpets, poor beds, peeling wall-paper, dirty windows, no pool, no saunas, the list could go on. Many facilities suffer from neglect of maintenance or mere cleaning. Gone is the charm and service that made this a top hotel. Instead it is a property that is stumbling towards being one of the worse hotels that your money can pay for in New York City. \n\nSome of this might be to Hilton taking over the hotel, but whatever the reason the Hilton Millennium One UN Plaza has become a disaster zone. A hotel that on e hosted Heads of States, is today (under Hilton management) unfit to serve as a prison for international criminals.\n\nWe checked in for a week's stay and checked out the next morning searching for a safer place to stay. \n\nMy advice is that visitors should avoid this place like the plague.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":209382,"title":"Recommended if your intention is just to see the fireworks","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-07-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"It was our first time staying at this hotel. We stayed here from Jul 3 to Jul 6 with our primary intention to see the fireworks from our room facing the East River. There are some positives & negatives to this review, which I will outline towards the end.\n\nCheck-in staff were very friendly when we got there around the 8AM. The only issue was the room was not available when we got there and they knew the reason was because we are coming from the West Coast (San Francisco) & some from Los Angeles (as the primary reason as most took a redeye flight and just wanted to rest). Because of that, we left some of our bags with the bellman, who was friendly. To compensate for the room delay, we got to rest comfortably on their couch (there were also lounge chairs, which is pretty neat). To use the restrooms one would need a key card (or the bellman would give it if we did not get our room). \n\nThe other thing is I indicated an early-check-in but understood it was not guaranteed. When I inquired about the room facing the East River, they said it was full, but they did say they had a very nice room for me (to our surprise and happiness, one part of it faced the East River, and the other part of it had a wonderful city view), which part of me wanted for a downtown hotel. \n\nWe only got our room around 2PM and were on the 30th floor (the highest floor I have ever stayed at in any hotel in my life), room 3023. The room was very clean, but we had a couple of instances where the bathroom reeked of odor. When we reported this, the room service took care of it once, but  not a second time, which was a little disappointing. \n\nI liked that the shower had two shower heads; a fixed shower head & a moveable one. At some points, the tub was a little slippery, so not really a grab bar so had to hold on to another surface. \n\nThe beds were very comfortable. I guess there's a reason why for 2 full beds they only want 2 people in the room (it was pretty comfortable for my parents, just a little bit smaller to their liking, but no complaints from them, they enjoyed the bed). I got a very good night's sleep on them, and still better than the bed & pillows I have at my home. \n\nI went to the fitness center one morning and one thing I liked was you could see the East River and skyline view from different parts. One thing is that they did close early for July 4th for safety reasons, likely to prevent crowding of hotel guests at the gym, still owing to the current COVID-19 situation. \n\nThere's also a coffee shop (Illy) & a restaurant\/bar (Ambassador Grill). The coffee was average at most during the times I bought it, and $3 more for a cappuccino was a better choice which I enjoyed during our hotel stay. hat One little gripe about that, which is outside our control was that every day they had different hours (Jul 3, they closed at 4:30PM, Jul 4 11PM, Jul 5 around 6PM). Keeping stability of the hours or keeping it open 24 hours would be helpful. For breakfast, only 1 of the days we ate there (Tuesday) and had the French Toast, waffles and scrambled eggs. It was delicious, but it was quite pricey ($85). I would suggest at least 1 day have breakfast at the hotel as there are certainly many cheaper options nearby, which we equally enjoyed breakfast outside as well. \n\nComing to the main part - Fireworks. We had a friend also visit and hung out with us and even he got to enjoy the fireworks from the room. Given my parents are elderly and my dad (and ofc some of us) do not want to stand in the crowds, seeing it from the room was certainly very convenient & an experience I will never forget. Because of that I was able to fulfill my parents' wishes. It was unique like no other; seeing it deployed from the barges with the Macys logo was beautiful. For $250-$300\/night, it's definitely worth the view and convenience to downtown and many of the main landmarks like Empire State Building, Times Square, and Grand Central. It's also next to the UN Building, which has guided tours. \n\nPositives:\n- Great location if your intention is to see the fireworks from the East River\n- Friendly staff (they recognized me every day and made sure I enjoyed my stay)\n- Food (and of course the cappuccino)\n\nNegatives:\n- Some room service issues were not addressed all the time when we requested it (bathroom odor, laundry bags)\n- Coffee wasn't so good at the Illy coffee shop but good at the Ambassador Grill\n- Breakfast was a little more pricier to our expectations ($$)\n- Waiting for the room (this can't be blamed on anybody as it was a long weekend) but the couches and lounge chairs to take rest really compensated before we got our room. \n\nOverall, I recommend this hotel if your intention is to see the fireworks from the room without standing in any crowds near the East River. However, I would recommend other hotels in downtown New York (like Grand Central Westin or Hyatt, etc) if your intention is just to explore downtown. I only deducted a star due to the room service and understand it's due to covid, but some requests could have been handled better or some communication if there were delays. \n\nThe price was high (which was expected), but it's worth it if you want to just see the fireworks.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

There is no room service catering, no laundry service, and the swimming pool is closed. The rooms are clean, a little tired,but bare, not even a pen and paper or any guidance on what is in the hotel - I think the answer is nothing much! There is soap and towels in the bathroom, but no amenity kit. The mini bar fridge is filthy and empty. There is a coffee machine and some coffee, but no tea or milk. There is an iron, but it has either melted nylon stuck to it or the surface coating has corroded, either way not usable.\n\nThe staff, including the manager who I kept being referred to, are apologetic but clearly frustrated. I\u2019ve never stayed at a Hilton where after a long haul flight I\u2019m heading out to find food and a laundry service\u2026 I hope this stay gets better in the 7 days I am here but I think I will instead look to move.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t got better. So I head out to the laundry recommended by the hotel, and it closed an hour ago at 7pm. The staff don\u2019t even know the times - if they had told me at check in when I had asked I would have made it on time. I then walked around other laundries to find they had also closed. I then went into the Hampton by Hilton, just one block away, cheaper and they have a laundry service, but by then it was too late for the overnight service - but too marks to the Hampton front desk staff for actually being very helpful, unlike the UN Hilton.\n\nMore problems. The carpets are filthy in places. One area looked like the remains of a murder scene.\n\nThe Skyline Lounge is permanently closed, so nowhere for Gold members and above to go and relax. And I\u2019ve got light switches in the room without covers - shocking!\n\nSo this is not a 4 star hotel, it is in a shoddy state and it is misrepresentation by Hilton to claim it is.

Staff were helpful and friendly from moment we arrived to minute we left - doormen helping with luggage, front of house staff very helpful - I wish I had for the ladies name as we spoke with her on reception every afternoon\/early evening and she was always happy and helpful.

I don\u2019t care about the view. Certainly not in lieu of cleanliness and comfort. I can go out and sight-see from the tall buildings during the day. Anyway: cracks, leaks, stains, grime and scum in books and crannies - this hotel has it all. And I wouldn\u2019t quite characterize the staff I dealt with as rude, but they certainly weren\u2019t nice. I think they might be \u201csurly\u201d, but I\u2019d have to look that word up to be sure. I\u2019m a Diamond member. It was not acknowledged once and I did not receive any \u201cprivileges\u201d of this status other than two bottles of water. Whoopee! I\u2019ll try to savor those. The ceilings in this room are 7 feet! Yes, you read that right. Over the 90 or so square feet that cover the bed, there\u2019s a cutout to make it 8 feet. Just. And I\u2019d surmise that the floor of next floor is a foot above that, given the surprisingly loud volume of the foot traffic I hear. And I\u2019m sorry, the room is not 387 square feet. It is about 330, and a good chunk of this is taken up by the long, dark, empty, useless 3 foot wide hallway that leads into the room itself. It feels like I\u2019m walking into the archives section of some dusty relic. So all in all, I\u2019m glad paid what seems to be on the lower side of room rates - having booked this way in advance.

All you have to do is look down to see all the dirt and especially in the elevators. It never got clean during the three days we were there. Likewise around the room, it was a two-story suite, but equally devoid of a high cleanliness standard you associate with Hilton. Dated and stained carpet. I saw more people cleaning the elevator doors at the various buildings where we looked at properties than at the Hilton.\n\nThe bright spot was the small coffee place near the entrance.

One with 2 full beds and another with 2 doubles with a city view. While the rooms where relatively clean, the rooms we had needed lots of maintenance. Noticeable old carpet stains. Missing mini fridges. Broken lights and other various broken gadgets in the rooms. For the price of the hotel, it needs a lot of refreshing. Even the hallways look old and are covered with carpet stains. Views were great, however. All of our rooms had nice views despite only one being booked as a city view. \n\nHOUSEKEEPING: The attendants were awesome and extremely attentive. They were about the only positives of my stay here. \n\nSTAFF: Encountered kind staff (like the housekeeping team), but encountered more rude staff than kind. Upon check-in, the front desk woman was extremely short and rude with me when answering questions. Additionally, every time my family and I entered the lobby, the doormen and concierge stared at us like we did not belong in the hotel. It was the oddest thing and I never experienced that before. \n\nLOCATION: Not bad. In a quieter area of Manhattan. About a 10 min walk to Grand Central Station\/Chrysler building. Nearest subway I found was about 10 mins away. Times Square is about a 15-20 mins walk. Or you can take the Grand Central shuttle to the area as well. Stay here if you don\u2019t mind the walk. \n\nOverall, I would not stay here again simply because of how worn out the hotel is and how unaccommodating the staff was.

It was legitimately good enough to be a standalone cafe anywhere in the city, and this is coming from someone who lived in Seattle, the home of great cafes, for near a decade. My family and I ate breakfast from the UN Cafe every morning of our stay and we were impressed each time with the quality, and perhaps more importantly, the consistency of our service, food, and drink. Great handmade cappuccino and lattes, hot breakfast platters, and special recognition to the fresh cut fruits and berries. This place was busy and the single barista was able to crank out custom orders at top speed with no compromise in quality. \n\nWhile my families' entire stay was top notch, and the views, service, and amenities with beyond my expectations, the memory that stands out were the wonderful breakfasts from the UN Cafe.

To begin, we called the hotel a week before arrival to see if we were able to get an early check in as our flight landed earlier than the regular check in time. The woman we spoke to was very nice and told us that we were able to check in at 12 pm. We called again around two days before arrival to confirm and a different lady who helped us told us that we were good to check in at 12 pm. Upon arrival we let the lady at check in know that we had called to request an early check in and confirmed that we could check in at 12. However, she told us that the room was not ready yet and that they cannot guarantee an early check in and is based on availability. While this did make sense, this is not what we were told over the phone. Not once were we told that our early check in was not guaranteed; on the contrary we were told that in fact our early check in was confirmed. This wasn\u2019t too big of a deal but it did delay our plans as we had been traveling since 5 am and were hoping to at least be able to shower and change. Moving on, when we were finally able to get in the room we noticed that the room was not a city view which is what i had paid for, it was mostly a view of the building next to us and some of the city in the very corner, Regardless of the room being very nice, we did pay for a city view and again over the phone were told that we would get a full city view. We went back to check in to explain our concerns and the lady at check in asked for the room number. Upon telling her the room number she said \u201chmm that\u2019s weird that\u2019s not a city view.\u201d She then looked it up on the computer and said \u201cwell it is a partial city view.\u201d And then proceeded to say that all of the full city view rooms are currently booked and that we can come back tomorrow and check if any open up. This is ridiculous considering the fact that I literally paid for the full city view and not only did she straight up lie as she had just told us that our room was not a city view, but again we were not told that it was a \u201cpartial city view\u201d over the phone. The pictures on the website are also very misleading as they do show a full city view. This really upset us because we paid a lot for a city view and it\u2019s not what we got. Finally, on one of our nights there we asked the front desk if they could call us a taxi since it was snowing extremely hard and very cold outside and they told us that they do not call taxis at this hotel and that we would have to flag one down somewhere else\u2026 which we did. Then on our last day, we see another employee calling some other guest a taxi from the very same desk that they just told us they don\u2019t call taxis from, so we asked and he told us that they do call taxis and it is one of the hotels included services, and proceeded to call us a taxi right from the desk . Lastly, the hotel itself is beautiful and the room was very nice  looking but it wasn\u2019t all so clean either, there was so much hair in the shower drain which wouldn\u2019t let the water fully drain, the tv did not work, there was some blood on the sheets I had to ask for clean ones, the shower head did not work you had to use the handheld one, the coffee machine leaked water everywhere which i had to clean up. there did seem to be a lot of contradiction between the staff and although they are nice with their tone of voice they\u2019re all pretty unhelpful besides a few.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Here's my take.\n1. For the 2nd time I was unable to choose my room on the Hilton app. My advise is to call ahead and do everything you can to politely insist on getting a room in the west tower. The rooms are much nicer and if you reserved a room with a view it tends to be nicer as well. If you read these reviews you will see some very negative and some very positive reviews. I think it has a lot to do with the rooms someone ends up in.\n2. You are given a credit to spend at the bar, restaurant, or cafe (with store). I think IMHO you should skip the restaurant for breakfast and spend money on snacks from the cafe for later in the day. There are plenty of great restaurants in the neighborhood to eat at.\n3. Get to know the people working at the hotel. If you are nice to them they can make some nice things happen for you. \n4. I liked the layout of the king rooms better than the corner rooms, but that's just me.\n\nTo the management I want to point out and thank Bobby and Avery who were at the concierge desk, you're lucky they work for you.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

I am a Hilton Diamond and was denied an upgrade despite availability (on some of the days of our stay). Dirty coffee pods were not removed for 3 days from the room, and coffee was not filled up either in the room. There were tea bags but no way to boil water. Shampoo was not available either and we were told to use shower gel to wash our hair. I flagged these (and other) shortcomings with staff but no attempt was made to rectify them. The $30 credit per day is - to put it politely - a joke and shows how not just this hotel but Hilton USA has gone from a service economy to a pure money-grabbing business. There is barely any item on the breakfast menu for $15 or less per person so that you de facto end up paying extra for your breakfast. Moreover, many executive lounges across Europe and the Middle East are open but not so here (or indeed elsewhere in the US despite much lower Covid incidences than in Europe). For example, one could have at least handed out free drink vouchers to Diamond members. What is the point of having a genuine elite membership (earned through stays and not via a cheap credit card deal) if all I receive as a Diamond member is bottled water? Many staff lack even the basics of hospitality in this property. On a more positive note, the location is very good and the view from the room is great too. Overall, however, this property cannot be recommended and falls well short of international Hilton standard. ","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The fridge in the room didn\u2019t work, but they brought us a new one (but left the old one there (?)), and we had to put in on the floor. \n\nOn day one we noticed that housekeeping seemed a bit rushed and perhaps were not that thorough, but things got worse on day two. \n\nWe came home from a long day in town to find that the only thing housekeeping had done was to empty (some) trash bins, make the beds and hang up (dirty) towels. Used coffee cups were left out together with dirt on the carpets and no new coffee capsules or sugar etc were left. I immediately rang front desk and received apologies, and they sent up new coffee and promised to do better.\n\nOn day three - again coming home from a long day in town - we discovered exactly the same thing. We also noticed that one of the beds (which my daughter had slept in) was In fact broken (broken springs?)- no grown-up can sleep there.

I explained the situation and was told that housekeeping would speak to her boss and get back to me. \n\nNo one returned my call.\n\nThe following morning, during checkout, I explained my disappointment to the front desk (a nice guy named Brandon) who asked me to contact the director of front office, Matthew Waller, who would be there at 1 pm.

We were also told that daily housekeeping had been restored - this is the first hotel I've stayed at since the pandemic started that has done this without needing to make a request.  The room was clean and comfortable, and we found it to be more spacious that most comparable Manhattan hotels which are known for tiny rooms.

I had already checked in on the Hilton app and had selected my Room had the digital key prior to arriving. My partner went to find a parking lot and found one up on 46th and 1st, with a Daily Rate of $35, which wasn\u2019t bad at all. \n\nThere was whoni assumed to be one of the managers outside who was kind enough to point me in the right direction. Security is present with a dog that has to inspect your luggage. Safety definitely being a priority. Found my way to the room, got into the room and was amazed. At first the Windows seemed small, but when you get to walk over to them and look out, there\u2019s the city, we could see the Empire State Building as well as a very recognizable cityscape. THIS was the New York City I missed. \n\nThe accommodations were comfortable. The room was clean. Getting transportation to explore the city is a breeze with Lyft and you\u2019re located adjacent to  FDR DRIVE. Would highly suggest utilizing Lyft if need be. I think the most we waited was 10 minutes. \n\nThe cafe in the lobby had a nice selection to choose from if you are crazing a snack or something sweet. We didn\u2019t have a chance to try The Ambassador or Room Service. \n\nWe had to check out on Monday, but hadn\u2019t planned on leaving until later, so the bellmen were awesome and stored our stuff for us until we returned back to the hotel. \n\nOverall satisfaction has been met.

You can see the Freedom Tower on a good day one side and the skyscraper residences by Central Park on the other. \n\nWe easily got a room change since the first room reeked of smoke.

We decided to book into the Millenium Hilton at U.N. Plaza as it is a newer property and is probably kept up as it no doubt receives worldwide visitors to the U.N.\n\nThe staff was friendly and assigned a wonderful room with a view; however, we discovered upon entry that the carpet was stained and dirty, used coffee packets and sugar, cr\u00e8me and napkins accompaniments had not been replaced.  Also, there was dust on the shelves in the closet (there was no dresser with drawers as the hotel design was based on the European model).  Finally, the batteries in the safe were discharged making it unusable.\n\nUpon leaving for the day we spoke to the front desk who called in the manager and requested that we be moved.  We were told that we would be given a higher floor with larger windows and to check back upon our return.  We came back at 10:30 P and received a set of keys to the new smaller room (five floors higher) but set in an inner corner with virtually no view.  Also, we had to move our own luggage as there were no porters on duty.  We had a bedside lamp that could not be turned off using its own switch but was regulated by the main switch just inside the door.  The lamp on the other side of the bed worked perfectly.  Being tired, we settled for what was given and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day my wife asked the manager if there could be an adjustment made.  She responded that that was not possible as the room was booked through a third party.  However, she would try to give us some points.  Again, we went out for the day to spend time with friends and relatives and did not return until late the second evening.  Upon entering the room, we discovered that the bed was not made up nor were used towels replaced.  While we had new packets of coffee, tea, sugar, et al, there were no stirrers.\n\nAgain, we called the front desk and they did send someone up with fresh towels.  During this phone call, my wife was told that we would have to request that the room be made up and supplies replenished and that it is not \u201cautomatic.\u201d  It would have been nice if this was conveyed to us upon our check-in the first day.  On the third evening, we returned to a room that was made up and towels replaced.\n\nWe have booked Hilton hotels for years due to their reputation and fine service and we did stay at a Homewood Suites by Hilton during our visit to Long Island for the next three days.  That property was like night and day as compared to the Millenium Hilton.  We realize that some services had to be curtailed due to lack of staff during Covid, but at least communicate with your guests and let them know the true situation and the full extent of lack of services up front.  The Millenium Hilton did not communicate to us and it appeared that they didn\u2019t care either.  Apologies are cheap and we kept getting those but very little else.  We will probably go with another hotel chain in the future.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

When we arrived at check-in, the reservation was under my friend's name and the concierge told me I wasn't allowed to check in without her unless we called TripAdvisor and switched the name of the reservation. Because this is most likely standard procedure and it was the middle of the afternoon, I'd understood his impatient tone and went to fix the reservation. But I could also understand complaints from other guests who were checking in that afternoon that the customer service was unsatisfactory.\n\nAll that aside, when we arrived in the room we'd booked, everything looked fine except for some black stains on the floor. We hadn't thought anything of it because they were by the foot of the bed and we had planned to be out for most of the time. The next morning for check out, we checked out on time and cleaned up all of our trash.\n\nSo I was certainly surprised when I received a $544 deep cleaning charge on my bill. Throughout multiple attempts to get in touch with the hotel managers Saritza and Thomas, we learned that the deep cleaning charge was a result of those black stains on the floor, that were a result of smoking in the room. Neither of my friends nor I smoke\u2013\u2013as one of us has asthma, and carries an inhaler around at all times. Beyond that, a $544 deep cleaning charge seems excessive. \n\nI understand that it was the fault of my friends and I for not reporting the black stains when we first arrived in the room, but I'm really disappointed that I have tried multiple times (at least nine different times) to get in touch with the hotel managers, who have yet to answer my phone calls or return any of my messages about this.

Service was GREAT, our view of the East River, Roosevelt Island & beyond to Queens, both day & night was just GORGEOUS (check out my pics), but the cutback on hotel amenities lessened our enjoyment. Coffee shop closed, gym closed, no \"Welcome to the Hilton\" greeting, & our room seemed kind of bare because of the lack of typical items that make a room feel warmer & welcoming. Again, I assume because of COVID compliance. On the other hand, as mentioned, we were thrilled with our view, with the size of the room (although the sectional couch took up a disproportionate amount of space), the service, when needed (there were no coffee cups in the room upon our arrival & barely-hot water in the shower-both issues fixed immediately, & we were allowed to check in early & check out late without typically extra fees-why does a 4-star hotel charge extra for early check-in anyway & why does a 4-star hotel charge $15 for internet use??) & we found the east side, midtown location to be ideal.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"NONE"}

I was in midtown manhattan for a wedding and stayed at the Millennium Hilton  New York on 1 UN plaza. This is the worse hotel I ever stayed at and an embarrassment to the Hilton brand. They have rude staff, no house keeping unless you request it the night before (which wasn't told to us) , no trolleys to move your stuff, broken fixtures, no ice or vending machines, what seemed to be blood splatters on the ceiling and oh yeah BED BUGS. On our first night we woke up to bed bugs in our bed and bite marks all over us. I recorded the bug showed the staff and asked for my room to be changed. Management was unapologetic and called our new room to say that no bugs were found after their \"technician\" checked. Another party that was in town for the wedding had the same issue on a different floor and was told the same thing. This hotel refuses to deal with the bed bug problem and instead acts as if it doesn't exist. On top of this issue the sprinkler went off in my room for over 5 minutes soaking everything and everyone inside with dirty black water. There was no smoke or fire. I stood in the hallway for over 30 minutes soaking wet begging for a new room before anyone from management approached me, and when I was approached it was just to place blame on us. No hospitality no assistance. At this point i am now moving my soak and wet items to a third room ( not to mention the hotel has no bell boys or bell trolleys to move your items around) and received no help from the staff. Not only did all my clothes for the wedding end up being damaged but also I the \"Best Man\" ended up missing the wedding due to this traumatic experience. We decided we had enough and went back home instead of staying another night and risking being bit by bed bugs or worse bringing them back into our home. I spoke to management (Maria) on the way out, they showed no remorse was unapologetic and offered no compensation in any way. When I asked about filing a claim for my damaged items she said to call Monday and also reinstated that there was no bed bugs even though I showed them the video and bites. Maria the manager also refused to come out and speak to the other party that was bit by bed bugs. She locked the door and wouldn't come out.

I would stay somewhere else.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-10-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"So many things went wrong with my stay and as a gold member of hilton, I was not happy. The front desk lady was rude when I checked in and was dismissive when I asked about upgrades and basically just kept saying nothing was available and I was telling her that I was a gold member and I was hoping to get a better room than just an upgrade to a king size room. She said nothing was available.  I checked in on a Monday during a pandemic and nothing was available for real?  She kept cutting me off without listening to me and just wanted me to get out of her hair.  The gym was closed even though I stayed at a Marriott the night before and their gym was open so it couldn't be a law mandating all hotels to shut down their gyms. No breakfast and no water either for members and she did not care to tell me this.  The check in person did not even tell me about the WiFi situation, just handed me the keys and sent me off. \n\nI came to the room and so many things were wrong. There were stains on the pillows which I had to ask them to change. Coffee and wine stains all over the walls.  Old furniture in the room and smelly closet and bathroom.  There was a huge hole in the wall above the TV. I had to take out my own trash, change my towels, and the pillow cases myself. The towels were razor thin and not fitting for a 4 star hotel and I was disgusted using them.  They were worse than rags and I didn't know why they would have such poor quality towels. \n\nAnother incident was that a person with the same last name checked in on the second night and they gave that person my room key to my room. Luckily I came back to the hotel at the exact same time this person rode up the elevators with me and then I watched him using the room key that the front desk gave him to open my room.  If I did not come back at the right time, this person would have had access to my belongings in my room, what a scary thought especially during Covid.  This happened on the second night and I was so disturbed by this because how could they check a person into a room that has been checked in already the day before. Aren't there safeguards to prevent that ? Like oh it seems like you already checked in yesterday so how could the front desk person check this stranger to my same room on the second day of my 3-day stay. \nokay fine, mistaken identity but don't you have to check IDs before checking a guest in ? He couldn't have the exact same name.  It was a very jarring experience.  Another frustrating thing was that I called the front desk about this incident then she said that I must contact security, then I talked to security and then security told me that I must talk to the front desk and the manager. So this was their fault and then I had to be on hold and be passed around like a hockey puck waiting for a response on what happened.  The manager did change the keys and explained to me the next day what happened that they accidentally checked another guest into my room but honestly how could that happen and the staff at this hotel seemed like they did not care about their jobs.  \n\nLastly, I asked for a two pm check out and around 1130 am on the checkout day, someone from housekeeping called me and asked me , \"hey when are u checking out?\" I said I'm checking out at 2 and they said oh not 1 pm? So that is when you are checking out? I said yes 2 pm , I'm checking out at 2 pm. \n\nThe conversation was unpleasant as if they didn't want me to stay there for long and wanted me to leave earlier than 2 pm but couldn't say that so she was passive agressive on the phone.  Honestly all my years of staying at hotels, I have never had housekeeping calling me to double check on my checkout time when they could just look in the system. This was a terrible experience and I felt like they just dropped the ball on so many levels and then when push comes to shove , they were like sorry, pandemic time so yeah sorry. It is really unacceptable and I would not stay here ever again or other hilton hotels if this is how they treat customers. I had a great experience even during the pandemic for two nights at a Marriott.  They really need to retrain their staff and make sure their rooms are clean.","travelDate":"2020-10","tripType":"NONE"}

This stay topped it off. I spent Saturday night in a King Corner Room booked through Expedia for a weekend getaway in NYC - I got the wheelchair friendly room as I wanted a corner room and the price was better than a regular King room. Well, you get what you pay for. The actual room did NOT look like the one pictured on Expedia, but that was just the beginning of a nightmarish stay. \n\nMy husband and I checked in around 9 PM and we booked an overnight stay for the sole purpose of catching a good night's sleep before exploring the city some more the next day. We were assigned room 3038 and as soon as we got off the elevator on the 30th floor, I knew it wasn't going to be a restful night as we could hear music blaring down the hallway from one of the rooms. Turns out, that room was right next to ours. The hotel thought it was a good idea to book 3 ladies and us in connecting rooms with very little soundproofing between the rooms. Their loud music was frequently interjected with talking\/shrieking\/cackling making it impossible to relax, let alone sleep, and I called the front desk three times - the last call was around 12:30 AM. To their credit, security did make two trips to the room next door to reason with the ladies, but we couldn't fall asleep till much later because of all the commotion. So much for getting a good night's sleep. I asked front desk if we could be moved to a different room and they said they were full for the night. I found that a little hard to believe given the size of the hotel, but I guess you should have very low expectations with the Hilton brand unless you're a Honors gold or diamond member.\n\nAs for the room itself - an utter disappointment. Furniture and light were old and stained. Hair from previous occupant was next to the soap holder in the shower and the tissue box on the sink. One of the blackout curtains was missing from the windows facing the foot of the bed (if the hotel manager is reading this - check room 3038 and you'll know what I'm talking about). The water container in the coffee maker looked like it hadn't been washed in a while and had a slimy residue at the bottom (unfortunately only discovered that after I had already consumed my morning cup -  ugh!). Carpets were old and stained. And no, there was no button to automatically close the window blinds in my room. Obviously, we were assigned an older room with very little maintenance and upkeep. Other hotels have made obvious efforts to sanitize rooms more thoroughly but this was clearly missing from this hotel.\n\nIn short, after disappointing experiences at Hilton hotels in LA and Bali, this stay has me convinced that I'll never book  a Hilton Hotels & Resorts room again.","travelDate":"2020-10","tripType":"NONE"}

This hotel was the worst hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed at. I was in town for my friends engagement. Based off the reviews we\u2019d thought this hotel would be a great choice, but I was wrong! On the website it states that they offer valet parking for $78.00, when we arrived at the hotel there was no valet parking. I had to park my own car a few blocks away and walk back. My mother is disabled and the hotel states that the hotel would be able to accommodate at least with a wheelchair. The hotel gave me such a hard time about getting a wheel chair for a disabled veteran. They told me that the wheel chairs were locked up and could not be used. I had to argue the concierge down about getting a wheelchair. They wouldn\u2019t even allow us to use a cart. How the hell was I supposed to carry a person and the luggage. It was terrible the customer service is completely horrible! I understand that we are dealing with covid and so forth but this hotel just needs to be closed during these times if they are unable to accommodate something as simple as a wheelchair! The hotel room was disgusting the carpets are dirty, disgusting the odor in the room was terrible and made my mother sick. Lastly once I parked the car in the parking garage the garage tried to charge me another $78.00. The parking garage attendant told me to walk back to the hotel in the pouring rain to talk to the concierge, and to have them call the garage in order to get my additional monies back.

To make it worse, the tub is VERY slippery. Myself and fiance both slipped the first day, which wasn't cool. I did inform the staff 3 times about changing my room for a regular king bed room. Front desk sent someone with a tub mat (which let me know this is something that is complained about quite frequently) and it was sort of helpful, but didn't help with how awkward the whole thing was.

We ordered room service one evening which was delicious. There was a small coffee maker in the room, and also a coffee shop in the lobby. The lobby is very bright and sparkly.

There was no porter, which you would expect at a large hotel but there was a nice security guard who welcomed us with his dog. No front of house staff, so myself and our wife has no interaction with anyone other then the security guard. I wish this continued.....\n\nWe went to reception to check in like 2 excited kids (first time in NY) and greeted the reception staff how we would have been expected to be greeted- the response was a lift of a head (from her phone) and a short, not warm- \u201cchecking in\u201d. We let that pass, however not a good impression.\n\nMe and my wife are celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary- so as you cheekily do, requested a new view, maybe an upgrade if possible- the response was \u201cyour room is allocated, and i can do anything about this\u201d- which completely contradicts the other reviews from guests who have? Anyway, again let this slide.\n\nWe went down a dark dingy corridor behind reception and got in our lift to our room. We got to our room and it wasnt too bad, the view not great but nice and it seemed cleaned. How wrong were we? Pubic hair in the sink, really dirty cups in the room, no water (would have been a nice touch)- i could continue but i hope you all get my drift! At this point we thought dont worry, have a shower and crack on- the pressure in the shower is basically non existent- quiet possibly the worst shower we have ever used!!! \n\nDetermined to not let this get in the way off us enjoying the rest off our holiday, we got ready and went to reception to see if they had any tips on the whats around, how to get around town etc. We avoided the extremely rude receptionist we spoke to initially (who was still on her phone) and went to speak the other one. Her response \u201cGoogle it\u201d- i mean for god sakes! Just appalling service.\n\nWe are not 2 nights into a 4 night stay and honestly the staff have been nothing but rude, unfriendly and unhelpful. Note to management- if you want to represent your brand in the right way, employ individuals that have the same care for customers and experience as you advertise. The guys you have working here honestly dont!!\n\nNever will i return to this hotel and as someone who regularly uses the Hilton group i will be avoiding you going forwards.\n\nWe are still staying in the hotel for another couple of nights so if anything does happen to change my opinion i will happily consider updating this review but as it stands- STAY AWAY! Actually considering checking in somewhere else if this gets worse and will be complaining to British Airways also (we booked a package deal through them!)- sometimes money just is not everything!\n\nPositive: bed is comfy but hotel needs an update in general!\n\nAwful awful experience from a very unhappy customers!","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

(even though her colleagues granted us 13h check out).  \nAnother issue was the noise the hotel personal would do in the morning between 7-9AM when joking and running in the hallway. \non the check out, they simply show you a copy of the bill that has been depited to your credit card without checking. It obviously charged us a breakfast that was initially complementary. and last but not least, the executive lounge is only open in the morning with a miserable breakfast buffet and broken instant coffee machine. the regular buffet in the restaurant is decent but the blue berries were moisy and I found some hairs in my omlette..... all these things are just not acceptable for a hilton in that category. \nTo leave on a positive note, if you come to work for the UN\/meet someone around the UN building, the location is perfect.

My overall impression is that the hotel is very nice, however, they are very bad at communicating.\n\nOn my last visit, I was given a different room to the one I had paid for. Originally I booked the 2 Story Loft Suite with King bed. I emailed the Diamond desk to request that I was allocated the exact room booked as it was a surprise for my partner. They forwarded my request to the hotel directly. After a few weeks with no reply, I then emailed the hotel directly to see if they can could confirm my request, again no reply.\n\nI hoped that if they didn't reply they would at least have actioned my request. Upon arriving at the hotel check-in desk very little was said and I assumed that I would be allocated the correct room, I couldn't ask if this was going to be the case as it would have ruined my partners surprise. Unfortunately, when getting to the room it wasn't as expected. There were two bedrooms and only one floor, the original room was supposed to be 1000 sq ft but the allocated room was 100 sq ft smaller with additional wasted space in the form of the second bedroom.\n\nAfter returning home I complained that the room wasn't what it should have been and I got the reply 'the hotel has contacted you directly'. They hadn't, I even included in my complaint that the hotel has never contacted me. Customer services went quiet once more, even after chasing multiple times.\n\nFinally, I raised the issue on Twitter where customer services were very quick to assist and informed me that the 'hotel is having renovations at the moment' and this is why I was not allocated the correct room. It would have been nice to inform me of this before we arrived or even at the front desk.\n\nFrom experience Hilton Hotels that are having renovations clearly state this on the hotel website, so I am unsure if this was true or if I have been fobbed off. I was given 30k points, but this really doesn't cover the fact that I wasn't allocated the room I booked and the Executive lounge was closed the entire stay after breakfast, supposedly for the same reason of being renovated. Though there were no signs of any work being done.\n\nI would consider another Hilton on my next return to New York.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

You could see that there were no maintenance works in the evening going on and as the Lounge was open some hours later for breakfast, the reason for the shut down was more likely to be missing staff or other things. \n\nIn addition there was no compensation. In other Hilton hotels - in case there is no availability for an upgrade or something's going wrong - you get a voucher for the bar. If we were told before we'd have the option to book another Hilton hotel in NYC.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Blocks away from Grand Central and the Empire State Building. Amazing views of the City and River. The hotel room was clean and looked nice. However the overall hotel experience was lacking...\nUpon check in they way over authorized and charged my card. When my friend and I got up to the front desk, we told them we wanted to equally split Room and Tax (RT) between us and they ended up authorizing my card for the full amount of RT and also charging me for my half of RT as well. So almost all my funds I've saved up for my vacation got tied up into the hotel. When I looked at my bank account and noticed this, I had to speak with multiple people just to get this problem resolved. I didn't get my authorization back until days later. Causing the first few days of my vacation very stressful..  I also had an issue with the TV in my room. When we turned it on the screen would be bright and normal then almost immediately start to dim and turn so dark it was hard to see what was happening on screen. I had to call for an engineer multiple times to get this problem resolved. They canceled my consecutive reservation and when I got the email and when I went to speak with them about this, they blamed me for the canceled reservation and  I had to book my room again at a higher rate than what I originally had for my consecutive stay... they also tried to charge me $89 for breakfast even though I'm a gold member. That did get resolved quickly though, which I'm grateful for. \n\nOverall the hotel is beautiful and in a great location, but the experience was greatly lacking.

A younger man started by taking our claim ticket (we had dropped off bags earlier), and then looking rather irritated, began looking for the bags. Once he found them he asked, as if hoping the answer would be \"no,\"  \"do you need help taking your bags up?\" When we replied that we did, he asked the older gentleman behind the desk who was engrossed with something on his phone, \"is it your turn or mine?\" Discovering it was his turn he again looked none to pleased and said he would meet us at our room. We had booked what we thought would be a nice suite that turned out to have two floors. When the bellman arrived we asked him to bring the bags to the entry on the second floor, 29M. He then got lost apparently going to the 30th floor and knocking there for a while before calling our room and sorting out there was a sub-floor.\n\nThe room itself was in questionable repair for a \"suite.\" Cracked paint everywhere, the showerhead in the main floor bathroom was only partially functioning, a very loud fan in the main floor bathroom never shutoff, reader lamps on the master bed were burned out, the TVs were laughably small, and the master bedroom TV seemed to be stuck noticeably dimmer than the living room TV.\n\nOn departure, we once again had the \"pleasure\" of engaging with the bell staff. The morning bellman asked me to help him roll the bags into the small storage room. Once we were alone he started by bad-mouthing his colleague, insinuating he was an idiot for not having a pen. Then, to make sure our interaction was sufficiently awkward, he informed me that, \"we don't charge for storing bags but we do appreciate tips.\" I let him know I didn't have any cash on me and would try to bring some back later when I picked up the bags. To which he replied, rather disappointedly, that he might not be around later to receive the tip.\n\nThe bellman on duty when we departed, a tall, grey-haired gentleman, was probably the only good interaction we had. He was cheerful and seemed happy to help. He let us know the yellow cabs would probably be a little cheaper than Uber for our trip to JFK and secured us one large enough to fit our 4 bags.\n\nOverall the majority of staff interactions were terrible.

This was already prior arranged and assigned and i could not wait to get there!\n\nThe check in process was easy, quick, friendly, hassle free basically. The room they assigned me was given to me, as well as instructions for the lounge access. \n\nEntering the room had a wow factor. My previous view from the stay at the Hilton Times Square took some beating!! But this beat it!! My corner room was clean, cosy, new, and the views were amazing (see pictures). We had an issue with the TV (it simply didn\u2019t work), being in NYC i didn\u2019t even get round to reporting it until day 3, however when i did it was promptly fixed by maintenance.\n\nThe lounge was just perfect for us at Breakfast, nothing to heavy but enough to set us up for day, free coffee and soft drinks all day long, and they did let me stock up our mini fridge with waters and diet coke (without taking advantage too much!). Again the view from the lounge while having breakfast was great, however the windows need to cleaned.\n\nHaving been to NYC 3 times, the location of this hotel was perfect. Its within 15-20mins walking to main attractions, 5 mins walk to Grand Central that takes you anywhere you want to go in the city, we enjoyed the experience of the Subway. There is also a lot of little bars, shops and food places locally (not silly money like times square either) if you like a Guinness like we do :-) we found a great Irish bar called Mondoons.\n\nWe had a fantastic time at Millennium Hilton Plaza, and i would like to thank you personally for making our NYC trip so amazing. When (not if) we return to New York there is only one place i will be staying at - The Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza.\n\nThank you Again!!!\nJez & Chelsi\n\n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When checking in, my rate was incorrect. The front desk rep suggested that is was due to the taxes not being included in my online booking, I showed her that the taxes were included. She asked me to email my booking confirmation to the manager so that this could be corrected (this is the second time at a Hilton this has happened to me, so check your rates). She wouldn\u2019t provide her name though, so I could jot down who I spoke to. Not a huge deal, the manager corrected this immediately, I just thought it was odd. The room didn\u2019t contain the half bath, but instead it had a kitchenette area that contained a sink, coffee maker and what appeared to be an old in room bar\/snack refrigerator. Only the bottom shelf could be used for keeping anything cool since it was designed to sell snacks and not as a true refrigerator. Upon inquiring about the room, the manager comped me 7k points since there wasn\u2019t a room that had both a sofa bed and half bath. The complimentary breakfast was pretty good, no complaints there. I had to dispute 1 days charge for breakfast since I was charged for 1 breakfast, that was corrected at checkout. The complimentary Skyline bar, charged me $8.00 for the \u201ccomplimentary\u201d drink which was a lukewarm beer. I emailed the hotel and it was corrected.

We saw Empire State Bldg's light show, Chrysler etc skyscrapers in their nighttime glory, sunrise, sunset and the spectacular working East River with water taxis, barges, tugboats, yachts etc. Beds were heavenly. Coffee\/tea in room much appreciated.\n\nPatrick went all out as our \"Hilton UN Christmas coordinator\" to reassure a young boy that his liaison at the North Pole had already contacted him to get the room numbers of kids staying at the Hilton instead of at home. The milk and cookies on arrival and his  explanatory note sealed the deal. Santa arrived and all was wonderful.\n\nThe hotel is very well located between 1st and 2nd Avenues, with buses and subways within a few blocks that can take you anywhere. Ambassador Grill in the lobby and Skyline lounge made everything easier. The UN\/Grand Central neighborhood is not the jumping hot spot of the Village or SoHo. It's more reserved and business oriented. \n\nWe had a worried child, harried parents and one member recovering from major surgery. The hotel staff from friendly security dogs to bellmen, to front desk (Patrick, Brendan, Nina, Teicia et al) to housekeeping--especially lovely Victoria--to restaurant and lounge staff treated us all as VIPs. Almost without exception, they all went above and beyond. Not only to give expected good service, but to reassure and understand the intangible needs of our family in somewhat stressful circumstances.\n\nThis is Hilton service at its very best. Any minor deficiencies or older property issues mentioned in some (unnecessarily churlish) reviews pale in importance when the STAFF treats their GUESTS as our family was. \n\nWe were so comfortable, the grandparents stayed over in the suite another day to decompress and enjoy those WINDOWS.\n\nWe will definitely recommend the Millennium Hilton UN to visiting friends and family.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I hadn\u2019t stayed in the city previously, just visited twice. The experience in the hotel was excellent from start to finish. Staff are efficient and friendly, rooms are spacious and cleaned daily. We had a beautiful view of the river and the room is large enough to feel like you have your own space. \nWe did not use most of the hotel facilities as we were out from early morning until late evening daily. The hotel is 5-10 minutes from Grand Central Station. In this respect you are connected to the entire city and beyond. We purchased a metro card for 1 week - costing $33. Walking to Times Square takes 20-25 mins - it does not feel tedious as you take in the sights and lights of the city. Most of our holiday was very active, we walked mainly everywhere or to the subway when tired. \nI would stay here again and recommend anyone to stay. A shuttle can be organised to the airport as well as private transport. The only negative of the stay was check out. Check out is at 11am (extremely early), when your flight home is 8pm, late check out can be purchased but we declined this. Overall I was very pleased with the hotel!

The corner rooms have huge ceiling-to-floor windows, giving guests unblocked views of UN and the East River.  One of the windows can be opened a little bit that you can take nice pictures of peaceful sunrise and sleepless skyscrapers in NY.\n\nSky Lounge is also a great place to view the city.  The top of the Chrysler building is just in front of you.  It feels that you can touch it.\n\nThe interior design of the hotel is very artistic.  At the lobby, look up to enjoy the skylight and the unique design that leads your eye to the sky.  Throughout the lobby and restaurants, the hotel is very creative to use glass to extend views, to present extraordinary views from good views.\n\nHotel service teams are great, warm and helpful.  They are not the typical New Yorkers, who might be too efficient to care.  Guests staying here are also nice to each other by greeting strangers a good morning.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize that how close it is to Central Park, Grand Station, the fifth Ave, Chrysler Building and of course UN.  It is within walking distance!\n\nThe very rare thing is there are security dogs in the hotel.  At first I thought they are just hotel doggy hosts like some of the Canadian hotels do.  In fact, they are security dogs to keep dangerous luggages away from the hotel. There are a dozen of them.  All of them are Labradors.  They are very playful, letting you pad them and rubbing their bellies. \n\nThere is a sky lounge on the 30th Floor exclusively for HH Diamond members only.  It is a great and quite place to have breakfast, which starts at 6:30 pm.  The Ambassador\u2019s Grill also offers free breakfast to Diamond members.   Between these two places for breakfast, the basic food items are the same, but Ambassador\u2019s Grill offers made to order omelets and more hot items.  So if you want to eat a big breakfast, join the crowd at Ambassador\u2019s Grill.  If you prefer a more exclusive service and a nice view, go up to the Lounge.  The gentleman managing the Lounge is amazing, cheerful.\n\nThe Sky Lounge also has food, snacks, drinks in the evening.\n\nMy only wish is the windows of the Sky Lounge were cleaner so that nice, sharp pictures of the city can be taken.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was traveling alone with my 13yr old son. Also I would rate this as a great location, not far from Grand Central station where you can easily catch the subway. Its also within easy walking distance to the Rockefeller centre and central park. I would say its a quieter location rather than times square and if you walk along you can find cheaper supermarkets and restaurants. \nOk the negatives, its sooooooooo expensive, don\u2019t buy food or drinks here. I bought a cappuccino and it cost over $5 When we arrived it was late and we had been traveling a very long time due to delays, my son was really hungry so we ordered a pizza, it was $29 and was not very nice, I\u2019m sure it was a frozen pizza and not fresh. Be careful of prices because the tax is added on after.\nWhen we arrived the lady on reception was not very friendly at all or welcoming! Basically got handed my room key, asked me to pay $250 and that was it, no information about the hotel or anything, we were the only people checking in at the time so she wasn\u2019t busy. When we got to our room I had to call to ask about wifi etc, no information about the hotel facilities in the room either. The cleaning isn\u2019t up to scratch, the dust in our room was awful! I went to make a coffee and both the cups were dirty. Felt like it needed a really good hoover and clean. When I bought my one cappuccino there was a lovely friendly member of staff on in the cafe in the lobby, unfortunately I didn\u2019t catch his name. \nIf I was to go to New York again I probably wouldn\u2019t go back here in all honesty even though the location and view was pretty good.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The fitness center isn\u2019t huge for the size of the hotel but has great equipment. \n\nThe lounge in the west tower has the best views in the city\u2014you can see all of Midtown\/downtown, LIC, UN, bridges, etc. The food is extremely boring but the staff is so, so friendly and attentive. \n\nThe lobby can be understaffed at peak times. Staff is somewhat friendly but not particularly warm. Elevators can be very messed up (I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve stepped into an elevator on the west side to have the doors close and the elevator not move). \n\nOverall this hotel is solid and not a bad choice.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":209382,"title":"Customer Satisfaction Still Counts!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-10-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"My wife and I recently stayed at the Millennium Hilton UN Plaza while in New York for business.  The hotel confirmed beforehand that they offered valet parking services for a reasonable fixed daily rate; more on this later in the review.  While we were acknowledged by reception as being Diamond Members, it was only after requested that a room upgrade was offered.  Unfortunately, this lack of acknowledging Diamond program benefits at check-in seems to be fast becoming the norm across Hilton properties.\n\nThe upgraded higher floor room was incredible.  In comparison to the size of a typical New York City hotel room, this was more than double the space.  The floor to ceiling window view from the room of the nearby Chrysler Building was amazing and truly memorable.  Furnishings in the room were modern and comfortable, and the touchscreen electronic lighting and air conditioner controls were quite impressive.  One strange note to the room was that it had absolutely no overhead or lamp lighting near the oversized desk.  The bathroom was huge with a fully tiled and glass walk-in shower.\n\nOur visit to the Executive Lounge was truly uninspiring.  The lounge was open for evening refreshments and lite food for another 30 minutes when we got there on a Saturday night only to be greeted with a warning of the closing time.  A minimal selection of alcoholic beverages is available for a charge, with only soda, coffee and tea being complimentary.  The food selection was truly spartan as most of the serving trays were empty.  We questioned the lounge staff and were once again reminded that they were closing in 25 minutes.  I am sorry but you are either open or closed and we were left to feel like we were imposing on the staff.  After a few crackers and celery sticks, we left in disgust.\n\nThe next morning was a spectacular contrast to the night before.  Breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was top shelf.  The many selections on the buffet were fresh and well-stocked.  My wife ordered an egg white vegetable omelette that looked and tasted outstanding.  The service was extremely professional and our table was very well attended to.\n\nNow getting back to the valet parking.  At checkout, I was informed that there would be an extra $24 fee for oversized vehicle added to my bill.  I informed the front desk that my vehicle was actually a 'compact SUV' and in no way oversized.  After some back and forth between the front desk, the third party parking service and myself, they removed the charge and printed my receipt.\n\nThe following day my credit card was alerted to a single charge of $24 from Hilton which initiated over a week and a half of back and forth attempts at resolution with the local Hilton staff who offered no more than an acknowledgement of the charge.\n\nNow for the happy ending.  I was finally able to get my issue escalated beyond the billing department and spoke with Patrick the Reservations Manage at Millenium Hilton UN.  Patrick immediately acknowledged my Diamond loyalty to Hilton and listened to the series of events leading to the call.  Patrick saw my experience as a training opportunity for some of the local staff and offered to refund the parking charges in full.  Customer satisfaction is sometimes a difficult task and you never get a second chance at a first impression.  Patrick was instrumental in turning my experience at Millenium Hilton UN from a strong negative to a positive.  I am now looking forward to staying at the Millenium Hilton UN on my next trip to the city.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location of the Milennium Hilton we found to be very nice! It's in close proximity to Fifth Avenue, Central Park and Grand Central Station. Also, it's just a 10 minute walk to the closest boat stop on East River (East 34th Street); this is practical if you want to go to Brooklyn or Williamsburg. \n\nWe got a room on the 32nd floor. (It seems like the hotel floors start from floor 28). This means that you - most likely - will get a room with a view. We had a room facing south, with a magnificent view of East River and Manhattan. From my bed, I had a clear view of Empire State Building, which is quite a sight during night! \n\nThe beds were very good, as were the bathroom facilities. Housekeeping always left our room tidy and well cleaned. \n\nOn the minus side:\nReception staff treated us a bit indifferent on arrival. So, the welcome was not the best. (However, this seems to be the norm at many hotels in New York City.)\n\nThe playlist at the hotel bar downstairs was totally out of place, taken into consideration that you are at a hotel next to the UN. The music made us feel that we were at a bad 90s party. \n\nOn the plus side: \n-good beds\n-marvellous views!\n-nice bathroom \n-good housekeeping!\n-very welcoming and friendly bell boys!

My almost entirely positive feelings towards this establishment were confirmed on my most recent stay.  Due to circumstances beyond my control I had to postpone by two days my arrival in the city.  Even though the booking was non-refundable and I was quite happy to accept this, the reservations manager at the hotel changed my booking and informed me that as the hotel was fully booked they could benefit from having a room freed up for two nights and so they would waive the charge for the two nights in question.  I mention this example because the Hilton would have been justified to have charged me but staff used their discretion to treat me as a guest not just a source of revenue.  Obviously, in the long run satisfied and happy customers will bring far more benefit for the hotel than the two nights they could have charged.

I can\u2019t complaint about that, since staff assigned me a room as soon as they could. \nLocation I really nice. Rooms have amazing view over UN building, the Hudson river and the midtown as well.\nRooms are mid-size, quite well furnished with a king size bed and a chaise-longue to enjoy the view from the window. \nSaid that, windows are quite narrow and I did expect something more. \nBathroom is pretty small, very average, nothing to talk about. Toiletries from Evelyne and Crab. \n\nService is pretty anonymous. Staff does its job without any interest in you. None of them is really dedicated to you, neither tries to anticipate your needs. \nAs a gold member, while I got the benefits related to the tier, no one really recognized my status or made me feel really welcome. \nThis is an area where the management should work hard. \n\nClub Lounge is old, and I mean old: it stinks, spaces are narrow and all the things saw better times. Breakfast In the lounge is just sub-par. Nothing you\u2019d fancy of when you think of Hilton. \nBut breakfast in the restaurant (which \u2013 by the way \u2013 costs 10$ for the upgrade as gold member) is not that better: located in the basement, while staff is ok, food selection is quite limited and could be definitely better in terms of quality. \n\nAs a final note, on my folio I discovered I was mistakenly charged 2 times for the breakfast. As none gave me the receipt on check -out (they send it to you via e-mail), when I read it on my mobile I was surprised. I know mistakes may occur, so I promptly email them about the matter. \nLuckily they were more than professional in fixing it. \n\nIt\u2019s a pity, because the hotel is ideally located and has some very good things, but all this made my stay very mediocre and I don\u2019t think I will stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Personally, I was taking the weekend away to celebrate achieving some goals of mine; the Millennium Hilton made this celebration one to remember. Upon arrival which was late in the evening, the front desk agent Adina was very friendly, warm and welcoming to me; she saw that I was waiting in line and even though she must have just begun her shift and was logging in, she called me over to her desk and helped check me in. The overnight front office manager Stanley was also at the desk and greeted me kindly and enthusiastically. Come to find out, the reservations manager Patrick had upgraded my room to the Hemstead Suite - I guess he saw that I listed \u201ccelebration\u201d as the reason for my stay when booking my queen room and really wanted me to have a celebratory experience! The Suite was immaculate and exquisite from the moment I entered the door. Two floors connected by staircase in the room with a gorgeous chandelier, double master baths each with extra large showers, spacious living room area, and the king bed on the room\u2019s second floor with nearly floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking southern Manhattan and the East River, with direct sight of Freedom Tower\/One World Trade. An amenity of wine and a handwritten card from Patrick were waiting for me in the suite wishing me a great celebratory stay; Patrick and his team went above and beyond servicing me as a guest and making sure my time in the city was enjoyable. Access to the lounge was also a part of the surprise upgrade, and I loved all of the options available. I went with the continental breakfast, but even so, the selection of muffins, pastries, beverages and other items was wide ranging and nothing was lacking. Eating breakfast in the lounge with a great view down 44th Street has its perks too.\n\nAgain, this hotel is really where you want to stay if you have any reason to be in NYC. It\u2019s within the UN complex, and with that brings a level of stature and presence that conveys \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m important, and I\u2019m going to have a great stay\u201d. Transit access is easy - just a 10 minute walk straight down 44th Street leads you directly to Grand Central Terminal, complete with subway access to virtually all points around the city (4\/5\/6 give you Bronx and Brooklyn via the east side of Manhattan; 7 gives you crosstown Manhattan via the newest hotspot Hudson Yards and Queens; the S shuttle takes you to Times Square where you\u2019ll find the 1\/2\/3 with access to Bronx and Brooklyn via the west side of Manhattan, the N\/Q\/R\/W with access to Brooklyn and Coney Island via Barclays Center and Queens, and the A\/C\/E with access to JFK on the A, downtown\/World Trade Center on the E, Central Park on the C, and Penn Station on the 1\/2\/3\/A\/C\/E). You can get EVERYWHERE. I never felt isolated by staying at the Hilton; rather, I felt the whole city was my playground to explore.\n\nThe entire team of staff does an amazing job of making sure each guest is well taken care of. Each day of my stay, my room was serviced promptly by housekeeping with keen attention to detail. While I relaxed in the lounge, staff were always eager to make sure I was enjoying my time and always offered assistance should I need anything. Even as I was checking out and leaving the hotel, Suzy at the front desk was warm and attentive, making sure that every part of my stay had gone smoothly and that all of the billing was correct. My experience with the Millennium Hilton left me feeling refreshed and glad I had chosen to stay there for my celebration. If you are looking for wonderful comfort, with wonderful amenities and a wonderful, top-notch staff while staying in NYC, you are guaranteed to find all of that here at the Millennium Hilton One UN Plaza.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

One night we were not feeling well so decided to eat there and brought a 2 1\/2 year-old, very well behaved child with us. The waiter acted mad and rude from the get go. We had to argue with him to get silverware and a plate for the child! There is no kids menu, and he didn\u2019t seem to want to help with smaller portions or any adjustments for children\u2019s food, despite being the only hotel in the restaurant. That was fine, we were willing to pay full price if we could have just got some service! The waiter never refilled our glasses or came back and asked how our food tasted, among other things. My order was not correct, but I had to eat it anyway as I could not get anyone\u2019s attention, let alone our waiter. The restaurant was not busy that night. When I complained at the end of the meal, (which was the only time our waiter came back) about the service and the food all he said was \u201cI\u2019ll give you a free dessert\u201c. The next day I went to the front desk and spoke to the very personable and nice front desk manager. He took notes and told me he would have the restaurant manager call when he came into work that day or when we got home the next day. I never got a phone call but I did get the full price of the meal refunded. That was nice but it tells me that they\u2019re not very interested in the way the restaurant is run.\n\nThis Hilton has an absolutely wonderful breakfast buffet with more items than I\u2019ve ever seen! Everything is fresh and delicious and the service is amazing. We ate there every morning and no one at breakfast seemed to have a problem with the 2 1\/2-year-old! She got silverware, drink and a chair without having to ask. Everything was refilled promptly and dirty dishes were taken away quickly. The difference between the morning service in the evening service was unbelievable!\n\nWe had a beautiful room and very good maid service, but the rooms had a smell that seem to be coming from the carpet. It smelled to us like urine. I called the front desk once about it and talk to the maid another time but nothing seemed to be done.  The rooms need a maintenance person to go and check them, as there are nice amenities but a lot of them don\u2019t work. Also seems as though the upholstery and the carpet need to be cleaned.

From the doorman to the front desk, they were all pleasant and wonderful. From the first time I called this hotel to research info about the area, I spoke with Linda and she was awesome. Speaking with Linda was like talking to an old, dear friend. Because we share the same birthday and she wanted our first time in New York to be special, Linda had champagne, chocolate cake, and strawberries delivered to our room. How sweet is this? Thank you so much, Linda, and the wonderful staff at the Millennium UN. Your service was seamless and exceptional! \n\nThat being said, I'm very disappointed to share my family's experience in regards to the accommodations at this hotel. With such a great staff there, I believe this location is in need of a renovation. The building has somewhat of a musty odor, along with worn and stained carpet throughout. The lobby furniture appears to be dated and stained as well. \n\nOur room was on the 28th floor. While we appreciated the view of New York, we were not fond of the spiral staircase, as the staircase was rather tall and steep. The carpet on the stairs was not clean as well as areas in the room. Having teenagers who hated the stairs because of how steep they were can be very telling. One of my daughters said the stairs gave her anxiety and this was her least favorite hotel to stay at. And while the kids had their own bathroom downstairs, they had to climb the stairs each night to shower (there isn't a shower downstairs). \n\nIn addition, rooms at this hotel are not equipped with a microwave and they do not have ice machines like traditional hotels. Also, there is no option to receive a complimentary breakfast like other traditional hotels. However, we knew about the breakfast option going in. \n\nLastly, (IF) I could rate the customer service at this hotel alone, I'd give this location a 5-star rating. However, by a family vote, I'm giving this Hilton property a 3-star rating (and not because of the staff!)\n\nHilton, you can do better than this!\n\n","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

What a nice greeting. I felt the front desk were very entitled about their mediocre hotel. \n\nAfter waiting for 15minutes she notioned that I was allowed to come. Before this, we had booked and paid for the hotel in Finland, my manager sent several emails and driver license pictures to the front desk person for me to avoid having to use my own credit card upon arrival. Despite this, the front desk refused to give us our room so we were forced to pay for the entire stay with my credit card (including a 200dollar deposit).\n\nWhat followed was about 20 emails, 4 phone calls from Finland to confirm the old credit card, about 4 front desk workers, and none of them helped me get my charge back. Finally I contacted my bank, and they said I would get it back the next day, after showing the receipt for the hotel. This was 2 weeks later.\n\nWe stayed in a suite around on the 31st floor and the view was great. However, the room was fully carpeted and very dusty. The furnitures were worn out. There was a noodle (piece of food) in the minifridge, which I complained about twice and it never disappeared. There was splashes of liquid stains on the walls, and they didnt disappear even though I complained about the dirtiness of the suite. I took a piece of paper and water and tested if they can come off, which was possible, so it was just due to laziness. The bed was fine and I slept ok.\n\nThe suite did not have a very large room height. It felt like around 6'6feet or 2 meters in many places, a bit claustrophobic even for a 5'8 foot\/170cm guy.\n\nThe bathroom shower handle was loose. \n\nThe windows were semi-dirty, which ruined the view a bit, which was otherwise nice.\n\nThe coffee machine had an absolute gross, green water holder, which I complained about, but which never got cleaned. And so I never used the coffee machine.\n\nThe breakfast was good buffet-style, and the chef made good omelettes.\n\nThe hotel had 3 elevators from which 2 broke down, and it took us a 10minute wait to get downstairs to eat break fast.\n\nThe TV was sufficient, but they had an automatic log-out every day at 11am. And when it was thundering outside we were watching a movie from netflix and it got shut and logged out at 11, and we had to input our login credentials again to continue, which was frustrating. ( I know, 1st world problems, but not expected from a 400dollar\/night room).\n\nI do not recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was the first time that the breakfast servers remembered us! Most places don't seem to.  The room had everything we needed. I loved the espresso machine! The only reason I am giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is the fridge in the room is a little pointless. It could at least have been a dorm fridge. You can't even fit a bottle of water in it. So that is a much needed upgrade. If you don't plan on using the fridge then it is really worth the 5 stars. The only other complaint I had, not against the hotel, was that it was further than I thought to Times Square. It made for a very long walk when we wanted to see that area of the city. But excellent hotel and we would stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":209382,"title":"Most expensive and worst value across 50+ countries visted","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I traveled 23 hours to be at a United Nations workshop. With only 10 hours from touchdown at JFK to my event, I opted to stay at the UN Plaza for proximity and to optimize on sleep. I hoped to use the morning for extra sleep or breakfast, rather than on flagging a cab during NYC rush hour and commuting from another hotel. After a long journey, all I wanted at midnight was a hot shower. But no, that simple requirement was too much. I filled the (small) bath but got tepid water. Shivering, I tried the shower. No better. I let the water run, I tried running the tap in the sink too (hoping to kickstart heating somewhere, while feeling guilty about wasting water!). Nothing. \n\nWhen I called housekeeping, I got the operator who said he\u2019d send someone \u201cto show me how to use the shower\u201d!! That was patronising and deflected fault from them to me, which is ridiculous. As a middle-aged frequent traveler, I\u2019ve handled hotels and showers across 50+ countries: \u201cit\u2019s not me it\u2019s you\u201d. Someone checked it out, agreed it was cold, thought it might have been wrongly installed, yet said there was nothing he could do and would let the front desk know. They called and sent someone else, who tried his best and managed to reset it by 10 degrees, to a temperature still less than the minimum temperature required by NY regulations for landlords. All this while, I\u2019d been browsing for other hotel rooms because in addition to this issue, the room was freezing even after switching off the air conditioning. When all you want is a hot shower and sleep, and can\u2019t get that at a hotel you paid almost $500 for, you\u2019d even consider moving at 1am after a very long journey! \n\nI was too exhausted, and finally opted to settle for the slight improvement rather than wander NY at that hour. Having wasted so much time, I thought I\u2019d order breakfast through room service as a \u201cwake up call\u201d to ensure I didn\u2019t miss my meeting. Guess what? No room service menu in the room, no breakfast card to hang on the door. I tried calling room service, no response to several calls. I then tried checking the TV for a menu, and they only had options for dinner (5-11pm) and nothing else. No late night service, no breakfast options. \n\nThis is a hotel whose main reason for existence is the United Nations next door, with diplomats and international travelers arriving and departing round the clock, and they don\u2019t cater outside of 5-11pm?? This makes no sense. \n\nOther issues: there was a cavity where a fridge\/mini bar should been, and a \u201cpotential door\u201d propped up behind it (images attached). There\u2019s tea\/coffee sachets, no kettle, no spoons, no creamers or sugar, no bottles of water. No bathrobe, no slippers, no stationery, nothing. This is the room time forgot. \n\nThere\u2019s a sign on the 37th floor saying it\u2019s under renovation. You only see this when you exit the elevator. Nothing in the lobby, no mention at check in, and certainly nothing on the website, let alone a reasonable price to compensate. Yet, so many of these issues stem from neglect rather than a botched\/incomplete renovation effort.\n\nI\u2019ve never stayed in a hotel this expensive, yet got so little. I\u2019ve stayed at Travelodges and cheap motels during sold out conferences like SXSW and got better amenities and service. This is a cruel, cruel joke. Except it isn\u2019t remotely funny. \n\nI will never use the Hilton again, anywhere, on principle. This is unacceptable. I need to stay another night after all, but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t extend till I got here. I\u2019ll give my business to absolutely anywhere rather than this. I now have 5 hours before my UN meeting, so that\u2019s shot too. Thanks, Hilton!! You can have 2* for the location that I needed, but it was a fail on every other count.

I stayed at this hotel because I had a transit in NYC in the middle of a long trip. I hate to say this but the bellmen at this Millennium Hilton hotel were all worst than any of the Uber or cab drivers that helped me along the way. The front desk was also no better.\n\nI arrived late afternoon, and after I got off my Uber, a bellman saw me but pretended he didn't see me. I had to wave at him to get him to help me with my suitcases. I had four suitcases. He asked me \"you need help?\" Well yes obviously! He then walked to me very slowly with his cart with an unhappy face. Afterwards, he slammed my suitcases onto the cart, with wheels down. He pushed the cart into the lobby (literally 10m distance). While I was checking in, he interrupted me and told me his job is done, that someone else would help me take everything to my room if I needed it. I thanked him, but he didn't walk away. He continued standing there. At that moment, the front desk associate helping me check him said to me, \"Robert has helped you, and his job is only until here\". I nodded and turned my head to thank the bellman again. He still wouldn't leave. The front desk associate then said, \"he helped you, so...\" This was when I realized that both of them were expecting me to tip the bellman. I really did not want to tip anything because I didn't like the service, but I was obligated to do so! I took out a $1 note and gave it to him, and he frowned and still didn't move. I ignored him completely from then on and he finally left. \n\nI asked the front desk if any upgrades were available as I am a Hilton Honors Gold member, he just shucked his head without even checking the screen. I am very sure there are still available rooms for an upgrade because I booked my room on the day (only a couple hours before my arrival) and I saw all sorts of rooms still available for booking. Even if everything is really sold out, I would expect the associate to look into possibilities first before relentlessly turning me down. Furthermore, I did call the hotel right after I made the booking (so around midday) to ask if they could upgrade me, and the person who answered the phone said they will, and that I will get it during check in. The person I spoke to on the line was also a lot more polite than the person helping me at the front desk. \n\nThe next morning as I was leaving, I brought all four pieces of luggage down to the ground level. This hotel has two wings and the wing I stayed at is a short distance away from the concierge. Three bellmen walked past me and no one offered to help me with my luggages. \n\nAll in all, I couldn't understand why all the staff working at this hotel seemed very unhappy. Every Uber driver that I came across during the trip would voluntarily leave their car seats to help me load and unload luggages, with a big smile on their faces. I felt very sad that I booked a Hilton property and felt less welcomed by the staff there than the Uber drivers. The front desk even pressured me to tip when he clearly did not know what kind of service I had experienced. \n\nI will not stay at this hotel again, and I do not recommend anyone who cares about service and hospitality to come here.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

I was assigned an upgraded room which was CLEARLY available on both the Hilton website and the hotel\u2019s own website for he length of my stay.  I confirmed my upgraded room on my way from the airport to the hotel.  However, when I got to the hotel, the front desk took one look at my reservation, refused to check me into the hotel room I had been assigned and confirmed to and MOVED me to a different room!!!  This was AFTER I showed her my app indicating the room I had already been assigned and confirmed to!  She proceeded to tell me the hotel was booked, and when I went online to show her that Tre hotel was still showing rooms, including the one that she moved me out of, she proceeded to tell me that the website was wrong!!  She then put me in a different room that was not really nice at all, and continued to insist that the hotel was completely sold out even when there were rooms available to book online, including the room she had removed me from!  To appease me, she gave me coupons for a free hot breakfast, which was completely pathetic!!  The fruits were not fresh and the offerings were very limited.  I will NEVER stay here again!!  I should have known this the last time I stayed here and was treated rudely at the Executive Lounge that this was NOT the Hilton to stay at!!  In fact, I\u2019ve already cancelled my next reservation and opted to stay someplace else!!  Totally not worth the money or the aggravation.

While the views are still spectacular, the property itself has not aged very well.  \n\nThe now historic glass and mirror lobby, seemingly untouched, still gives the impression that you have entered a 1980's discotheque (not that this is necessarily a bad thing!).  It was disappointing to see lackadaisical maintenance in public areas, e.g., lobby and hallway carpeting was extensively stained. The narrow room corridors, festooned in charcoal gray wallpaper, had a somewhat foreboding, prison-like quality.  And, room service trays, carts and random glasses and dishes scattered throughout the hallways did not help.\n \nMy tastefully renovated room on the 32nd floor, decent size by New York standards, was clean but very basic and mostly unremarkable.  It took quite awhile for the room to cool down. The bed was comfortable yet unadorned. The tight bathroom was not at all luxurious with a compact toilet and bathtub.  The illuminated makeup mirror was a nice touch.\n\nService was merely adequate. I arrived before I could check-in so I left my small suitcase with the bellman.  When I tried to retrieve it later, the bell staff was first unable to find it.  Needless to say, I began to panic.  They even asked me to help them look for it in the storage closet!  Finally, after several nerve wracking minutes, it was located behind several other bags.\n\nThe Millennium Hilton One UN Plaza has a wonderful location that's far enough from the midtown hustle and bustle but still close enough to everything.  If you can snag a good room rate and your expectations are modest, this hotel is a good value.  And, of course, you are guaranteed to get those great views.  Now, if they'd only clean those windows once in a while, this might become a great hotel again.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Millennium Hilton is perfectly placed at the quiet end of 44th street and 1st Avenue. We booked a very competitive deal with BA, which is much much cheaper than booking flights and hotel separately. \n\nI had phoned the hotel a couple of days ahead to specifically ask for rooms with a view over Manhattan. Unfortunately, upon our arrival late on Sunday we were given two rooms with a side view of the East River (which was lovely), but also a full view of a building site! \n\nDisappointed, as we were visiting New York on a special occasion (our silver wedding anniversary), I went back to the lobby and spoke to Taricia (I think that was her name). She was super helpful and got us a much larger room in the front building facing the New York skyline. What a treat!\n\nAll in all everyone of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. \n\nHere are a few tips to make your stay even better:\n\nGet a Hilton\u2019s Honours membership (very easy to set up via your mobile). You get lots of perks, like free WiFi in your room, late check out (1pm) etc. \n\nThe breakfast in the hotel is too expensive (even for New York standards). However, they have a coffee shop downstairs in the lobby which is open from six every morning and offers delicious pastries and coffee to take away (or to our room to have breakfast in bed every morning!) Marvellous! \n\nIf you fancy a more substantial breakfast or want to experience a proper New York Diner, visit John\u2019s Diner on the corner of 44th street and 2nd Ave. Their special omelette with home fried potatoes or their granola with Greek Yoghurt and fresh fruit are amazing!\n\nIf you have a late flight home like us, don\u2019t bother getting a late checkout, which can set you back $100 to keep your room until 4pm. The reception will store your luggage for you and will give you a key to the restrooms to freshen up or get changed. \n\nWe definitely would stay at the Millennium Hilton One UN Plaza again!

No problems!\n\nThe Room\nThe room was comfortable with plenty of sunlight coming in. We got a room that has the empire state building, it was pretty nice. Standard TV and the bed was firm. \n\nThe Bathroom\nThe bathroom got a bathtub and it was clean. Big mirrors and overall it was a nice clean bathroom. \n\nRestaurant\/Entertainment\nThere is a cafe on site where you can get coffee and light pastries.  \n\nHotel Service\/Amenities\nStaff was not friendly at all. We are staying at Hilton and more than ever it was right next to the UN Plaza, you would expect the staff was friendly but oh boy that was not the case. \n\nWifi was not free in the room but free in public areas. Although, if you are a Hilton member you can get free wifi in the room. This is where the staff was unfriendly, so I called the concierge and told him that I am a member and I would like to know how to get the free wifi service in room. The concierge was talking really fast but I understand him perfectly. I was telling him that it didn't work and then he asked for my membership number and etc, in the end, he was just telling me to call the customer service to rectify my account (ridiculous just for wifi) \n\nThen my husband called again and the same thing happened to him. He was not happy so he went down instead to prove that we are members and this should be an easy process, if not what's the point of being a member? So the staff was telling him reasons why and then we said what's the point of being a member if your system doesn't recognize our membership? then the guy was maybe fed up and he just gave the code but he didn't look happy. I found this very unprofessional. I used to work in the hotel industry and I do deal with annoying customers but If I was in the staff shoes that were not acceptable both the concierge and whoever my husband spoke to. Furthermore, we were there during Christmas week, where tourist are everywhere and the staff were unfriendly at all. \n\nOverall\nIt was a great location to stay at if you're looking to stay away from the crowd and had a business trip to the UN. It is a 10-minute walk to Grand Central, 2 long blocks from the hotel. Duane Reade was nearby. Overall, I enjoyed the room but not the staff.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we arrived we were greeted by one of the bellmen and he was very nice.

To my surprise they did have a room ready and we were able to go directly upstairs. We were on the 28th floor and the view was absolutely amazing. I had requested an upgrade for a 2 bedroom but it wasn\u2019t available. That didn\u2019t even matter because our king suite was just like a 2 bedroom in my eyes. The living room had a pullout sofa bed, an awesome view for the kids and they even had their own bathroom and closet space. There was also a mini fridge in there. The master bed room had a good view as well with our own bathroom and closet. Omg and the heated toilet seats...never thought I would say this but they were so much fun lol! Clearly we don\u2019t get out much because it was our first time seeing heated toilet seats with all the other great features and even had a remote for it. \n\nI believe the next day was when I got a knock at the door and someone brought up a tray with a small bottle of wine, some macaroons, and a card that said happy birthday.

Never felt unsafe walking anywhere in Manhattan, although we were back before midnight. 55min walk to the Met Museum alongside Central Park gives an idea of scale to first time visitors.  If using Yellow Cabs, do not expect any conversation with drivers, the attitude is generally that they are doing you a favour, you will also need the street number and nearest avenue number\/name where you want to be dropped. Beds were large and very comfortable, housekeeping efficient. Decent, but very expensive breakfast available, we just grabbed a coffee and pastry from the good coffee bar in the (small) lounge most days, cost around 10USD. You might want to find another place to stock up with water or juice as the pricing was comical, ( 4USD for small water).

Arrived at the hotel tired and looking forward to getting into the suite which we had had confirmation of an upgrade to.  However, when we checked into our room it was a king room.  We needed a room with two beds or a separate sleeping \/ living area.  I went downstairs to reception to get this sorted.  Not particularly friendly reception staff.  However, I then met Patrick who had dealt with my reservation.  He showed me the original \"double double\" room I had booked and clearly it did not have the view or the amenities of the room we had been allocated with its view of the Chrysler Building or Empire State Building.  The suite was not available, however we had a lovely room with a pull out sofa which housekeeping made up for us each day.  We were also given complimentary access to the Executive Lounge where we had continental breakfast and drinks \/ canapes in the evening.  This was ideal for us as it was next door to our room and we could go in for a drink or a coffee at any time during the day.  \n\nPOSITIVES: Super bathroom (no bathtub, but walk in shower); Illly coffeemaker - but take your own milk or cream and store in the fridge; spotlessly clean; staff in the lounge area and housekeeping were friendly and helpful; location - very quiet even being next to lifts we heard no noise from outside or in the hotel.\n\nNEGATIVES: The hotel is a bit dated with very strange decor colours, unless brown\/grey\/orange is your thing.  This is NOT a new hotel and maybe some upgrading is due again.\n\nOn balance, I would stay here again as the positives definitely outweighed any negatives.  Star of the show was Patrick Goad who arranged for fizz and desserts to be sent to the room on our first evening as a welcome to my daughter for her special birthday.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":209382,"title":"Quite expensive but not quite up to expectation","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-04-14","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"For a recent weekend trip in March I wanted to give us a special treat and booked a double-floor suite (in doing so I was really guided by the online foto of the hotels own website next to the `offer` of 350$ per night.\nArriving at 12:30 pm we were informed that the room is \"not yet ready\" and we should try again at 14:00. \nWe walked the nighbourhod (UN; 10 mins walk to Grand Central terminal etc) amd returned at 14:00  -  to be told that check-in time for this hotel is 16:00. We changed our day-plan (and finally checked in late afternoon). Watch-out: the official check-ou time of this hotel is 11:00 am!\nWe were quite surprised that we got a junior suite upon check-in  -  nothing of that two-floor room with its nice warm colours and the view I had booked. That room was `not available` but this one was presented as an \"equivalent\"  -  it did have a separate sitting room and a `kitchenette` built into a wardrobe. Unfortunately it didn't have the view I was hoping for  -  the view from the bedroom was straight against the fa\u00e7ade of the hotel`s other wing (\"UN DC 1\") . Now, from THAT one there IS a view of the UN, its gardens, the East River and Queens as you can see from the hotel`s gym which is in the UN DC1 wing. When you book and want a view, ask for the UN 1 wing.\nThe mentioned `gym`: friends of mine who stayed here before told me ahead that their nice pool (with a view!) was closed for good, so I went for the gym. There is no other connection between the wings than through the (dark) lobby, which can be a bit of a nuisance but `ok`, except that when you return you do so pitch-wet and sweaty after a full work-out, as that gym has no showers - whatsoever. Incredible! What is also quite surprising: the gym has just 7 cardio-equipments (3 treadmills, 2 bikes and 2 elliptical walkers) and a few  weightlifting items) and is rater small for a hotel this huge of a size, but it has a stunning 149 lockers in the male changing room only. I suppose another 150-or-so in the female locker as well, and I wonder why so many as all cardio-equipments were already full on a Saturday morning at 09:00. My `take` is that the gym is open to hotel-external non-guests as well, and I don't dare to imagine a busy Thursday after-office time in-there.\nSkip the breakfast in the windowless \"Ambassador Grill\" - not worth the price (of 39++). In summary: it is kind-of `ok-ish`  if you don't expect too much, but you should ask for a definite view in the DC one-building ahead of time.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Sadly this was not to be the case. \n\nWe arrived at the hotel at around 5 pm, no wait to be checked in. We were checked in by Avery, and what a \"jolly\" fellow he was (please note the sarcasm) Don't think I've ever met a more surly front of house individual in my life. I asked if he had my HH details on screen before I could finish my sentence he responds \"yes but you won't get your points as you booked through a third party\". this was delivered with an almost \"ha ha\" type attitude all without looking up from his screen. \"ok, can you see the details of the complaint I had with Hilton\" again curtly response of \"no sorry\". In addition to his poor manner, he looked like he had slept in his coat! \n\nOff we went to our room and both agreed this was not a great start, we walked in and low and behold, the upgraded room had not been given, we were in a dark room with a tiny window on the 37th floor. I called down to the desk, and got Avery, \"Hi there you've just checked us in and we were due to have an upgrade\" I said quite politely. \"no, your booking was for a  double room\" I was told. I then explained the email chain with Stanley, his response, \"well I've not got any corner rooms\" sigh. \"ok I'll come down and we can discuss\" I said, now getting a bit annoyed with his attitude. Surprise, surprise he had vanished. I explained the issue to another member of the front of house team who was perfectly pleasant, saw the issue and rectified quickly and professionally, and magically had a corner room that Avery had said you didn't have, so not only was he rude, but he lied to us. I wanted to raise this, but my partner just wanted to enjoy our trip. \n\nThe hotel lobby is quite small and feels like a train station waiting room, there is a small coffee shop serving snacks and drinks. We felt as we were not wearing suits we really didn't matter to the staff, we both agreed that we have never felt so invisible in a hotel in our lives. \n\nBreakfast is $42.50 each, so we eat out every day. \n\nOur corner room was spacious with a great TV and amazing views, the water was not always as hot as it could be.

We wrote to the hotel asking for a fridge to be placed in our room for our daughters medication and told them how excited we were to be coming to New York staying with them for my husbands 50th birthday. We had not had a holiday for 8 years. \n\nNot only did we get a prompt response agreeing to our request for a fridge in our room but we were also upgraded to the Suite. When we arrived the hotel was stunning the people were warm and friendly. The hotel security makes you feel extremely safe. The staff did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable, giving us the best advice on travelling\/sight seeing around New York. \n\nWhen we walked through the door to our suite, we were blown away by the most beautiful views we have ever seen, simply took our breath away, so much so that we were never in any rush to leave the suite. We had 2 beautiful bedrooms with en-suite, a big lounge where one side overlooked the river and the other Manhattan with incredible views including the Empire State and Chrysler building. The hotel is immaculate, we could not find a single fault. \n\nCredit to Monique the hotel manager who ensures extremely high standards in every way, delivered with warm, friendly helpfulness. \n\nA personal thank you also to Monique for making our stay the most memorable and talked about for years to come. \n\nA personal thank you to Robert also who went that extra mile, our daughter Ellamay still speaks of you now.

We were booked for a two-night getaway to celebrate a special occasion. Unfortunately, mother nature decided to strike and give us lots of snow, which ended up with cancelled flights and our plans for a weekend away were also cancelled.\n\nWe originally did an advanced purchase for our room (And yes, we understand the refund policy that was stated). My first interaction with the front desk manager was at 6pm, I explained everything that happened and asked if she could move my reservation that was for 3\/2\/19 to 3\/16\/19. She quickly brushed my concerns away but said, \"You are all set. I will change your reservation. You will receive an email with your new reservation. We look forward to seeing you.\" I was ecstatic. After waiting two hours and still no email, I decided to call and check on my reservation. The rep. told me my reservation was still for 3\/2\/19. I called the hotel directly and again was told my reservation was 3\/2\/19 and had not been changed. This is when everything went downhill.\n\nI spoke to the front desk manager again around 9pm and asked what had happened. She gave me the typical advanced booking policy and told me there was nothing that could be done. She then refused to talk to me and only wanted to speak to \u201cThe one that holds the Hilton Gold Status\u201d. I have worked in hospitality for over ten years, majored in hospitality, and know exactly how stressing the job could be. I simply asked why she could not call me to let me know my reservation could not be changed. Common courtesy would have just been to call me and let me know that due to my advanced booking, I would have to speak to Hilton advanced booking personally. What a disaster it would have been had I checked into the hotel on 3\/16 with no real reservation. Her attitude and her unwillingness to be understanding and help really put into perspective that the hotel does not care about their customers. It is a shame that we do not want to stay at this beautiful Hilton hotel anymore.\n\nEven after all of that, my representative from advanced bookings understood that my safety was much more important than a hotel booking. Thankfully he was able to refund my room, after only he was given a hard time by the front desk manager as well.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel elevator and lobby have nothing to do with the office people. The hotel has a lounge for those who are entitled to use it under their Hilton honors standing, or who pay for access. The neighborhood is completely United Nations.\n\nThe plusses: very kind staff (everybody), perfectly clean, beautiful views of the East River or parts of the city, depending on where your room is. The lounge was very nice, and I had no problem with the $5 charge for a glass of wine or a beer at happy hour. But I'm not sure how I would feel about paying extra for the lounge.\n\nThe minuses: the decor feels dated, at least in the room we were given and in the common areas. The neighborhood is really the UN, and has an office-area feel. There's not a lot right there that would interest a tourist. If you like to walk, it is walkable enough to Grand Central Station and many other things noted in other reviews, and that is more valuable in the warmer weather and when the daylight hours are longer. Grand Central is a transit hub, with subways to anywhere in the city.\n\nWould I go back? Yes, if it met our needs again. I like it a lot, but if 5 is \"excellent\" and 4 is \"very good\", it's probably fairer to give it 4. It really deserves four and a half, especially if you get a good price by NYC standards.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had breakfast both morning in the lounge which had a large selection of breads, cereals, fruit, eggs, etc and good coffee.  There were a number of restaurants and subway stations within a relatively short walk.  We had a late lunch at one of them since we were going to Yankee Stadium the second night.  The subway ride to the Bronx was a little long but we didn't have to change trains.

Otro problema tuvo que ver con la fianza que se quedan a la llegada (para 3 d\u00edas, unos 600\u20ac que te devuelven a los 8 d\u00edas aprox.). Nos parece una barbaridad de dinero que te cogen s\u00ed o s\u00ed, adem\u00e1s del cobro que luego realizan (para que nos entendamos, te cobran una fianza + la tarifa cuando te vas, en vez de descontar de lo que ya te han cobrado).\n\nEl gimnasio est\u00e1 bien, tiene unas vistas impresionantes, y la pista de tenis arriba, bien tambi\u00e9n.... si claro, nos hubieran explicado todo lo que tiene el hotel a nuestra llegada; cosa que no hicieron.

My Boyfriend and I found ourselves sitting by the window for ages at night just staring out at the city, I took so many pictures of all the different angles.

I'd like to give a special mention to the toilet in our room, i've never had a heated toilet seat but i'm also unsure now how i've lived without one... :-)\n\nThe only big disappointment for me is the lack of WiFi unless you're a Hilton member, I like to catch up with my family in the evening whilst i'm away, I'm already paying for the pleasure of staying in your hotel, I really don't feel I should be paying for WiFi too?

This happened and I was left with a $350.00 surcharge, as the booking was later in the day confirmed, but by this time I was in the suite that I neither needed nor wanted and anyway, there weren't any rooms left or so I was told.

Check in was efficient and friendly. Asked for a room in the West tower and was given a corner room as requested with dual aspect views on the top floor. The room was perfect for our stay and had everything we needed. We chose this hotel for its location, which is a quieter location but it was still easy to access anywhere we needed to go. We could walk to midtown and central park within half an hour and if We were headed downtown to wall street, Brooklyn bridge etc we caught the East river ferry which we found very easy and reliable to use and that was our main mode of transport after walking. The checkout was simple and it was easy to show our bags as we made the most of our last day. The lien on the card went back on within an hour of us checking out which is the quickest it's ever been done before. \nDo not hesitate to book this hotel you will not be disappointed. Ignore the bad reviews about hilton honour points etc it's a fantastic hotel and I hope to return one day.

The room standards were very good with exceptional views. We were on the 37th floor. Rooms were very clean, air conditioned and have a fridge. There are coffee making facilities, free Wi-Fi and a safe. The bathrooms were large and modern. The waiting on staff were really lovely and attentive. On checkout day we were allowed to use our rooms late at no extra charge as our flight was early evening. When we left the porter looked after our cases and called a taxi for us and helped with our luggage.\n All in all we had a wonderful stay. We would definitely return.

The hotel was OK.  I have stayed there on more than one occasion. However on my short 2 night stay this time I had some issues.  The first night I went to the Executive Lounge for light snacks.  However, the lounge was closed due to a private event.  As a concession, the hotel offered 50% off on a meal at the hotel restaurant.  Not complimentary like the Executive lounge would have been but I did get a decent meal--but ended up spending $40 nonetheless (I ended up double tipping--as I did not notice that a gratuity was auto-added to the bill for a single diner (me) until after I paid and got back to the room).  That was bothersome, but shortly afterwards the fire alarm sounded.  False alarm in the end--but about 10 minutes of a lot of noise and drama wondering whether I was going to have to walk down 29 floors.  The 2nd night I was awoke by knocking at the room door--2x.  The first time, the security guard (or one who said he was) wanted to know if everything was alright.  Asked about whether water was leaking in the room.  I said all was ok.  Another 30 minutes later another knock on door.  This time three people were at the door.  Same thing, same message.  I relented opened the door after getting decently dressed.  Short inspection, but inconvenient and I remained wide awake after that.  Checking out early AM I was not asked about how I liked my stay by the front desk staff and I did not get a chance to followup with hotel management.  Not sure I will return after a bad two night stay.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

She said the hotel was fully booked, which was clearly a lie, since there were still plenty rooms available at booking.com. What she didn\u2018t tell us, is that she only gave us a queen bed room, which we first saw when arriving at the room. So we tried to change to the correct room category, that we already paid for, but the rude lady at the front desk refused to help us again. Since I was too tired after a long-haul flight to discuss this with the manager, we had to sleep the first night in an uncomfortable queen bed, which is way too small for two people! View is awful, since we are just looking onto another building, that is right in front of the window. Customer service at this hotel is simply non-existent and I wouldn\u2018t recommend this to anyone! There are road-side motels, that have a better Standard than this Hilton... Beware! If you have the Hilton Honors Gold Status: That won\u2018t get you anywhere in this hotel. No late check-out, no upgrades, nothing. The only positive thing was the friendly staff at the executive lounge and the cleaning staff also did a good job, although the furniture is rather worn out.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had already checked-in online and selected a room and it was ready for me despite my early arrival. Maybe I'm not New York City material, but being asked to put an extra $100 deposit on hold from my credit card took me aback a bit. Not my first surprise while in the city though. The room wasn't far from the elevators and had a very nice view from the window onto the East River and directly down onto the United Nations. The room I was in was larger than most, mainly due to its location - it was about 1.5x larger than what you would expect as you can likely see in the pictures I'm posting with the review. The long window along the wall gave a great view during the day and even moreso at night. Things I liked about the room included the flooring in the bathroom which was never cold even when I had the A\/C turned up. Things I didn't like? The Illy Coffee-Espresso maker in the room. It was terrible and wouldn't make a complete Espresso or coffee unless you played with it and pushed the buttons repeatedly. Filling it with water was a bit tricky as well as the reservoir didn't want to come off and I worried I was going to break it (and buy it!). The plug in the bathroom sink wouldn't come completely up either, so I could only run water there slowly as the sink wouldn't drain as fast as water filled it. It took quite a while for the water to turn hot enough to shave as well, especially at a trickle. Speaking of hot water - there are very nice bags of tea available to you on the coffee bar, but no way to boil water for them...unless you want to trickle hot water in the sink for about 20 minutes or so first. The TV was first rate and I liked that extra streaming channels like Crackle were included; Netflix is also there but you have to sign into your own personal account to view anything. The bed was comfortable, no complaints there and ultimately that is the point of a hotel - to have somewhere to sleep. The alarm clock provided was an iHome brand oriented towards Apple products, but if you have a USB cord you can connect other devices to it as well. With the location of the hotel and the branding, I expected much more than I found here. It was still a comfortable stay and if in town again for business in the same area I would book again.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room is corner which makes the views are perfect. Room very well cleaned. The air conditioning was quite loud. Staff at the hotel were not very interested in the guests. Breakfast in the executive louge very poor: bagels, 2 pastas, jams and two cheeses, fruit, yogurt. Little space. It happened that there was no place to sit. Even worse is the executive lounge during happy hours. Every day for a week were served wings and carrots, peppers, cucumbers and all that. There was beer and wine but extra pay: 5 $ for a beer and 5 $ for a glass of wine. This is the first time I have experienced such a situation, I have stayed in many Hilton hotels around the world and you do not have to pay for beer and wine anywhere. Very weak. Great location, very good rooms, poor service and a terrible executive lounge.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We came to NYC for our anniversary as well as my wife's birthday.\n\nFor our stay we were located in room 3131 which was a gorgeous and spacious two bedroom suite.  I would have to say that one of the many highlight of this particular suite was the sweeping views of not only the East River but Midtown Manhattan as well, especially the One World Trade Center and Chrysler\/Empire State buildings. Besides the vies, this suite was extremely spacious and main living area consisted of a large circular dining table, built-in coffee\/mini bar area, a desk and chair, lounging chair with ottoman, wall-mounted t.v., two chaise loungers a coffee table and more. The main living area also had a wall mounted digital\/touchscreen unit which controlled not only the HVAC for the main area and bedroom but as well as the lighting for the whole well which was divided into zones. \n\nThe master bedroom was equally large and had flanking wardrobes at the entrance with ample pull-out shelving and hangers, a king-size bed as well as a bench at the foot of the bed.  The views from the bedroom were just as great as the main living area.  The master ensuite was luxurious to say the least - large soaker tub and glass enclosed walk-in shower with multiple shower heads including a rain shower head.  The ensuite also had a dressing\/makeup table and of course a single vanity.  \n\nThe Skyline Club which was located on the 30th floor, was where continental breakfast and evening snacks were served.  Breakfast consisted of cubed cheese, bagels and breads, an assortment of pastries, yogurt, cereal, granola, jams\/spreads, juice, coffee, milk and fruit.  In the evening, the lounge offered small bites such as cheese, bread, pretzels, veggies and dips and some warm items such as chicken wings and crispy deep friend beans.  The selection of food items change daily so the aforementioned menu was what we encountered during our 3 night stay.  The lounge also offered wine and beer for an additional cost.  The other option for breakfast would be to visit the Ambassador Grill restaurant on the main lobby level of the hotel. This is a full buffet spread with just about anything you can imagine.  There is a fee for this breakfast option. Similarly, there is also Un Cafe on the main level as well which serves snacks, sandwiches and salads as well as crafted coffee beverages.\n\nLocation wise, you're Midtown East area and within walking distance to Central Park, Empire and Chrysler Building, Times Square as well as the iconic Grand Central Terminal.  \n\nAll in all, we loved our stay at the Millennium Hilton New York One UN Plaza and will definitely stay again when we return.  The staff we had contact with was amazing - super friendly, always willing to help out and above all, very hospitable.  The suite was probably one of the nicest rooms I've ever come across at a Hilton property and I'd highly recommend it if you are looking for a bit (lot) of extra space.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff could not have been nicer. Sylvia on the front desk is a treat. She had our daughter smiling ear to ear. The room was incredible with towering views of Manhattan- the Chrysler and Empire State in full view. The room was large and really well appointed with a neat coffee dock and basin which made it convenient for cleaning the babies bottle. The bathroom was really modern and with a great shower. The doormen were courteous and when we got in the elevator the maintenance man was really nice too. Highly recommend this place!!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The Staff at the front desk was excellent and incredibly helpful.  We were able to check into our room early because they had one ready, but they were also willing to have our luggage held and delivered to our room if we had needed it.  Unfortunately, we had less than stellar service from others.  We called three mornings to have ice delivered to the room (they do not have self-service ice machines or vending machines available).  We only got the ice one morning in a reasonable time.  One morning it had not come after 45 minutes and I called to cancel because we were leaving.  The other morning is took nearly as long, but I had learned my lesson and called really early.  \n\nTHe location is definitely great for the UN or business travel.  It is also great if a view is what you are looking for while in your room.  It was our first trip to New York, so we knew we wanted a nice room with a view.  We got a corner room and out one window we could see the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building.  Out the other window was the River and grounds of the UN.  Definitely no complaints about the view.  It was a bit of a trek to the nearest subway, basically you had to go to Grand Central Terminal to get anywhere.  There was another line a little north, but no matter what it was a half mile or more walk.\n\nThe room was comfortably sized and in good shape.  The bathroom was very nice.  The main issue we had was rowdy neighbors.  You could hear every word they said and especially when they had been drinking a while.  The other main issue was smell from their  cologne made its way into our room and lingered for a while, which was very annoying.\n\nOverall, I think this makes a better business hotel than family or romantic hotel.  The view can be incredible with the right category of room, but that is the main thing going for the hotel.  We will likely choose another property when we return to New York.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was a great experience as the hotel seems really modern in the common areas and the service at the front desk was nice and efficient.\n\nNo problems checking in on a Saturday afternoon.

Minor detail but still kind of important.\n\nThanks to the front office staff for providing adjoining rooms with my travel partners.
