Had a game one night @ MSG so being somewhere between Times Sq & MSG was key. What looked like good sized room in the pictures and mainly positive reviews online led to the decision to stay at this location. The rooms were indeed comfortable, good sized washrooms with plenty of counter space and good quality towels for a Courtyard. For a family travelling with older teenagers, this hotel fit the bill perfectly.  Very short walks to MSG, Times Sq,  the Empire St Bldg and very good transportation options to get around elsewhere. Many good family food options within short distance as well. There are some quirks however to consider - one room had a full sized mini fridge, the other room had one half the size. For those needing only one bed, looking at the room map on the door, some rooms are indeed tight and tiny with not much room. The front deck staff were very friendly, but for Bonvoy Elite members, this hotel \"does not participate in room upgrades\" so there is no possibility of booking a lower floor and switching  to a room with a better view, or a higher floor at check in. Finally, the area in general is very busy from morning to evening, but still better then the heart of Times Sq, so for folks looking for quieter surroundings, they will not find it here. Overall, it was a good family hotel that was close to our needs. If it was just myself on business or a getaway with my spouse only, I would maybe consider other locations due to the no upgrade policy and leaving it to chance of getting stuck with one of the very small  sized rooms.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

It\u2019s about three blocks north of Penn Station, a good location.  It\u2019s not in midtown, but it is in the Fashion District, previously known as the Garment District.\n\nThe hotel is secure.  This is not meant to imply it needs to be secure, but that the staff and design of the hotel has taken this into account.  After you check 8n, your keycard opens the front door.  To enter the hotel otherwise, the front desk staff sees you and opens the sliding glass automatic door.\n\nThe elevators need your keycard to activate the floor buttons.  Obviously your room lock works the same way.  When we returned to the hotel in the evening, the front desk staff asked our room number.  I assume they checked us off a list.  All these are good things.\n\nThe rooms are modern, but small.  The bathroom is modern, but it has a tub and shower curtain, not a walk in shower.  There are plenty of towels.

One morning we came out of the hotel and there was a man sitting in a doorway shooting up. There were times we could not get by on the sidewalks and had to walk in the street because groups of people were camped outside the free clinic next door to the hotel. There are needles and broken crack pipes on the streets. Another night we came home and could hardly get by the sidewalk on 8th Avenue because they were handing out methadone pills. It was here where we witnessed a woman chewing her wrists to the bone. We witnessed drug deal after drug deal go down as we walked home from various outings during the day. I know this is NY.

The 27-story hotel was fully booked (or so I was told during check in). Yet on the evening of 10\/9\/2021, there were ONLY TWO STAFF ON DUTY to handle possible emergencies AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO REACH EITHER STAFF PERSON FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE HOTEL. I leaned of this only because I tried unsuccessfully calling the front desk from my in-room phone and even when I used my cell phone to contact the front desk there was no answer and no ability to leave a message (because the mailbox was full).  When I went down to the lobby I learned from Antonio that he and the housekeeping person were the only two on duty.\n\nThat immediately raised red flags because, in the event of a police, fire or medical emergency, guests would not be able to be assisted by staff. Indeed, guests would have zero way to contact staff to alert them to an emergency and would thus need to fend for themselves. In the rare situation where a full evacuation of the tower might be required, there would be insufficient staff numbers to assist disabled guests. In my opinion, that is not consistent with the duty of care owed by innkeepers. \n\nSignificantly, EVEN MARRIOTT CS COULD NOT REACH ANYONE AT THE HOTEL! Indeed, recognizing the serious safety issues posed by the understaffing, they tried repeatedly during a 37-minute call to reach someone at the at the hotel and were unable to make contact.  \n\nFinally, this safety risk was completely preventable to the extent the general manager, Bob Handler, apparently knew weeks in advance that the hotel would be at or near capacity. The reason I am raising these safety concerns is because nothing like this has never happened during any of my more than 550 previous nights at Bonvoy properties over the course of the past 20 years. That reality highlights just how serious the issue is and why folks considering this hotel should book elsewhere.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I was very pleased with everything. Every staff member we interacted with was polite and kind. The facilities were clean and modern. The room is quite small, but that's to be expected in NYC. The location is excellent. You are within easy walking distance of Times Square and all the Broadway theaters, but it's on a much quieter street than you'd expect. In fact, that was our favorite thing about our stay - the room was quiet! The only time I heard anyone was when we were resting there in the middle of the day, as other guests walked in the hallway to their room. At night, we couldn't hear any other guests or street noise (we were on the 16th floor). You are also within a 5-minute walk of two different train stations, so you can easily access several different lines to get to different parts of the city. The only negative part was one night we went to the dining area and ordered an appetizer to eat before we went to a show. It took 30 minutes from the time we ordered to when they brought it out. We had to ask them to wrap it up and we ate it as we walked to the theater. There was only one woman working the front (taking all orders, making all drinks, delivering all food), so I think they were just short staffed. Definitely not the end of the world, but just be cautious if you have a time crunch to make a show!","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I had a room with a king size bed on the 14th floor.   The hotel is certainly newer and had nice furnishings.  The furnishings were typical of the brand - dark wood desk and nightstands.  The bathroom was spacious for New York City.\n\nMy biggest challenge with the stay was the room configuration.  The king size bed dominated the room, so there was limited space to move around the room.  The closet is tiny and the hanging bar is too low to hang suits or even dress shirts.  There is a safe and refrigerator on the floor that really limits what can be hung.  I had to take the ironing board out of the closet and put it near the bathroom so I could hang my suit and not have it crumple up on the safe.  There was just enough room to hang the suit, I couldn't hang my shirts without them crumpling up on the safe.\n\nThe bathroom is great; however, they don't have a great place to hang shirts etc to steam while taking a shower.

Rooms on NY tend to be tight and nearly claustrophobic.  This was a king room with good space for two people.\n\nThe bathroom had good lighting with ample open storage under the sink, the shower was clean and convenient with good water pressure and there were plenty of fluffy towels and toiletries. \n\nThe room had very effective black-out shades and draperies. The a\/c was also effective and did not disturb our sleep.\n\nHousekeeping did a good job of refreshing the room and replenishing towels and toiletries.\n\nThere is a Starbucks in the lobby and a coffee shop across the street, as well as numerous restaurants, within a 30 second walk from the hotel.\n\nOf the three plays we'd chosen to see, the theater furthest away was a 10 block walk, at 49th and Broadway.\n\nThis hotel was a winner!","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

She made us feel so welcome, like we were coming home.\nThe hotel itself was comfortable and pretty much suited all our needs. Great thing about New York (we were in Midtown Manhattan) is that you can walk everywhere to find what you need. There's just so much available in terms of various ethnic foods and restaurants, entertainment, sightseeing, etc. To save money and the hassle of driving and parking, we walked everywhere and took the convenient Metro subway.

He also helped with a late arriving family member to make sure she could access the room.  Joseph helped us arrange transportation to the airport and made sure everything was set on our days of departure.

I forget how convenient it is to Times Square and Penn Station. I made a last minute reservation to see the Big East Championship game on a Saturday night and I wanted to stay out of Times Square proper. The hotel still looks new. The service is friendly, courteous and immediate. The bed was super comfy and there are full size pillows! The bathroom is small, but adequate. I was on the 26th floor and the door barely clears the bed. This room is very city size, but for 1-2 people you can manage. Room 2605 is a corner room and if you looked left you could see the Empire State Building. I was truly surprised the windows open. This isn\u2019t a room for young children who like to explore.  The desk is small, there is a small wardrobe and the heating\/cooling system is responsive and fairly quiet. Again, I was hardly in the room. Yes, I wanted Villanova to win.  Mission accomplished. \n\nBreakfast is available, but is not complimentary. The Starbucks coffee is actually good! In the evening there is a Happy Hour every night. The bartender couldn\u2019t be nicer and remembered me when I returned after the game. Well, I was practically dancing so it would be hard to miss me. There are 2 TV\u2019s at the bar. \n\nBack to the room. Get rid of bathtubs and give us a great shower. Use the large dispensers of product in the shower and do away with those tiny bottles. Shower gel instead of soap would reduce waste. The room needs more USB outlets and they need to be tested to make sure they work. The room is well lit. \n\nThe area, like almost all of NYC, has a ton of construction going on. I was there on a Saturday night so it wasn\u2019t an issue. I suspect it is much noisier during the week. \n\nMy overall experience here was better than at the PGA Resort the week before. Except for the weather. ","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Even more so when I checked a few weeks before arrival and found the rates for my room had dropped 66% so I rebooked and saved hundreds of dollars.  This was a few days before the Macy's parade, so I guess occupancy was low just before the Thanksgiving rush.  The room and the overall property were very clean and the staff was friendly.  I can't account for the reviews about unfriendly service, but the hotel lobby is always busy and a bit chaotic as people are checking in and out often at the same time.  So  be patient with the young staff.  One day when I came back to my room in mid afternoon my room was not yet made up--not until 4 pm, which was an inconvenience, but that's how it goes sometimes.  Housekeeping did a great job keeping the bathroom sparkling clean.  I am not sure the HVAC was heating the room as high as I had set the thermostat (75 degrees), but the bedding was warm enough so I didn't follow up on it. The location is always super---northbound 8th Ave. buses to 42nd St and the Broadway and Off-Broadway theaters but also an easy walk.  Diners and delicatessens are in the area and Penn Station and the subways are close by as well.  Stay here if you can, but constantly check the rates.  Sometimes booking far in advance can be a good thing, but if it is during a cold period or just before a holiday the rates may go down.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

This was a very nice and clean hotel.  The hotel staff were outstanding!  Everyone was helpful and friendly.  The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be.  \nThe hotel is near Penn Station if you\u2019re using the subway.  I found the subway system very easy to use by accessing maps on my iPhone.  If you take Uber from this hotel, you have to walk to the nearest block and wait for a car.  Each time it showed a different location and make it quite difficult to determine exactly where.  Make sure you contact your Uber driver before he reaches your destination.  \nThe only complaint I had with this hotel was there was no air conditioning\/air in the hallways.  This would not have been much of a problem IF there were more elevators in the hotel and it wasn\u2019t 90 degrees outside.  This hotel has 27 floors and 3 elevators.

Front desk was friendly and efficient in getting us checked in and again we could get in early which was great. Excellent location as a quick walk from penn station and to the theatre district and times square. Only issue this time was not being able to sync up with the cleaning crew to get our room clean. We were not out early and would come back after being out for a few hours. We thought, incorrectly, when we left for awhile and saw the housekeeping cart in our hallway that we would be getting cleaned. That didn't happen either of our two days. Now when we did call they said they would send someone up to clean but we were then relaxing.Never had this issue before but now we've learned to call and tell them you're out and that you prefer cleaning in that time. Best to communicate those desires at this hotel if you'll be in and out as you will probably be missed otherwise. Wifi response was spotty this time. They do have a happy hour and the breakfast\/starbucks in the lobby is a fast and convenient way to grab something.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room had a refrigerator and coffee maker, as well as a desk area.  The bed was incredibly comfortable.  The only down side to this room was that garbage pick up is every night around 11pm, so you would hear the garbage trucks outside (we were on the 2nd floor).  They didn't stay long and most night we weren't trying to sleep yet.  Otherwise, there was not a lot of street noise even though we were facing the street.  There is a nice little cafe on the first floor we visited the first night for happy hour (half price drinks from 4 to 7).  We had an enjoyable time here as well.  It also serves food though we didn't eat here.  The location of this hotel is about a 8-10 minute walk to most of the Broadway theaters and Times Square.

We were greeted at the reception with a welcoming smile and were informed that our room will be ready in 1.5h time as we were early. We went for a walk to Time Sq which was only 15mins away. \nThe room was spacious with two double very comfortable beds and with a very nice and super clean bathroom with a shower. This is what you are looking for a city break .Although I didn't try the gym I had a look around and it was nicely equipped. In addition the hotel has a small cafe\/Bistro that you can have breakfast drinks\/dinner etc. We only had some light breakfast there once and the service was very good.\nAs I said the Hotel is in the perfect location. From there we were in no time to Time Sq,  Empire Sate Building, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Tower   , USS Intrepid at Hudson River, the Sky Line and many more . Also there are tons of restaurants and diners within short distance with a lot of non tourist ones on the 9th and 10th avenues \nWe had a very pleasant and happy stay at the hotel and we definitely have it on top of our list for any future visits. The last day we checked out early and we left our bags to storage so as to enjoy the rest of the day in NYC. Chis was super helpful with that and when we return late in the afternoon he had our taxi and bags sorted for us for the trip back home\nDefinitely a very good experience so would highly recommend it to everybody.

Not too many rooms on each floor. Appears that this room and bathroom have been renovated as all appeared brand new. Very clean and sufficiently spacious with a safe in the room.

Plenty of options for food close by including one of our favorite diners for breakfast - the tick tock diner on 8th ave.

I was welcome by Erick who let me know they were expecting me, thanked me for my mobile check in and offered me a warm caring attitude as I checked in.  He walked me to the elevator and waiting until the elevator came.  He wished me a warm goodnight and asked I call down if I needed anything.  It is so nice to be greeting warmly when you check in to any hotel.  The room, as with most Courtyards, was clean and comfortable.  I was disappointed because the vending machine on the floor was empty of water and when I ordered the large bottle from room service it was a $10.00 +_ bill.  But, I was so thirsty and needed to hydrate so it is the price you pay for convenience.  My stay was great.  Every staff members acknowledged you when they met you in the hallway, elevator, front door.  Everyone was eager to help.

This is the first time I was sorry to have trusted TripAdvisor.\n\nThis is a very average hotel with no special amenities.  In fact, some would say that when you can hear the vacuum toilet flushing every time anyone above or to the side of you flushes their toilet it may be considered below average.  Or perhaps when you can hear other guests using the toilet, that may be in fact quite disgusting.  Well all of the above at this hotel.  \n\nThe room size is small; and they located this elite member right across from the elevator which was horrible because you could hear folks at all times of the night as well as the elevator noises.  No complimentary gold breakfast, or any other special amenity -- well perhaps \"enhanced\" internet, but not really enhanced at all.  \n\nThis is an average hotel.

We thought that maybe the flew in seeing the window was left open by housekeeping probably to air out the room.\n\nThe next morning we returned from sightseeing and noticed that our towels were not replenished nor were our soaps.  I had to call down to the front desk and asked for \"4 sets of towels\"....i figured the word \"sets\" would indicate the entire \"set of towels\"...like washcloths, medium and shower towels...not the case...I only received the big towels...this was also after I waited for almost 45 minutes.  \n\nThat night, I spoke with the concierge since I saw a subway stop on the corner and asked how I would get back to JFK the next morning....his response was classic...gave me a blank stare and said \"I don't know, I've never taken it....\" wow!  \n\nThe front desk person overheard me and asked if I would need a ride to the airport which I stated yes...he had one waiting for me the next morning....\n\nAfter calling and complaining about the bugs, housekeeping service and then the transportation, management apologized and asked that I stay there again, since I was coming back to NY the following weekend, I took them up on their offer.\n\nYou would think that everything I went through, things would've been better...they were going well up until the end.  \n\nAgain, I was greeted with friendly welcome...housekeeping needs some serious work...they left dirty sheets and pillow case on the bench in the room....No bugs this time....but did find smudges all over the mirrors and a half eaten donut in the corner desk...gross!  \n\nMy buddy and I were going to the Presidents Cup, we asked concierge how to get to Pier 79...he told us it was about a 20 minute walk...it's doable...then I looked online and knew that was no way a 20 minute walk....The front desk girl that night suggested we take Uber which we did...it was about a 15 minute drive....again, concierge doesn't know much about the city.\n\nWhen we were leaving the monday morning, I asked the front desk person if they could call us transportation to the airport. Maria stated they don't do that and that if I wanted transportation that I should walk up a few blocks and hail a cab.  Not really wanting to take a cab...hence \"transportation\" and not \"cab\".  I explained that the person there last week arranged it, she replied \" you will need to walk up the street...its against hotel policy.\"  As I left I walked by her and stated \"please tell (hotel manager) thank you for everything, greatly appreciate it...\" i was sincere since they made an attempt to fix the problem. She replied, \"enjoy the walk for your cab\"...I about did a \"about face\" but decided to talk to the manager again.  We did....I won't stay there again....\n\nnow my points are all screwed up because they gave me points for $129\/nt stay...now that's damn cheap for Times Square...seeing that my bill was $439\/nt...not sure how that balances out...maybe its \"new math\"...not sure...but I've invested enough time and energy into this hotel...they obviously can't get it together...they obviously have people not qualified (concierge) that shouldn't be working there either...I'm done....","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I chose the location for convenience, and it was near the Metro, Penn Station and Times Square, although the block itself was very drab. The room was typical for the area -- small, with a no view and minimal charm -- but it was adequate and clean.  Closet was good sized and the bathroom seemed fresh and modern.\n\nMy stay, however, got off to a poor start.  I arrived at 11 am.  The desk clerk (correctly) reminded me that check-in time is 4 pm.  She said to come back at 4.  She noted that I had elite status with Marriott, but said there was no chance before 4 pm. She gave several reasons why no one should expect a room prior to that hour, as it is well-publicized that check in is at 4.\n\nI sat in the \"business center\" (which is also the lobby) and did some work on line and even checked on the availability of other hotels nearby, but none had immediate check in at a reasonable price.  I then went out for a walk, even though it was raining.\n\nI came back at 12:30 to try to change clothes, and, miracle of miracles, my room was ready. The crowd in the lobby had disappeared, so I presume others also got rooms well before 4 pm.  It was totally unnecessary for the unsmiling authoritarian at the desk to insist that no rooms would be available before 4 pm.  All she had to say was, \"I'll see what I can do; check back in an hour or two\" for a loyalty club member.\nFor failure to treat customers with respect and causing unnecessary resentment that the hotel must be poorly managed if no rooms are normally available until 4, an average rating!","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

By sketchy I mean we walked by crack pipes and strung-out folks. If you have kids, just go the other way.\n\nThe worst part was the maid service. And by maid service I don't mean the maids themselves, who were always delightful and did a great job on the rooms. I mean the cheap folks who refuse to hire more of them. There must have been one or two maids for the whole building at the rate the rooms were being attended to.\n\nWe stayed here for a week. One day I really wanted to room made up. By 1:30 pm, no one had come by, so I asked the front desk. They put a \"rush order\" on the room and by 4 pm it still wasn't made up. Most days it would hit 4 pm with no sign of a maid. Sometimes at this point I would just say forget it and put the Do Not Disturb sign out, because I didn't want them barging in at the time of day I like to relax. I would go out ALL DAY and still come back to a messy room. \n\nSome friends of ours flew in at noon, room wasn't ready (that's OK, wasn't time to check in) and luggage collected. But by 7 pm the room was STILL NOT READY. That is just not acceptable. This is a service that is built into the cost of your stay. Hire more maids. Seriously. I've never had this issue at an NYC hotel before. When you go out, the room is made up, and you come back to folded towels, a nice bed, trash emptied, new little bottles of shampoo, etc. Here: Forget it. Weirdest thing is: The hotel was not even full.\n\nI did laundry here -- it's $4\/load. There is no change machine in the laundry room so you'll have to find somewhere to buy quarters. But it is nice that you can do it here.\n\nMore friends of ours were staying across the street at the Hilton Garden Inn. They had free breakfast. We didn't. They had tea and cookies sitting out in the lobby. We didn't. They had a nice rooftop deck. We didn't. They had a nice lounge area that fit a lot of people and big-screen TVs. We didn't.

This trip, we had some issues:\n\n-First, my reservation was NOT supposed to be PREPAID - it specifically stated on my confirmation that it was to be paid at the hotel.  However, when I checked in just before 5:00p 6\/26, the desk clerk advised that they had already \"pre-charged\" my credit card on file.  When I questioned this, he advised that \"they do this when they are sold out\" - but I did not authorize this.  On top of that, he told me that he not only had one reservation for me, but two and \"pre-charged\" my credit card for both?  I double checked with our company travel coordinator and only one reservation was made with only one confirmation.  The desk clerk then advised that they supposedly have refunded both of these reservations charging my card for only the one reservation.  I have not had a chance to check but hope that this was done and am very irritated that the hotel would take these liberties with my credit card especially when I am a Marriott Rewards member, travel extensively for business, and stay exclusively at Marriott properties when I can.\n\n-  The armoire in the room has a built-in  \"night light\" that cannot be turned off without moving the entire unit from the wall and unplugging it.  Suffice it to say, I tried to sleep with this light on but without much success.  I mentioned to the desk clerk at check-out when asked about my stay.\n\n-  Guests need to know that this hotel is a bit off the main cab routes and catching a cab is difficult at best.  We had the same issue last year when staying at this property. This time after having trouble on the day of arrival, we did ask for assistance from the bellman and the process was a bit better but not ideal.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The staff were friendly and helpful, and trying to do their best during the week I was there when the hotel had no water from 8am to 2pm due to the city ripping up the street to install new water pipes. The only reason I didn't give the hotel the highest rating is because I was disappointed that they didn't offer guests any discount, particularly Gold members like me, due to this rather annoying inconvenience. Instead we were merely given some extra bonus points. When I complained about this, one staff member did reduce my rate, but only for that one day. Guests were told that it's the city's fault for the pipe replacement, which is technically true. But I don't think the hotel should expect its guests to shoulder the entire burden and pay the normal rate for a room without proper water service (no toilet, shower or running water). And because I was notified just one day before my arrival, there was obviously insufficient time to cancel, and book another hotel in the midtown area.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

There are plenty of parking garages located close by.   Many different types of cuisine restaurants are available and the Port Authority Bus station is a block away with its restaurants.  On 9th street there are plenty of restaurants that are not that expensive.  Taking the Hop on Hop off bus is convenient, as there are many stops close to the hotel.   Since, I am a platinum member, I was offered late checkout.   But, could not get a higher floor.

Not here! From the moment we arrived, we were treated wonderfully. The staff managed to find us a room with 2 queen beds (at the time of booking there was only a king. I like my travelling companion-- but not THAT much \ud83d\ude00) . They were so helpful and patient during what was going to be a very busy week for them. Make sure to get them to book you car service to La Guardia or JFK, when you leave. Our trip in via Viator shuttle bus was disappointing. Not worth the 8 or $10 you save in money. Trust me, your time, the waiting for a van that's late and a driver that doesn't give a rat's patootie, not worth it. Especially if there's more than one of you. \n\nSo back to the hotel:  standard room size that you'd find in a good property in nearly any other city, with a large bathroom. Very unlike other New York hotel, unless you want to pay double! Clean, clean, clean. Hooray, for that. And amazingly, while located in the busy 'Garment District' they must use triple pane windows in that hotel. We were on the 5 th floor of 30-- and once you closed the window it was so quiet.\n\nThe gym was good, not huge but certainly had good equipment, different cardio machines, weights, headsets, water, etc. Open 24\/7 which served me well.\n\nA small dining room, open for breakfast till 10:30 am and that reopens at around 5 pm. But with so many dining options in NYC, from super cheap to very expensive, I think it's silly to eat there, unless you're really pressed for time. The Essen deli (a great little eat-in or grab ' n go place has breakfast sandwiches made fresh, a juice bar and a hot\/ cold buffet that is a great way to get going.\n\nThe hotel is located so centrally to the rest of Manhattan that it would be hard to justify going to a place that is buried deeper uptown or downtown, unless you have a few weeks to explore. You just choose a section of the city and it's a lovely 1.5 hour walk north\/south. We had 7 days so being close to shopping, the theatres, the High Line and so many other attractions meant we weren't stuck far away from anything.  We took the subway once, during the whole trip. And that was only because we had walked the Brooklyn Bridge one way, it was getting dark, and we were hungry.\n\nSo, far all the reasons here, I would highly recommend the Marriott Courtyard Times Square West.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It was only a short walk to the 34 Penn Street Station (easily doable with luggage) which took us nearly everwhere we wanted you go.   We were within walking distance of many the places we wanted to go to, including the theatre district.   After a late night out at the theatre it was only a 15 min walk back to the hotel without having to worry about the subway or taxis.\n\nThe bedroom was a good size, two full queen beds and the decor was quite pleasant.  The bathroom was also a good size and appeared to have been modernized farily recently.   Our room had a bath and we had a problem in that you couldn't fill the bathtub as the metal plug wasn't sealing properly.   Upon reporting this, maintenance turned up quite quickly and fitted a new plug.   Any hotel can have a problem but it is how the hotel responds that shows the quality of the hotel.\n\nI was very impressed with the amount of charging spots available in the room as we all have multiple electronic devices nowdays.      The small fridge in the room was also a bonus and also the availabiity of a guest laundry downstairs.\n\nThe lobby is fairly small and was occasionally a little croweded.   There is a breakfast\/bistro downstairs but we did not use it.\n\nOpposite the hotel there is a very small store called Non Solo Piada from which I bought absolutely beautiful crossiants each morning.   They are cheap and home made on the spot and defintely a cut above the mass produced varieties.  We also had a pizza from them one night - tasty.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is a good option to stay in Manhattan.

It is also close to Port Authority and Penn Station. So, if you want to save money with the taxi from airport to Manhattan, you can take the bus to Port Authority or train to Penn Station. From here, you will have a 5-10 minutes walking distance to the hotel\nThe advantage to be near those points that help you to save taxi money is compensated by the dirty area around the hotel. Some big bags of garbage, on the street near hotel could not be the first impression that you want :). \nBut the hotel is clean. The bathroom is clean and modern. The room is large enough to not requesting gymnast capabilities to move in the room. We know rooms in Manhattan hotels are very small. This one is acceptable. \nPeople on the reception and concierge are nice. \nYou can use their offer for breakfast. 5 USD per person. It is enough to start the day and less expansive than a breakfast in the city. \nDo not use the concierge for Broadway theatres booking.

The check in was straight forward and staff at the desk were efficient and friendly. They took the time to explain the hotel basics. The hotel lobby and public areas were very clean and well presented. There is also a very small shop for basics in the lobby.\nThe rooms are small. The bathroom is tight. It included a tub\/shower, toilet and one sink\/basin. In these small bathrooms I wish they would ditch the tub to make more space. Amenities are very basic - no shower cap or dryer was provided. \nI found the beds to be very uncomfortable. Not sure why but I didn't sleep well and woke up battered every morning. Maybe they were too soft?? The desk chair dent really match the desk. The lighting was a little poor.\nBut hey, I am in New York and the location is pretty good. \nThe air-conditioning unit is a wall mounted device in the room. It is very noisy and blows quite a bit of air around. So whilst it was effective at cooling the room, we had to turn it off when we were in the room.\nI also found the food and bar concept a little underwhelming. Breakfast is \"starbucks\" style. They do eggs or waffles to order, otherwise everything else is from the fridge or counter. I tried the eggs one day and they were very average. Next day I just did a cup of fruit. The bar\/restaurant area opens in the evening at around 5pm. It was every quiet. I was extremely underwhelmed by the bar experience. The barman just wanted to be somewhere else. He clearly hates his job. He was completely uninterested. Then a G&T was $17.50. I guess they make no effort because there are so many options around the area that the hotel has just given up. But I am also not sure if this is a chicken or an egg issue. I wanted to sit downstairs, work and have aa drink but after the first night I gave up. \nOverall I was left a little underwhelmed.

We've arrived to NYC after a wonderful hotel that we stayed in Miami.\nWe were greatly surprised by the low standards of the Marriott's courtyard Times Square west. Besides the great visuals and design it has nothing good in it, more than that, I don't think it should be a 4-star hotel and definitely not a top tier 4-star.\nSo let's start:\n\nThe good:\n1. Great design\n\nThe bad:\n1. We had a connecting door to other room\n\n2. The room is small for a couple, no comfort when it's so small and you don't have enough free space for two people and baggage\n\n3. The water stream in the bath is static and cannot be changed, only the water temperature is changeable.\n\n4. The bath separator looks cheap, just ordinary material, not a glass like in high end hotels\n\n5. There is no breakfast(or so we have been told by the staff), if you want you can order from a menu, however there is no active restaurant in the hotel between 10:30am-5pm , it fells like a 2 or 3 stars hotel when you are hungry and need to go out to eat because the restaurant is closed in the middle of the day.\n\n6. The air conditioner is a garbage, a cheap one and when you switch to heat it releases at first very stinking air which stays in the room for a lot of time, and the staff says it's ok because no one uses A\/C on heat in the summer so it wasn't prepared for this.\n\nThink twice before staying in this low-end expensive hotel and don't buy all the \"great design\" reviews because at the end you need great room and service, not only good visuals.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is a Chinese bun place on 38th and 8th ave. Buns are a dollar, right out of the oven in the mornings. Milk tea or coffee also a dollar. Close to times square and a block from blue line subway and a couple more blocks to red line. Rooms are small but do offer 2 queen size beds. AC was noisy as hell. We weren't in the room much. Only big issue for me is it isn't on the nicest street. On the corner there is I think a pot paraphernalia store. Every night there are always some seedy types standing around not doing much.

The staff were VERY friendly and helpful and kind.  They offered directions and free breakfast because we never connected with WiFi despite their attempts to correct it.  One small little weird thing was to have a window washer banging against the window at 8am and opening the curtains to a man standing there on the 2nd floor EEK!  Not sure if or how they could give a heads up on this one. LOL  Overall, would stay here again.  No pool or hot tub but just a place to rest and clean up.

Plenty of small cafes nearby, with a better selection, guaranteed table, and slightly cheaper.\nSecurity was good however one guard we encountered was much less courteous than the others...it is a hotel not a night club, and he would do well to take a course in customer service.\nRooms were large, a large comfortable bed, sheets felt great. \nWe would without question stay here again.\nTip, book online through 3rd party sites as we got greater discounts and a better deal than going direct with the hotel.\n\nEnjoy you stay!!","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hotel offers perfect location to explore the many attractions and places of interest, its location being on 37th and 8th is very good. Shops and restaurants close by or within short walk, the only slight downside is that there is some sort of health centre or clinic next door on same side with a needle drop box outside. In the mornings there are one or two charactors milling around. Having said this we did not feel at all unsafe as this was usually in the daytime during open hours and at night it was no problem so dont let this put you off in any way as the Hotel is very good with good staff and a secure lift system which only operates with your keycard so no security problems noticed. Room very good size for big city and bed was comfortable, air con unit worked very well and alternatively you could even open the window slightly if fresh air needed. The bathroom was good size too and the walk in shower was excellent. Hotel has restaurant although we did not use it, opting instead to go over the road to dunkin doughnuts for coffee and tea take outs. They do pretty good bagal as well and all very cheap. Houndstooth pub directly over on 8th is pretty good too for lunchtime or evening eats. Some subway stations within fairly short walk either uptown or downtown.For those unfamilier with the NY subway just be sure you are travelling in right direction and at some stations make sure you enter the correct side of the street ,as some do not inter connect like our system, otherwise its very cheap and although not as regular as the tube, it runs pretty well and is pretty safe to use. We travelled back late one night from the bronx after a yankees game and it felt  pretty safe.\nOther altenatives are Uber taxis which we used quite a bit to get us either further uptown or to central park, of to go right down to battery park or the east river piers. You could always try your luck hailing  the yellow cabs but that is not always as easy,and certainly not as cheap as Uber.\nHotel is well situated to walk to the Hudson river or the high line, so all in all a very good ,comfortable base whilst in the city.

We checked in while still on the train and was sent a message when the room was ready. We were able to check in early and after a 9 hour train ride, that was great. Check in was easy. Just picked up the keys. Celebrated my husband's milestone birthday and received complementary breakfast coupons. The room was clean, but smaller than we were use to, but from our understanding that is probably the standard. We had a king sized bed. Bathroom very clean and well maintained. The small refrigerator located in the closet did not work well. Ice is only located on floors 3, 5, 7, and 9 and we were on 23, but the elevator zipped me down and up in a jiffy. All the staff we encountered were pleasant and respectful. Marie from house keeping was great, but the plastic shower liner was outside the tub and I turned the shower on and got water on the floor, but it was my fault for not checking. We were street side so the view was only of other buildings and with only 27 floors there was not much to see. I asked for an upgrade to a higher floor, but was advised it would cost about $400 more which I did not feel was worth it. It was easy to get to from Penn Station. After a family member drove us through the city, I needed a glass of wine to calm my nerves and the gentlemen working in the Bistro was kind and quick. He had a wonderful smile and asked me to sit back and relax and he brought out the wine and our order and everything was okay. Only concern is that there appears to be a health clinic next door and there was some unsavory looking characters standing on the street, but did not particularly feel unsafe. You need your key card to access any floor from the elevator except for the lobby so the extra security is a plus. Overall, great folks, great location and if we return, we would stay again.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The first time you enter the room you don't know whether to laugh or cry at the size of the room but once inside you see that they are very well designed to accommodate you and your belongings.\n\nThe nice surprise was the small refrigerator. Just large enough for bottled water, soda and snacks. The bathroom is spacious and modern with a great shower.\n\nI highly recommend joining the Marriott rewards program and downloading the app for your phone. Checking in was so simple by completing a mobile check-in for our stay on the train ride in. We only had to show identification once we arrived to get our room key. All 3 stays we had nothing but the best possible service from the Marriott staff. All were very friendly and extremely helpful.\n\nLocation is one of this hotels greatest assets especially given the price point. On one of our stays our room was not ready because we arrived to early so we left our luggage with concierge and walked about a hundred feet to the Houndstooth Pub for drinks. After drinks, we stopped at the 7\/eleven across the street and stocked up on drinks and snacks.\n\nWe would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive comfortable stay in NYC. We will definitely be back soon.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Now first impressions perhaps weren't great due to what I assume to be a health clinic which had a needle bin outside next door but I appreciated this was nothing to do with the Marriott and didn't let it affect my impressions of the hotel itself. When we first walked in we were impressed by the modern decor, friendly and efficient staff. We were checked in in five minutes, 27th floor! Wow! I want to give a shout out to all the staff, everyone was so courteous and welcoming.  \n\nI liked the fact you needed a key to go anywhere but the lobby, a good security measure. The rooms were fabulous, beautifully decorated and spotless. The view was nothing great, but who cares when you've got a great room! If I wanted a good view, I'd go to the country or seaside. \nThe beds were beautifully comfy and there was enough storage space for two. The only thing that perhaps was confusing was the thermostat but it only took a few days to get the hang of. Note to any Brits who like tea, it seemed to be only filter coffee machines available in the rooms! But in the bathroom there was even a bath, the sample shampoos were divine and the towels fluffy. \n\nThe location is perfect for shopping and sightseeing, one member of our party has a walking stick and he was able to get to Times Square and Herald square in ten minutes using the hotel as a starting point.\n\nI can't comment on the bistro as we ate out but I can recommend starlight diner not too far! One of the staff members recommended it and we went a lot, the portions were extremely generous and fair priced compared to the usual chain fairs. \n\nOverall this hotel is perfect for a shopping break or sightseeing trip as a luxury put your head down sort of hotel. I would definitely return on future visits to NYC! ","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Quiet hotel.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-01-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"This hotel is located very near the \"squares\" (Times and Herald) as well as just a jump away from Madison Square Garden.  Very seamless check in and, for those with cars, parking was 3 doors down ($42 for the night).  As is typical in NYC, the room was small but very clean and the bed was quite comfy.  It is a very quiet hotel as there were only 6 rooms per floor I believe.  The front desk has a very modern flair, albeit a tiny space.  There is a bar in the back which is a good size and they have coffee, drinks and some food available.  There is a nice patio just off the bar for those warmer days.\n\nThe elevator was secure in that it would not move until you inserted your card.  I really like that bit.  The only complaint I have is probably the man working the bar.  He was quite snooty and it took a while to get my coffee, which was supposed to be a latte.  We paid quite a bit for it and it was horrible.  I don't believe he knew what he was doing.  That, coupled with his holier than thou attitude, turned me off of the bar.\n\nFor touring, though, it is excellent.  We love the Tick Tock Diner and it is a 1 minute walk from the hotel.  We love Macy's - 5 minute walk.  Just a nice location and we will utilize it again.  We only paid $115 for the night since it was Sunday.  You just don't find that kind of price in NYC for that level of hotel.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We had a high floor and no view.  But this worked well for us as the room was very quiet (no street noise and no noise from other guests). Ultimately if you go to NYC you're not there for the view from your room as you're out about all day.  The only minor point was we had breakfast included and when we checked in one of the check in staff gave a little bit of attitude by saying our rate should not have included breakfast (hey not our problem, that's what we booked and we had proof of the booking).  Also the fruit cups were sometimes a couple of days old (so not very fresh at all).\n\nOverall, I would stay there again if given the opportunity to return to NYC.

It was a short walk up 8th Ave to the hotel.  Check in was super easy & the staff are all very friendly & helpful.  The room may have been the smallest room I have ever stayed in but given this is NYC, that is the norm (I suppose?)\nI will say that the room was CLEAN & extremely comfortable; I managed to get over my anxiety of being on the 17th floor rather quickly!  The window DOES open, just barely enough that a small child MIGHT be able to squeeze their head thru... if you have kids you may want to keep them not so close.  I doubt that they could reach the windows but better safe than sorry.  Either way, I was VERY thankful for the fresh air.\nThe room has most amenities that one can expect, a small fridge, ironing board & iron, hair dryer, TV, clean shower\/bathroom & the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a long time.  I seriously need their pillows. The hotel also participates in an eco friendly program where they will only give you fresh towels if you leave towels on the floor.  If you are like me, reusing a bath towel or wash cloth is NOT a big deal, better to save the water to wash them.  Kudos to you Marriott!\nThere is a bar on the ground floor with a seating area behind it.  Plenty of TVs to watch the game.  I am not sure if there is a pool but there is a fitness facility in the cellar that has a few treadmills, ellipticals & a couple bikes.  There was 1 weight machine to cover most muscle groups & a few free weights.  They also provided mats, water, wipes & ear buds.  VERY cool.\nThey do offer some foods at the bar area, they have breakfast in the morning, not included but there is a Dunkin Donuts across 8th Ave if that is your thing.\nWe were a short walk from an outdoor market (8th ave north till about 42nd St) & from there Times Square is a hop & skip away (no need to jump too).\nReasonable priced wraps up this deal for me, I would DEFINATELY stay here again!","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We didn't use the breakfast or bar area but as we passed through to the elevators it looked busy and nice. The only thing I would say is that it is a good 10 minute walk from Times Square. Seeing as we were doing an overnight with the main focus of seeing 2 Broadway shows it was a bit out of the action , seems like we spent more time walking the 11-12 blocks to get to where we needed to go! If it was a general NYC weekend and you were happy to walk\/ cab to where you needs to go it does the trick!

The bathroom was nice too, with a walk in shower. Room was a little on the darkside, mainly due to lack of sunlight, but not so much of a problem. We did ask if there were any rooms with a view. Front desk informed us that none of the rooms had any views of the city. They even took me to the 19th floor, just so I could have a peek. Other than the sun coming through there wasnt much difference. In fact original room looked better.\n\nWe were given a map at the front desk and they told us the best way to get to any attraction we wanted to visit.

The location was good and near to Times Square, Empire States Building and lots of food and shops in the neighbourhood. However,  the street, similar to other streets in the city,  can be quite dirty and lots of homeless people.\n\nThe room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. We had a king size bed for two and there is sufficient space for us. The complementary WiFi is good too.\n\nThe great stay was destroyed by the bad service we received at the end of our trip. We booked an airport transfer to the airport for our departure day Nov 14 at 3pm from the hotel concierge Anne on Nov 11. However, due to the Paris incident on Nov 13, we decided to move our transfer earlier to 2pm on Nov 14 in case the US tighten their airport checks.  \n\nWe tried to request for the late checkout on Nov 13 night but was told to request on our checkout day after 7am. I called the front desk at 7.50am and was granted the extension to which I was very grateful. I further requested to see if we can change our initial airport transfer to an hour earlier. I told the lady that I had booked with the Concierge Anne. She told me she doesn't know who is Anne and I reinstate that it is the concierge in the hotel.  She then told me she will change my transport. \n\nUpon checkout,  we were informed that the car is waiting for us at the driveway. The car had our room no. 2006 pasted on the window. So we proceeded to load our bags into the car and wenmmt to the airport. \n\nWhen we arrived at the airport, we were told to pay USD70. We were surprised and told the driver we had paid the hotel USD46 and showed her our receipt.  She said it  was a different arrangement.\n\nAfter much discussion with the driver and calling the hotel to check,  we learnt that the hotel concierge and the hotel are two separate companies, although the concierge desk is just next to the front desk. We were not told before and totally unaware of this. \n\nThe front desk lady did not point this out to me when I request to change my transport. She just proceeded to book a new transport for us and did not even inform us of the price. She most likely will have to cancel our 3pm transport but couldn't find any on their record and just book a new one without bother to check back with us. Her actions caused us much inconvenience and monetary lost!\n\nWhen I tried to speak to the front desk again after we realised the error,  the hotel staff kept saying it is my fault for double booking.  They refused to claim any responsibility at all. How would a guest be aware of what is the internal arrangement in the hotel and the concierge? \n\nIn the end, I had to pay USD116 in total for my one way transfer!!! This is ridiculous and totally spoilt the end  my wonderful trip in USA and my impression of Marriott. I am a frequent traveller and uses Marriott quite often. I was thinking of becoming their member after this trip as we had stayed in 3 of the hotels in this trip and was impressed until this bad service. \n\nWARNING: Please be extra careful when dealing with the staff and concierge in this hotel!","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We like Marriott and Starwood properties, so we picked the Courtyard based on location and the reviews.  Our room was fairly good size for NYC. The view was non-existent from the 19th floor, but I suspect if you are near the top (30-31) you probably have a view.  I had requested it, and with Gold status, I was hoping we would have a shot.  We arrived early and our room was ready which was a bonus.  The hotel is clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The location is a huge plus. The subway entrance is only a few steps away from the hotel entrance.  It is near Times Square so depending on your likes\/dislikes that is either a positive or a negative.  If you have never been to NYC before, Times Square is great to experience, but you dont want to hang out there or eat in the area.  The restaurants are marginal and grossly overpriced. Be strong and venture out just a bit to 9th Avenue or to the many Boroughs like Soho to get some food even locals enjoy.\nI recommend the Courtyard for sure.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I would not suggest this hotel if you are traveling with someone who can't walk far as even though it is very close to Times Square, it would be a little much for an elderly or disabled person to walk to.

The hotel really is excellent for the price range and in a great location for the mid-town sites - about 10 mins walk from the Empire State Building in one direction and 10 minutes to Times Square in another.\n\nRoom: Our room was very clean on arrival and our chambermaid was like the magic cleaning fairy - every morning we left our room looking like a bit of a bomb site (there were four of us in it after all) and every evening we came back and it was cleaned, tidied and polished to perfection. In fact we were so chuffed we left a sizeable tip. The air conditioning was very slightly intrusive noise-wise, but as it was 90 degrees for the whole week, we were forced to put up with it. To be honest, after a full day of sightseeing, you are so tired it won't keep you awake anyway. There was no kettle in the room which was a bit irritating, but there was a small coffee machine which we contrived to make tea with after a bit of head-scratching (although it did taste slightly coffee'ish!) There is also a small fridge in the wardrobe which was an absolute godsend, especially in the heat-wave we experienced.\n\nAnother really important thing was that there was virtually no noise at all from other guests - we were barely aware that other guests were on our floor apart from the odd plumbing noises. Getting a decent night's sleep can be very hit and miss in a hotel, but this place has somehow got it sorted - in fact we all commented on how well we were sleeping throughout the week. And the bed was really comfy!\n\nThere is a small diner downstairs which serves very respectable (although quite pricey) basics. Fried egg and bacon comes in at a pretty costly $13.95, but the good news is that one plateful is really enough for two, unless you are a complete gannet :) \n\nStaff: The staff throughout the hotel are incredibly helpful, courteous and friendly. The reception staff are incredibly welcoming, various maintenance staff leapt out of the lift if we needed to use it and resolutely refused all efforts to persuade them to get back in and go before us, the concierge is worth his weight in gold and so is the lady who serves breakfast. (I've forgotten her name but she is an absolute star). The barman (bar manager?)  is also a complete star and provides good banter over your pre-dinner tipple.\n\nLocation: Although conveniently placed for all the mid-town sites, I would say the area (the part of West 37th street where the hotel is located) is a tiny bit downmarket. There was an unfortunately placed syringe disposal unit about 12 feet from the front door of the hotel and more than once there were one or two tramps slumped against the wall just along the road when we came back at night. This didn't bother us, but it might upset some people.\n\nOverall we were thoroughly pleased with our choice of hotel and would definitely recommend for value, sleep quality, service and cleanliness.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel is a few blocks to the west of the heavy traffic and tourist areas of Times Square and what a difference a few blocks makes (for reduced noise, traffic and general congestion).   \n\nOne of my buddies had never been to NYC and we picked this hotel for the easy access to Times Square and Madison Square Garden.   We were in town for the Wounded Warriors Basketball Tournament in late November 2014.   Access to these two places was perfect....a few blocks (walking) and we were on top of the action.   \n\nWhat made our trip even more enjoyable was the concierge level service provided by Maria Pozo, Marriott Guest Manager.   On multiple days and times, she provided perfect recommendations for local diners for breakfast and lunches.   Each of these spots was within two or three blocks from the hotel and allowed us to enjoy great food while not having the chaos of touristy locations in Times Square.    \n\nMy room was sharp - I love the consistency of the experience at the Marriott - and even though my room overlooked 37th street, noise wasn't a problem.   Kudos to Maria and staff for making our trip to NYC a huge success - we're already planning our trip for this fall (November 2015) and will be staying at this hotel again.   \n\nFinal note - didn't realize this until we left - this hotel is about three or four blocks from the tunnel that gets you from Manhattan to NJ - this made our Uber from the hotel to the Newark airport even easier.

Warning - the rooms are very, very tiny - very typical NYC - so it's not a complaint, just an advisory note. We had a lot of luggage, so it was a tight fit. Overall, an excellent hotel. First, it's relatively new so decor is updated & trendy. Second, the bar is both a coffee\/breakfast eatery as well as a meeting spot to grab a night cap. The hotel staff is what rocks this hotel. They're friendly, but not intrusive, alert and helpful. The cleaning staff rocked. BTW, how great is it to stay in a place where everyone is happy to work there? Seriously. Their satisfaction showed in how they treated each guest with courtesy and pleasantries - all genuine. Our front desk clerk Paula was first rate. I didn't care for our first room - it was sort of dark and on a low floor and I wanted more sunlight because I was working out of the room while attending a business conference. She found me another room that met my needs immediately. The hotel is in great proximity to many restaurants, fast food restaurants, Duane Reade\/Walgreens (groceries) the subway and the bus station. It's a ten-minute walk to Times Square for all that fun shopping and Broadway plays. The hotel has free high-speed WiFi that worked well at all times. Some floors had ice makers and filtered water to refill water bottles. It was great tasting water. Rooms had coffee makers, too. The hotel had great security, and you needed a key card to work the elevator, so riffraff couldn't get above the first floor. There are only a few downsides to the hotel, but they are very minor. The first is that the business center is off to the right of the front desk, so it was loud at times when trying to work, but there are 2 available computers whereas some area hotels only have one. The computers are password protected which prevented non-guests from using them, so that is a plus. The other downside is that the hotel was in near proximity to a Tobacco shop so you had to weed through some unsavory folks with their vapors to get to the front door. It's NYC, so you expect that street element and that was only during business hours. I would most definitely stay there again. Loved it. Highly recommend.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Arriving early to the hotel, our room unfortunately was not ready.  The staff was friendly and advised that they could hold our luggage until a room was available.  Located on a side street, the hotel is only 3 blocks away from the closest subway station (A, C, E lines).  It was also only 5 blocks away from Herald Square where I was able to catch the N, Q, and R metro lines.  This was convenient since we have visited NYC before and didn't necessarily do anything in the Times Square area.  The area was quieter than central Times Square and I felt safe even at night.  The room was nicely appointed and modern.  We faced another building but we didn't spend much time in the room so that was fine.  It was understandably small but roomy enough for two people with opened luggage (I've stayed in smaller in Asia).  I liked the walk in shower  which had good water pressure and drainage.  There was free wifi, in-room safe, ironing board, and flat screen TV with tons of channels. I was concerned since we had the ice machine next to our door but it was relatively quiet since there were only so many rooms on each floor.  Also, the ice machine had a water dispenser which was super handy for refilling our bottles.  A great property that I have no concerns staying in again!","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}
