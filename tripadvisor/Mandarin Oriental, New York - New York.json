Arriving on foot during a heavy rainstorm, I was struck by the stark contrast between my experience and that of the upscale guests being ushered into their waiting Escalades. While struggling with my malfunctioning umbrella, I felt overlooked by the front door staff, who seemed preoccupied with attending to more affluent visitors.\n\nUpon reaching the upper level, I found the check-in process lacking the finesse I would expect from a premium hotel. Despite presenting my ID and credit card, I was not offered assistance with my bags until after completing the formalities. The manager's demeanor suggested skepticism regarding my presence, making me feel unwelcome from the outset. Moreover, the service at the reception desk appeared inexperienced, requiring my guidance even for basic tasks like processing my credit card payment.\n\nMy room, situated on the 48th floor with a park view, failed to impress. The hotel's dated d\u00e9cor and lack of upkeep were immediately evident, casting a shadow over the supposedly luxurious experience. The room felt far from clean, with stains on the carpet and frayed curtains that detracted from its overall appeal. The lighting was insufficient, making it challenging to read or engage in any activities that required adequate illumination.\n\nWhile the in-room dining service was a standout, providing delicious meals and attentive staff, this was overshadowed by other disappointments. A late-night interruption by a staff member delivering unrequested snacks further marred my experience, raising questions about respect for guests' privacy and the necessity of such gestures after midnight.\n\nOverall, my stay at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel left me underwhelmed and questioning the value of its lofty prices. For those seeking Manhattan standards and a truly premium experience, I would recommend exploring alternatives such as the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South. Until significant updates are made to address the hotel's dated facilities and service shortcomings, it falls short of meeting expectations for discerning travelers.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

Firstly, what is advertised as a \"park view\" isn't; the view is obstructed by the Trump International, resulting in what every other hotel on the park refers to as a \"partial park view.\"  This is tantamount to false advertising, and I am shocked that Mandarin does it.  Secondly, the walls are very thin; during my stay, I could regularly hear my neighbor conducting phone calls.  This is unacceptable for a hotel at Mandarin NYC's price point - one should never, ever hear their neighbors conducting routine business at conversation level in a $1000+\/night room.  Additionally, the headboards in the Mandarin NYC's rooms are loosely connected to the walls; every time anyone gets in, out, or shifts in bed, the headboards bang the walls, resulting in loud noises.  I was routinely awoken by this noise.  Additionally, the general state of the building is poor; rooms feel threadbare, panels in the elevators are loose, carpets are stained, etc.  Finally, some of the clientele are unseemly; on several occasions, I rode the elevator with groups of people who were loud, rude, and reeked of pot - definitely not the sort I'd expect at a Mandarin.  While I understand a hotel open to the public can't control who stays in it, there is an impression of a proprietorship of questionable standards.  Staff service was on-brand and adequate, but it was grossly overshadowed by systemic issues with the property.  All of this meant that I cut my stay short and moved to the Ritz on 59th, which provided a much more satisfactory experience.  Even though I am a MO member, I will never stay at the Mandarin NYC again.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

While the staff were lovely, and the location is great, I thought my room looked pretty darn tired.  For instance, every single lampshade in my room was wonky.  My friend guessed that the room decor was about 15 years old, and I bet he was right.  I was also disappointed in the food and beverage service.  The only place to eat or grab a drink is in the MO lounge off the lobby.  While the view is, of course, spectacular, sometimes you just want to sit at an actual bar -- which does not exist in this hotel.  I found it annoying waiting to be seated, and then served, when all I wanted on a few occasions was simply a beer.  In short, while the location is great, I didn't feel particularly cossetted in luxury -- which is kind of the whole point of these hotels.  This one won't be on my short list when I return.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

No complaints.\n\nSpecial thank you to Garrett, on check-in on Jan 12th I was a little early yet he informed the room was ready (was around `10:30am).  He also was able to assist me in staying an extra night in the same room as same rate.  I understood it would be no negative reflection on Mandarin if that could not be accommodated (was literally last minute request).  Very pleased he checked and it worked out, for everyone.  Garrett informed he is a training assistant manager, I think.  Whatever the case, his demeanor was very gracious, well spoken and inviting.  He is a great asset, I give him high review for his professionalism and friendliness.\n\nA shout out to Wendy who brought me chocolates, water, ice, a soft cloth and a bed side floor mat in the mid evening timeframe.  She was so friendly, kind and courteous.  She deserves a mention from \"Mr. Aman\" or \"Mr. AJ.\" \n\nRecognition to the friendly staff all around without fail, namely:\nEner and Jonathan - Valet\nIn-room dining:  Mareesa, Christopher and Carlos.\n\nThe service was Excellent.  I stayed in premier central park king.  I'm going to try Hudson river suite next time, which is in March.\n\nThe room-service is very convenient and a good variety.  The hours are unparalleled.  I did not eat at the restaurant, yet I did have drinks.  The view is Amazing.  Would wish for perhaps a little more variety on overall menu, yet only reason I did not eat at the restaurant is because I went out for sushi both nights.  I did order room service both nights... and was not disappointed in the least.\n\nI highly recommend Mandarin Oriental New York and can't wait to return.

The spacious footprint provided a sitting area that inspired a coziness to the environment. The bath was endowed with a walk-in shower and other accoutrements in keeping with the stature of the Mandarin. The MO Lounge is an all day dining experience served in an American food-fare format with bar and views that overlook Central Park and the Manhattan skyline.

After realizing we wouldn\u2019t be Ok with it, they showed us to another with a small bathroom. At that point, we were too exhausted to keep moving. The rooms are dingy, and decorated in bad taste and worst of all, they feel dirty. Everything from the carpet, to the drapes to the finishes - all sort of gross. Dark, badly lit, hardly any closet space and no modern amenities. The rooms don\u2019t even have coffee machines, old dingy bathtubs and dustballs in the corners. I walked in and saw housekeeping cleaning our wineglasses in the bathroom sink rather than changing them out - gross. The bar doesn\u2019t even offer nuts or olives with cocktails.

We thought it was a lovely idea and were looking forward to the experience. Upon booking we were aware that price was steep at $155 US per person with a glass of champagne (we\u2019re Canadian so it was in fact more with the exchange) but we figured the whole experience would be worth it. Sadly it was not; not even close! The service was poor. Our server couldn\u2019t remember any of our tea orders and overfilled all the teapots causing them to spill all over the table. The sandwiches were dry, they felt like they sat out too long and the bread felt crusty and stale. Were it not for the scones, which were delicious, we would have left hungry. On top of all of this the hotel was testing its fire alarm system so there were random alerts going off here and there. All in all with gratuity and tax it cost us $225 each (that\u2019s $300 Canadian) for some stale sandwiches and poor service! I\u2019m not one to complain but I don\u2019t appreciate when the product does not warrant the cost. I couldn\u2019t shake the waste of money the rest of the trip; I felt rip offed to put it lightly.

Location was great and room sizes are fine.  Pool, gym & spa are good amenities.  But the rooms are very dated and it just doesn't feel like a full service luxury hotel... no tea or coffee facilities in the room, only one restaurant (which is basically in the lobby) and no bar.  (Hotel will say Nesprsso machine & kettle are available 'on request', but there's no sign or information in the room about this, or online on their info menu - & why not just put it in the room?).  The whole place feels like it's skimping, getting by with the minimum.  We were there a week - hardly greeted by doormen, pretty cold service in the restaurant apart from Luis (been there 20 years...).  The staff were pleasant, if not that efficient. I sensed embarrassment... that they all knew it wasn't up to scratch.  We had breakfast credit included but it's been a major issue for it to be credited appropriately to our account, which is just boring, particularly when we have it all in writing.  Rather wished we'd stayed at The Carlyle, which was same price bracket, has lovely location, amazing bar, great restaurant & is renowned for its service.  Disappointed with MO NY - nothing like MO Hong Kong or London.  Perhaps it's about to be closed for renovation....that's what it felt like\n","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I had high expectations as a loyal customer, but unfortunately, my experience fell far short of what I had anticipated.\n\nFirstly, I would like to address the issue of early check-in. As a hotel representative assured me, I was promised an early check-in at 12 PM. However, upon arrival at 12:30 PM, I was informed that my room was not yet ready. This was particularly inconvenient as my flight had landed at 6 AM, and I was exhausted from the overnight journey.\n\nFurthermore, when my partner and I requested a late check-out, we were met with resistance. Despite our willingness to pay for an additional night, we were forced to vacate the room and pay for an extra night's stay. To make matters worse, the room was not cleaned throughout the day, despite the fact that we had paid for an additional night. This lack of attention to detail and disregard for our comfort was highly disappointing.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to highlight the lack of advertised amenities at your hotel. The website clearly stated that there was a restaurant on-site, yet upon arrival, we discovered that it was closed. It is unacceptable that this information was not updated anywhere, leaving us without dining options within the hotel premises. As frequent travelers and members of your loyalty program, my partner and I have stayed at your hotels in Tokyo and Barcelona. However, due to these recurring issues, we are now considering removing ourselves from your loyalty program and seeking alternative accommodations in the future.\n\nI hope that you take my feedback seriously and address these concerns promptly. As a loyal customer, I believe it is essential for you to rectify these issues to maintain your reputation and ensure customer satisfaction. I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will take the necessary steps to improve your services.\n\nYours sincerely,\n","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is no buffet for breakfast and only a small choice from the menu, even less choice if you have dietary restrictions, we ended up having the same breakfast almost every day and it can take a while to arrive which is not ideal with children.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":281071,"title":"Disappointing","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"We were quite excited by coming to MO New York as we saw the Reviews by far was quite good. However, our experience was not up to par:\n- Upon Checkin, we were not recognized nor asked whether we are a MO Fan member. We were also not explained by the breakfast benefit clearly (only quickly say you have 70 dollars, therefore we assumed we had 70 dollars per person per breakfast) we received as a Amex Platinum Member. Therefore it created a kerfuffle upon check out when we see the bill\n- We stayed at the MO for 7 nights and we somehow were explicitly told that there was no upgrade. This is also a first time as we use the Amex Platinum Program. However, since it was not a guarantee. We decided to let it go. \n- We had our Breakfast on the 2nd day in the morning, and the quality was very bad. The potato was microwaved and not cooked. We were deeply disappointed and decided not to have breakfast at the MO afterwards, which turned out to be a good thing.\n- During our stay the service was up and down. Someday we would have very thorough service, and someday we'd need to ask 4 times for a package delivered to us in order to have someone bring it upstairs. Also our room phone's display had always been blank and we noticed no-one ever fixed it during our stay.\n- Upon Checkout, I realized the real problem. First we called the concierge and the front desk, nobody picked up. So we decided to take the luggages downstair by ourselves. During check out, we noticed that there was a lunch bill on the 3th Aug, which was ours, was included in our total bill. The checkout receptionist had to manually remove that lunch, which shows the management mess already. Also I noticed there was a breakfast bill that was 40+ dollars. I did not understand why we were charged by having free breakfast. then the receptionist explained to me that we were only eligible for continental breakfast and 70 dollars per breakfast, not per person. Both of the bill incidents had me sense a scammy tone of this hotel and made me question their professionalism. I had to double check all the bills in the end and made sure my luggage was safely stored. I also had to obtain a paper copy of the bill just in case, which turned out to be very useful later.\n- When we were leaving the hotel, the concierge was reluctant even on helping on move the baggage to the Uber. This is definitely not what we expected from MO\n- One day after check out, I noticed they silently charged me 42 dollars on my credit card, and I had to call Amex to monitor the transaction. And having the paper bill on hand also helped in this case. Thankfully the charge was not finalized. But I have to say that I choose to stay in MO not to have a little scamming battle with them. That shouldn't be the intention. \n- Overall, I would not recommend anyone who got used to other MO service to stay in this hotel. ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It kind of ends there. \n\nIt was a tough choice to decide between luxe hotel properties in NYC. I settled on the Mandarin because of my extraordinary experience in London. Maybe the bar was set too high by Hyde Park. \n\nWe got in to the room and felt like a quick coffee before heading out. No coffee setup? We called down and were told it could be provided - on demand?! Really?? Soon enough a Nespresso setup was delivered. How many people opt out of coffee? Maybe that\u2019s just me. \n\nNext, showed up for lunch in the bar (I think there is only the one dining option). There wasn\u2019t anyone at the host\u2019s station so we grabbed a seat.  Soon enough someone awkwardly asked us to vacate the \u201creserved\u201d seats and they would check to see if they could accommodate us at another table. Eventually we were reseated. Service was lagging and food was overpriced (as can be expected at an establishment like this). \n\nHotel decor and interiors were all just average.  Nothing felt like a wow. No part of the experience felt like it justified the price tag - especially when there is so much competition in this city. \n\nMy stay at The NYC Edition in March (for roughly half the cost) far outperformed this experience. The Mandarin can do much better than this.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Need to be redone ASAP","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-07-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"A couple of thoughts for the once thought amazing experience the MO New York used to offer, sadly it passed away during the pandemic and it seems that it will never be recovered.\n\nWe used to come on a yearly basis and spend a good part of our summers in NYC booked into the hotel that, due to the extremely attentive and amazing staff at that time and services, we actually felt like home far away from home.\n\nNothing has been upgraded within the amenities or services, it seems extremely stuck in time, where carpets and furniture around the hotel seems to be broken, ripped, kept together in pieces, using ice tongs to close sliding doors, unwashed carpets, prehistoric air purifier on the upper level hallways, leaving the ones on lower levels smelling like old and mould. The TV and remote control it is still the same from 6-8 years ago, with a system not up to date with the modern times where you select movies (that you pay for obviously) that freeze while you watch then you cannot continue it. Bathroom that doesn\u2019t have refreshed amenities everyday as supposed in a hotel of this magnitude, so you end up having to ask daily or going to buy your own to make sure you are set, a blow dryer that is impossibly old (i emphasise the word \u2018old\u2019).\n\nThe pool amenities and the pool itself has been stuck in time with a disgraceful aspect, again lucky for the location on the 36th floor with beautiful views\u2026 but nope. This isn\u2019t a 5 star style and comfort of a relaxing pool or the pool lounge. Same can be said about their fitness rooms.\n\nFurthermore, the staff that currently operates is extremely unresponsive and has a beautiful lack of happiness and professionalism that leaves you with a very unpleasant slight upset feeling after. Their \u2018communication\u2019 system apparently is entitled only to them or whoever they chose to do so with, especially through their \u2018state of the art\u2019 messaging system via Whatsapp where they either answer or don\u2019t answer at all or their system deletes you as immediately as one day or half a day and you would have to go through the process of validating yourself all over again time after time. Let us not speak of the fast help the provide\u2026 because it doesn\u2019t exist :). However, they would love to charge you for every breathing thing possible, but the return of investment?!\n\nQuality does not match the investment.\n\nThere are still plenty more to say in regards to this experience which left us with a distaste in our return to NYC, but whoever comes here and knows how a true MO hotel operates or how this one specifically used to operate will surely match the feelings provided.\n\nWith all due respect to the rest of Mandarin Oriental hotels and resorts around the world, i think this one should be taken out of the franchise, scale down for a 3-4 star hotel or simply close it for total refurbishment.\n\nI highly recommend other hotels which we will definitely only stay at for the future NYC long trips for business as well as for pleasure as they cater for all the necessary needs. Recommended Baccarat, Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton. Better staff, communication system and services, what sadly they do not have as MO NY is privileged to have is the amazing views of Midtown and Central Park. But with pleasure can be traded not to waste your money on lack of quality and improper staff.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was easier to walk across the circle to Starbucks.   The MO Lounge was another story.  The host staff was very personable and attentive, servers were average.  The drinks were good and the view was stellar.  The food is absolutely atrocious.  the pasta was underwhelming, the crispy chicken sandwich was inedible.  It was comprised of all dark meat and I literally had to spit my first bite in the napkin.  We ordered the handmade potato chips as a starter and they were good, but the server never brought (despite several requests) malt vinegar as was touted on the menu.   The redeeming factor was that we were able to find a table on short notice at Rosa Mexicano (a local restaurant not affiliated with the hotel across from Lincoln Center) that had far superior food at about 25% of the price and much happier servers.

What was particularly offensive was  how dirty the tables, carpets and even chairs were, i had to literally clean my seat of crumbs and leftovers while the staff looked at me and offer no help. From there onwards i couldn't stop thinking that if the front is dirty imagine the back...\n\nThe room: we booked a large corner room on the top floor, the size and views were amazing. Then it all went downhill, the furniture was old and full of nicks and stains, the carpets are probably the originals from 20 years ago, i opened a window and the dust and spiders that came out scared me into asking the staff to open it. The bed sheets had yellow stains and so did the towels. The amount of dust under the furniture and around the windows, doors, light fittings was clear evidence that housekeeping had not done a full cleaning in a very long time.\n\nWhat really pushed me over the top was that when my wife complained the service actually went from bad to worst... The room was cleaned but amenities stoped being re filled, towels disappeared, water bottle reduced to half and in general we felt like we were punished for complaining.\n\nI couldn't recommend this hotel to anyone... If i was offered to stay there for free i would skip it! \n\nThis hotel offers location and location only, if you are looking for anything else in your experience stay as far away as possible, you can always go for a drink at the lounge and enjoy the views without spending thousands of dollars in mediocre rooms and service.\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had check-in late, and the check-in staff pointed out there was a WholeFoods downstairs in case I wanted something.  She must of known clearly I was not keen on a huge meal.  Nicely done!   The service staff at the cafe were funny, cherry and attentive - as you would expect having breakfast.  The doormen were super great.  I was wondering if I could get a table at one of the bars in the shopping mall upstairs.  They immediately called the concierge upstairs to check for me.  It was much appreciated.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located at Columbus Circle, which is a huge plus for any runner.  Just cross the street, and viola!, you are in Central Park.  Plus, during cold spells, it is super nice to simply take the elevator down to the enclosed California-style shopping mall.  Some may argue this feature isn't a plus, but given the choice of braving the cold and wind, or simply going downstairs, I'd prefer going downstairs.  Also, a huge benefit is the WholeFoods located in the lower ground floor.  After a long flight, it's nice to be able to grab a salad.  The gym itself is well-maintained with modern equipment, and again, the staff managing the gym were excellent.  \n\nThe cafe offers a wonderful, tip-top view of Central Park, Central Park South, and the buildings on the Upper East Side.  Make sure to get a seat at the window.  I always looked forward to the breakfast, which not many restaurants get right.  The toast was always adequately crispy and the eggs at the right consistency.  The chef naturally took pride in his\/her work.  The one small issue is that the cafe only opens at 7:00AM.  It would have been great to have opened a bit earlier.  I noticed three guests, including myself, all waiting.\n\nA sign of a great hotel is the staff's attention to details.  The Mandarin is fantastic about the details, without a doubt.  A great example - the complimentary coffee stand in the morning.  As a business traveler, it's so nice to grab a quick coffee and go. The gym offered fresh fruits, which is nice after a workout.  \n\nOne small issue was when I was checking in the staff didn't automatically realise I was a registered member of the Mandarin's loyalty program.  This was important because members get a complimentary voucher that can be used at the cafe.  I almost missed the fact I was entitled to this benefit.  I was staying 7 days, so the voucher was in particular valuable.   And then again, when I was checking out, the staff had not recorded I was entitled to the voucher, so had to ask them to correct the final invoice.  Normally, I wouldn't have to check on these things.  \n\nAlso, to access the wi-fi, I had to have an account set up.  This was a bit annoying trying to figure it out.  Finally, I had to call the front desk and they promptly gave me the code. Normally, it's just one's room number and surname.  But it wasn't the case.  Adding this extra complexity is slightly weird.  But overall, these are trivial compared to the excellent experience I had.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I always have pretty good impression about this hotel chain. We even got married in one.  \n\nRecently, we stayed at this one for our special event. I have emailed and called to set up something nice weeks before we check in. However, when we checked, nothing was setup. And the room smells like there was a dead cat there before. There is no water or anything we requested there.\n\nWe called to request changing room. Finally we got a another room which looked like a reasonable hotel room late night, needless to say it put negative vibe on our experience. \n\nThe deco of the hotel and rooms are from 1980s.  Everything screams for new updates. The bed is also small, looks like queens size, even we booked King bed.  \n\nWe booked central park view room, however, there obstructed view of central park( Trump tower right on your face). \n\nSpa is decent and they have good skills.  This is probably the positive experience during our stay. \n\nOne can argue this is New York.  You often pay more for less.  Giving the rising safety issues everywhere in nyc, I don't think it justifies the price they charge with the room they have.\n\nService is so so at best. \n\nMore importantly, this is the worst hotel we have stayed in this chain.\n\nI don't recommend this hotel unless you have business nearby.

The city view behind the band is breathtaking. NYC is a jazz town, and this place is a must for jazz lovers; \n- the hotel is only 15 minutes walk to the \"Hamilton\" musical at Richard Rodgers Theatre; \n- my kids and I love the Whole Foods store at B1 of the compound.\n\nWe split our stay between a Central-Park-view room and a Hudson-river-view suite. To be honest, I find the Hudson River view better, because the central park view is partially blocked by Trump Hotel, a building I personally find quite ugly (brown glass, so 70s, oh no...)\n\nRoom service team is top. I totally enjoyed chatting with Derek almost every morning. A wise and joyful person, and one true gentleman.\n\nValaria and Robin at the front desk are two very caring and kind persons. They've gone out of their way to help us with room change. They also showed tremendous calmness and professionalism working under stress and huge workload.\n\nHowever,\n\n- the hotel needs a facelift very urgently. It's a big step down compared to MOs in Europe and the Middle East. Hardware looks really old-ish though well maintained. The Kohler toilet would not stop leaking after flushing, and the window of the building lets rain in after a windy night. Please renovate!\n\n- Breakfast at the MO Lounge is a bit disappointing: our table and chairs were dirty when we were seated; I didn't see the slightest smile on our waiter's face during our entire breakfast (thank god there's room service breakfast with Derek); \n\n- Though an MO member, I booked through my Munich-based boutique travel agent, to support these hard-working gents and ladies. However, MO doesn't give me some membership benefits because I didn't book directly. Does MO really want to turn travel agents into one-booking-only? MO can't be this short-sighted. I know there's pressure to maximise profits by skipping agents, but it'll be smarter to treat them as real long-term partners and not to punish MO members who choose to support these boutique agencies. I do hope MO can find the fine balance between profit and partnership.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The 2nd-day sausage was pork :). Also 2nd day, I ordered orange juice, and I never got it. When I asked about it at the end of the breakfast, they said its coming. But I canceled it.

We are not fans of the Mandarin Oriental, or for that matter, chain hotels in general.  We had an absolutely horrid experience at the Miami Mandarin Oriental, and vowed that we would never darken Mandarin Oriental's doors again.  But we had come to New York to visit Per Se.  You can walk to Per Se without leaving the building, so it was just too convenient to say no.\n\nFrom the time we walked in the door, the New York Mandarin started changing our minds.  A delightful young man, Andres, checked us in and showed us to our room.  I did not take pictures, because the pictures on the hotel\u2019s website fairly depict the room, and it was as represented.\n\nWe booked this trip kind of last minute when Regent Cruise Lines cancelled a cruise and we were scrambling for something to do.  We got a reservation at Per Se and then constructed a little six day adventure from there.  We had three destination restaurants booked: Per Se, Marea, and Peter Lugar.  The concierge helped us fill-in the other three days.  But speaking of the concierge, we could not have asked for better advice than Joel gave us, both on getting tickets to shows, and restaurants that were convenient.\n\nWe can attest that the room is comfortable, because other than our Dinners, and two shows, we pretty much stayed in the room\u2014it was in the teens for much of our stay.  Not that uncommon for us to do.  Order room service midmorning for breakfast, watch the market and trade till an early dinner, and then bed.  We have one major criticism of the room\u2014no electric outlets are convenient to the large sofa in the living room.  We could not keep our laptops plugged-in while we worked.  But we worked around it.\n\nHere is a great thing.  There is a Toto in the main bathroom.  Unfortunately, not in the powder room.\n\nThe location of the Mandarin could not have been more convenient for our needs.  We went to two shows, both of which were less than a mile away.  Two of our destination restaurants, Per Se and Marea could not have been closer.  And all of the fill-in restaurants the concierge sent us to were a short walk.\n\nAll in all, we were very happy with this trip, and New York and the Mandarin will become a regular part of our adventures.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

We were particularly disappointed with room assignment.  Booked park view, and front desk tried to fob off a hudson river side room adjacent to the service elevator.  Sorry, no, we'd like what we paid for.  Wound up in a park view on the 42nd floor.  It had terribly inadequate sound insulation, and, we could hear the guests in the room next door crystal clear.  Not what we expected at 5* prices.\n\nBreakfast was a big disappointment.  Supposedly included with AMEX FHR rate, the benefit only covered about half of a modest breakfast.  Menu was dull, food uninspired, and the service painfully slow (the guy at table next to us sat down, ordered, ate, and paid his check in the time between when we ordered and when our food - a smoked salmon bagel and yogurt with fruit - came).  Even more disappointing was the lack of any enforcement of dress standards.  Guy at table next to us was allowed in wearing hotel slippers, and several guests came straight from the fitness center in their sweaty work out clothes.  Mornings two and three, we had a better breakfast at the Smith on Broadway, for less than the price differential between the FHR breakfast benefit and actual breakfast cost.\n\nNote there are no coffee makers in the room.  They do provide free coffee in the lobby, but you have to get there early.  Our last morning, the concierge mentioned we could have requested a Nespresso machine in the room.  Gee, wish they'd mentioned that at check-in.\n\nOne positive is the staff are (mostly) exceedingly friendly and helpful.  And the location is hard to beat.

When we checked out we were told there were no other charges, but my Amex card was later charged another $126 for snacks from the fridge that we didn't have.  When I called about it, they said we may have vibrated the sensors over the snacks when we opened the fridge.  I suspect that they cater to wealthy people who ignore these little $126charges.

While the Mandarin in NY provided some of the amenities promised, they failed to provide others.  We were NOT offered a room upgrade as the hotel was sold out, so I get that.  However, regarding the allegedly \"Breakfast Included\" as per the Fine Hotels and Resorts, the individual at check-in told us that we'd be offered a free continental breakfast worth $35\/person (total $70 for my wife and myself).  \n\nThe catch is, there is nothing on the menu that would allow you to actually get this sold called breakfast--everything had a high cost.  For example, coffee was $11.  The juice was $15.  A bowl of yogurt and fruit was $23.  It is virtually impossible to get what the AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts promised in terms of \"Breakfast Included\".  Our so-called \"Breakfast Included\" cost a total of $263.63 (including tips, which by the way were a mandatory line item, on top of another line item on the check with space for an additional tip).  \n\nWe've used Fine Hotels and Resorts many times and never has the hotel charged us for breakfast like the Mandarin.  The Penninsula in NYC, Beverly Hills, and Paris included breakfast, the Pierre in Manhattan included breakfast.  The Beverly Hills Hotel included breakfast.  All these hotels provided what was promised on the Fine Hotels and Resorts website without the pecuniary proviso that the Mandarin Hotel offered.  \n\nSimply put, the Mandarin should NOT be listed in Fine Hotels and Resorts if they don't abide by the promises made on the Fine Hotels and Resorts web page.\n\nWe will not be staying at the Mandarin again via Fine Hotels and Resorts for the simple reason they do not follow the rules promised by AMEX on the Fine Hotels and Resorts website.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":281071,"title":"Not What It Used To Be","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-12-20","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We've stayed here a number of times before and, unfortunately, our recent experience left a lot to be desired.  First, upon arriving to our room upon check-in, a dirty rubber glove was laying on the bathroom floor.  There was also a laundry tag laying on the carpet in front of the closet.  Second, they have yet to open the main restaurant, so dining was in the lounge area just off the lobby.  We ate there twice and on the second morning, I had to send my omelette back twicec because it was under-cooked the first two times.  Any local diner can get an omelette right for about $10, so one would expect a $35 omelette to be prepared to perfection.  That was not the case.  Admittedly, I wasn't charged for it, but it would have been nice for me to eat my breakfast with my wife, instead of watching her eat and then her watching me eat.  The third issue concerned room service.  The MO website indicates roomservice is from 6 AM.  Upon checkin, desk staff indicated roomserivce started at 6 AM.  However, the night before checkout we called to order room service for the next morning.  We were informed that the earliest we could expect our breakfast would be 6:45.  When asked about the 6 AM start, we were told that's what time staff arrived.  We reluctantly agreed to place the order, but really needed to be out by 7:30 to catch a train, so we knew it would be tight.  The MO has an SMS communication mechanism they encourage MO Fans to use, so I reached out on SMS to try to get breakfast at 6.  (It was only going to be a Continental breakfast, not an elaborately prepared breakfast, which past experience indicated they couldn't do anyway.)  Using SMS I was told inroom dining didn't start taking orders until 6:30 and it would be after 7 AM before we received our breakfast.  When I pointed out that the website and front desk said it started at 6 AM, they ignored me and didn't reply.  If you are going to have an SMS messaging system for your \"Fans,\" use it appropriately.  Finally, the day before check-out we asked the doorman about getting a taxi for the train station the following morning.  He indicated it would not be a problem, just come down that morning and one would be called from the group always parked on Columbus Avenue.  After checkout on Saturday morning, we arrived at the door to find another family waiting on a taxi and no taxis in sight.  We finally called for an Uber and were able to get to our destination on time.  Meanwhile, the family ahead of us finally had a taxi arrive as we were leaving in our Uber.  So, lots of promises but not so much on follow-through for this stay.  Finally, the room we had, a Central Park view room, was showing wear and tear.  The tiled wall between the shower and bathroom door was cracked from the floor to the ceiling.  Pretty disappointed.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It is already very good because the Spa, the gym and pool are open, not many New York hotels are able to do that.\nLike other MOs, daily house keeping includes cleaning in the morning and turndown service in the evening. It is the familiar \"Jasmin\" music played on the TV that always reminded me that I am in my very favorite hotel.\nHouse keepers are also attend to details like other MOs. Cables of chargers would be tied together and well organized; bath salt would always be replaced when it was used. When meeting a house keeper in the hallway, she could always call me by my last name...this is how MO is unique and why I love MO!  It reminds me that when I stayed in MO Shanghai, even Mr. Clements Hoerth, the general manager, would recognize me and called my name. It is simply amazing.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was clear that as we arrived the hotel was still waking up from being closed for a long time due to Covid.  \n\nOverall we debated whether it was 3 or 4 stars, and decided due to the timing to give the benefit of the doubt with four.  \n\nThe room - We had adjoining rooms.  The beds were comfortable, and for a city hotel fairly spacious.  Well equipped with TVs and charging facilities.  However, no coffee machine? We asked and they brought an  nespresso machine but they didn\u2019t refill our capsules each day, so no coffee in the room.  Also, we asked four times for the minibars to be unlocked and eventually gave up.  So a $700 a night room with no minibar and no coffee machine?  Also in terms of decor it feels more 4* than top end 5*, which is what you are paying for.  \n\nThe staff - The saving grace for us.  Joel the concierge was fantastic, as were all the other people on the concierge desk.  From the doormen to the check in staff everyone was fantastic, helpful and made up feel welcome.  Housekeeping were also lovely and accommodating of the children.  \n\nThe food - Only one restaurant open, limited room service menu.  Not great for a hotel of this standing although yo be fair the food that we did order was good, which you would expect at such high prices.  \n\nThe facilities - Large pool for a city hotel, we didn\u2019t really use anything else.  \n\nNoteworthy - Links directly into the mall at Columbus Circle which was good.  \n\nVerdict - Nothing to complain about but we wouldn\u2019t stay there again.  At this price point there\u2019s a lot of hotels and you should expect something special.   Whilst the staff were great the rest of the hotel just isn\u2019t special.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":281071,"title":"Weekend Staycation","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-06-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Just finished a weekend stay at this place and am writing while it\u2019s fresh in my memory.  Am from the city and now live in tri state so have stayed in hotels throughout the city over the years but never in a true five star as the Mandarin is advertised as being.  We stayed here based on location as we were attending a wedding reception in Central Park.\n\nFirst, we self parked in the attached garage which is literally steps from the hotel entrance.  You can valet with the hotel itself, but decided to just self park.  \n\nUpon entering the main hotel entrance, it is a tad confusing because the entrance is shared with the residences at Mandarin and it isn\u2019t particularly a grand entrance as you would expect from a five star hotel.  It\u2019s more like a nice Manhattan condo.  Regardless, there are a number of enthusiastic and helpful door men and baggage valets there to help.\n\nThe main lobby is on 35 so it\u2019s kind of Asian inspired as many hotels throughout Asia do it like that, with lobbies up in the Sky rather than at ground level.  Anyway, upon entrance you are immediately hit with the spectacular views from the picture windows in the lobby bar\/lounge area which are nothing short of stunning.  You get nice full CPS and lower park views.  Some blockage from Trump hotel but doesn\u2019t detract from the splendor.  Check in was a breeze from the super friendly hotel personnel.  \n\nWe had an upgrade deal to a Central Park view room on 42 and not being jaded by staying here prior I can say the room does look a bit dated from the early 2000s era.  The bed and bedding are not great.  The mattresses flat out need to be replaced.  Period.  End of story.  The RAC rate on my room was over 1200 but we paid far less with a discount rate and upgrade so I wasn\u2019t complaining all that much.  It didn\u2019t hurt my back or anything, it\u2019s just that my bed at home is nicer and that was not expected.  Furnishing are fine and the tv is 4K and rather large.  The minibar is one of those automatic charge ones which is super annoying frankly I really wish hotels stopped using those.  In fairness if you want a separate fridge they offered to give us one but we declined BC I always feel like I have to tip staff on every touch point.\n\nThe bathroom was luxurious and fine.  Separate tub and shower and as someone mentioned on here the tubs are slim.  Our room lacked a bidet but rather had a hand bidet, if that\u2019s what you call it.  Overall the size of the room is fine by NYC standards.  One item that I was not expecting is that the windows are not double paned so you get tremendous noontime to afternoon heat from the sun and you also hear construction (during the week) an fire trucks\/police vehicles etc. even from Floor 42.  Not something that bothers me that much and being that high it definitely is fainter than many other places I\u2019ve stayed.  Didn\u2019t seem to hear it from the Lobby Bar on 35 so not sure is glass is double paned down there or just that the ambient noise blocked it out.  In fairness again, the street noise in our room was not super loud at night.\n\nThe pool was tremendous.  It really is a luxury to not only have a pool in NYC but also a fairly large one like this.  We went three times and no more than three other people were there during our time.  And the guys working that area are fun and friendly guys,  Unfortunately, the hours were awful.  For instance, the pool and gym closed at 4 pm on Sunday.  That\u2019s just plain ridiculous.  The pool area has an amazing view itself of the West Side and Hudson\/NJ and at night it\u2019s probably something. I even ordered a wildly overpriced glass of wine while in the pool so it\u2019s just like any resort from that perspective (other than the pool being indoors).\n\nWill say the minibar items were wildly overpriced and I was overcharged for one item but when I called this to their attention they purported to remove it from my bill.\n\nWe had room service breakfast one day and it took awhile but it came piping hot and delicious and the attendant set up a really nice table for us so it is first class service, albeit, again, wildly overpriced.  We had breakfast another day in the hotel lounge area itself and they were clearly understaffed and the same breakfast that day was underwhelming and we felt a bit rushed which was disappointing but again, that\u2019s a popular spot with limited space.  In addition, don\u2019t bother making reservations there unless you\u2019re like Mick Jagger BC I made some and they were just ignored,\n\nTheir actual restaurant Asiata unfortunately seems to be closed for good so hopefully they can get a replacement for that because the space is very nice.\n\nThe hotel is basically on top of the Time Warner Center mall or whatever they call it these days which is itself kind of dated and less than, given all of the closures, including some of the flagship fancy shmancy restaurants in there.  We ate at Momofuku Noodle Shop which was top notch and the Mandarin has its own cool entrance from the Third Floor of the shops so going to and from the restaurants in the mall area is a snap.  There\u2019s also a Whole Foods in the lower level.\n\nThe area is Columbus Circle which is lively and gives you access to the Park, MONH, etc.  So it\u2019s a great area.\n\nAll in, a solid four plus star hotel only because it seems to be coming back from COVID and the hours restrictions on the amenities are unconscionable at this price point.  We were going to stay at the Park Hyatt solely due to lack of these amenity restrictions but we wanted the views and to that end the Mandarin does not disappoint.  Amazing views and also amazing hospitality all around.  Folks working there really do seem to try to be positive in let\u2019s face it a very negative city these days.\n\nIn sum, would replace the mattresses and bedding and get back to full staffing and restore normal amenities hours and replace the main restaurant and this place would easily recapture five star status without a doubt.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I was surprised to find out that the Afternoon Tea service is no longer offered. That is usually one of the highlights of my trip. The gym and swimming pool closed at 4pm, which is not ideal. At some point hotels should stop blaming everything on Covid, especially when the hotel rates do not reflect the limitations on amenities. The worst part of my experience is that we ate at the restaurant and the food was horrible, coupled with lack luster customer service from our server. For a $35 burger, I was expecting gourmet and delicious, but instead, I got low quality meat that lacked flavor. To add insult to injury, we elected to charge the meal to our room and we did NOT add a tip on the receipt. While I was checking out on our last day, I reviewed my final hotel bill and noticed that the restaurant charge amount differed what I signed on the receipt. The receptionist broke down the pricing and mentioned a $24 tip. I didn't add a tip, I explained and asked to see the signed receipt where it shows that I wrote in a tip. She immediately removed it from my bill, but stated she didn't have the signed receipt. It is illegal for servers\/companies to alter a food bill receipt by changing the tip and total amount. Nevertheless, the reason why I am giving a 4 rating and not a zero, is because the hotel staff were very nice and gave wonderful customer service. The room was cleaned twice a day, which was fantastic. The location was excellent.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

For this return visit, I was looking for familiar, fancy-ish experiences.  These included splurge tasting menus at nearby Jean-Georges and Per Se, and a return stay at the Mandarin.  Aside from an imperfect experience at the MO Lounge, the stay was perfect.\n\nAlthough it had been over 10 years since my last stay here, everything was familiar.  I am a Fan of M.O. and booked online.  I had the pleasure of being assisted by the same pleasant woman (Yahira?) for check-in and check-out, plus she confirmed by phone that I could check-in early.    \n\nThe hotel lobby is on the 35th floor, rooms are on floors 38-54.  MO Residences are above that.  The MO Lounge, Asiate Restaurant (currently closed) and Spa are also on 35; the fitness centre, pool and event rooms are on 36.\n\nI was upgraded to a Central Park View room with a lovely view blocked only by the hotel tower named after a former president.  There was a chaise by the window, spring water in glass bottles, a sensored minibar.  Alas, no USB ports by the bed, and the clock radio was not Bluetooth compatible.  The bathroom was large and luxurious and had a TV in the mirror.  \n\nFront desk staff, housekeeping, in-room dining staff and lower lobby staff (doormen) were uniformly excellent.  \n\nMy stay included daily breakfast, so I made reservations online for the MO Lounge.  Upon arrival the first morning, I told the waiter (there was no host or any other staff at that time) that I had a reservation.  He said there are no reservations for breakfast, it's first come first served.  It was early; there was only one other table occupied.  The room began to fill fairly quickly, and service slowed until a second person came to help.  I ordered the Smoked Salmon Croque Monsieur, but it did not come as described on the menu (pickles instead of an heirloom tomato salad, no Gruyere cheese).    The kicker was I signed for the meal to my room (I took a photo of this bill), but the charge for this meal on my check-out folio was over $13 more than what I signed for, so someone padded the bill in their favour, which was dishonest and upsetting. \n I canceled my seemingly \"unnecessary\" reservations for my remaining 2 breakfasts and enjoyed them via in-room dining instead.  The room service menu had more variety than the MO Lounge menu, the service was better, and although there was a delivery charge, there was no padding.  \n\nStill a pleasant stay, and the hotel is convenient to so many things, especially with the Columbus Circle Metro stop just across the street, Whole Foods downstairs and Per Se upstairs.","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Had wonderful service with every employee that we interacted with and enjoyed the view of the Hudson River from our room on the 45th floor.  The location is great, right on Columbus Circle directly adjacent to Central Park.  There are plenty of bike rental options right outside.  The hotel lobby is on the 35th floor of the building complex.  It's also connected to the mall for shopping and dining options.  There are so many things to explore outside of this building, but it's nice to have something connected in case you can't go outside because of the weather.  They have larger rooms for a larger price, but we opted for the smaller size room.  For NYC, it was still ample size to move around the bed.  The bathroom is large and extends the full length of the room.  I've been the MO in SF which I found the room much larger, but this is NYC after all.  \n\nI have a few tips.... 1) regarding their lounge... make reservations if you think you may want to have a drink or eat there.  We got lucky with getting a seat for drinks and dessert, but it appears that it fills up and there isn't a bar that you can just stand around and hang out... you must be seated.  2) Join their free Fan club - it provided us with a few perks like late checkout in the afternoon and a $50 credit towards our food bill.

During my time there; I stayed at 3 different hotels. The Mandarin was the worst hotel by far. The star I am giving them is for the pool. \n\nThe first night I was there I wanted to have a glass of champagne in the lobby before dinner. My guest and I went down to the lobby around 7 pm. It was packed with people and there was not a bar available. \n\nConsidering that I went over to the front desk and kindly asked if I could grab a lobby seat and have Champagne in the lobby.  The front desk woman, Anita, loudly in a high pitched voice \u201cMadame! No! You will have to check in with the hostess and wait to be seated in the restuarant!\u201d \n\nFirst off, Madame? I am not French or in France. Next this is the first time I\u2019ve asked for a glass of Champagne and someone has said \u201cNo!\u201d So forcefully only my life. \n\nDo you imagine staying at a hotel that charges almost $2k a night and being refused a glass of champagne? Absurd. \n\nWe go check in at the hostess stand and they say it is a 20 minute wait. My guest and I have no choice but to now go sit in the lobby without a refreshment. However, there are people in the lobby with drinks and some drunk girl spills her drink on the table I\u2019m sitting at. See picture below. \n\nWhen the drink is spilled Anita comes over, because she sees I am infuriated and mortified. She cleans up the drink and I look at Anita and say \u201cthis is disgusting\u201d Anita turns to me and in a high pitched tone borderline yelling \u201cshe just spilled it MADAME\u201d! \n\nAt that point Anita should of said nothing and kindly apologized. I asked how they had drinks and we did not. She did not answer the question and walked away. I am blown away at how disgustingly rude she is. \n\nWe ended up finally getting seated. Had one refreshment then headed to dinner. \n\nAfter dinner I was headed to my room. Anita happened to be in the elevator with me and did not acknowledge my presence. She was being very kind to the gentleman in the elevator.\n\nShe is the rudest person I have ever met.  I vacation often. Never have been treated this poorly. \n\nThis past week I stayed at the Mandarin Boston. The level of service is impeccable there.  Whoever is running that hotel should run a workshop to fix the NYC property.  \n\nIn addition to being denied a glass of champagne I asked for a bathrobe when I was at the pool and it took 45 minutes to find one.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It was a very pleasant stay. The arrival experience was the best I think I've ever had at any hotel. A woman warmly greeted me in the crowded lower lobby, asked if I was checking in, then when I said yes, she cleared a path for me through the crowd to the elevator, chatting with me in a friendly and casual manner. Then when I got to the front desk on the 35th floor, I was very impressed by Aneta, who was so warm and professional as she checked me in, smiling and talking with me the whole time. There was a minor mixup with my info on file, but the experience was still superb because of Aneta's personable manner. She's definitely a role model. All the staff I encountered at the hotel were friendly and effective, from the concierges to housekeeping to Asiate restaurant at breakfast. In addition to the Carnegie Hall concert, hotel was a great base for exploring MoMA, Central Park, Neue Galerie, Met museum, Lincoln Center, and attending a Broadway show (took the subway right outside hotel). My Central Park view room was great. Wish the lobby was a little bigger but I could usually find a seat. Checkout experience was very good too. When I asked for a copy of MO Magazine to take with me, the front desk woman made sure that I got it. It was an expensive stay but worth it. This was my third visit in about 5 years.

I had booked this hotel based on the brand name (we have loved the quiet oasis, gorgeous rooms, stellar service at many Mandarins) and the reviews here.  I used Amex Fine hotels and resorts, thank goodness-they got us our money back and found another hotel within five minutes.  I had prepaid and by the time we arrived the room we had booked was $400 less due to a special.  We did not receive an upgrade.  The room was tiny and grubby.  The view was great.  The hotel bar lobby was filled with very loud and drunk people, including one woman calling people the B word in high volume.  Not what I expect from a Mandarin.  I tried to get a different room, but they only one offered was a suite for an additional $600.  The manager, Stacy, was not who I would hire for that position. As we left to check into the Four Seasons, where we got a suite for the same price we were paying for this tiny dirty room, one of the MO employees apologized and guessed the name of the manager.  Evidently many guests are not very happy with her. There are so many fabulous hotels in NY, skip this one.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

As the parents of the Groom, we stayed the night at the hotel.  I cannot say enough about how outstanding this hotel is.  Every element of the wedding was simply perfect.  But let me compliment Nina, the Catering Sales Manager.  As a funny story although it caused me a panic, shortly prior to the start of the ceremony, the button came off my tuxedo jacket (thanks made to measure, first time wearing from a nameless store but it begins with N)  Anyway, in panic mode, I reach out to Nina.  Without batting an eye, she gets on her cell, calls someone, takes my jacket, and in 10 minutes returns with it all taken care of.  Clearly not in her job description, but she knows and fully understands the hospitality business.  She is absolutely the best.  That's not to say all the other people we interacted with were any less.  I just don't know their names.  Take it as fact as I stay in lots of hotels in a variety of countries, this property is outstanding.  Each and every person we interacted with made you feel as though the only person they had to worry about was you.  Now this is not an inexpensive place to stay, but if you can handle it, you owe it to yourself to experience it at least once.  The location by Central Park South and West is just so beautiful and the views are exquisite if you like a city perspective.  And the suites the groom and the bride had resembled an apartment.  But even a standard room is spacious, well designed, comfortable and nicely appointed.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The double vanity in the bathroom was especially convenient. The staff throughout the hotel was incredibly pleasant and helpful. For example, our arriving flight was delayed and we hadn't eaten for some time. The receptionist at The Aviary went out of her way to get us into their sister bar, The Office, early so we could get something to eat before our reservation at The Aviary. The staff members in the restaurant, Asiate, were extremely accommodating. We had a spectacular view of Central Park both mornings we went there for breakfast. The fitness center was well-appointed.

The only service failure was when I called to housekeeping to ask for a small scissors, and the scissors were never sent.  The gym is adequate but too small; the hotel should re-locate the front desk and expand the gym in that area.  In all, I was very pleased with my stay and will be back.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

This tells you that the MO is actually on my good side. My significant other pushed her favored hotel, I lived in NY for some time but stayed only in pre-booked hotels ever since. I wanted to check out the MO so I pushed for it.\n\nOur agent booked a room that would get us the MO upgrade to a 950$ room. The upgrade happened. \n\nFindings:\nSee attached pictures. I am still totally baffled by the poorly maintained room that was run down, tapestry rolling off,  smears and dust everywhere. The room was gloomy and dreary even with all lights on and the sun out in full. Reality is a mile off the photoshopped web version. That's not unusual, yet I can say that visual gap at the MO in HK is nothing like what I experienced in NY. The same goes for the furniture and bathroom hardware\/shower that is made to look high end, yet it's more common to flimsy budget department stores than what one would be used to from high priced premium brand hotels.\n\nWorst of all:\nI practically had to live in an elevator shaft due to the constant elevator noise that could be day and night, and EXTREEMLY annoying. 950$ for a room that has an elevator running through it day and night?! My wife had a friend join her, she experienced the same noise in a different room, and my wife was equally annoyed my the rolling elevator sound. So I am not a hypochondriac making a fuss. \n\nThe MO NY did not drop on our list of NY hotels. It's now #1 on the list of to be avoided by all means hotels in NY; within the category of 5 star premium brand hotels. Rooms of the quality we experienced go for around 350$ if you do your homework, which I obviously did not do. \n\nI hope this feedback leads to a few empty rooms per year and helps others from overpaying for a hotel that's not worth it. \n\nI am writing this while residing in the MO HK as we speak. That's a real MO!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I made our reservation over the phone a long time before our trip, asking for a room as high up as possible and near the southern corner of the building. I confirmed this request by email a week later, confirmed it about a month before the trip, then called two days before our arrival to specify our request again. Each time we were told: \"We can't hold a specific room for you, but it shouldn't be a problem.\" When we finally got there, we were given a choice between a room more or less facing south but TEN FLOORS below the top, or a room 4 floors below the top, but facing north. I don't see why the hotel can't honour a simple request for someone who is staying 5 nights in one of the highest categories of rooms.\nOnce we had checked in and deposited our luggage in the room which did indeed have a nice view (though not the one we were expecting), we went back into the lobby and asked to enter the bar just to take a look for a few seconds. We were told that this WAS NOT POSSIBLE! At the restaurant, the hostess allowed us to take 2 steps in, but then ushered us out! We were told that this is hotel policy, but what did they think we were going to do? Stand on top of the other guests?

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":281071,"title":"Absolutely LOVED Our Stay at the MO NY!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-03-30","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"We had been planning a spring break trip for a little while and settled on NYC. We split our trip into 3 nights near Central Park and 3 nights near the World Trade Center. During our Central Park stay, we chose the Mandarin Oriental New York because of the great reviews, views and pool. Yes - it has an indoor pool!! It is one of very select few hotels in the city that does. And the location can not be beat. Walking distance to Central Park, it is also attached to the Shops at Columbus Circle \/ Time Warner Center including a Whole Foods. Super convenient!\n\nService from check in to check out and everything in between has been flawless. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the doormen where they collected our luggage and directed us to the 35th floor for check-in. At check-in, we were given an upgrade to a Premier Central Park view room on the 45th floor by friendly front desk staff because we booked through a travel agent that had access to MO\u2019s \u201cFan Club\u201d rates. She explained all the perks of the rate at the MO like upgrade at check-in, complimentary breakfast for 2 people, and $100 food or spa credit. \n\nThere is a separate elevator bank that take you to the rooms near the spa. After 7 pm, you have to use your key card. All the rooms at the MO are the same size but with slightly different layouts (except the suites - but they don\u2019t generally comp upgrade to suites, so you gotta shell out money for those). Anyway, since we were there for our kiddo\u2019s birthday week, they gave us a rollaway bed at no extra charge. There were a couple books in the room for the kids that we were able to bring home too. The king bed room was the perfect size to add a rollaway and we still had space to stretch out a tiny bit. The room is big for NYC standards and had a separate bathtub and shower. Online said they had some bathtub toys for kids, but when we called they didn\u2019t have any - just bath safety items (whale themed nonslip mat, knee pad for the parents, spigot cover, drain cover, and thermometer) which was nice too and appreciated. We hardly heard any hallway or outside noise during our stay.\n\nWe chose to eat at in-room dining for our breakfast and one of the dinners. The food is always excellent, but they sometimes forgot to bring certain items though they were quick to send them up when we called back. As for coffee - no, there are no coffee makers in the room. You can either buy coffee through room service OR if you call guest services, they will bring you an old school coffee maker and coffee grinds (the maker and coffee arrive separate) so you can make your own coffee. These are not pods, so you kind of had to experiment a little with water and amount of grinds. For us, 2 bottles of drinking water and the entire bowl of coffee brewed the perfect cup of Joe.\n\nAnother perk of the hotel is its complimentary house car available to all guests on a first come first served basis within about a 10 block radius. We had the same driver when we went to Times Square for the M&M store and then again a different day to Nobu Fifty Seven. It was such a great service to have a friendly and professional driver available for these trips. He was awesome! Nice small talk conversation and even gave us some helpful tips for our visit. There are also water bottles and wet wipes in the car. Don\u2019t forget to tip - these guys deserve it! Really refreshing, especially after experiencing some not so friendly or professional uber drivers. FYI - the MO car service doesn\u2019t pick back up though, only drop-off service.\n\nAnd last but not least, the pool and fitness center on the 36th floor. It is open to all guests. It\u2019s not huge, but quite adequate. Attendants check you in on your first visit and then remember you the rest of your stay. There is a fruit tray right outside the pool and an infused water dispenser in the fitness center. The pool is a long narrow lap pool that starts at 3.5\u2019 and ends at 4\u2019. The attendants are also lifeguards so they watch you while you swim or play. They even had a couple kick boards, pool noodles, and toddler life vest you can borrow during your swim. They also check to see if you need any water bottles when you leave. We were super impressed with the amenities and the staff.\n\nOverall, we could not have asked for a better introduction to NYC. The Mandarin Oriental New York was the perfect 5-star hotel for our stay. We are now continuing our stay near the World Trade Center and wish we were back at the MO. The staff, service and amenities just cannot be beat! Thank you for a great stay!","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It's one of the best in NYC. My thoughts are best broken down into the following bullet points:\n\n35th FLOOR\/RECEPTION:\n- Lobby, reception and bar are top-tier. \n- Francesca (sp?) at the front desk is the best employee at the hotel. Outgoing, warm and enthusiastic she is one of the top reasons for returning.\n- The hotel bar (Aviary) is frustrating as it is a bit of a tourist attraction in and of itself. While it's annoying you can't just saunter up to a table, I've had no issues requesting one an hour or two in advance from the concierge. \n- The drinks at the aforementioned Aviary are amazing. Really creative and fun. The price point is expensive to the extreme, especially for the food. They are charging, on average, $20-$30 for a few bites. For 5 of us, each having two drinks and a couple bites, it wound up being $600. I almost fell over.\n\nROOM:\n- When compared to other hotels of this price point, the rooms feel a bit dated: No designated USB ports, lots of light switches as opposed to an integrated system, etc. \n- The bed and linens were a tier or two below what you'd expect. It was hard and springy. Linens rough and unpleasant. Oddly, I was able to move from a \"Hudson River view\" to a \"Central Park View\" and the linens in the new room seemed quite a bit softer than the previous ones. It was odd. You'd think they'd be consistent throughout. This newer view also made the room seem quite a bit larger thanks to a revised layout that widened the room while placing the bathroom nearer the corridor. \n- Bathrooms are spacious and nice. You'd think the tubs would be a little larger but they are manageable. \n\nETC:\n- The laundry is the most expensive I've encountered. Overnight service for a couple shirts and socks came to $200. No idea if it was a billing error or not, but it was insanely expensive for some basic cleaning sans a suit or tux.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

As all of the rooms are on high floors they are relatively quiet from any street noise, however,  we did on occasion hear a screaming kid running up the hallway which is surprising as one doesn\u2019t hear any noise from the rooms next door. \n\nBeside being a spacious room with king bed, there was a long, comfortable chaise lounge by the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the park. The bed was extremely comfortable (not too firm and not too soft) and the edges of the mattress were reinforced to prevent sagging from sitting on the edge of the mattress and rolling over (if sleeping on one\u2019s side). The bed linens and pillow fill were very nice as were the towels.  The room has an accurate thermostat and we were able to set the temperature to our liking.  There is complimentary water and turn down services. My only suggestions would be to add a night light and exhaust fan in the bathroom.\n\nThe decor is contemporary with tasteful, oriental accents, indoor plants and orchids, and nothing is over the top. The curated colours, textures and design are elegant, calming and rich.\n\nThe restaurant has an excellent array of food offerings and service is of a high standard. We did experience some families with screaming and crying children that were indifferent to others in the lovely restaurant. It\u2019s accepted that young, affluent families stay in nice hotels, however, MO might want to consider a policy for under the age of 12 children where families can dine separately from couples and power meeting breakfasts. It\u2019s a very mellow restaurant and the lack of mindfulness doesn\u2019t project the MO allure.\n\nThere is no traditional lobby. Instead MO offers a scenic lounge on the 35th floor adjacent to the restaurant and reception area which is the perfect place for cocktails and small snacks. Reservations for drinks during cocktail hour are recommended especially if you\u2019d like to sit near the window seats.  The  afternoon we arrived, we observed a few very loud children standing on the leather sofas in the lounge. Perhaps MO should consider a safe, designated playroom where children can express themselves without projecting themselves on other guests.    \n\nIt was a lovely 3 day weekend and by far the nicest hotel we\u2019ve stayed in NY. As we visit NY quite frequently, we hope to make MO our new go to hotel as it had everything we could hope for and more.\n","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's on the West side by Columbus Circle, great location to get to everything in midtown and easy to the subway if you're going far downtown. The room service isn't Michelin star but it's good, and the espressos are great. The views top notch, and the overall fell of the rooms super cozy in the best way.

When you add to this the fact that the hotel is new and extremely well maintained, the rooms are large (for NYC) and the position is great, it's really an unbeatable combination. We recently spent 3 days here, celebrating our anniversary. Even though we're locals, we wanted to treat ourselves and chose the hotel b\/c it has a wonderful spa and a long pool. To our surprise (it's not advertised) it also has a sauna. Although the hotel was full, we were mostly alone in the pool, and the spa was not overly crowded. The rooms with Central Park views were sold out when we booked, but this extremely helpful guy at the front desk found one for us (a room that is normally part of a suite, but was not being used as such). So call them if your room of choice is sold out, they might find a solution. The view towards Central Park is amazing!\n\nA special kudos to house-keeping. I'm not sure we've ever seen bathrooms that shiny or carpets that clean. Also, unlike every other hotel we've stayed in, they organized our toiletries in helpful ways (I'm constantly annoyed when someone un-does my arrangements, but these people made them better). \n\nWe got exactly what we were hoping from our stay here: a few relaxed days with long swimming and gym sessions, a few luxurious hours in the spa, great views, and just steps from two of our favorite bakeries (Bouchon and Kayser). Having stayed in a fair number of expensive but not well run hotels, we fully appreciate the difference great management makes.

The concierge had been amazingly helpful with securing dinner reservations and lunch suggestions. However, the front desk could make some improvements. I had notified the hotel weeks in advance that I was coming with my family for our babymoon.  However, on arrival the gentleman that was checking me in was disinterested and made no acknowledgement that I was here for a special occasion. Furthermore, the couple next to me was being upgraded and given multiple room choices for their room upgrade. On the other hand,there was no mention of an upgrade for my stay despite my stay being booked with FHR program. Very limited on-site dining options and the only restaurant available for lunch has strict cut off times. We had checked into the hotel at 1:30 pm and went directly to the restaurant at 2:05 pm and was told they were no longer seating for lunch after 2:00 pm. We also had our young son with us and there was no special welcome gesture that we have come to expect from other brands like the Four seasons or The Ritz. The hotel does have a unique place to grab a cocktails at the Aviary bar. Very creative cocktails with great views! Overall, I would likely check out one of the other central Park hotels next time I come to NYC. I still enjoy the Mandarin Oriental brand but this hotel has been my least favorite one.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

However the room itself, you hear a fair amount of noise from above. I\u2019ve never had that in a hotel before. Just shoes on the floor above, endlessly. The much bigger issue is the blackout drapes don\u2019t really black out. I called for someone to help at about 6am when it was already fairly bright, and maintenance agreed it seemed weird for such an expensive suite to have curtains that don\u2019t overlap. He tried (as I did) to push them together but didn\u2019t work. They also left gap at the wall. He offered to come back later with tape to try and tape them to the wall and together. That just seems a little low rent for Mandarin\u2014 for something a thousand dollars more than Park Hyatt\u2019s much nicer city view suite (where I didn\u2019t need tape!Service at Hyatt not nearly as good but sleep wins!) So in summation: staff is super nice\u2014 manager heard about curtains and at check out apologized saying he wish he knew it was issue at check in (not sure how I\u2019d know before dawn) but small rooms and the suite (at least #4500) can\u2019t sleep much past dawn.

The Aviary is quite pleasurable & I for one had already been a loyal fan of this grande space for several years.   \n\nNow, gazing up at the sweeping new overhead light installation, it did indeed appear that Mickey Mouse was magically conducting the swirling back & forth-shaped illumination dancing across the ceiling. The Aviary is located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel lobby which features panoramic views 35 floors over Central Park that regularly melt the heart of even the most seasoned traveler. \n\nSwirling lines of the ceiling lights are picked up again by sweeping lamp-stands curving up & over massive sectional couches & dropping down-light over the central seating areas. They add dynamic whimsy to an already magnificent space.\n\nKnown from the start for its promise of \"atomic\" cocktails theatrically steaming with dry-ice explosions of brandy & bourbon & tequila, I confessed today that I had never actually seen one of these concoctions being served & only knew them from photos, since I usually come to the hotel at lunch-time. To my delighted surprise, the Bar Manager, Berit Soli-Holt, graciously indulged me with an amazing personal demonstration, up in the bar's staging area. \n\nThe Aviary cocktails are crafted by \"liquid chefs\" at an expansive bar space displayed behind floor-to-ceiling glass which stretches the length of The Aviary above & behind us, while we guests gaze out at Central Park. As Berit told me the story of The Aviary, she produced wonderful rum-spiced steam rushing over the counter from a slim-necked chemist beaker at the bar. \n\nAll of this inspired me to try out her suggestion of a \"Boom,\" as she called it, with my salad. This is the special cocktail known as \"Boom Goes the Dynamite,\" in which she stirred up a combination of rums, vanilla, violet \u2014 with just a gourmet touch of ver-jus and \"rooibos,\" which is some sort of South African herb. After a few minutes of fragrant rum explosion at my table, a straw was playfully served \u2014 although I preferred a glass, which was delivered frozen, to best set off the flavors of the drink.\n\nBoth times I've enjoyed the chicken sandwich, it has been delivered by the chef himself & combined a spicy fried chicken cutlet dressed with creamy sauce & lightly pickled cucumber slices ever-so-carefully fanned out on a sesame bun. Most dishes \u2014 such as my Orchard Salad today \u2014 are garnished with colorful flourishes of edible blossoms, often pansies, fresh plucked from the stem. The little movie-savvy princess & her mother were gone by the time I finished a cappuccino, but I will always remember her imaginatively \"conducting\" the ceiling lights like Mickey Mouse for me.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Second, at this price point, I think there are several hotels in NY that are much nicer (such as the Park Hyatt, The Peninsula and St Regis).  We have also stayed at several mid-tier hotels (mostly W\u2019s) and have found the rooms and service to be at least as nice for less than half the price.  \n\nThe night we checked in, we were disappointed to see that the bathroom had not been properly cleaned and there were several strands of hair in the shower.  Also, when they did the turn-down service, they did not leave chocolate mint by the hotel \u2013 they were happy to bring it if you called and were actually surprised that it wasn\u2019t already there \u2013 on all 3 nights.\n\nBreakfast at Asiate was nice.  The Aviary is the best part of the hotel \u2013 it is in the hotel but managed by the Alinea group of Chicago.  If you are staying at the hotel, you don\u2019t need to book on Aviary website, which requires a non-refundable deposit.  We ordered BF in room one morning and it the room service would not answer the phone despite long tries.

Lamentablemente la elecci\u00f3n no fue buena, si bien debo destacar que el Mandar\u00edn Oriental es un verdadero cinco estrellas. El problema comienza con la propuesta que hace el hotel, que es mas bien una trampa muy seductora. Contrat\u00e9 el servicio de traslado de lujo que ofrec\u00eda el hotel y a mi llegada estaba esperando una Se\u00f1ora que, con cordialidad, nos invit\u00f3 a esperar 15 minutos en el exterior del aeropuerto JFK hasta que finalmente lleg\u00f3 el Mercedes Benz clase S. Llegamos al Mandar\u00edn a las 11 hs. esperando poder acceder a la habitaci\u00f3n ya que la propuesta inclu\u00eda Check-in a mediod\u00eda (\"sujeto a disponibilidad\"). No fue as\u00ed, la habitaci\u00f3n reci\u00e9n estar\u00eda disponible a las 16 hs. o en su defecto, por tan s\u00f3lo 600 d\u00f3lares diarios m\u00e1s, ten\u00eda una subida de categor\u00eda y en ese caso s\u00ed hab\u00eda una habitaci\u00f3n disponible. Quiero resaltar que tambi\u00e9n la subida de categor\u00eda estaba incluido en la propuesta (sin costo adicional) y tambi\u00e9n era \"sujeto a disponibilidad\". Esto puede verse en la p\u00e1gina del Mandar\u00edn Oriental de New York. Tambi\u00e9n estaba incluido el desayuno diario para dos personas. Pues bien, tampoco era tan as\u00ed, ya que s\u00f3lo inclu\u00eds 40 d\u00f3lares de consumo \"a la carta\", por persona. Es decir que para el precio del hotel, es algo as\u00ed como un caf\u00e9, leche, cuatro tostadas y agua e impuestos. Cualquier otra cosa,  deb\u00eda pagarse aparte, es decir que no hab\u00eda en realidad un desayuno al que estamos acostumbrados en los viajes a Estados Unidos. Eso s\u00ed el WIFi efectivamente estaba incluido, sin costo adicional, tal como lo establec\u00eda la oferta. En suma, para no caer en una situaci\u00f3n de disgusto que me impidiera disfrutar de mi descanso, decid\u00ed aceptar que el Mandar\u00edn Oriental con su ambig\u00fcedad, habr\u00eda dado cumplimiento a la oferta, en los t\u00e9rminos de la propuesta. La estad\u00eda me cost\u00f3 el DOBLE de lo previsto. Deb\u00ed pagar m\u00e1s de 1600 d\u00f3lares por d\u00eda tan s\u00f3lo por la habitaci\u00f3n (Suite en el piso 52) y el no-desayuno. Una verdadera decepci\u00f3n. Realmente esperaba m\u00e1s de tan prestigioso lugar. Mi esposa y yo disfrutamos mucho de la estad\u00eda pero desayun\u00e1bamos fuera del hotel y ten\u00edamos la disponibilidad econ\u00f3mica para pagar \u00e9se lujo. En New York hay infinidad de mejores y m\u00e1s aut\u00e9nticas propuestas. La correcta traducci\u00f3n del Mandar\u00edn al espa\u00f1ol es \"sujeto a disponibilidad\" = \"se cobrar\u00e1 como adicional\"; y al desayuno faltar\u00eda aclarar que se acreditan 40 d\u00f3lares por persona del men\u00fa a la carta. Si hubiera estado con menores, el desayuno s\u00ed habr\u00eda sido un verdadero problema ya que cobraban todo, todo y muy caro.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Housekeeping was incredible, they tidied and refreshed with attention to detail such as replacing a small tube of toothpaste when they spotted we had run out and making the bed and changing the towels even though we were a late check out. The best we have ever experienced anywhere in the world.  We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning, it is a table service breakfast so no opportunity to help yourself at the buffet, this makes service a little slow and we had quite a wait one morning although we were given coffee in the lobby as we waited. Orders arrived wrong and we had to send the toast back to ask for it be actually toasted! So maybe a little fine tuning required on the breakfast front.  Other than that guests can dine in the hotel or take a quick spin in the elevator down to floor three where there is a plethora of dining opportunities within Columbus Circle.  The concierge was very helpful and knew the magic words to get tables at restaurants that were packed.  Thanks Concierge team! The Aviary bar in the hotel is great fun with a madcap scientist approach to drinks so we had a slingshot that had to be cracked to reveal the drink, a steaming glass flask that contained a the drink and a ship in a bottle to name but three!  Not cheap but a great bit of theatre, and the drinks a good too.  There is also The Office which is like a speakeasy hidden behind a door.  \nThere is a well equipped gym, a lap pool and a spa that is right there on floor 35 where you check in rather than hidden in the subterranean depths of the hotel as they very often are.\nFrom Columbus Circle all of New York is at your feet with subway stations nearby and Central Park across the street the location couldn't be better.  We had a great stay and will be back.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We stayed at MO in Kuala Lumpur and this was miles away from this hotel, they need to take some tips from KL on how to treat others.

First, during the reception, there were tables filled with empty glasses that were never cleared. Second, we go in to the ballroom for dinner and during the first course, we were not served bread. There was a plate of butter and other tables had bread, yet when we asked the server, she told us it was not being served. When the first course was finished, they half cleared the tables. As the main course was served, one of my friends was on her way back from the ladies room and she was refused service. She waited nearly 20 mins for her dinner. As wine was served during this course, the used my shoulder to balance the bottle. Finally, during the dessert service, the plates were thrown onto the table rather than placed. This meant that the rather delicate mousse was splattered all over my arm. The servers did not apologize nor bring fresh plates. We had to consistently flag down the servers for wine and when I requested tea, instead of coffee, the server rolled her eyes and said she\u2019s be back. By the time she finally arrived with my tea, everything was being cleared. \n\nThe event space was beautiful, it overlooks the park and Columbus Circle, but for the kind of money that was paid to host the event, I am appalled by the quality of service.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We pretty much dealt with our own cases and made our way in, we were directed to the lift by somebody inside the ground floor entrance and up we went to the 35 floor. Usually in hotels of this magnitude your bags are whisked and you are ushered to reception by a member of the front door team, this was noticeable but wasn't any major concern. Check-in lady was excellent & efficient and took us up to our Hudson-Twin. I was travelling with my friend and we were in NY for the Opera. Twin rooms are invariably the lower category rooms in deluxe hotels from my experience, this twin was lovely and comfortable, although due for its twenty year refurb now as the decor is looking tired and dated. No fruit in the room but I guess this is because of our lower category room. No heated towel-rail in bathroom or heated floor, which is pretty standard these days in top hotels, but the general layout of the bathroom was good with great shower and bath with a view. The room was very comfortable with quality furnishings and fixtures, albeit nearly twenty years old. The room had a nice walk-in closet with space for our things. Beds\/linen top quality, super-comfortable, the glassware, crockery etc was quality, tea\/coffee-making facilities in-room were very good, fresh-ground coffee and percolator provided to make lovely fresh coffee instead of those awful 'pod' machine things that many hotels are using these days. Fresh milk provided in silver jug which kept it cool. These were good finer details. There was no magnifying mirror fixture in the bathroom but we phoned down for one and an excellent illuminated portable one was delivered within ten minutes. Excellent body products in the bathroom, re-stocked generously. Housekeeping and turn-down was good, but only received bedtime pillow chocolate on the first of our four nights. Complimentary bottled water generously provided in room. Room service was prompt and the fresh milkshake brought up to my room late at night was delicious. The restaurant was beautiful, it's had a fairly recent make-over and the views of Central Park and Midtown are awesome. Breakfast was delicious, delicious freshly-squeezed Grapefruit juice, delicious Canadian proper bacon, all five star, and the management team and servers are extremely pleasant and professional. We didn't manage to get a window seat on our visits to the restaurant but this was no big deal. We got great views and photo moments from the Ballroom upstairs, it was not in use during our stay and on a couple of mornings after my swim I sneaked in to sit in the window to admire the views! The hotel reception area is beautiful, although it too is due for a modernisation I am led to believe. Concierge guy, William if I remember, was excellent and very knowledgeable about his great City. The Pool was great, big enough for a good workout, the Pool room was a bit on the cold side, not sure if this was because I went down early morning, but with small kids this area would be too cold, air-con blowing cold during winter in a big pool area made for a very cold space. Pool attendants were polite and professional. My morning sauna was not the best, it just got colder and colder and after 30 mins in there I realised it was not working correctly. I went to the guy at the Pool desk and he came and fiddled with it and said it had shut itself down, he said it would be lovely and hot the following morning but it wasn't ever really up to usual Sauna temperatures. Also, the Sauna floor under the boards looked like it hadn't been scrubbed in quite a long time. For a hotel of this rating this basic hygiene slacking was disappointing. Pool changing area and gym were of a good standard with nice ice-cold citrus water machine and fruit basket laid on. There was a slight issue with our usage of the Spa facilities, we'd gone down to use the facilities and was told by a Spa member of staff that the vitality pool and steam room were not working, but then when we got back to our room and rang down and complained to the duty-manager that we hadn't checked into supposedly the best hotel in NY to then learn that the vitality pool & steam room wasn't working, she got straight on the case and we were invited straight back down to use the facilities. It was obvious to me that the Spa member of staff was attempting to reserve the Spa for people coming for treatments and for members maybe, thus attempting to usher hotel guests back to their rooms with lame stories about facilities not working. This is a very poor philosophy as the simple fact is, without paying hotel guests there would be no Spa. I realise that they are offering a deluxe service for Spa treatment customers, but this must not be to the detriment of the hotel guests who rightfully wish to come and have a steam and wallow in the vitality pool. This issue was dealt with promptly by management and my friend and I were welcomed to use the Spa facilities for the duration of our four night stay, and the standard usage charges were wavered for all of our Spa visits, which made amends and reconfirmed my trust in the MO brand. It has to be said that the Spa is now in need of modernisation, the relaxation room\/beds are very comfortable and the Spa changing rooms well fitted, but the vitality pool space does now need refurbishment, floor tiles etc need replacing around the vitality pool and in the showers. The steam room is dated although it is a quality steam room, and as usual for MO hotels, the vitality pool is great, hot and powerful, although it did stop a few times and the man had to come and jiggle buttons to get it going again. For all of the little niggles, I still loved my time at the MONY, once the bedrooms, main reception, Spa thermal area etc are modernised, there is no reason why the MO cannot claim to be the best hotel in New York and certainly back up there with Four Seasons, Peninsular and Park Hyatt. I would certainly consider choosing the MO on my next visit to New York... Mark Drinkwater.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Our room wasn\u2019t ready, so we decided to have a quick bite at The Aviary NYC before our matinee -- other luxury hotels welcome guests with a bit of bubbly, unfortunately, not Mandarin Oriental. When we got back to MO after dinner, we were given our keys. Our room was on the 48th floor and we had high expectations, until we walked in and found two twin beds! Seriously? Both Hilton and Marriott can accommodate with two queens, or doubles at the very least. We were appalled that a luxury property, with 4-figure nightly rates, provides twin beds to adult guests. The chocolate treat delivered to celebrate the birthday was too little, too late. Upon waking, we found our view blocked by the mirrored side of the building next door. The live orchid in the bathroom was a nice touch; however, one of the lights over the sink was dark and remained so through the duration of our stay. Furthermore, the furniture was oddly placed:  while there was a floor lamp in the corner of the room, there was no chair. There was a tiny chaise at the end of one of the twins, but no chaise at the end of the other. Since we saw no complementary coffee in the lobby, we decided to have breakfast at Asiate. While the food was good, no cold croissant is worth $30 \u2013 not even in NYC. Shame on MO! Luckily, The Spa at Mandarin Oriental did not disappoint and we enjoyed a number of awesome services. We had wanted to schedule mani\/pedis, but were informed that those services were no longer being offered. That being said, mani\/pedi services remain listed in the hardcopy spa brochure in the notebook on the desk. How hard is it to tape over the listing? The next morning we called to see if complementary coffee was offered (of course this 5-star room has no Keurig) and found out that the coffee set-up in the lobby is dismantled at 7AM, but is available \u2018upon request\u2019 at the restaurant. One would think with the mission statement: \u201cto delight our guests each and every day\u201d that someone might have brought some up to our room. We thought we we could provide some feedback at checkout, but we were never asked about our stay. The Front Desk could learn some valuable lessons from hotel chains that charge half their rate. MO NYC was opened in 2003, and it appears that they are way past due for some refresher training about the meaning of providing the very best in luxury hospitality.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The view to the central park, for which I had to pay extra, was extremely ruined by the Trump International black building right in front of the window. This wasnt shown online. When I complained about it, I was told that many guests comolained about the same thing all the time but there was nothing they could do. I felt scammed. #fakeadvertising\nThe room service always took like 2 hours to come so I decided to start ordering food from restaurants arround the hotel. The food frome these arrived to the hotel door in much less time than the room service.However, the hotel made sure that wasnt the case. They took 30 minutes or more to deliver it from the door to my room, every single time. It is obvious they were doing this to make me stop ordering food outside and continue ordering it to room service.\nThe gym is extremely small and lacks some essential machines. The indoor pool was very cold; taking into account that the weather was very cold, it should have been warm.\nThe people who cleaned the rooms were exceedingly invasive, every time I went into my room someone was inside. If I had the \"do not disturb\" light on (this wouldnt allow them to ring the bell of my room), THEY WOULD KNOCK MY DOOR. Dont you understand the meaning of privacy? \nThe decoration of the hotel was horrible, distinctly old, who ever chose it has exceptionally awful taste. \nAnd last but not least, the elevator system was really slow. It took for me at least 25 minutes to get to the ground floor and I had to take two elevators.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel has direct access from the third floor to great shopping mall that has upscale shops and restaurants and even a Whole Foods in the basement.

After a warm greeting --valet escorted us up to the Lobby. \n\nStaff at the front desk was very friendly and gave us another warm  welcome and wonderful room. all staff were very accommodating throughout our stay.  We have a Maltese dog and there is a $ 250.00 pet fee,   $ 150.00 per stay and $ 100.00 refundable cleaning fee.\n\nThe hotel is within walking distance of the performing arts at City Center and Lincoln Center . The hotel and City was beautifully decorated for the Holidays. We also very much enjoyed the mall-shops at Columbus Circle which we could enter from inside the Hotel. There is a Whole Foods Restaurant and we enjoyed purchasing snacks, fresh juices, and eating from their buffet.\n\nOur room was on the 53rd floor--a Hudson River view room. The room was well designed with spectacular views of the City and New York Skyline. Good views of the Hudson--partially obstructed by other buildings.It came with a $ 75.00 per day meal or Spa allowance.WiFi was included.\n\nThe bathroom was wonderful! Large with double sinks, a deep tub with views overlooking the City and Hudson River, and a TV,  and a large and separate shower. \n\nThe King size bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the magnificent views and sunsets from the room and the bed.\n\nCleaning could have been better--the room was not automatically vacuumed daily. We had to request it along with a change of linens daily. Housekeeping aims to please and we found Housekeeping will honor requests about cleaning the room, extra pillows, towels, and toiletries, etc. \n\nRoom service was excellent--a broader menu would enhance it. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel. Elected to try nearby restaurants and really enjoyed Jean Jorges at nearby Trump Tower.\n\nHad a terrific and relaxing massage at the Spa.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":281071,"title":"Borderline tired...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-12-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Just spent one night at MO NY for a mini staycation. \nWife and I do that 4-5 times a year since our little one showed up. Nothing like a 24h break in a hotel with a pool and spa -assuming the facilities are really nice.\nSadly, our high expectations were not fully met at the Mandarin. Surprising since I am usually a fan of Asian five star chains or hotels, and stayed at many Mandarin which always gave me full satisfaction.\n\nArrival:\nLobby elegantly decorated but setup in such a way that you feel like you just stepped into Grand Central Station at rush hour. Very busy every time we went through it (granted it was during the xmas-New year period so one can expect lots of tourists.) But the issue is the long line of people waiting to have access to the tea salon or adjacent lobby bar. And if you feel that because you\u2019re a guest paying close to $1,000 a night you will have some kind of priority when you decide to spend an hour there and soak up the beautiful views over Central Park and Columbus Circle, well think again.\nThe front desk agent checking you in will waste no time telling you that the hotel has outsourced the management of those two spaces to some obscure Chicago-based company and that should you want to get in, you will have to book a reservation via the concierge. Am I still talking about the only places for drinks in the lobby area? Yes I am.\n\nRoom:\nWe booked a standard room via Amex Plat and we didn\u2019t have an upgrade. Again, no big deal since busy season and we were not really expecting one. After seeing the first room (4818), we asked for another, that would have less of a weird layout. That room was actually accessible, which explains the unusual layout. We were moved to 5332, which while much smaller, was a bit more Mandarin style. Great views from the high floor.\nSmall-ish bathroom, with only one vanity. And I just don\u2019t get this. 5 Stars h\u00f4tel in a very modern building and they couldn\u2019t design the room with a double vanity bathroom? Strange. Not a deal breaker but strange. Room was elegant in the Mandarin-asian zen traditional style. \nBut I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what made the overall experience disappointing. I just kept having the feeling that the room\/furniture\/hallway\/wall paint etc...were tired.\nThe property is definitely ripe for a renovation when you consider other similarly priced properties such as the Baccarat, the Peninsula, Four Seasons Downtown and many more.\n\nIn-room Dining:\nOrdered dinner before our show at the Dizzy\u2019s jazz club in the same building. One of the dishes, a market salad, had a very fishy taste that both wife and I had a strong reaction about. We didn\u2019t touch it past one bite. Looked at the menu to make sure and no, no fish ingredients listed. Called to indicate the issue. Got some very polite apologies but the dish was not removed from the bill by the time we checked out. I didn\u2019t say anything because its not very elegant but still...\n\nSpa:\nOver Asia and other countries, the spa at Mandarin properties have very high reputations so our expectations were high. My massage with Nicolette was excellent but the overall experience was a bit of a letdown. Firstly, the entrance is on the 35th floor, right next to Grand Central mentioned earlier and we debated before heading down whether we should don our plushed bathrobes or get dressed. We opted for jeans. Who walks in Grand Central in a robe? Once in the spa, everyone is very polite and kind. But there again, not sure why, the setup didn\u2019t scream exclusive and elegant spa. Was it the floor to ceiling windows that made the atmosphere cold? The lighting? Anyway, we didn\u2019t feel like we were in a 5 Stars spa in the middle of one of the most expensive cities in the world. Again, this is my subjective opinion.\n\nPool:\nIt\u2019s located one flight above the spa and there is conveniently an elevator to bring you there from the spa, without having to go trough Grand Central. But then again, you\u2019re in for a scary experience. This elevator is brutal. You know the kind that you don\u2019t know when it leaves and you\u2019re already there? Well, that\u2019s not one of those. It\u2019s more like a version of riding an elevator in SF in the middle of the BIg One. Everything shakes when you depart and when you arrive, and the trip takes an hour. The pool is a nice size (for NY standards)and the water had a good temperature. What was bizarre is that even though we came from the spa elevator, we were asked to sign in. Why I wonder? All guests from the spa have access to the pool so I missed the point. It just didn\u2019t feel like you were in a Mandarin... Also, there were 3 persons at the desk who were busy tasting chocolates (from Maison du Chocolat, my favorite so I can\u2019t blame them) but once we got to the pool which was empty, we noticed dirty towels on every single bed. None of the desk persons followed us in the pool area and there was only one clean towel on the shelf so I had to go back in and ask for one. Got one, and then we proceded to remove the used towels from a bed so we could put our belongings. Again, not the top notch service I came to expect from properties like the Mandarin.\n\nFitness:\nLocated next to the pool area. I decided to check it out after the pool but since I had left my sneakers at the spa reception, i was in for another dreaded elevator ride to get them and use it again to go back. Fitness equipment is excellent, new, and in great working condition. Odd thing was I couldn\u2019t find any towels. No shelves. I saw the basket where you can dispose of the used towel but I\u2019m still perplexed about the missing towels. Was the shelf right there, staring at me and I missed it? Who knows. The point is, towels ina fitness room should be the first thing that your hand encounters.... you should not go on an expedition trying to find one...\n\nConclusion:\nBusiness in NY is tough. Competition is strong and one has to keep up with standards being raised every day. I get it. And that\u2019s why my review here is a bit severe. I tried many competing properties and the way I see it, in the current state this hotel is in, there are no reasons why we should plan another staycation at the Mandarin. Just too many missed opportunities to leave a lasting impression on guests who are familiar with the brand.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Fruit bowl much appreciated, as was the daily NYTimes.  Kettle\/tea-making provided on request.  The bathroom was particularly good, very spacious with a large shower and lovely bath.  Decor is of course bland, and the carpet was particularly brown and depressing, but these things are to be expected in international hotels.  Some of the public areas are quite dark too and I found it very irritating that there was not a guest bar.  Luckily Gabriels (just across the road) is a an excellent bar\/restaurant highly recommended. \nI actually chose this hotel for its lap pool, which did not disappoint.  Had several terrific swim sessions, mostly with the pool to myself.  It is a lovely space to be in, excellent water quality and not too hot.  Designed for swimmers.  Unusual for a hotel pool.

We were planning on sleeping in that morning but it was not meant to be. I almost slept through it but they kept calling over and over again!!!\nPossibly an honest mistake (albeit a rookie one), but the thing that bothered me about it was the reaction by the staff member when I checked out. She said \"sorry,\" but that was it. And then as she finished checking me out, she laughed and said \"next time, we won't wake you up at 5:00 AM!\"\nTBH, I might have given this hotel 5 stars, but the attitude and discourteous nature of the woman whom I checked out with, just ruined it. The single most important thing a hotel can do is provide a good night's rest.

Initial impressions were very good, we had a lovely high room overlooking the river (high up is good if you want to escape the noise and obviously have a great view), the room was clean and had all the facilities and was a good size, although it was a little tired and needed a bit of updating. Bed was very comfortable. Staff were very attentive. The restaurant Asiate was great for breakfast, lots of choice and good service. (but please don't refill my teacup, I am British and I like to pour it myself. I had to guard the teapot!)  The reception and concierge were incredibly helpful, as were the doormen. \nThere were a couple of niggles. One afternoon we wanted to sit and have a drink in the Aviary but we weren't allowed to sit by the window as those seats were reserved for 'larger' parties. However the place was empty, but they 'helpfully' said they wouldn't seat anyone by the window directly in front of our allotted table so as not to spoil our view. So why could we not sit by the window then? It remained free for the entirety of our refreshment. My husband and I felt it was a silly rule when the bar was very quiet. \nWe went to the spa where we both had a fantastic massage. The only thing that let the side down a little was the pool reception staff were a little unprofessional, they were swearing and mucking about which didn't necessarily bother me, but it might have bothered some guests. \nWe went to Asiate one evening and had their tasting menu with the wine. The food was good, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting for the price. I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu and would choose differently if I went again. I didn't feel we had value for money with the wine either. It all felt a bit rushed. However they were accommodating with a menu change for my husband. It just lacked a bit of 'occasion'. \nHaving read this back, it sounds a bit harsh, generally speaking we had a great time, just a couple of things that let the side down but certainly didn't alter the fact that we had an incredible time. I would certainly recommend the hotel, but with hindsight I would probably eat out and I would be more insistent about sitting where I wanted in a quiet bar. We had a fantastic experience and New York is a fascinating city.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Nothing missed, room ready early, and my wife's feather allergy was accounted for when we got to the room.\n\nOur room was a standard room, overlooking the River.  It was as expected, not too small, but everything is in the room was in tip top shape. Great TV, comfortable bed, large bathroom with 2 sinks, overall, the room was great.\n\nHousekeeping did a great job each day, beds made as expected, towels replaced daily, nothing out of place.\n\nNightly turn down was not consistent. The first night, there was water left on each bed table, the rest of the stay this did not happen.  The first night, chocolate was left on the pillows, the rest of the night, this did not happen.  It almost seemed that the weekend staff was going through the motions, and didn't follow those steps.\n\nThe bar area was under construction and could not be used.  This is really disappointing, and there was no mention of this, except during check-in.  Renovations occur, but have some sort of accommodation for your guests.\n\nHere is where it falls from a 5 to 4-Star hotel.  The doormen.  They are really not helpful.  At least 4 times, no one was there to open the door.  They were standing inside by the Bell Desk.  I understand that there are other guests, but the first impression when coming to the hotel is the most important, and most memorable. There should always be a doorman.  I know when I go to the Mandarin in Miami, I have never opened a door into the hotel and I am always greeted by someone. This did not happen here.\n\nI get that my complaint is a first world problem, but that is a mark that distinguishes the top hotels in the world.

The beds are comfy, and bathroom facilities are nice.\nThere was no lounge while I was there, no where to crash after a hard days shopping for afternoon Tea or coffee, before venturing back out into the city for the evenings entertainment.

Impera a mais absoluta tranquilidade;\nContrariamente ao informado em algumas avalia\u00e7\u00f5es, n\u00e3o houve cobran\u00e7a pelo recebimento de mercadorias compradas pela internet. No dia em que minha encomenda chegou, telefonaram a meu quarto avisando e perguntando se poderiam encaminhar o produto ao quarto naquele momento.\n\nO frigobar apenas pode ser utilizado para consumo dos produtos oferecidos pelo hotel (caso voc\u00ea tire alguma coisa do lugar, o sensor avisa e o produto j\u00e1 \u00e9 cobrado).\n\nO hotel conta com um bar e um restaurante concorridos e elegantes, com piscina e academia (no 36\u00b0 andar, proporcionando treinos com invej\u00e1veis vistas), assim como com um dos melhores SPAs de NYC. \n\nEmbora o pre\u00e7o da di\u00e1ria seja superior ao da maioria dos demais hot\u00e9is da cidade, entendo que o custo-benef\u00edcio \u00e9 excelente, considerando todas as comodidades que s\u00e3o oferecidas.

We have stayed in rooms facing either the Hudson River or the Central Park. The view could greatly improved, if the Trump Hotel is shifted about fifty blocks to the left. The hardware of the hotel combines elements of the MO in Las Vegas such as the open lobby, it also has the grand view like the MO in Tokyo and also the massive size of the DC property.  Service is where it slides quite a bit in comparison. First visit, the receptionist barely made eye contact. The spa is also a real let down, I have had better massage at the local YMCA for fraction of the price.  The spa receptionist was outright rude, and therapist was in a rush and had the touch of a limp fish.  The views of the central park from the restaurant is breathtaking, but when the regular F&B manager is not on duty, the food and service can be all over the place.  Empty coffee pot left unattended, welcome smoothie not served and seating out of order.  One morning, the steak and eggs rubbery and the Japanese breakfast inedible on second try.  Most embarrassing was my hosting of a Sunday brunch; we were fortunate enough to be seated in the side room.  However service was neglected, drinks barely refilled and food mediocre at best.  Upon giving feedback to the substitute manager, we were told \"they were busy.\"  I still like the MO, it has lovely room and a very generous bathroom. The duty managers go above and beyond and readily rectifies short comings.  I just wish the MO service philosophy trickles down stream.  Otherwise, having a cup of coffee, reading the New York Times and just looking at the gorgeous views of the Central Park, makes this place worthwhile staying.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had just delighted in NYC's own \"Manhattan-henge\" sending startling sunset straight thru the crosstown streets & came home to the hotel to find this new treat. \n\nLocated on our 35th-floor hotel lobby with other Mandarin Oriental courtesy services, including its fragrant spa & the Asiate Restaurant (which still serves my favorite NYC corporate breakfast with eagle-soaring views), this jewel of a cocktail haven is accessed, with the help of the concierge & a reservation, through a velvet-draped hidden passageway. \n\n\"THE OFFICE: NYC\" is all about service. Our hosts, Sebastian & Anthony, tucked us into a comfortable dining nook with rich leather seating & dark wood to enjoy discovering this new bar with the feel of a private speak-easy. \n\nBrass antiques abound, with little secrets appurtenances, like a dancing monkey sculpture & a non-functioning antique radio which swivels open to reveal brandy & crystal highballs ready to pour out the fun. \n\nEven though a special \"THE OFFICE: NYC -- EXTINCT SPIRITS & ANTIQUITIES\" menu was served, with liquor arranged by historical decade, the approach with our cocktail order was an emphasis on personal interplay with our bartender. \n\nNicholas, quite the drinks-master, scoped out my abiding preference for wine, even over his inventive cocktail suggestions & he graciously provided me with a Ch\u00e2teau Pressac Saint-\u00c9milion Grand Cru Class\u00e9 2007 which was not even on the menu for my drinking pleasure before the Lincoln Center Festival ballet started, performed right there in the hotel building at the Rose Theater. \n\nWhat a prince of a wine this was to taste. First of all, classy fruit presented itself in the nose with the rest of its heady almost-caramel fragrance. And then, on the tongue, a well-rounded smooth\u200b, actually\u200b rather extravagant\u200b Bordeaux. Although the non-stem wine-glasses are not to my liking, I admit they are\u200b \u200bof late\u200b stylishly cutting-edge.\n\nLovely \u200bsignature \u200betched plates \u200b& stem-ware are also served with the small plate menu specialties. We enjoyed the Salmon Rillettes dressed with cr\u00e9me fra\u00eeche aux fine herbs\u200b & yellow caviar & buttered buckwheat toast. This was a familiar dish from my grandma's \u200btable \u200b& it was even served potted in a \u200bcomfy-looking covered glass dish, with the freshest\u200b-ever\u200b herbs on top \u200b& even a few brilliant red flower petals.\n\nTo finish with something sweet\u200b before putting on lipstick for the theater, we had blueberry cobbler with creamy sorbet & drooled with honey that tasted like lavender. \n\nNext time,\u200b we want to try\u200b the\u200b Prime Rib-eye Tartare, because Nicholas was bragging on the beef \u200b---\u200b& for me, the special Iberian Ham dish\u200b.

Walk straight out the door across the street into the park. Hotel is on higher floors so the check in is very calm and smooth - foyer restaurant is a buzz with large full wall windows.  Had business and dined in the Restaurant against the windows and soaked up New York sky line with really attentive waiting staff. Unobtrusive but focused on what was happening on the table with drinks, food plates etc. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous - pillows - feather duvette - amenitites were well selected and fresh. Breakfast after a long walk in central park had some unique different choices which was refreshing - try the Japanese breakfast box - light delicious and fresh. Seating is different level so you all get to capture the views. If you are looking for under stated luxury - quiet elegance and the true brand of Mandarin Oriental in an iconic location with absolutely high stunning views from many windows then you should stay here. Spring is the best time as its warmer - the park is in full bloom and love the energy of all the dogs walking. Joined a fun run  on the Saturday which gave you a sense of community right off. Concierge at street level are fantastic and well trained and knowledgeable in getting you in the right direction for a Pharmacy or  any item you may require.

My wife and I, came to NY for a family event and figured it would be a good opportunity to see what this hotel is all about.\n\nFirst things first, 1400 dollars a night for a room, I was expecting the accommodations to be in the same category as the St. Regis. We were escorted to our room, only to realize how cramped and small it was. The view was not particularly great, as we were blocked by tons of buildings and faced the beautifully green looking Hudson River. I thought maybe the bathroom is what people love about this place. I was wrong. While the bathroom is big and luxurious, it is an odd layout with a cheap looking bathtub and toilet. It was very narrow and the doors would not close. The bed was average and had very tough pillows.\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, I needed a coffee and figured the room service would be just fine. My coffee was watery and tasted like it sat on the fire since 6am. The only great thing was the late check out for 3pm, as this is very uncommon in NYC hotels.\n\nI am generally not someone who complains however, for this price I was expecting a little more.

Everything from check in to check out was seemless. The staff are excellent - each and every member of staff we encountered was friendly, knowledgable and happy to help. We stayed in a Hudson View room on the 53rd floor and the views were fabulous. The room was very spacious even by NYC standards as was the amazing bathroom complete with bath, large shower and TV. The level of in room house keeping is very high. I don't know how they manage it but the rooms are cleaned and made up immaculately and yet you never see housekeeping or housekeeping trolleys. I amazed how they do it. The turn down service provided nightly is also excellent as each night you are provided with a letter offering details of the weather forecast for the next day and possible activities for you to consider as well as a quote, or pearl of wisdom about sleep. It's a very nice touch.\n\nWe used in room dining a couple of times (breakfast and dinner) and the attention to detail is brilliant. They bring a table complete with linens and flowers and set the table as if you were dining in the restaurant. The food was excellent. \n\nThe only thing that I felt was trying to be too clever and ultimately not working as well as it could was how they operate mini bar services. The mini bar and in room snacks are motion sensitive. Once you pick up and item from its spot you have 30 seconds to put it down or you are charged for it. We had seen this in the in room information which detailed this therefore did not pick anything up however at some point possibly during housekeeping items had been somehow dislodged and these items were now appearing on our bill. This issue was addressed and was a non issue however it seem like a cumbersome feature that is not fool proof.\n\nIn terms of location I loved this hotel. It is facing Central Park and more or less above the 59th Street Subway so is excellently appointed with all areas of NYC easily accessible from this location. \n\nI will definitely be back to this hotel and have plans  to try Mandarin Oriental properties in other locations when I travel.\n","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It is NOT enough that one person in the elevator has a key. A nice security-feature!\n\nNOT DIRECT VIEW\nWe paid extra for Central Park View. We got the view but please note that the Trump building stands between you and the park (see picture) This is conviently NOT shown in the hotel-pictures. \n\n","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Checking in was quick and friendly, and the gentleman at the front desk personally brought us to our room. The room  overlooked Central Park and Columbus Circle...and since we were on the 53rd floor, we had an amazing view of the city. The decor was elegant, but comfortable and \"home-like,\" with a very comfortable bed and a large flat-screen TV. The bathroom had a shower (with \"normal\" and \"rainfall\" showerheads) and a large tub. There was plenty of closet and drawer space (far more than we needed).\n\nThe lounge off to the side of the lobby has wonderful views of the city, as well as delicious food, great drinks, and friendly and attentive staff.  If you get a couch next to the windows you won't want to leave.\n\nWe ate breakfast in the restaurant (also on that main lobby floor) and the food was absolutely fantastic. And, of course, the view can't be beat.\n\nWe spent one morning at the spa...and we could have easily spent the whole day. The staff was friendly, the massages were rejuvenating, the facilities are amazing, and we even saw a celebrity! (Smiles were exchanged, but we were respectful of their privacy.)\n\nIn terms of location...it's tough to beat the Mandarin: it's right on Columbus Circle, across the street from Central Park, within easy walking distance of Broadway shows (we walked to see a show one night), and if the weather is bad you can spend a few hours walking and shopping in the mall on the first couple of floors of the building.  (There are also some fantastic restaurants there.)\n\nEvery staff member we encountered - from the gentlemen at the front entrance, to the staff in the lounge and restaurant, to the cleaning staff - was exceedingly polite, very friendly and always helpful.\n\nI've stayed in a lot of nice hotels in NYC, around the country, and around the world, and this was easily one of the best places I've ever stayed.  In fact, we are hoping to make this an annual \"anniversary\" trip.\n\nLet's be honest: Is the Mandarin Oriental expensive? Absolutely.\n\nIs it worth that expense? Without a doubt.\n\nIt is - as my review title states - spectacular in every way.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Every person we encountered was kind, friendly, and helpful. \n--when the hotel learned of our anniversary, they sent up champagne, sweets, and a congratulatory note. \n--our room was beautiful, the bed was heavenly, the bathroom luxurious, and the Central Park views were spectacular. \n--the location of the hotel cannot be beat. It's a quick walk or train ride to pretty much anywhere. And Central Park is right there! I also think it's advantageous to have the Time Warner shops sharing the building with the hotel as well. We enjoyed some light shopping and picked up treats from Bouchon Bakery. \n--we took advantage of the pool and gym. The pool is really beautiful! It was also empty when we used it so we had it all to ourselves. \n--breakfast at Asiate each morning was a true treat. My husband and I are usually too busy for our own good. It was such a pleasure to start each morning by slowing down and savoring a delicious breakfast in such a peaceful and lovely setting. Service was, of course, perfect.\n\nAlthough we only stayed for a couple nights, the Mandarin managed to feel like home for us. We hope to return next year too!

There were so many little things that made a difference between this hotel and those we've stayed in over the past few years. For instance, when our room was cleaned, they folded all of our items that were left out, arranged our shoes and other items, and threw away our trash that was left on the tables. It sounds so small, but even when we've stayed at the JW Marriott, they don't do that. Furthermore, they left bottled water every night at turndown (complimentary), left two complimentary hardback novels to read and take with us, and refreshed our bathroom towels and amenities every day. \nAs dumb as it sounds, one of my biggest pet peeves is having low water pressure or a bad shower head in the shower. This is the first hotel in as long as I can remember that had a great shower head and water pressure! In addition, the room temperature was great, and we were able to make it as cold or as warm as we liked. \nFinally, the location of this hotel was perfect for us. We did not want to stay in Times Square, as we preferred to stay a little further away from the crowds and noise. The Mandarin is right across the street from Central Park, it is attached to a fabulous mall, and is in walking distance to a ton of different sites and activities. The subway is right at the hotel, and cabs are easily attainable. One final perk is the car service the hotel offers. Although it's not always available, there were two times when we were going somewhere close, and the doorman offered us the complimentary hotel car rather than calling up a cab for us. Just one of the many wonderful services and attention to detail the hotel offers. I highly recommend the Mandarin!","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I asked him if that was normal, he wouldn't answer me. He was extremely unpleasant, treating me and my wife like we were a nuisance to him. He then told us he needed help with the ac problem, he called another engineer to the room and that engineer wreaked of cigarette smoke.

This was our anniversary gift to ourselves. It is a 5 star hotel and I would give it 6 if I could. Knowing that we were there for our anniversary and booked through the American Express Fine Hotels Program, we were upgraded to a suite. The room, on the 48th floor, was perfect. The first day there we had breakfast in the restaurant. I was very surprised when the waitress called me by my name. That has never happened in any hotel I have ever been to. When the woman who made up our room saw us in the hall, she also greeted us by using my name. And the same thing happened when we had lunch in the lobby cafe. Most impressive!\nIn the afternoon, we both had massages in the Spa. What a treat! A hot whirlpool, a steam room, and a fantastic massage. They also have a relaxation lounge that overlooks the city.\nThe service, the attention to every detail was just perfect.\nNow, I hate to degenerate into potty talk but I have to. I can only speak for the room I had but I will assume that the other rooms have the same toilet. It is a Japanese toilet. When I walked into the small toilet room inside the very large bathroom, the toilet seat cover rose on its own. When I sat down, the toilet seat was nice and warm. There is a box on the wall that explains how to operate the toilet. It can shoot water up while you are sitting to clean what ever needs cleaning. Now, to be honest, I didn't try that feature. I like technology but this is something I want to do myself. However, if you go to the Mandarin Oriental and do use the full capabilities of the toilet, I'd really like to read about your experience if you review on Trip Advisor.\nI think the present we gave each other was the best anniversary we've ever had.\nWe saved up for this present because it was very expensive. But we have already decided that we are going back next year and possibly adding an extra day.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's not an artificial warmth, either.  Everyone seems genuinely friendly, eager to help, and extremely knowledgeable. The hotel is very expensive but it justifies the price. You'd be very hard-pressed to find anything better, not just in New York, but in the US.  One of the very best hotels in the country.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We got a room on level 38 which is the first or second level with rooms in the hotel which it goes up to 54th level, so not the best view at all and it looks over to a huge terrace of the hotel which is below the room, from the side of the room u cannot see the Hudson river neither. So the hotel stuff just ignored our request which by that price is not acceptable. We asked to change, the staff was very helpful and the promised us a new room in 30 minutes. It took 2 hours!!!!!!! After arriving from Europe, tired and I underline that we have asked for that in advance, I have to tell not the best service at all. The front desk manager invited us meanwhile for a drink in the lobby, which amount has been charged to the room... Not very attentive. Then we got finally the room on the 47th level which had a really amazing view and the room was beautiful. We have asked for late check out until 2pm, the hotel was not able to provide this, however we waited 2 hours for the room...\nSo the hotel is very nice but the service could be much better, even if we stayed at the first time in the hotel which is noted in their computer.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our two adjacent bedrooms were spacious and impeccably maintained. The view is nothing short of amazing. Our rooms were cleaned twice a day and everybody was very polite, especially the housekeeper.\n\nHowever, the check-in was a nightmare because we had European cards with pins and apparently their software wasn't updated (that's what we were told). The guy tried several times, and as a result our cards ended up being blocked. Lovely. Things got sorted eventually but I was made to feel that it was our problem (it wasn't !), and the bank called as they thought our cards had been compromised. Needless to say, the hotel couldn't care less.\n\nWe had a good stay, but there was no tea or coffee facilities and I must admit that I would have liked a coffee when waking up (at 4 or 5 am, because of the jet lag). The in-room dining was good but a bit too long to arrive (45\/50 mins).\n\nThe hotel gave us a late check-out, which was nice as we could stay in one of the rooms for a couple of hours. They called us when our car to the airport had arrived (in advance, which was fine because we were ready) and we all (I was travelling with husband & children) went to the ground floor (the lobby is on the 35th floor and our bedrooms on the 54th). \nI don't know what happened then, because the staff spent at least 15 mins looking for our car. It was a complete mess, I think that the team downstairs changed shift, and the new guy didn't have a clue, he first told us that the car hadn't arrived, then that it was the wrong time, made us say our name at least 10 times and ran like a headless chicken to the 5 cars waiting for clients without being able to find ours.\nEventually he found the right car (right in front of the entrance) and apologised profusely. I found the whole episode surreal.\nIn short, I enjoyed my stay but didn't feel like a valued customer -more like a walking purse, actually.\n","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is perfectly located at Columbus Circle near Central Park, Park Lane and Broad Way with 5th Avenue in walking distance. It is located on the upper floors (36th+) of the Timer Warner Buildings with great views, especially of the Central Park from the top-end bar area on the reception level. The Mandarin staff is authentically friendly, very attentive and helpful. The rooms are decently furnished and decorated with the highest sleeping comfort I have experienced in a hotel. The food either at  the bar, for break first or at the restaurant is far-above average. Try the Wonton Soup and the lemonade at the bar! The hotel is a perfect starting point for exploring New York by walking. Just around the corner the Broadway starts, the shows and theaters are in walking distance to the hotel. Walking along Park Lane passing by the other top-end New York hotels (though none of them surpasses the quality and standards of the Mandarin) you will reach 5th Avenue after a few minutes. Left-hand side, you pass by the Central Park and can jump on a Riksha to explore New York's green lung. I have stayed at other Mandarin hotels before in Washington D.C., London, Munich, Singapore etc. and it is the right place to be. The staff makes you feel at home, every service is of the highest possible quality. The concierges are the best travel consulting firms you can experience. So whenever going to New York, there is definitely no better place to stay and to enjoy a perfect hotel service. It is one of the best managed places I have ever experienced!","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}
