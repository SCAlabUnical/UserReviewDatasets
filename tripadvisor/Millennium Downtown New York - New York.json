{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":262330,"title":"Location Location Location, superb!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2024-04-10","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"I\u2019ll summarise at the start, had a fantastic 7 day stay here with my wife and 15 year old son and I would recommend this hotel for its location and stunning views. \n\nWe managed to find a good flight and hotel deal here for April 2024 but after we booked it we started to panic a bit with some of the negative reviews we read on TA. Whilst there are some very valid points people have made, we found that the overall experience was excellent and really enjoyed our stay here. I hope this helps others who may be felling like we did after reading the reviews. \n\nWe had a junior suite on the 27th floor and the view was spectacular as it was a corner room with amazing views of the oculus, WTC building, some of the uptown skyscrapers, Hudson River and the Brooklyn bridge. The location of this hotel is so convenient for many attractions in Downtown and you are spoiled for choice with places to eat and drink here. The oculus is a beautiful space and a great place for lunch and shopping as well as a convenient subway entrance for trains uptown. \n\nA few things to note, on top of the fee you have paid for the room there is a $40 a night resort fee. When you check in they will put a hold on your credit card of $600 and if you check out without spending anything like food or drinks then they will release the $600 minus your total resort fee. We were $280 for 7 nights and had no issues with the hotel releasing the fees or over charging us. I suggest you email the hotel before you go and ask them to confirm the charges prior to your visit so if there is any disparity then you have it in writing what you should have been charged. \n\nThe swimming pool is not operational. The resort fee should be reduced to reflect this but it is not. This was disappointing as my son was really excited to use it but we were told it has been out of action since the pandemic and there are no plans to open it for the foreseeable. \n\nThe rooms are dated and a bit shabby but the sheets and bathroom were clean and comfortable. \n\nThere was a safe, a hairdryer, an iron and board, 2x large flat screen tvs and a phone with free international calls in the room but no fridge. We stayed in April so the temperature of the room was ok but I\u2019d imagine in the summer and winter that the room would be uncomfortable as the AC didn\u2019t really do anything but act as a fan. If you put it to its coldest setting or it\u2019s warmest setting it didn\u2019t do anything but blow out mildly cold air. \n\nThe lifts were fully operational 6 out of the 7 days we were there but one day we had to use the service elevator and it was busy but no problem. \n\nSomeone complained about the smell of Cannabis outside the hotel but I can tell you this is not a problem with the hotel, this smell is unfortunately ubiquitous to NYC as cannabis is legal here and there are shops everywhere selling it. I personally don\u2019t have a problem with it but the smell is overwhelming and it is everywhere so definitely not an issue with the hotel. \n\nTaxi from JFK to hotel is about $75 fixed price so we\u2019ll worth it as it is a long drive and the hotel will store your luggage when you check out at 11am until you need to leave for the airport. They even booked a taxi for us but the baggage guys will expect a small tip. \n\nCompared with many other cities it is not great value as the rooms are expensive even before the resort fee but in the context of NYC pricing it is actually reasonable. You won\u2019t get Premier Inn prices anywhere in Manhattan but it truly is a special place so it is worth the extra expense IMO to stay here. Just don\u2019t expect luxury for the price you pay and you\u2019ll be right. NYC is such a busy place that you will not spend much time in your room anyway so location is they main factor and this hotel is blessed with an amazing location.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

No duvet\/comforter and it was the middle of winter. Sure, we could turn on the heating, but I had lovely duvets in the other two hotels. \n\nThe bathroom: we were given just one crusty bath towel each. No bathmat towel, no hand towels, no face towel.

We booked a room for 3. As we arrived, they told us they would upgrade our room to a Junior Suite without charge, so that we get better beds. We appreciated their offer and accepted.\nThe room had no fridge and no mini bar. At the reception we were told that it was hotel policy, but if we wanted, they could get us a fridge, which they normally charge, but they would give us for free.\nThe fridge never came\u2026\nThere was a weird smell in the bathroom and we couldn\u2019t find out where it came from, until we used the shower: there was mold on the inside of the curtain and some unidentified yellow stains! (Really gross)\nThere were only 2 drinking glasses on the table. These glasses were never replaced by clean ones till after the 3rd day when we kindly asked the maid to do so. \nThere were not enough hand and face towels for all of us. On the 2nd day we asked the maid for some more towels and she immediately gave us some. On the 8th day, we were left with only 3 bath towels and the maid told us that there were no more face or hand towels left. So for the next days we were supposed to dry our hands, face AND body with a bath towel....\nThe room was supposed to be a Junior Suite, but the furniture looked old and overused, most surfaces were scratched and discolored. \nThere were no accessible sockets on the bedside so when I moved the bedside table to find one and charge my phone, I discovered a lot of dust and hair which was certainly hiding there for months. \nUnder the bed couch, were my son was sleeping, we were confronted with the same situation: dirt, dust and hair which were not cleaned for months\u2026.\nThe room was in general not clean. And if you left a used tissue, or an empty chips bag outside the trashcan, you would find it at the same spot when you came back in your \u201ccleaned\u201d room. \nAt day 3 we had to buy liquid hand soap, cause the little hand soap we were using was never replaced... \nFor all the above, we paid 520$ per night....","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

If you need to be in this area for work or travel, it's not a bad option. With the location comes an incredible view out of the room window towards the Hudson River, looking down into the World Trade Center Memorial, and seeing the sunrise reflect off of One World Trade Center. \n\nUnfortunately, beyond the location, it is difficult to give high praise to this property. The room fell short of expectations in a few ways: first, the armchair was missing from the room (there was just a big empty space with a coffee\/side table); second, housekeeping did only an average job refreshing the room, with the inner shower liner missing from the bathtub.  Another colleague of mine didn't receive any wash-clothes in their shower linens. Water pressure was really good for being so high up (30th floor)! Finally, the elevators are incredibly slow, despite the building being divided into two elevator banks to service all floors. It took about 5 minutes for an elevator to bring me back to the lobby, and my colleague even got stuck when the elevator that arrived to collect him refused to bring him back to lobby - he had to walk down 30 flights of stairs to make it to an early morning meeting (and was late to the meeting as a result). Sound insulation was average and worse than expected for a building of its stature - you could hear neighboring rooms' showers relatively loudly and the sounds of doors slamming in the hallways resonated into the bedroom. I will say (maybe because my arm chair was missing) that the room size was very generous for an NYC hotel. Mattress comfort was just OK.\n\nThere was a lively bar area in the lobby that was packed in the morning with business travelers game-planning their day, and in the evening with folks enjoying night caps. Front desk staff friendly and polite. \n\nJust a few things for the property managers to tighten up and my review would be a lot higher. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Elevators were not working when we arrived on August 2023. Had to take the employees elevator or else it will be be 15 minutes waiting with a line of people in front of us. Upon arriving they didn\u2019t have my reservation which was booked, fully paid through a third party and CONFIRMED by the hotel. They took their $300 deposit and we went to our room . By the way the front desk lady had to go grab her manager to try to find the reservation , not ONCE did he acknowledge me or anyone \u2026. As a manager it says a lot about a place.The rooms are huge and extremely outdated. The bathroom are not deep cleaned like they \u201csay\u201d , there was mold around the tub and curtain. (Don\u2019t let that lobby smell I told you about fool you)Upon checking out I received my receipt which included the amount the third party stated I had to pay at the hotel which was the hotel fee , plus a donation they added without my concept. That same afternoon when I boarded my flight the deposit was credited and a charge of $600 appeared. I called and they told me they needed me to speak to the Billing Department\u2026. They don\u2019t return calls or voicemails so I emailed . Not one person emailed me back . So I filed a claim with my credit card company , which since August has been under investigation \u2026.. today I received confirmation that I was being provided full credit. \n\nTherefore , go somewhere else \u2026. Don\u2019t give this place your money and let them lure you in with the price. There\u2019s nothing to do at night , there is nobody on the streets . Go somewhere else, somewhere where they do their management job right and care about customers coming back. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t because of the view I believe they would of been out of business a very long time ago.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I\u2019m not picky I am fine sleeping on the floor when I visit friends, but this bed was just springs, stained, and I got a rash after sleeping here. I actually avoided being here so I basically paid to have a place to store my luggage. I tried to stay out all day and leave around 6am -8am. I paid about 1,300 for three nights to get a rash, get talked down to, disrespected. Also the tv don\u2019t work, I didn\u2019t get any towels after the first day, every person at the front desk was so unbelievably mean, I feel like kindness goes a long way, apologetic, and all of that would\u2019ve felt a lot better than what I got ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

STRONG DO NOT GO!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-09-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"The absolute worst hotel that I have ever been to! Firstly, I stayed for 10 days and specifically requested a quiet room. When I checked in, they gave me a room next to the elevator, and an ac unit that didn\u2019t work. I then requested a room change after day 1. The 2nd room they sent me to, the ac unit was so loud that you couldn\u2019t even hear the tv and was dirty. Then I requested another room change. Mind you this is the 3rd room which was also old and dated and smelt putrid. I realised the poor standard of the hotel was the normal standard. As I was working as well from the hotel, I needed a proper internet. There was no option to pay for a fast internet so I had no choice but to use their internet which kept dropping every 15-20mins while I was in meetings. Needless to say, I was not able to conduct my meetings resulting in a loss of revenue. I complained several times to the manager and spoke to IT, but IT never called my back when they promised someone would attend to me in person. In addition to this, I would request room service for breakfast. However, these in room dining requests were never sent to the kitchen, so I was left with no breakfast coming to the room. I complained to the manager about this. The cleaners were absolutely rude and demanded that I leave the room so she could clean, even though I said that I was working. I complained about this yet again to the manager. Then it got worse. The cleaner wouldn\u2019t pick up the dirty towels, then I complained to management. It continued to get worse. The cleaner wouldn\u2019t replace any towels, any toiletries nor vacuum. I complained yet again to the manager. Then the concierge staff was most rude to me when I asked to collect a package which was delivered to me. Not only that, but the concierge would be chatting away loudly in the lobby talking about \u2018a b**ch\u2019! \nI\u2019m utterly disgusted by the lack of concern by management. Seems it falls on deaf ears.

A week prior to the booking I called them from the UK to request all three rooms be located on the same floor and\/or within close proximity to each other given we had elderly and young children in the group which they acknowledged and accepted (10 mins I was on the phone with them). Upon turning-up to the hotel they provided us two rooms on the same floor a fair distance apart and the third room was on a completely different floor. Upon requesting and reminding them of the phone conversation I was told that would not be possible and that I would need to keep coming to reception on a daily basis to check if any floor had three rooms available in close proximity. Basically my pre-calling a week ahead was a complete waste of time and money.\n\nUpon checking in we were assigned a room with two double beds. The beds in the room were tiny comparative to normal double beds in other hotels. My two kids (7&9) struggled to share a bed, let alone us adults (the room itself was spacious just the beds were small). \n\nThe bathroom itself was smelling of stale urine the bath, shower and shower curtain very dated old school. Upon calling room service to complain about the stench in the bathroom I was met with no answer thus informed reception about this and they said they would have someone come take a look. Nobody came and the whole night passed. The following day the same thing happened by which point it was clear my calls\/words were not being heard. \n\nLong story short, I would not rate this hotel a four star. The location is prime but the hotel itself is dated, the reception and managerial customer service is non-existent. The concierge desk on the other hand had some helpful individuals in terms of providing local advice and direction.\n\nIf heading to the hotel be prepared for a lack of quality service and dated rooms.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Oh and an Asian guy at the concierge that made eye contact and smiled when I passed by. so I guess that makes 3 nice people out of the many I had come across in the entire place.\n\nRoom wasn\u2019t clean, carpet was way overdue for a good steam clean: many black spots, 5-6 bits of something red that looked like bacon on the carpet, overall very dirty-looking. Bad-smelling bathroom, super gross (dirty) phone (I had to use it because they called me on the room phone and when I called 8-10 times over a span 20 minutes to order breakfast, and no one picked up). Breakfast took 91 minutes. That\u2019s an hour and a half if you feel like waiting, or you can DoorDash the many options around. Wrong order arrived, I did not complain because I was grateful it arrived.\n\nI left a day early. I paid to change my flight.

Security was iffy, and our door looked like someone had tried to break in at some time in the past.  There was no elevator security, so all floors could  be accessed by anyone in the lobby.  The third floor bar and restaurant are closed. It was astounding to pay over $300 a night for such a run down property.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked for 6\/13-6\/14 with a co-worker for one room. We checked into room 3301 and were immediately met with 75 degree temps in the room. We tried to get it to work but it would not. Also, the two beds were different sizes, one considerable smaller in width than the other. I called down and was told to bring my keys down to the front desk so we could  be moved. The woman at the desk was very nice and she asked me to please take pictures of the beds to show her. I went back up to the room and dropped a bottle of water and about 3 ounces feel on the floor. I grabbed a white wash cloth to wipe it up and was appalled to see the towel looking like I wiped up a floor in a hallway. In addition, the carpet is an absolute mess with pulls and stains all over and attached is a picture of the arm rest which looks like a dog chewed on it. I went back to the desk to be moved and showed the front desk associate the pics of the beds and room issues and she gave me a number for her manager and asked if I would forward the pics which I did and said we would be getting some adjustment to the bill. We moved to room 2201 which frankly was just about in as bad of shape as 3301 but the air conditioning worked.\n\nUpon checking out, we were told no adjustments were made to the bill. What is absolutely even more insulting is this place has a $35 facility fee (it shows as resort fee online). Fee for what? Restaurant in the building is closed and all \"amenities\" in this building are so beat it is pathetic. Also was charged a $2.50 optional donation which if optional, should have been asked if I wanted to donate.\n\nI was told they realize the building is tired and needs a renovation which is supposed to happen next year. Until this is completed, I would not consider this hotel at any price. I travel on personal and biz travel probably 70-80 days per year and this is by far the hotel in the worst condition I have booked in the last 25 years.\n\nI contacted the hotel this morning and spoke to the on call manager Mike Diaz, who was very personable and apologetic but only offered to remove the \"optional\" donation of $2.50 and the $35 resort \/ facilities fee. I expressed to Mr. Diaz that I thought that was not a sufficient olive branch for the experience and suggest a $100 credit which he basically did not acknowledge I had asked for and asked that the next time I stay at the hotel they will promise me a better experience.\n\nThat will not be happening and Millennium Hotels are on my \"no stay\" list going forward if this is the level of brand quality for this chain. They are a far cry of the days when it was owned by Hilton.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Clean and serviceable, and with a worthy view (be sure you ask for a west-facing room, and high up in the tower), but they would not earn any Michelin stars for quality of site or service  Total failure to keep up with the fine details of a luxury establishment (such as the decaying door stop and half-peeled stickers in the bath \u2014 see pics) or a modern one (no USB charging ports and way too few standard electrical outlets for the modern complement of techno prostheses we all carry).  As for service, see the pictures of what I got when I ordered breakfast from \u201cin room dining\u201d (looks like it came from the local Wendy\u2019s and didn\u2019t taste any better), and I had to fight tooth and nail with the front desk to get a \u201ccomplimentary\u201d one hour extension on check out (see narrative below for details).  Might do better (and save money) to hire a helicopter tour of Manhattan, and stay at a more affordable and less pretentious establishment.\n\nMy experience with a request for late check out (standard is 11am; I was hoping for 12 or 1):  When I called to inquire, I was told that it was \u201csubject to availability,\u201d only complimentary until 12pm, an extra $50 for 1pm, and $100\/hour after that.  I went ahead and requested the 1pm checkout; but then, after \u201cchecking further,\u201d the clerk told me there was actually no availability for late check out all, and I would have to leave at 11am.  Stunned and, quite frankly, incredulous, I asked to speak to a supervisor.  After putting me on hold for about 10 minutes, the clerk returned to tell me that no supervisor was available (they must also have been unable to get a late checkout); however, after checking further with the front desk, I could be given the complimentary 12pm checkout.

The staff member I spoke to was astonishingly unhelpful. She told me the hotel would not extend my room - I would have to make an online booking that they would then connect to my existing one. She refused to acknowledge this was in any way bizarre. I followed her instructions as I was left with no choice and on checkout I was asked by another member of staff why I had two bookings for the same night - I had to fight to avoid being charged twice.

My partner has allergies so we pack food for her. We get to the hotel and there is no fridge in the room. So, we had to purchase a fridge for $35, which is ridiculous considering that is standard in every hotel I have ever stayed and travel a lot. When they did bring the fridge up, they plopped it on a table I was using to charge my phones and I was asked to remove my things  and just plugged it in with the fridge facing sideways.\n\nThe hotel itself was very dated and not well kempt. The lobby was doing construction, one of the elevators was out of order. Just not aesthetically pleasing to the eye in general. \n\nOur hotel room itself, aside from the views, has a very motel-like feel. Our mirror in the bathroom was broken. We could feel the springs in the mattress, but the sheets were decent.\n\nThey charge a \"resort fee\" of which includes, access to the gym, unlimited international and long distance phone calls, unlimited use of the business center, 1 Citibike pass per day, $10 F & B credit daily, ad 15% off Classic Hop on and Hop Off Big bus tour. Aside from 1 Citibike pass per day, $10 F & B credit daily, ad 15% off Classic Hop on and Hop Off Big bus tour, everything else should be included. So, I think the resort fee is silly. \n\nSpeaking of the $10 credit, we went to go find the restaurant on the 3rd floor to find it completed gutted. So, we were confused where we would use our credit. Maybe they had a grab and go? So in the morning before I was leaving for work, I asked where can I use the food credit. They said oh, you have to order room service.........?\n\nOverall the communication about how things work was non-existent. This all should have been gone over during the time of the check in. \n\nThis brings me to my parking experience. When I called ahead of time before getting to the hotel I asked which parking lot my park and play package included. They told me Icon Parking on Church Street. When I got there, they told me to park on Ann Street, at Little Man Parking. No big. I get there and they say I owe $56. I told them I paid already and gave them my reservation. He said that didn't work. I asked if people often stayed here from the hotel, he said yes. But continued not to help and told me to walk back to the hotel. Before walking back I tried to call with no answer after 5 minutes. Walked back and they validated. Lack of communication.\n\nOverall, not a good experience","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Party of 3 including my 13 year old daughter checked in on Sat 18th Feb, we got checked in at 13:30, we were given room 8008 but asked to switch rooms as the beds were very small, we were moved to 2905, which offered as what I can only describe as the most amazing hotel room view I have ever experienced...... Sadly the previous occupants had been smoking in the room and the smell of cigarettes was unbearable. The house keeping team were fantastic and arranged via the manager and reception to move to 2906.... the view was equally as impressive.\n\nWe were on Bed & Breakfast, the restaurant was closed so we were required to call room service and order breakfast, this was delivered to the room within 20 minutes and was fantastic, they catered for Gluten Free and the quality and quantity of breakfast set us up perfectly for the day. we had everything we needed in the room, including coffee maker, we got also got a kettle from house keeping. \n\nMy only negative was the residents tax that you pay per room, $40 per night, this includes access to the Business Centre (On holiday - why would i need this?) you get daily access to a Citibike but it is only for 1 person and you get $10 to spend at the bar, a pint was $10.89 so basically 1 free drink per day. The bar is closed on a Sunday and it was Presidents day when we were there, so the bar was closed again.\n\nLocation is fantastic, access to several subway stations, we also used the NYC Waterways from Brookfield Place (opposite the hotel - 5 mins away) 10 mins walk to Battery park for Statue of Liberty cruise, 10 mins from Statten Island ferry terminal.\n\nFood - We didn't sit in anywhere for food, was always just food on the go, 5 mins to plenty of choices.... Joe's Pizza is a must, $4 a slice, also BROS Pizza, just further along the street, $5 for 2 Slices and a can of soda.\n\nWe really enjoyed our 5 nights, the staff are amazing and really helpful. if you can request a room on check in, go for 2906 \n   \n\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

It is walking distance to Bowling Green park and the bull. For the not so great, we booked with Chase Ultimate Rewards and called ahead to the hotel to check on early check in due to having 2 kids with us. I called the hotel operator who found our reservation and confirmed our dates and that our room was available in their system. They tried to transfer me to the front desk to verify that the room was truly ready and disconnected me. I called back and the front desk person said they could not find my reservation with the hotel confirmation number I gave them, which the previous person found just fine since they told me the room I booked and the date of check out. I spent 10 minutes talking to the front desk who told me I had to call Chase Rewards to verify the reservation. Chase Rewards spent over an hour talking to the hotel confirming my reservation, which existed somewhere since the previous person found it without issue. When we arrived to check in at 215 pm, we were told our room was ready but that it would cost $50 to check in at 215 because their check in time was 4pm. We just wanted to put our stuff in our rooms and go walk the city so we paid the $50. They charged my card $100, which may be for incidentals, but we checked out over 4 hours ago and no update to the charge yet. When we got to our room, a jr suite with king bed and pullout sofa for the kids, the sofa was missing. The bell hope immediately noticed it and requested it brought. A bit later spare sheets were delivered but no sofa. We also had to ask for a mini fridge since the one that appeared there was screwed shut. The gentleman that delivered the sheets said he would bring one cot for the kids and a mini fridge. We had to wait. He delivered the cot, then brought the fridge, then had to take the cot because the sofa was being brought. They asked us to wait but we told them we were going to see the city and to please put it in the room. We left the room at 245pm, taking 30 minutes to get the correct items requested. When we came back later in the evening, we saw the sofa bed had been brought, brand new sofa, and was folded out to a bed. Problem was, we booked a room for 4 of us and this sofa was a love seat. My very tiny 5&7 y\/o barely fit on the love seat bed together. Rollaway bed pictured but not the love seat. There were 3 towels for 4 people booked, the fire alarm was hanging from the ceiling with the red wire not connected, and no trash can in the bathroom. King bed was not horrible but not superb either. I will say the TVs were nice and big though. But the guide didn\u2019t show any shows, only channels. All in all, good location but not great experience. They did try to make some things right, but there shouldn\u2019t have been that many items to have to make right in the first place. And unless a hotel is selling rooms by the hour, there should be no reason to charge an early check in fee. If the room is cleaned, let people go in it as long as it isn\u2019t like a day early.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Currently laying on a bed that is so \u201cfirm\u201d it feels like laying on a board. Everything is worn and dated which I wouldn\u2019t care so much about if it wasn\u2019t 74 degrees in here. In December. You read that right. 74 degrees in December. The window is open and has been since we arrived hours ago. It\u2019s still 74 degrees in here. We called down to the front desk to ask about it and they said they turn off the A\/C for the winter and it\u2019s unseasonably warm right now. So what? Turn the A\/C back on then! Instead, they sent up a maintenance person with a small table fan. He looked at it and said there was nothing they could do because the A\/C is turned off and left. \n\nWhen we arrived, there was an employee trying to get into an elevator that had guests freaking out inside. He couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. The elevators took 8-10 minutes to arrive each time. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s very long, try standing in front of a bank of 4 elevators for 10 minutes waiting for them. It\u2019s a long time. So long, that there was a constant pile up of guests waiting to get on one. \n\nThe toilet decides to loudly run about twice an hour which is why I am currently awake and writing this review. \n\nThe TV was nearly unwatchable with a signal that cut out about every 15 seconds or so. The internet is painfully slow. And this is supposed to be a place for business people to stay? What a mess. I\u2019m very  glad that we are only staying a couple more days and then moving to a hotel that wasn\u2019t booked by my partner\u2019s place of work. And she will be giving feedback about the place so that it won\u2019t be booked again for any of the people flying in to work in the office. \n\nAll of that said, the employees have ALL been extraordinarily kind and have tried to help. This looks to me like a lot of folks working their butts off, who actually do care about the guests stuck working for a management company that is cheap with the way they fund their hotels and unsupportive of the people who work for it. I absolutely hate to see this because I know I will never stay here again and it looks like many others are saying the same, and that means these awesome people could lose their jobs. \n\nAnd to the person replying to these reviews, get real. Every reply is the same canned response and y\u2019all clearly don\u2019t care about the guests or the crap accommodations here. Actually do something to fix this. Don\u2019t say \u201cwe hope you\u2019ll give us another opportunity\u201d when you are doing nothing already about the avalanche of terrible reviews with all the same issues. It\u2019s just proving how disingenuous your company is. \n\nMy advice to anyone considering staying here is do not.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was by far the worst hotel I've stayed at. I feel bad for tourists, honestly. #800 for two nights on a work trip?!?!? I can't imagine if this was my own money. This hotel looks like its from the 1970s, the beds sink to the floor, and the pillows are so thin you better get at least 10 to equate to one pillow. Oh wait, it gets better. I had to do a late check out for work and they charged my company $50 dollars for a 1 hour late checkout. What a disaster. I hope tourists and business people look elsewhere. As I said, I lived here for 12 years and their a number of hotels that are better for the price. Only person to blame is myself here.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":262330,"title":"The Millennium, but it's nearly 2023....","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-10-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"In the 1980\u2019s, or 1990\u2019s when a bunch of people in suits sat down in a boardroom to brainstorm a name for their new chain of hotels, I\u2019m sure they decided on \u201cMillennium\u201d because it sounded very modern and elite. When they were built, I\u2019m sure they fit that description too. But now, nearly 23 years since the turn of the millennium, this particular property is extremely tired, run down and to be honest, gross. \nWe had a run of bad experiences during our 8 night stay at Millennium Downtown. Firstly, when we checked in, we were slapped with an unexpected USD$40 per night \u201cfacility fee\u201d (USD$320 total), additional to the USD$1600 we had pre-paid for the room and taxes. They also took a USD$500 bond\/hold on our credit card \u2013 so before we have even started our holiday, we are down nearly USD$1000.\nWe get to our room on the 23rd floor, the room is very poorly cleaned. We found previous guests handwritten notes in drawers, price tags on the floor, remnants of food on the chair and floor. On top of this, we had no soap at all for the first 6 nights stay (we went out and bought some). The bottled water was replaced ONCE during our entire stay. The TV didn\u2019t work \u2013 just static, no matter which channel. The air con didn\u2019t stay cold. There was no fridge in the room. The phone in the room doesn\u2019t work at all. We were also rudely awakened twice before 9am on the same day to housekeeping entering the room \u2013 not knocking, just walking straight in with no apology. But the worst part about our experience, is that the rooms are all vented internally, so one night we came back to our room and walked in to an extremely overpowering smell of weed as someone must have been smoking in an adjoining room. Despite letting the (less than pleasant) front desk staff know, it smelt like that for a couple of days. For people that don\u2019t smoke, it was truly unbearable. \n\nCredit where credit is due \u2013 there were a couple of positives that I must mention and the saving grace for the 2nd star for this review. The location of the property is fabulous \u2013 a large interconnecting subway station directly across the road, the 9\/11 memorial museum is right there too. 10 minutes walk to the Statue of Liberty ferry, 10 minutes walk to the Brooklyn Bridge, plenty of restaurants and shopping very close by.  One thing I can\u2019t fault, is the view from the room which looks out over the 9\/11 memorial and out to the Hudson River.  \n\nI would also like to mention both Mike and Seth located at the concierge desk. They were the only two friendly staff we encountered during our stay. They were helpful and attentive and always had a welcoming smile on their faces. They are truly a credit to the hotel. \n","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But there were just too many issues on this stay.  Arrived on a Friday afternoon, met by the bell hop immediately and he was very nice and attentive!  Front desk staff was less than cordial.  Discussed an upgrade to a Jr. suite and decided that we would pass on the upgrade.  Later found out at check out that we were being charged for the up grade we had denied.  Got to our room, noted the temp was warm and the HVAC was turned off.  Turned it on and set at 68F, Left for the evening and returned to find our room at 74F.  Called the desk, was told nothing they could do that late at night.  Next morning stopped at the desk to advise of and request something be done about the HVAC.  Returned about 3pm to find the temp still at 74F.  Again stopped at the desk to request service and went out for the evening.  arrived back at about 10pm to find the room cool at 68F.  This was annoying to start but the worst thing is the noise from the elevator.  We were in room 1712.  The right wall backs to the elevator shaft.  The noise from the cables and the elevator cars going up and down was ridiculous!!  And unrelenting.  The 3rd and last night was to no fault of the staff in the hotel but, we were awakened by people pounding on the door of the room next to us as they attempted to wake the person inside.  This went on for 15-20 minutes.  later in the early morning, we were again awakened by the Fire Dept as they made entry to that room and had to take the person to the hospital.  NO SLEEP on the last night we were there.  Upon check out as I went to pay for the room with cash, I was told that the desk doesn't have any change.  It is my responsibility to have exact change if I want to pay cash.  I've stayed in THIS hotel before and that was a great stay.  This one left so many things to be desired.

Which makes it accessible to alll trains. Outside of that, it was a lackluster hotel stay. I\u2019m from New York and i stayed here with my partner to attend an event in the city. We decided to make it a weekend stay and we chose this hotel because of its location and price point. The view was fabulous!! We were on the 49th floor and I loved being able to be a fake tourist and see the 9\/11 memorial. But the room was pretty outdated. It was large (compared to NYC hotel room standards for a king bed) but there was no mini fridge or loveseat. There was an odd space in the corner with an end table that made me feel as though a chair belonged there but it there wasn\u2019t one. Strange. The bathroom was pretty good and i loved the water pressure. \n\nThe only issue i have with this hotel is the severe lack of communication with the staff and management and with myself as the guest. I checked in with no issues Friday night and put my partner\u2019s name on the room so he can get a key card (because i was going to run some errands). Somehow, he is prompted to check in and leave a card down (which didn\u2019t make any sense because when i checked in, my card was charged). So the woman recognized her mistake, took his card off and told him to tell me to come back to the desk. Red flag number one. Because why didn\u2019t anyone call me nor why didn\u2019t you see in the computer that the room was under my name and paid for? I come back fro merrands and check in with another desk person and she assures me that everything is fine and my room is paid for and doesn\u2019t see any strange issues. Saturday morning, I\u2019m getting ready for my event and leave the room. I get a call from to my partner stating that he\u2019s locked out and they charged his room. So when i come back to the receptionist and after speaking to a male manager on the phone prior, the male manager takes my card for the third time, manually \u201coverrides\u201d the issues and says it\u2019s fine. Red  flag number two abs three. Fine. I check out Sunday morning and i get my itemized receipt and I\u2019m soooo glad i read it. Because on it, they still charged my partner\u2019s card and then charged me an additional $300 for the room. So at this point, I\u2019m irritated by the lack of communication in this place and why this issue wasn\u2019t handled Friday night. The woman apologizes (it\u2019s the same woman that checked my partner in on Friday) and then it\u2019s fixed. A simple phone call from them and a checks & balances system would suffice.

Upon arrival after a bit of a long day, I was practically barked at by a staff member to stand in a queue to the left of the entry.  This queue was marked only by a small letterboard on a stand with simple white letters on a black background.  It was not clear guests needed to \"funnel there\" upon arrival.   There was also only one other guest at the front desk at the time, so there was no clear need for a queue at that time. \n \nThere was also no clear reflection from the front desk of the facility's departure from Hilton.  This was my first stay since that change took place in January of this year.  Upon asking if I could have my Hilton Honors account linked to the stay, I was informed in a very matter of fact way that it would be a MyMillennium rewards program.  No simple apologetic comment that the property has left the Hilton brand and is now on it's own brand.  No attempt to pleasantly upsell joining the MyMillennium Rewards program, which I chose not to do.\n \nThe weird lighting set up in the bathroom wasn't clear either.  The panel has a vertical slider for the dimmer.  But the actual switch is a horizontal rocker made flush with the panel and VERY thin.  After attempts at the slider did nothing, and feeling around the plate for a bit I finally figured it out.  But in this case, form was given priority at a big expense of function.\n \nThe room itself was my pretty standard experience at the Millennium.  Bed and pillows were comfortable.  Desk was a decent size and easy to work at.  Shower worked well and water pressure and temps were good.  On business I rarely need amenities so I didn't use anything from restaurants to concierge service. Overall the room was clean and comfortable.  But there are definitely other properties in the Financial District that can make the same claim.\n \nAfter over a decade of staying here, sadly I suspect this will be my last time at this property.  Given the cost of this location, I expect more in the way of guest treatment than what I received this time.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Right across the street from the WTC Oculus, you honestly can't get a better location anywhere. \n\nHowever: the furniture is very dated and worn on the edges, the toilet and countertop in the bathroom were clearly designed for small children because they're very low, the carpeting is stained, and the drinks in the lobby bar are overpriced and not great. On the plus side, the rooms are very quiet, and they have nice feather pillows. Bed is a little hard for my liking but I prefer a very soft bed so YMMV. They were able to check me in early, but only if I paid to upgrade to a junior suite.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":262330,"title":"Hoping for a change back to the days of being Hilton-owned.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-09-20","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"I keep changing my rate from 3 to 4 stars so maybe after writing my full review, I\u2019ll decide what to stick with. \nThe first thing I wanted to mention is that this hotel is no longer own\/run\/managed by Hilton. I did not know that and honestly, I know it wouldn\u2019t have given me pause if I did when booking my recent trip. I\u2019ve stayed at this hotel three or four times when it was run by Hilton and each time, it was a top-notch and luxurious stay. During this most recent trip, I didn\u2019t notice right away that there was a difference, but after one day, then two, and then three, I could definitely see the change. Let\u2019s get this out of the way\u2014the staff was wonderful. From the front desk, to the concierge, to housekeeping, everyone was really nice and professional. I wanted to say that right away b\/c I\u2019m sure when management and owners read reviews, they want to blame the frontline staff and that just shouldn\u2019t happen. \n\nI am not a hotel-snob so my main issue was the room cost compared to the quality. The Millennium is still appearing like, and charging for, a premium hotel experience. The rooms are now dated and needing to be updated. The light sconces are crooked, the bedside reading lamps, and clock, were unplugged with no outlet (or extension cord) on one side of the bed. The TV is no where near as modern as it should be, and the bathroom needs to be caulked, and the faucets and shower hardware needs to be updated. The carpets are really what is the worst. My fellow guest and I wore our shoes the entire time we were in the room: the bathroom floor was sticky from something that spilled and we had to put a towel down on the carpet in front of the bathroom from this same spill. This mysterious substance was embedded into the carpet and very  sticky as well. It had no odor whatsoever, so it wasn\u2019t worth changing rooms or making a complaint about. But having to put a towel down on top of carpet and put  a pair of flip flops on as soon as you step out of the shower is really unfortunate. I\u2019m absolutely certain the floors were vacuumed by housekeeping but they really need either steam-cleaning or full replacement. \n\nThe best thing about this hotel is the location. I\u2019ve taken many trips to NYC and this is, by far, the best location: It is emotionally moving to be so close to Ground Zero, the various Metro lines are very close by, and the best thing about the Financial District is that you are not overrun with tourists (especially at night). I have a soft-spot in my heart for this hotel b\/c I\u2019ve spent so much time there and had so many great memories. However, I\u2019ll be watching the reviews carefully and unless things improve, I won\u2019t be returning. For the amount of money I paid\u2026.I expect a comparable  experience.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First the highs: great location if you\u2019re viewing WTC Memorial. Great views with surrounding windows.\n\nBut that\u2019s about it. How it has deteriorated and left unkempt without proper maintenance over the years. You can tell they don\u2019t care anymore- perhaps milking the price paid by unsuspecting nostalgic ex-patrons until their reputation completely unveils. And the current pricing absolutely does not reflect its current state of its demised condition.\n\nLet me name a few to paint the picture. Peeling paint, wall paper coming off at the edges, dirty dirty (did I mention dirty?) stained carpet, deep urine stains around the toilet seat, slow draining water with weak water pressure (still the old type of tub), old dusty and drabby curtains, varnish of wood peeling, no refridgerator (!!? why not? it did have a lock box though surprisingly), non working lamps, list goes on\u2026 And the inconvenience of no parking or valet on site and the logistics to drop off family or luggage, park 4 blacks or so away at their recommended parking site, and to walk back in the dark. Maybe this, though, is the New York experience you were seeking when it was still under the governance of Koch.\n\nI\u2019ve stayed at holiday inns in nicer conditions and more amenities at quarter of this price.\n\nYou will be disappointed in the condition of these rooms. The only other option seems to be to travel back in time 10-20 years and experience the rooms then.

I also wanted a hotel with great city views and many of the competitors lacked in that area so I decided to go with the Millennium.  The biggest pros for me were the location and friendly staff. However, a major con was the cleanliness of our room. We stayed on the 30th floor, which offers great city views, but our rooms cleanliness was extremely disappointing; especially since we\u2019re in the midst of a global pandemic. Upon arrival, the first things I noticed were stains on our bath towels, the sheets, heavy\/built up dust on the carpet alongside the baseboards, and mold in the sink. There were also some cosmetic issues like cracks in the ceiling and peeling wallpaper. Furthermore, the TV had very few channels available and the picture was unclear\/snowy making it near impossible to watch the channels that were available.  I\u2019m really not sure if I would recommend this location to anyone else simply due to the cleanliness which is unfortunate because the location is ideal.

I got my phone back and found they clearly thought I was full of it because new windows had been opened and they had gone through other emails. From there I was asked to forward my confirmation email to them which didn't work, so I was asked to send it to another email. Finally, though they never found my reservation (I'll come back to this at the end) they created a new reservation for me for the same room type. \n\nWhen we got upstairs the room was not at all what I had expected. I stayed here with my wife in 2015 and it was in much better condition. The carpets were tattered, there were used q-tips and floss on the floor outside our door, the windows were filthy, and what used to be a refrigerator cabinet was nailed shut. This was a \"junior suite,\" which I would think we have a mini-fridge, though to be honest a fridge is pretty standard in most hotels today regardless of room type and was when I stayed here before when it was a Hilton. Pretty sure this place hasn't been updated since it got pelted with debris on 9\/11. \n\nWe didn't spend much time here for the remainder of our stay thankfully. Though I might as well throw this in, the TV barely worked, and the coffee maker had no cups, not that I'd have used it anyway. On check out day I dropped my room cards off and was met with a bill that was nearly double what my initial reservation was. Come to find it was the total of the room plus an additional \"hold\" that would change now that we had checked out. Weird. Regardless, the total room amount, excluding the hold was still wrong. I brought this up to the front desk host who was the only nice person I encountered here. She couldn't figure out why and quickly grabbed the wizard of Oz, er, sorry, manager whom actually came out from behind door. The manager of course tried the third party booking excuse with me and was admittedly surprised to hear I had booked through his hotels website. From here he tried to explain that the reason my total was so much more was because I still had to be local fees. He actually said to me \"if I show you that on our website will you believe me then?\" No. No I won't, and he didn't. The issue is that said fees were already included in my initial booking. Hence the part at booking that says total + taxes\/fees. When I asked him what those initial taxes and fees at booking were he could not answer me. If you don't know what those taxes\/fees are then HOW can you know that I need to pay additional ones and what they are? Eventually he did \"waive\" those fees. The next day I went through the booking process without submitting just to see what was included  at booking and you wouldn't believe it, but the fees he claimed I still had to pay were INCLUDED already. Weird. Anyone else hear of a hotel that charges more than you agreed to at booking as standard operation? No? Me neither. This place is a joke. So much so that the lobby and exterior of the hotel have their OWN NAME SPELLED INCORRECTLY. Hysterical. \n\nAnyway, long story long, go somewhere else. Anywhere else.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

We\u2019d checked out a lot of hotels before choosing this one, and upon arrival we\u2019re dismayed by what awaited us. The lobby of the property is nice and welcoming, however, the check in process was the first of many issues during our stay. Staff was rude and uninformed, didn\u2019t explain any of the closures throughout the hotel, any amenities, or offer any help. \n\nOnce we got to the room, the power was defective, so our AC didn\u2019t work. A utility person came to the room and tried to resolve the problem by telling to use the power button. What?? We had obviously attempted that and it wasn\u2019t until he tried the buttons that he realized the entire power to the unit was nonoperational and we would have to change rooms. In our new room, the unit would only cool to 70F, which left my partner and I very hot and uncomfortable for the duration of our stay. \n\nThere was no fridge or safe in the room and the TV was quite literally from 2004. We looked up the model online and we\u2019re astonished by that fact and the quality of the cable provided. The TV also buzzed loudly the entire time it was on. Whenever we wanted to call the front desk, we had to use our cell phones since our first room didn't contain a phone at all and the second had no buttons that worked!\n\nMany services were offline, (restaurant and bar), or unavailable, (vending machine), that seem like very basic hotel amenities. The floors of the room were very dirty, and all the furniture and fixtures appeared as old as the television. The handle of the bathroom door had fallen off and constantly rattled. And finally, a very large group of young adults, (thirty or more), were staying on our floor, smoking marijuana so much that our room stank for two days after. One night, they loitered near to elevators, yelling, laughing, and playing music past 1am in the hallways. We had to call down to security twice before anything was done about it.

When we entered the room we were pleasantly surprised with the size and although a bit dated appeared clean on the surface.

We went to reception and advised the receptionist who advised us the room would be cleaned whilst we were out. On return the smell hit us as we walked through the bedroom door, out from the bedroom I to the sitting room area, in disgust I went to reception and asked the chap behind the desk for someone to come up to the room, to smell it, he advised me the housekeeper would be up, 1 hour later no one had been up so I went back down and asked a different chap why no one had been up, he just advised us we could change room, I explained I wanted the room to be checked, he was more than rude and advised me the room would have to go of for deep cleaning and handed me the keys to a new room, my question to him was why wasn't it deep cleaned before our arrival, he shrugged his shoulders! We moved to the new room exactly the same room only at a different side of the hotel, as I placed something on the window shelf I noticed there was hard icing like product dried into the shelf, I went back to the reception and asked for a different person to speak with, the same rude chap came out with another chap at his side, I informed them about the icing sugar and asked why this room hadn't been deep cleaned either, the chap said they would have to look into it, however as the room had no smell and it was 8.30pm by this time I didn't want to move again, so stayed put,. When I woke up in the morning and went for a bath I noticed something hanging on a pipe under the sink vanity unit, on deeper inspection I realised it was a dirty pair of ladies knickers!! I duly put them into a sanitary bag and went back to reception, where I was met with by a very pleasant chap who agreed the whole Cary on was not acceptable by any standards and he would look into it and make sure the room was deep cleaned whilst we were out!! We came back at 7pm that evening and although the room had been serviced it had certainly not been deep cleaned as the icing sugar was still on the window shelf!! As this was our last evening we could not be bothered chasing this up. On check out the next morning we were not met with any resolution\/apologies\/recompense to our issues in fact there was no mention of any of our issues, we were presented with our bill, again we were still being charged the incorrect price for which I had to send my copy email to prove my rate!! I can only say how deeply disappointing the service and cleanliness of this hotel was from start to finish, the cleanliness advisory re covid and cross contamination statement for COVID was absolutely not followed, no apology or recompense was offered, disgusting, as a reservation\/reception manager for 20 years in a small group of hotels in Scotland, this would never have been acceptable standards in normal times let alone covid times!!

Eventually we get into the room which appeared to be fine, just not updated in awhile.   The next morning when we get light into the room we find stains all over the floor and bed, hair in the bed, and a condom in the room provided.   Luckily we were able to quickly find a very nice hotel at a similar rate (the Marlton Hotel, very nice) and we checked to call our travel agency when we got back to get a refund.  Turns out the attendant at the front desk didn't check us out as requested and charged us for the full stay.

The first receptionist wasn't helpful at all.\n\nThe pictures of the rooms were embellishing the reality. By the looks of our rooms, I don't think the hotel had been renovated in a long time (I'll say late 90's and early 2000's and I'm being generous. There was no phone in the room I was in, nor fridge, slippers, even the electrical outlets were hard to find.\nThe beds were too small for 2 adults. Under one of them, we found a dental protector and dust while looking for an electric socket. \n\nSince we arrived we notified them on multiple occasions that the breakfast was included in the reservation for the 5 of us (meaning we already paid for it). When we were leaving, I noticed on the invoice that they charged us for all them - every breakfast everyday per person (and wasn't event that good). \nThe icing on the cake: now, she's telling me only 2 breakfasts per room are allowed... even though you can book a room with 3 people in it.\nLong story short, there was no manager onsite (supposedly arriving at 2PM and never did, because yes we stayed that long until we couldn't), they charged us for the breakfast for 1 person.\n\nThis hotel do not deserve the price we paid for it nor the 4 stars. I guess it's all in the name of the brand.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}
