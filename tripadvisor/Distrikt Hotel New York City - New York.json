Cabs in NY add fees so watch out.  BEWARE.

Yes, Port Authority is across the street; yes, the block is less than picturesque, and yes, there are probably more people sleeping on the street than your average city block, but this is a city and these things are just going to be part of the experience.  We paid less than $300 per night when there was no other Hilton property in the city under $600 per night.  For that we got a larger than average room for NYC (with a king bed) and a staff that delivered on any request that we had (extra towels, housekeeping, bill modifications to reflect breakfast and resort fee credits, etc.).  The small bar area was open all day and gave you more than enough opportunity to use your breakfast and resort fee credits and their prices were very reasonable by NYC standards.  Speaking of credits, the staff was upfront from the beginning on how you could use your credits and how you couldn't.  If you want a luxury experience, you need to book a luxury hotel.

I think there were 30+ floors at this particular hotel. On our 3rd night we asked for a wakeup call b\/c we had to catch our flight in the morning. They stated yes, will call and they do wake up calls. Well guys there was not a wake up call but glad we had a backup with our phones but it was the principal behind it. There is a Frames Urban cool place bowling alley which has some good food and drinks, the vibe is perfect. There is a doubletree next door that has a rooftop we experienced the first night but was not able to experience the 2nd night b\/c the elevator guy on the first floor allowed a group of us to go up and then we get there and 2 guys stated we couldn't get it and told us and the other strangers to come back at midnight. the place was empty so if it wasn't an option then the person on the Lower Level should know what is going on via the rooftop when they don't feel like letting people enjoy the roof. Departing and Arriving they were friendly. Oh if you are a coffee drinker the coffee maker only worked 1 days while we were there. So find something else to drink. They do however, have flavored water in the front. You are about a good 15 minutes walk from Times Square. Find a closure hotel unless you don't mind spending the money for mediocre service. spend another $2-300 for a better place. Maybe when you see the picture it may not look like it's trash that needed to be removed.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"NONE"}

They sent me an email saying I had until 6 pm that day to give the new one. Even though I attempted to give the new card at 4 PM the day of my arrival, they canceled it anyway! I tried and explained it was because that credit was in a fraud and I had to be issued a new one, and could I give the new card, and they wouldn't allow it! The person I was dealing with was named Ajahni P, and she was the rudest, most condescending person I have ever dealt with in my life. I want to add that I am a college professor with an excellent credit rating, I am 60 years old, and she sounded half my age and treated me like I was a criminal. All she did was give me the Hilton 800 number to make a new reservation. To make a long story short, after Ajahni canceled me, she called me back to say she reinstated my reservation. I had new reservations, so I canceled the new one to get the old one back because it was in a better location. AND THEN she canceled my reservation AGAIN! In the end, I ended up with a place to stay, but the entire experience was very stressful and I can't believe how disrespectful Ajahni P from Distrikt Hotel was.

At this hotel with their \"premium\" internet I was not able to do a video call as it froze and the video quality was  choppy. \n\nThe breakfast at this hotel isn't great. The sandwich is heated up in a microwave. The acai bowl was good but whp would regularly pay that much? I felt bad for the staff at the bar as there was always only 1 person there and they were overworked and understaffed while the front desk always had multiple people there who were sometimes standing around. The allocation of staff is not great at this hotel. On the first night after using the daily credit at the bar I went to the front desk and asked for room service the next day. Again in the morning before breakfast I confirmed with the front desk staff that my room was on the list for room service that day and was told it was. I had breakfast and put my name and hotel room on the receipt so that I could claim my food and beverage credit. I went out for a few hours and came back at 1130am my room was not done but cleaning staff was on our floor. I confirmed with the front desk that my room would get done today and that I would be back by 330pm and it needed to be done before then. I got back at 345pm and it was not done. I was told cleaning staff left at 5pm for the day and they weren't sure if my room would get done today. I asked to speak to a manager and was told no one was there. At this point I asked for a towel from the front desk to have a shower and was told they didn't have any and that cleaning staff would bring one. Staff brought it at 415pm to my room and asked if they could cleany room now. I told them to forget it as I needed it done before 345pm. The next day I charged my breakfast to my room again. Upon checkout I asked again to speak to a manager and was told they would be in later in the day. Someone from the hotel called me later in the day to tell me I left a pink backpack in my room. I told them they had the wrong guest but that I did want to speak to a manager and was told this person was not a manager and that someone would call me. I got my bill later the day I checked out and saw I was charged for breakfast. My Gold Hilton food and beverage credit was not applied for both days of my stay. I called the hotel a week later to speak to a manager as no one had called me. I was told someone would call me back. No one has since. No accountability for this hotel. I can not recommend this hotel as the customer service is lacking in multiple departments and starts with a non existent management team. I will be reporting this to Hilton.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we arrived back we gor our room on the 18th floor, the room was both spacious and clean and the bed is the most comfortable bed iv ever slept in, you do pay a resort fee of $20 a night but this is given back to you in a voucher that you ask reception for each day. This can be used in the morning for breakfast or the evening for drinks, we used our for breakfast each morning which was a lovely way to start your day. House keeping are available if you ask but we were happy enough just getting fresh towels and we left our own rubbish down to Reception when needed as we weren't in the room enough to need someone to come and clean it. In reference to the comments regarding the homeless coming in and out of reception, we didn't see this at all, there is homeless all over NYC at the minute so don't let that put u off staying here as u will see it everywhere.

There is no in and out privileges, so make sure to take everything out of your car. The hotel also provides a $20 voucher for the cafe attached to it but it\u2019s only open from 7-11am for coffee and such. Our room was small but super clean.

Close to lots of transport options, especially port authority. Our room was ready when we arrived and that was a real bonus. The room itself was spacious with comfortable beds, plenty storage space and hot water with good shower pressure. You have to request housekeeping which we did most days  on others we asked for clean towels and the bin emptied. It was noisy at night as we were on the 4th floor I would recommend a higher floor. Also the smell of weed from people smoking out front was notiecable in the room. But it was everywhere anyway so no avoiding it and not the hotels fault.\nWe had booked on a bed and breakfast basis. Honestly don't it was a joke!!!. First morning we had issues when trying to explain we had alreay paid. We were given the limited choices and to be honest Ive been to New York 8 times and this was the poorest breakfast ever. But that wasnt the real issue.\n It honestly went downhill from here. It was very confrontational the next two mornings. A different staff member, who was rude, and actually called us crazy. We went to reception to speak to them to ensure breakfast staff were aware of our B&B booking and to say how intimidated this guy made us feel. Banging about being very intimidating. The response was we will update the breakfast staff as you are not on the list and inform the manager of your concerns. Whilst at reception the breakfast guy came over and was rude again. To top it all the next morning my friend asked for the parfait to be told there were none left and whilst sitting eating our pastries watched other guests recieve the parfait. My advice would be avoid the breakfast altogether. We have never encoutered attitude like this in New York before and for 2 women travelling alone it wasn't great.\nWe were unable to ay to keep our room as the hotel was full that night but the luggage guy stored our cases and booked our airport transfer. He was by far the most helpful, pleasant staff member we encountered. \nWe stayed for 6 nights and if it had been a less confrontational visit then we would probably have stayed again.\n8th visit to New York and it wont be my last.

Bottled water was available at the reception, we also had coffee\/tea maker in the room with coffee, tea, milk, sugar etc. We had avocado toast for breakfast, it was good. Service in the bar\/bistro also was very good. The staff is the best, all are happy, helpful, kind. All halls and elevators were also clean. We had some concerns before arrival due to some negative reviews, but honestly, I didn\u2019t get why some previous guests were unhappy with the hotel \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (maybe the hotel just tremendously improved by the time we stayed). We really had nothing to complain about. Quite opposite, for NYC for such fairly inexpensive rate we received superb quality and service! We stayed earlier at Candlewoods nearby (on 39th str.) for about similar  rate, and it was so much worse than District (old furniture, dirty halls, bed smell, horrible AC, unfriendly staff, old towels etc.). \n\nThank you, Distrikt staff, you are doing great job!!!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Dennis in particular was fantastic at advising us on how to get around each day, what was within walking distance and gave us a great recommendation for a breakfast diner.\n- The rooms are clean, comfortable and have a mini fridge inside\n\nCons...\n\n- Due to the location, it can be somewhat noisy outside when trying to get to sleep\n- The rooms looked much different in real life than what I had seen in photos from our rep and what I had seen on Instagram. They are very basic and very small. \n- The bar in the hotel was closed (we were not informed this would be the case and would've been able to claim a free drink each day) which meant no on-site drinks, not even tea\/coffee\n- There are only two elevators, which are quite compact.  If you're on a high floor (we were on the 31st) you might be waiting a while\n\nAll in all, we had a pleasant stay at the Distrikt Hotel.

That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this property again. It's a short walk from Penn Station as well as across the street from the Port Authority, so it's very easy to access via public transportation. One of my favorite perks of staying at a Hilton hotel is the ability to pick your own room through the app. This being my first trip to New York City I wanted a view. I had picked a deluxe king room, which I feel like was worth the money. I got a room at the front of the hotel on the 32nd and top floor. While the view wasn't the absolute best, I was not disappointed and could see a lot of the city life along with a few lights from Times Square. Being that far up the room was also quiet, though you could open the window to hear the sounds of the city. The room was very clean and luxurious. My only complaint was the that leather headboard was a little worse for wear, but I've seen a lot worse and it didn't really bother me. The service wasn't overly friendly, but that also isn't something I really care about. All the employees did everything I asked from them. There is a $25 daily resort fee which is typical for the area, but I do feel that at the Distrikt you get more for your money than most places. The $25 includes two drinks at their bar as well as two bottles of water. I did not take advantage of the gym access that the fee also includes, but I would think the trade off of an offsite gym is more than made up for by the increased variety an actual gym offers versus a hotel gym.  The elevators were fast, even to the 32nd floor. I experienced much less delay on the elevators at the Distrikt versus hotel that had far fewer floors. This is probably attributed to Distrkit only having a few rooms per floor. The water pressure was quite good, even on the 32nd floor, and the provided toiletries were more than acceptable. To summarize my review, while the Distrikt may not be the cheapest hotel in the area, I feel that it's an incredible value that is worth staying at.","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Done.\n\nAnd now I\u2019ll tell you what to expect.\n\nThis is by no means your normal Hilton quality.  The rooms are small (and I mean small) and in need of a refurb.  We travelled with our two teenage daughters so the room had two double beds with a bedside table in between them and that was about as much as you could fit in it.  We had 4 suitcases and ended up with them down the side of each bed.  There was only one wall light which was dim so no good for doing your makeup while sat on your bed (according to the wife). You had no choice but to sit on the bed to do makeup and hair as there was no table (or do it in the bathroom and hog it).  The bathroom was tiny with no working extractor fan.  There was complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body cream but no shower gel!?  We showered with a complimentary bar of soap!\n\nThe room did have a small wardrobe with a safe and mini fridge in it though but I\u2019m not convinced the fridge was working.  I say this because the room window fitted poorly and a bitterly cold draught was blowing in and drinks were colder left in the room than left in the fridge.  There was air con which did work but was noisy and because the room was so small it heated up in two minutes and then was so hot it was unbearable so you couldn\u2019t get the temp right at all.\n\nWe were on the 4th floor directly above reception and 40th street and it was really noisy (not helped by the ill fitting window).  I guess there\u2019s a reason why people say try to get a higher room.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, the lifts.  I don\u2019t consider myself impatient but pretty much every day we were there I had to wait at least 10 mins to get one of only two lifts servicing 30 odd floors.  I found the cleaning staff and other staff were using them and holding them on the lower level underneath the lobby.\n\nThen my biggest issue was the lack of tea and coffee facilities in the rooms.  Someone must have thought about this and decided giving two free drinks vouchers per room per day for the bar next to the lobby was a way to overcome this.  Wrong!  As I said earlier, we were on holiday with our two daughters but they still only give out two vouchers per room not by occupants per room.  Even the most intelligent of management must know this doesn\u2019t make sense.  Not only this, while we were packing to leave I went down to the lobby to get our vouchers for a coffee while we packed.  I was told vouchers aren\u2019t available on the day of checkout!\n\nMy biggest bug bear is the urban district fee.  You\u2019re asked for your credit card on arrival and a \u00a3200 hold fee is charged.  This is apparently for incidental charges like drinks to your room or you stealing a bathrobe.  Yes you heard right, they supplied one bathrobe (between four of us) but no slippers, tea, coffee or shower gel!?  Incidentally, the bathrobe in our room had holes in it so not sure why you would want to steal them?  Anyway, there is a $25 + tax fee per room per night.  This is for absolutely nothing but at least the hotel does the decent thing and just deduct it from the bond on checkout and reimburse the rest to your card (unless you charge stuff to your room).\n\nFinally, the bar at the hotel is rubbish.  Poor selection of drinks and I wouldn\u2019t eat there despite them having a small menu, it must all be microwaved.  We only spent our two vouchers there last thing at night on a beer and a glass of wine.  Oops, forgot one point, two complimentary bottles of water are left in the room each day.  Nice but probably to be expected in this da6 and age and also only two bottles despite there being four of us.\n\nSo, to summarise, it\u2019s cheap for its location in NYC but don\u2019t expect to be wowed.  If you just want to sleep (not very well) and shower in it then this is the place for you.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

This hotel is just lovely. I am a little confused as to why there are bad reviews about this hotel on trip advisor. We had not one issue here. We had a room with 2 double beds and the rooms were plenty big enough for the both of us. The rooms were very clean and felt comfortable as soon as you walk In. I can't say enough about the staff here. So incredibly friendly and welcoming. From the reception staff,  the cleaners, bar staff and security guards we always felt welcomed. The port authority bus terminal is right across the road so you can just jump on a train to take you anywhere in the city. Lots of little eateries around and a short walk to times square. I saw some reviews saying the area was unsafe but we were 2 girls staying here and I can confirm that not once did we feel unsafe.. there is always people around so there is no issues getting to the hotel from out and about. Most nights we would finish our day with a drink at the bar. Nice and relaxing.All in all I would certainly stay here again and look forward to coming back to Distrikt Hotel.

This is truly a no frills experience. The lobby is minimal, there is no onsite exercise room or pool, although there is a small cafe adjacent to the lobby. In exchange, the rooms seem reasonably large for a New York City hotel these days. We stayed in one of their large rooms, which had an excellent King size bed, a small desk, closet and a case that had some small drawers, a small refrigerator and a TV on top. The hotel has the standard Hilton WiFi offerings, a free standard WiFi which was adequate for browsing, email etc and a higher level for purchase or higher tier Hilton customers. The bathroom was small, but adequate. I give them extra credit for providing a wall mounted magnifying mirror, a small convenience that is often absent even in higher priced hotels. Overall the room was clean and appeared to be well maintained. Staff were friendly and helpful.\nThe Distrikt is located on 40th St, between 8th and 9th Avenues, directly across the street from the side of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. This is easy walking distance from the Theater District, and near a confluence of subway lines, so it\u2019s a good base of operations for site seeing or business in Manhattan. There are also numerous restaurants and fast food places on 9th Avenue nearby. On the other hand, this is not the area to be in if you are looking for charm or New York style! The trade off was worth it for us, we had a comfortable, clean place to stay at an extremely good price and easy access to everything we wanted to do.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

There are only 5 rooms per floor so don't expect huge rooms but for us, we didn't spend much time there except to sleep & shower. I think it would be awfully tight if you had children.  It's common to wait for another elevator because it's full of carts etc. as staff also uses the only 2 that go to the lobby (that's a consideration if you have physical limitations and can't use the stairs). The lobby & bar are also small so we didn't spend any time there but we did see a few folks having evening  drinks. There were some limited breakfast options for sale but we chose to walk a few blocks to the Westway Diner each morning. There is a desk with a computer for public use. Internet in the room was super slow. No gym onsite but we were told we could use one nearby but didn't. My friend just walked the 32 flights of stairs instead! The staff was always cordial during any contact we had with  them.\n\n Location across the street to the subway & bus station was super convenient but also came with bus noise if your room is on that side of the building. Views from the upper floors were scenic but the down side of the upper rooms is the plumbing (shower will fade away to nothing & then return full force either super hot or cold if water runs in a nearby room). \n\nWe never felt uncomfortable walking to the hotel after dark as there were lots of folks around. While it's approximately a block from Times Square, it's  a hike to lots of the tourist venues so wear your most comfortable shoes. \n\nHousekeeping made the beds and put fresh towels out each day but water rings on the nightstand were there when we checked in & still there when we left. It was pretty obvious that the floor wasn't vacuumed during the stay either. The day we were to check out, housekeeping knocked on the door at 8am! We always leave our room early so it can be turned over quickly but not that early!\n\nBe aware of all the extra daily charges: \nUrban destination $25, NY misc $2.22, NY misc $1.47, NY State $30.06, NYC tax $19.91, occupancy tax $2, JAVITS fee $1.50. That's over $82 in extras. There was also an additional amount held on my card when I checked in for any \"misc\" room expenses. Seems like it was $300 but I can't find my notes to confirm that amount and since we didn't have any expenses, it was reimbursed to my card on check out. The urban fee provides you with a delivery of 2 \"free\" bottles of water to the room & 2 drink tickets which can be used for drinks or coffee which you must get from the lobby desk each day. Note that there is no coffee maker in the room and breakfast is not included in the room price.\n\nWe used NYC Perfect Transportation for our trip to and from JFK airport ($125 each trip +tip) and HIGHLY recommend them. Our driver Miguel was wonderful so we requested him for both trips. \n\nI would consider this to be an average place to stay compared with other hotels in the area.\n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Since it only has about 150 rooms, it\u2019s not a zoo. There are five (5) rooms per floor. Two facing front towards the Port Authority Bus Terminal, three in the back. If I understand correctly room ending in \u201c04\u201d (like 3004) would face the building behind (no view) while 03 and 05 will give decent partial views, as you get higher of course. Rooms are smaller, because it is NYC, but not tiny. Baths are shower only, and very nice. \nEven though building only has two elevators, we never had to wait too long. I expected much longer waits.  \nStaff was very pleasant and helpful. \nThere is no on site gym or pool. Not unusual in NYC. They do have a gym off property you can have access to.\n\nNegatives - There is no restaurant on property. They have a snack bar. You can get a drink and some finger foods. Breakfast is grab and go....basically, coffee and a muffin. There are many places to eat nearby, so not a huge deal. But a really breakfast or a continental breakfast bar would be nice. \n\nComplaint - not the staff\u2019s fault, but makes no sense (and yes, I knew this going in), there is a $25 a day \u201curban fee,\u201d call it a resort fee or whatever....I\u2019m actually ok with paying a resort fee, but not for things I\u2019m supposed to get free as it is. I am a Hilton Gold member, I am supposed to get free water in room, free WiFi and free local phone (who uses a land line anyway)....all of this is part of the resort fee. You do also get two free drink tickets (per person) to use at the bar (maximum value of $10), so in theory you do get $20 in drinks (if two people) but we don\u2019t drink! So I used it for a latte or OJ, maybe $6? Just seems to me, this resort fee should be waived for Hilton Gold\/+...IMO.\n\nWould we stay here again? Maybe. Not because of the hotel, it\u2019s nice, we liked it. As a whole, we liked the location as well....Times Square\/Broadway is literally, two blocks East or two-three blocks up, respectively. Subway entrance is near end of block, on right. Looks like you\u2019re going down to a XXX place, but it\u2019s not, its just a store window down there. \nThat said, due to the location, it is dirtier and more homeless than you\u2019ll run into down in SoHo or the Village. Never really felt unsafe, but it is still cluttered and dirty on the streets. \n\nYou want a quieter hotel, close to Times Square, the shows and whatever, this is a nice place. I\u2019d recommend it.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Arrival and check in were smooth. The staff was friendly, welcoming and professional.  We found the rooms small but typical of NYC hotel rooms.  The rooms were nicely appointed and the furnishings were modern and updated.  This is where it goes down hill.  The heater did not work the entire weekend.  We notified the front desk of the issue upon discovery late Friday evening, however it was late and no one from maintenance was on staff requiring us to wait until  8am the next morning.  We requested someone come up early on Saturday morning.  We also informed them the tv was not working.  At first when we attempted to change the channel, the TV would abruptly turn off.  We eventually got the tv to change channels but we only had 3 grainy channels. We called again in the morning to remind the front desk of our issues with the heater and tv.  Someone finally showed up around 1030 a.m. He worked on the heating unit and got it working, we informed him of the issue with the tv as well.  He left and returned with a USB Memory stick and a second maintenance worker to look at the heater.  The first maintenance worker fixed the tv, while the other worker worked on the heater.  We had to leave in order to eat before our broadway show.  We were gone all day and didn't return to the room until approximately 1 a.m and the room was freezing cold.  The heater was not working.  We notified the front desk but again since it was in the middle of the night no one from maintenance as on staff.  We requested a new room, but was told that they didn't have any clean rooms for us to move to.  We understand problems can happen, however as a loyal Hilton Honors Member and disabled veteran, for this level of inconvenience I would expect the hotel management and\/or Hilton to give me a full refund for my stay.  It was 37 degrees Friday night and 33 degrees Saturday night.  The room was EXTREMELY cold which we had to endure for two nights.  The desk associate offered us free breakfast, then the manager called us later Sunday afternoon and offered to refund the $25 \"Urban destination fee which covered the bottled water and internet, things usually free at most Hilton properties for Honors members.

This year the Westin's rates were so outrageous we decided to try another hotel. I stumbled upon Distrikt Hotel after calling another Hilton property that was full, but whoever answered the Hilton line mentioned there was a Hilton boutique hotel close to Times Square called the Distrikt Hotel. The hotel was definitely great and walking the extra three blocks (this is on 40th and the Westin is on 43rd) was worth it to us for the hundreds of dollars we saved! The hotel doesn't have a restaurant just a snack bar, but there are other hotels nearby with restaurants. Hotel staff were great and helped us with all our requests. A gal who works at night named Christina was SUPER friendly and helpful! Cleaning staff came daily and on time and the entire hotel is very modern and tidy! The building is very tiny and tall... there's 35 floors and each floor only has 5 rooms. We asked for a quiet room, and we were put in room 302 right next to the elevator- and also where you could hear street noise. All the lower floors in NYC hotels you can hear street noise- it's New York after all... it just would have been nicer to have had that request honored for a quieter room. Another thing that was disappointing about our stay was that the Wi-Fi did not work at all. We were hit with a $25 a day \"destination fee\" that included our \"free\" Wi-Fi (which we did not have our entire stay). Again... most big cities are doing these slimy destination fees to increase room rates by keeping the \"official\" price on booking sites lower. Until the FCC stops this deceptive practice I've come to accept most hotels in NYC are usually at minimum going to be $25 more a night than the listed price. Although it's annoying, I booked my room knowing this fee was going to be tacked on. I don't understand why I paid a destination fee... when we had zero Wi-Fi. Overall I did feel safe in this location, and it was near enough to Times Square and the Theatre District, and the room price was competitive.

The location is conveniently located directly across the street from a subway access, is a short walk to Times Square, and good places to eat in Hells Kitchen. As others have mentioned, the bus station is across the street and we did see one or two homeless folks in the evenings on our walks back to the hotel-but there are homeless\/mentally ill people EVERYWHERE in a big city like New York. In fact, if you actually enter the bus station, it\u2019s pretty nice and a variety of people use it. Plus, it provides an affordable option to and from the airport. I never felt in danger walking around in the evening outside the hotel-we were only asked for money when near Times Square. \n\nThe hotel itself was a pleasant surprise. We arrived early morning, well before checkin but the hotel allowed us to store our bags for free while we explored the city. After checking in later in the evening, we were pleased to discover the small number of rooms on each floor made for quiet evenings. The room was comfortable and actually a decent size for NYC standards. The elevator also required a key to be scanned to get to the floors which was nice added security. \n\nAs others have pointed out, there is an added $25 fee each day-but this covered two drinks from the bar and water in the room each night-not really a big deal for us. In fact, having our two drinks in the hotel bar each evening allowed us to meet others in the hotel who were doing the same thing and provided delightful conversations. \n\nOverall, the Distrikt Hotel is a wonderful little place in a convenient location. I\u2019d stay again and recommend it to anyone looking to be near Times Square and the Metro. And if homeless scare you, just don\u2019t come to New York City. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had great rooms and the staff was extra friendly and nice and the place was spotless. So finally I make it there again, very much looking forward to it but what a change there has been. We were put in room 1004 and right away I asked to be moved but the hotel was full ( I understand that, it was Pride weekend) but I was miserable there. The room was very dark, very bad lighting and even if you opened the blinds, there is just another house there so very little light coming in. The carpet was filthy, the soles of my feet showed that. And it was a very musty smell in the room. There were no decorations nor anything else in the room really. Just a very uncomfortable bed. No mini bar to keep anything cold and just plastic cups to drink out of. One small bottle of shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, very cheap products. The shower was moldy, the backrest of the bed was worn and torn with big patches ripped. Door frames scruffy and dirty, one robe for two people. They only have two lifts for a 32 story building and one of them was out of work most of the time. Terrible noise that woke us up every night and every day, needs more insulation so dont ever stay that low.  They promise you two drink vouchers a day but it works so you have to ask for them every day. So first day we seem to have arrived too late and the bar was closed. Next day, the bar was closed anyway. Third day I got them. Forth day we were checking out so we did not get them. In my mind, I should have gotten 8 on arrival for the 4 nights we stayed to be used when I wanted to. They also should not charge extra for cocktails. Before, they had great front desk staff, this time, they all seemed very bored and certainly not interested in me. Yes, the area has a lot of drunks\/druggies but I knew that but it makes me sad to see how downhill this hotel has gone, certainly not worth the money they charge and it surprised me greatly to have to pay $114 for taxes, that is the fault of my booking site tho,  this really was more of a motel than a hotel.

When I stayed there years ago there was only 1 hotel in the street, I believe there is now 5 hotels. There is some homeless people lying around but they are on a lot of streets not just this one.  In all the years I have stayed here, I have never seen anything untoward, and there is lots of tourists coming and going from all the 5 hotels. This would not put me off staying.

Keep in mind we were sitting at the bar and could see and hear him.\n\nAround 4 pm we came back to the hotel to go to our room and it still wasn't ready. The staff finally gave us another room that was supposed to be clean. I wish we had waited! Our room had tears and scuffs in the leather headboard, the carpet wasn't properly vacuumed, the walls were cracked, and the bathroom light switch was hanging off the wall. \n\nAt check out, there wasn't a manager available and so I explained all of our grievances to a staff member. To add insult to injury we booked this stay with a certificate and shouldn't have had taxes and fees added to our bill and yet they were on there.

First, i'll start with the negatives. The obvious one is the stupid urban destination fee, which basically gives you wifi (which considering you get wifi in starbucks i dont think it shoukd be something you pay seperatly for) access to a gym..because i had time for that lol, some bottled water and 2 drinks a day at the bar. Very dissapointed that there was no tea\/coffee making facilities in the room, and finally after leaving early in the morning one day and having our room serviced, we returned late in the evening only to find our door open! Not impressed. Luckily nothing had been taken, but obviously complained at front desk, they were very appoligetic and gave us a couple of free drinks.\n\nNow onto the positives. The hotel is in an amazing location, right next to the main bus terminal. 2 mins from time sqare. The room was spacious, clean, nice bathroom, and the bed was soooo comfy. Staff were always friendly polite and knowledgeable. The positives about this place outweigh the few negatives we have and we would def stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I waited 15 minutes for the hotel to sort out his room and another 30 minutes to figure out what to do with me. They eventually gave me a room for the night (I was booked for 2 nights) but told me I had to be out in the morning and they would find me a new room for the 2nd night. The new room they gave me was probably supposed to be closed for maintenance as the A\/C didn't work and the shower handle came off when I tried to turn on the water in the morning. I was left a letter by the person on duty the first night which was supposed to be a credit for 1 of the 2 nights.

The gentleman at the front desk said he would have the manager come find as as quickly as he could.  He confirmed that the room was indeed ours and they would rebook the other guests.  We showered, got dressed, and after an hour of no one coming up, left to go explore the city.  \n\nWhen we came back, we could not get into our room.  We went downstairs and were told that that room was no longer ours and was issued to another guest!!!  The male front desk attendant was a complete moron and still hadn't made the updates in the system.  Another attendant re-issued our key cards (STILL NOTHING FROM A MANAGER) and we went back to our room.  \n\nSeveral minutes later a manager did stop by with an apology and a bottle of wine.  I explained that a bottle of wine was not enough to make up for having us barged in on.  She explained that was all she could offer and would speak to the general manager the next day to see if more could be done.  We booked directly through Hilton, so she said they couldn't offer anything more, but that the GM would reach out before we checked out or call me.\n\nUpon checkout we asked for our bags (which we had checked earlier in the day to go exploring)  The same moron male front desk attendant said he would text someone to get our bags.  We waited nearly 40 minute and nothing.  After several other guests had come to get their bags and got them we asked what the delay was,  The moron completely forgot about us.  He said, Please give me your ticket.\"  I explained that we already gave it to him.  The competent female attendant took the ticket,  asked why he waited so long if there was no response to the text he sent and went to retrieve our bags.  She came bag and stated that she couldn't find them.  She then asked moron if they were behind the counter with him.  Sure enough.  Our bags had been sitting right there behind this idiot the entire time.  FIRE or retrain mop top, idiot male front desk attendant. \n \nWe've been home now for 3 days and still no contact from the manager about compensation for being walked in on.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The trip was mainly for my parent's 50th birthday so I emailed to enquire about paying for an upgrade and getting some bubbly in the room. I got one reply and nothing else despite several emails and phone calls, needless to say no upgrade was successfully arranged which was disappointing. When spoken about on arrival, desk staff shrugged shoulders and didn't seem apologetic at all.  \n\nCons \n- Staff seem bored and uninterested in  the clients staying in their hotel. Very rude and at times hostile when talking with us. - \n- At one point staff stayed in elevator without inviting us in when opened at our floor. Instead closed doors immediately without acknowledging us standing waiting. \nPro's\n- Small snacks in bar advertised but waited over 30 minutes for three bagels and three hot drinks. No apologies for wait and instead very rude member of staff serving, all but throwing food and drinks at us. \n- Close proximity to Times Square, subway stations and plenty of restaurants\/cafes nearby. \n- Really good service at getting car organised back to airport with a decent price. \n- Rooms tidied daily, clean towels everyday and two free bottles of water each day placed in room. \n\nOverall don't think the price paid reflected the hotel we saw. I don't know why staff continue to stay if they don't want to be there and actually help their guests with concerns\/enquiries. \nI believe the hotel is now part of the Hilton group but certainly doesn't live up to the reputation of that company or other Hilton hotels I have visited.

The email and internet access to the hotel staff was sports at best and when finally able to contact after 3 days there were no upgraded rooms I was promised from a previous stay so we did not get to take advantage of that. Also by their own admission the staff seemed unsure of new policies and procedures and the hotel seem to be woefully understaffed. There is a small bar in the back to get coffee and danish in the mornings and alcohol and snacks at night. There were a few days when there wasn't staff at the bar even at 9 a.m. for a cup of coffee or 6 p.m. for a cocktail.

Plus corners of the Shower had Mold\/Mildew and the Faux Leather Headboard was peeling off. Still thought this Hotel had booming potential especially given the location. However, upon Check out and since I had already pre-paid I opted to pay the Hotel fees in Cash and surprisingly a few days later I saw that same charge on my Credit Card as pending. Should have suspected something since the Guest Services Agent (Adrianna) said her system was experiencing problems and she could only email the Receipt, and not print a copy. \n\nAfter speaking to the then Finance Manager, a Mr. Rich Valles who suggested that I give it between 10-15 days in order for the charge to reverse. Well, it's now been months, MONTHS!!! I've been emailing them back and forth...calling several times and have yet to receive a response or acknowledgement. The last time I called, I spoke to an Eva, who confirmed that Rich no longer works there and to forward the email again to her attention and she will ensure that it's forwarded on to the new Finance. Again, no luck, no satisfaction, no response....just a huge disappointment. Given the delays and constant back and forth, I have no choice but to alert my Bank of this double charge in order to receive my money back. Dear Distrikt...NEVER again!!!

I ordered 3 wines, one of the glasses were chipped and I cut my lip. So I went to the bar man showing him the glass and my cut lip, he changed the glass and gave me 3 mini plasters.

Very nice reception staff who are most willing to help if you need direction or any advice. Nice clean rooms, well appointed with good bathroom. The Cafe bar was a bonus as very handy for a snack in the morning. Unfortunately there was only one man serving so you needed to wait if there was a queue. An extra server would have been great as you do not want to hang around whilst other get served.\nGreat position in 40th Street for all the sights of NY. Also if going to JFK Airport to or from the hotel the Blue line station is near the hotel in 40th Street and that line goes to JFK where you pick up the Airtrain to the terminal. Much cheaper at $2.75 plus $5 for the airtrain than getting a taxi whichthe hotel can arrange for $70.

The staff were friendly- big thanks to Dennis at the door for helping with our bags and transportation!\n\nThe room was clean and functional, but seemed much smaller than advertised. Also, missing some amenities like shower caps (essential!) and kettle. The beds were comfortable and we did have a rather nice view.\n\nWe never used our bar vouchers (too busy) and the bar space wasn\u2019t particularly appealing. I made use of the gym access once, it is actually two blocks away, which is unhelpful in rainy snowy weather! The gym also charges $6 towel rental and there is no water fountain- these are things the hotel staff should warn and prepare gym goers for! \n\nWe had one hiccup where the staff upon check out charged our stay to the wrong credit card (despite my deliberately confirming with them at check in that the card used to \u201chold\u201d the room and incidentals would NOT be used for our final bill). Desk staff were apologetic but shrugged shoulders and claimed inability to reverse the charge. As a result, we wound up paying $100 in currency conversion fees that we would have avoided had they used the card we requested. \n\nThere is a parole office a few doors down, so lots of undesirables hanging out nearby. I guess there would be security, but it was not wonderful to walk past them every morning.\n\nSo, all up, a great stay, but I wouldn\u2019t feel a particular desire to stay again unless I got a great deal on rates.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Guy on reception looked a little bored on check in and had limited eye contact but did get in that we would be charged a daily hotel fee and needed my credit card for any incedentals..I was aware this is common so was not concerned. I was surprised however at the added hotel fee as i had not been aware of this on booking so the next morning I asked another receptionist to check this for me. She apologized and said the fee did not apply to me as I had booked in November the year before and this was prior to the fees being introduced so said these would now not be deducted from my credit card. Not sure why I was going to be charged if this was the case as the guy at check in had all this information, but receptionist I queried this with was helpful and much more friendly. Queen sized room was clean and daily service from maid was excellent, but room decor was a little tired with rips in headboard, screw holes and pencil markings on wallpaper, worn carpet and peeling laminate furniture in bathroom. Duvet had marks on it and was only covered in sheets rather than a duvet cover. Room was warm and comfortable and WiFi worked well throughout the hotel. Website states these rooms have a coffee machine and mini fridge but we didn't have these in our room. We did purchase some hot drinks from bar to have there (given in paper cups) but don't know why some of stated facilities in room were missing.  Location for us was great: just a short walk to times Square and easy walking distance to lots of tourist sights, cafes, restaurants and subway. Yes it was opposite the bus station but we didn't mind this and we used this to find our way back to the hotel easy. There is a parole center down the street but again this just added to the experience and we didn't feel unsafe. On checking out I discovered payments had been taken from  my credit card for parking my car and a bar bill which I laughed about as definitely didn't have a car and we had paid cash for drinks in the bar at the time. Due to this checking out took some time and receptionist  had to go away to speak with manager before coming back and saying they would refund my credit card which would take 3-5 working days and apologised giving us a voucher to use in bar for 2 drinks. I asked for a copy of the bill which I was given and also one e mailed to me and it wasn't until later that I noticed the address on bill was definitely not mine so it looks as though my details were completely mixed up with someone else's on check in. Overall our stay at District was fine for a short stay at price I paid , but this hotel is definately in need of some TLC and description on website needs some attention so it reflects what you are actually getting, plus issues at check in and check out could have been avoided if staff had checked details correctly and more thoroughly of guests that are checking in and out of the hotel.

There was also A\/C to cool the room down if it became too hot.\nLocation...A few have said on TripAdvisor it's in a bit of a 'dodgy area', don't let this put you off, never once did we feel threatened, NYPD patrol everywhere & are always there any sign of trouble.  The hotel is in an excellent location, 5-10 walk to Times Square & close to most of the attractions North of Manhattan. If you don't want to take in the hussle & bussle of Times Square, try Dalton's bar or Walk Way Diner, both in between 42nd & 43rd Street on 9th Avenue - both do decent food & drink at good prices. There's also the Distrikt Hotel Bar itself, again always relaxed & good place to chill after a long day out sight seeing or shopping.\nThis stay was a massive tick off my bucket list, my wife was a little apprehensive before we went but even she was very impressed, the Distrikt was part of this.\nWould I book the Distrikt again?  Too right, first hotel on my list anyway if I'm ever lucky enough to visit New York again.\nThanks Distrikt x","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Times Square and Macy\u2019s are an easy walk and dining options are plentiful. There are wine and liquor shops close by ( not the Athens ) and a laundromat just down the the street on 9th. Be sure to book a room on a higher floor ( more expensive) to get a better view. Our room on the 25th floor had two comfortable double beds and a very nice bathroom ( although we did have some hot water issues.... which were attended to straight away). The airconditioning struggled occasionally and did not seem to operate in the hallway as we waited for the lift. The staff were very friendly and always greeted us with a welcoming smile. I was provided with a kettle and mugs on request and was able to make my own cups of tea and coffee. The small fridge was very efficient, keeping the milk and wine well chilled. The room was meticulously maintained throughout our 8 day stay and the wifi was fine except you had to login every 24 hours. While the immediate surrounds included a few homeless people and a parole board we felt quite safe making our way around. If you have a limited time in NY the Distrikt is a great base for exploring.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1503474,"title":"Room for improvement","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-10-13","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"There are a lot of minor issues with this hotel that require a fix to make it truly a 4-star property, in my opinion, and to earn it a 5-star TripAdvisor review, but the major issue was the sound of traffic (with the constant and to be expected honking in the city) while staying in Room 402. My guess is the combo of the lower floor and a window facing 40th St. is probably what did it. Surprisingly, being next to the elevator (which is hard to avoid considering there\u2019s only about 5 rooms on each floor) presented no noise issues. If you\u2019re not as good a sleeper as I am (and even then I still woke), you definitely need to request a higher floor room, assuming that will do away with the sound of traffic early in the morning. \n\nOn to the minor issues (but should be noted for a 4-star hotel): We weren\u2019t fully stocked with towels one day because their linen cleaning service was late. We had to call to learn this and missing towels were brought shortly after we made the request. Slightly annoying was being awakened to an early morning hallway announcement that the fire alarms would be tested just to have the same thing happen the next morning where the same announcement was made, followed by another announcement later in the morning, and eventually the actual testing. It didn\u2019t last long, but if it was possible to do it all in one day and have the announcement made and immediately followed by the test all at once and during non-sleeping hours, that would have been nice. \n\nAlthough tastefully decorated with a modern decor, the room definitely could use some love. One of the electrical outlets was so loose, anything I put in would eventually slip out with a slight jiggle. There were holes in the ceiling where old drapes once hung and sloppy drywall patching above the shower head that had yet to be sanded down and painted. The ruler drawn pencil marks down one wall also made the room appear as if the hotel hadn\u2019t fully completed the finishing touches before allowing guests to come in. (This is considering the room did not appear to be newly remodeled due to evident wear and tear, so I\u2019m thinking no one cared to do any touch-ups when the room was redone years back.) Again, all minor issues (especially when it comes to the cosmetic things), but attention to detail is what makes you a cut above the rest. \n\nOn to the pros: The bathroom was what sold me over the cheaper priced hotels, such as Yotel, because it was clean and a good size with a large, modern, glass-door shower. The room itself was also clean and a very comfortable size for two double beds and two people. (One luggage had to go on the armchair because even if a luggage rack had been provided, it would\u2019ve made the room tighter. The other luggage was placed on the large, but good and very cold, air conditioning unit which worked out fine.) The armoire was small and may present a problem for a winter wardrobe for one (if you don\u2019t like living out of your luggage for the most part), let alone two people, but it had a safe, fridge, some shelves, and a few small, soft-close drawers. I loved that the TV had tons and tons of good channels including Showtime. Check out was at noon which was terrific considering most hotels kick you out at 11am nowadays. A resort fee (aka \u201cCity Hotel Fee\u201d) is pretty much standard at any hotel these days, so I\u2019m unsure why it is a shock to so many reviewers. Although I agree that it\u2019s an annoying norm, at least Distrikt gives two daily cocktails\/beverage vouchers which is more than I can say for most hotels these days that give nothing. As for location, we mainly used Lyft, but the 13 minute walk we took to Times Square one evening was easy. The area didn\u2019t feel any less safe than any other place you\u2019d stay at around Times Square. There\u2019s always a group of people walking on the streets and cars everywhere, so I at least felt safe walking around with my mom in the early evening. The hotel is located a few doors down from 2 Bros Pizza which is cheap, convenient, and delicious. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been to the city at least once and you\u2019re over the need to stay in a glamorous, grand lobby hotel or somewhere smack dab in the middle of Times Square, this is a solid stay. It\u2019s more of a boutique hotel with a tiny lobby and good sized, not at all happening bar area, but the hotel service is very good and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check went pretty smooth and I was informed that $50 would be held as a deposit, 2 keys and complimentary drinks tickets.  (Don't try to take glasses from the bar to your room - you only get paper cups).  The room is very tired looking and not very clean, 2 beds for 2 adults and a 12 yr old which was what I had wanted.  The headboard was worn away, accumulated dust all around the room, nice small fridge and complimentary water.  The alarm clock kept beeping so we just unplugged it.  Nice touch with the multi usb plug very handy.  Wonky toilet seat and tired looking fixtures and fittings in the bathroom.  Good location very close to all that we planned to see.\n\nUnfortunately my husband was taken ill while we were at the hotel which necessitated a second night at the hotel, which cost me double the first night $350 for this room.  As he was ill there was no complimentary water so I went out to the local Duane Reade store and got a large bottle.  Reception staff indifferent to my plight, when I got an inkling that we may have to stay I rang reception on the Monday evening to get a price for the room $261 but because I didn't book it there and got stung with the inflated price the following morning.\n\nI for one will not be recommending the Distrikt Hotel, the rooms are below standard and do not resemble the photos on the different booking sites and indifferent staff.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check in was easy with really pleasant reception staff. All staff looked really smart. We also got a complimentary drink vouchers each for that evening at the hotel bar which we used.\n\nWe were in a double room on the 25th floor. We liked the fact that it is a small foot printed hotel with only 5 rooms per floor cutting down on noise from other residents.\n\nThe room was small, modern and clean. The bathroom had a good shower and sink unit and was also modern. We also had an amazing view towards the west side. There was a good sized TV on the wall with plenty of channels. The wardrobe was a good size with a couple of draws in it and a small safe. There was also an ironing board with an iron in there too that we used.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable with crisp clean linen. The WiFi was fast with good connection. Air con was excellent if a little noisy. The cleaning staff were very good and worked incredibly long hours. The hairdryer wasn\u2019t working on arrival and when reported it was replaced within 10 minutes.\n\nNow for the only quibbles and these are minor. The room wasn\u2019t set out very well. The double bed only had a bedside table on one side. This could be resolved if they had a smaller work desk increasing space at the side of the bed. I had to use my case for this purpose but then had to move it every time we used the wardrobe. The alarm clock in the room bleeped all the time due to the Bluetooth connection on it so we simply unplugged it. There isn\u2019t much room for storage of cases either. This could be resolved if the easy chair wasn\u2019t there. Of course we don\u2019t use the easy chairs or desks whereas other people do so it\u2019s easy for us to say as it is personal choice.\n\nAs I say these are minor and wouldn\u2019t stop us booking here again.\n\nThe bar is really good with various sports channels on and a good large variety of drinks and snacks. The location is excellent for the Times Square area and access to the Subway and buses. It\u2019s convenient for Grand Central and Penn Station via one stop on the Subway. One tip, if taking a walk downtown then turn left out of the hotel and go down 9th Avenue instead of 8th as it is much quieter.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay here very much.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room itself contained a small fridge (which was good as we'd brought a travel kettle to make a drink in the room,there's nothing supplied to make a drink) and the smallest ironing board on the planet which,although perfectly functional,needed to be stooped over to iron anything. \nThe hotel is more than acceptable but what swung it for us was the location - although we had no view from our window (unless concrete car parks are your thing) it's just a very short walk to Times Square\/fashion district where there's a hive of activity.\nI've seen other reviewers mention some dodgy-looking characters around the area but we found that to be the case all over the city! No-one bothers you anyway so it's not an issue.\nIf we ever returned to the area we'd probably look for another hotel just for a change but that's not to say there's anything wrong with the Distrikt - it's just that,for the money,there's nothing we found really special about it.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

What it is, is NOTHING like the website! The rooms are nowhere near as spacious, and it is nothing like as smart. Our room was comfortable, clean, but there were old stains on the carpet and the furniture was chipped and a bit shabby. The public spaces are functional but neither elegant nor particularly smart. That is the danger with accommodation in NYC - it is astonishingly expensive for what it is. The staff were, on the whole, friendly. Odd opening hours for the bar. European travellers need to note that tea\/coffee facilities in the room is not the norm in NYC, and there were none here. There was a fridge, which wobbled about in the bottom of the wardrobe. Also - beware of who you book with; my booking site told me that breakfast was included. It isn't; they don't include it. It is in an excellent location, moments from Times Square, although on the 'edgier' side of town. At least there's some local character! I wouldn't stay there again, but I wouldn't dissuade anyone from going - just be aware that it is very expensive, and compared to hotels in central European capital cities - the standard doesn't come anywhere near.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Good location close to time square and right next to good transport links. based on reviews we have read from last year when we booked I can only imagine this has went down hill since then. \n\nBeds are comfortable and the air condition, despite being an old unit, is very good and keep the room cool. \n\nThe housekeeper staff were very friendly and helpful. \n\nThe main desk staff were indifferent at best some were pleasant and some resolved nothing. We twice reported a broken handle on the toilet in our room that was not fixed so gave up. The room was advertised to have a refrigerator, (still advertised on the website) with fresh water each day. This wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nWhen I asked about this we were given a mini fridge that held 6 cans and didn\u2019t keep anything cold - felt a bit short changed by this and it was actually colder putting water on the air conditioning unit than in the mini fridge. As with the broken handle I had to report this twice. \n\nThe coffee in the hotel was well priced and very good quality, the lounge area it\u2019s self was also very nice. \n\nThe bar is advertised as being open until 11 however last drinks are 10:15pm. This could have been advertised better. \n\nWhile in the elevator, what appeared to be a manager spoke in a very derogatory fashion towards one of the housekeeping staff. \n\nOverall it was not the experience we have had before in nyc and we paid a lot more for this hotel. \n\nMy person experience is that I would not use the hotel again when I return to nyc.

The only bad side was as soon as you step outside you get harassed by people selling you tickets for buses and other things. Walking distance to Times Square and other various spots which helped out.

We also were really close to tour bus stops which was great! \nThe rooms were always clean and the maid service came daily. The front desk were more than helpful and explained everything whenever we had a question. It's a quiet hotel. I could never hear our neighbours from the room even when they'd come in at 3am and head to their room next door, as soon as that door was shut you could not hear a thing. There is a bar that serves some small bites and cakes but we never visited it. Down the road is the famous franchise of Carlos' bakery from Cake Boss and a small local shop for water and snacks if needed. There is a safe in the room that could fit a laptop if needed. The only issue was storage space, for a couple of days it was plenty, if we had stayed a week I don't think we would have fit all of our items in the wardrobe and drawers.

We had the bigger King room which was nice but small. No actually built in closet, standing one for clothes. Had safe. We only got the water bottles one time and you have to ask for the drink passes every day which is included in the resort fee.\n\nOur issues:\n1. No restaurant since new ownership. There is a bar and a few shelves with pre-packed items (cookies, bagel, sandwich) but no waitress or cooked food. \n2. No air condition first night, thankfully they fixed it for 2nd and 3rd nights as it was 90 degrees outside. The lobby was ice cold but elevators, hallways were hot all week.\n3. This hotel on priceline is a Times Square hotel but really it is a half block from Hell's kitchen. Not a big deal but block was sketchy with homeless people as you make you way from Times Square down 40th street.\n4. Maid service- Very very late for 2nd floor. 5pm first day and after being out all day the 3rd day with clean me sign they came at 6:30pm as we were getting ready for dinner. Told them to please come back in hour, they never did. After dinner we came back to hotel at 10:30pm and room was never cleaned.\n\nMost of our issues was with Priceline as they make this hotel a 4 star and really it is like a Holiday Inn 3 star. When priceline called the Distrikt Hotel manager he never came to phone and told his front desk girl to tell them he did have a restaurant. Not true even on Distrikt hotel website it says market pantry. If we have known it was a 3 star type of hotel we would have felt differently but this hotel is up against Millennium, Sheraton, and the Hyatt right at Times Square for same price.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It always looked a good hotel but was always just a bit above my value for money quotient.  \n\nI was surprised therefore when I got it at a very good price for 3 nights in late July for our families long American road trip.  \n\nThe hotel is located right beside the Piet Authority so very handy if like us you were arriving by coach.  I quick 3 minute walk took us to the hotel and the very efficient staff had us booked in and we got a room on the 8th floor.  The hotel by its design is very narrow so there are only a few rooms on each floor and I was very pleasantly surprised with regards to the size of the room given the notoriously small size of New York rooms.  The room was also equipped with a fridge and safe which was very useful.\n\nBathroom was a good size and was equipped with a hair dryer. \n\nMy only complaints would be a very minor one that some of the furniture and fittings is starting to show a bit of wear and tear taking away from the slightly higher class of the hotel and secondly ( a bit more important) the mattress in one one of our beds had a noticeable sunken spot were the springs had obviously gone. I could have reported this and seen what would have happened but to be honest my normal awkward sleeping position meant it didn\u2019t affect me too much and with only being there 3 days I couldn\u2019t be bothered. \n\nOverall I would recommend the hotel and it\u2019s location.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The TV had multiple stations with no signal, but a complaint to the front desk resulted in a quick repair.  But the worst part was the air conditioning in our room.  We spent both nights sweating to death, and getting insufficient sleep.  The hotel didn't have any empty rooms to which to move us, and they didn't even have any fans to get air moving in our room.

I hate that particular hotel, and always find better deals in the vicinity. For the longest time, I was a huge fan of the RIU Plaza Times Square, but this year, I wanted to try something different. I came across a killer deal for the Distrikt Hotel on Booking.com, and decided to give it a shot. I must say, it was one of the best stays I've ever had in NYC. Not only was the hotel immaculate on the inside, but the service and staff were an absolute joy to work with. Everyone was super nice and accommodating. The check-in was an easy process, and the location to the Port Authority Terminal & a Chase Bank on the corner made my life so much easier. It was also a quick 15 minute walk to my conference. \n\nRoss, the bartender at the Collage Bar in the lobby, was an immediate favorite. He was a wealth of information on the fine dining scene, and he made a mean Japanese Slipper cocktail! I also had the pleasure of meeting Chef Wanda Richardson and her assistant James. They were teaching a sushi class in the lounge, and I had the pleasure of observing from the bar. Ross was also kind enough to share his samples! \n\nI would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to others. The rates, location, and service are great for business or personal travelers wanting to be in the heart of Times Square without being too overwhelmed by the street crowds. There also some great pizzerias on the block. I highly recommend the one near the NW corner of 40th\/8th Ave (near the New York Times bldg).","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Thank you so much Denis. \n\nMy only negative experience at the hotel was the abrupt manner in which one of the bar staff spoke to me regarding a tip. I had inadvertently forgotten to tip him (as it is not something we do regularly in the UK) and he made his displeasure very clear. As soon as I realised my omission I apologised and added a tip. However this incident and the way he spoke to me really put a dampener on the whole evening. He could quite easily have just quietly and politely reminded me of the tipping culture in America.... after all good manners and human decency should be the same no matter where you are in the world!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However after booking I believe the hotel changed hands. When we booked, our room was meant to have a coffee machine as part of the in room amenities and our room was to include a basic \u201cto go style\u201d breakfast. The problems started before we even arrived. After checking our booking online a few months prior to our trip I noticed the room price had increased a few hundred dollars. After I got the run around from one staff member I was finally told that a hotel tax had been introduced. However it was introduced after we booked! It should not be expected that this new tax would be applied to existing bookings, but it was.  After much emailing back and forward I managed to have the hotel tax removed. The other issue was they stopped including breakfast! And expected that I would be fine not receiving it. HARDLY! Half the reason we chose Distrikt was that breakfast was included and a coffee machine in the room. After more emailing back and forth they said they would manage to sort something out for us. Then once it came to checking in there was no record of breakfast to be included. I tried sorting this issue out with the hotel manager, Rich I believe his name was, who was SOOOO rude I cannot even begin to describe! People like him should really not be working in hospitality. He is an absolute disgrace to the hotel. He didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to look up my booking, just blatantly just said no, he wants proof! Even though I had been through this via email with another staff member.  So 3 days in to a 4 days stay and still no breakfast. On a side note there\u2019s the most amazing cafe a few doors down with $2 everything, lifesaver!!\nAll of the other staff were lovely, Linda and Sahara especially. \nAnother few negatives on the hotel were its location. While it is really central, it\u2019s in a pretty dodgy area and felt quite unsafe especially at night. \nAlso, there are two elevators in the hotel and they take forever!!!! Think we waited about 8 minutes one morning. \nThe rooms are small, but it\u2019s New York I guess! Would be nice to at least have a kettle with tea and coffee making facilities. \nEnd of the day I wouldn\u2019t stay here again. Even with 50% off ($270 USD) when I booked it was still too much for the quality and service at Distrikt.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I expected a lot more based on this scoring and the reviews left below.  I would say this is fine, it is clean and near subways. \n\nHowever, the rooms are small even by NYC standards. I tend to stay at least once a month and these are tiny.  And there no common amenities in the room or available such as a coffee machine or ice.  You can call for ice - it took 35 minutes the first time and 1 hour the second time.  There are also no amenties in the hotel.  The downstairs bar closes by 10:30 pm and there are no food options besides chips.  No vending in the hotel either. \n\nThe worst part has to be the elevators.  There is no service elevator which means that you are stuck with the workers going exactly one floor and it will stay on floors for minutes at a time. In general you will need to give yourself 8 -10 minutes to go up or down. \n\nI also booked the city view king room (the highest class room they offer).  Again, it was incredibly small and the city view was the parking garage next door.  Quite disappointing.  \n\nThe room is clean, the staff is fine.  It is nothing extraordinary even when you pay for such. I think there are better options, but it is fine.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is very convenient to the Broadway theater district and reasonably priced for NYC. The lobby was small but adequate and we were greeted quickly on our arrival. Since our Broadway show was before check-in time, they stored our suitcase for us and completed all of our check-in except for giving us our room key. They automatically added another mandatory $25 to the published room rate for add-ons such as 2 drinks in the bar, bottled water in the room, WiFi, and some other amenities that I consider to be standard. We ran into this in another large city recently, so I guess it's becoming just another way to get more money out of us.\n\nAfter we got out of the show and went back to the hotel to retrieve our suitcase and get our room key, the clerk at the counter was confused and seemed to want to go through the whole check-in process again. Finally, another clerk who overheard what was going on told him how to handle it, and we got our room key. Our room appeared to be neat and clean and the air-conditioner was working very well; however, there were numerous flea-sized bugs flying and crawling around the drain in the middle of the bathroom floor. The countertop around the bathroom sink was very small and did not provide enough room for personal toiletries or clothes. The toilet didn't have a lid, so we couldn't even close the lid to place clothing on top of it. I certainly didn't want to place even my dirty clothes on the floor with the small bugs. The shower was a walk-in shower with only a very small lip (maybe 1\/4 inch) between the shower enclosure and the bathroom floor. The lip was not sufficient to keep the shower water from flowing into the main bathroom area, resulting in a very soggy bathmat.  In the bedroom area, electrical outlets were very limited. For instance, the desk had a single electrical outlet with 2 plugs. Both plugs were being utilized by the TV and desk lamp, leaving nowhere to plug in a laptop computer or charge a phone. The same was true on the nightstand, although the alarm clock did have USB plugs on the back.\n\nWe did not complain to management, nor did they inquire how we enjoyed our stay when we checked out the next morning. If we had been staying more nights, I would have requested a different room. I will certainly try another hotel the next time we visit NYC.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a room for 3 to 4 adults & whilst it was very comfortable room it was somewhat on the small side. Also we had 1 very small wardrobe to hang clothes in. We felt the room would be moot suited to 2 adults & a child. Apart from this we had a good time & Rich on reception was very helpful when I had to e mail a medical report to my insurers.

Really well located in midtown within walking distance to Times Square, Empire State building and most other attractions.  All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and greeted us from reception whenever we were coming and going from the hotel.\nOur room was on the 26th floor and surprisingly quiet for the middle of Manhattan! It was quite small but clean and neat and had everything we needed. In the room there was a safe, iron and ironing board, a generous sized TV and toiletries in the bathroom.\nThe shower was really powerful, the air conditioning was effective and the bed was really comfortable.\nEach day our room was refreshed, bed made and clean towels replaced the old ones.\nThere are only a couple of things that could have improved overall, some of the mains power sockets in the wall seemed loose and were unusable, when we tried to plug something in the plug wouldn't stay and fell out. The other thing I found strange was that the duvet was not in a duvet cover, it was wrapped between two regular sheets that came off it as soon as you moved it and you ended up with an uncovered duvet with no sheets.\nOur departure on our final day was handled really well, our cases were stored for us until it was time for us to go to the airport and a private car was arranged for us for the time we requested. This service was fantastic, it saved us having to haul our luggage and hail our own cab and cost the same flat fee to JFK as it would in a yellow cab.\nIf we came back to New York, we would definitely stay again.\n","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We wanted somewhere central to stay to make our stay in the city easier, and after spending 4 great nights at this hotel in May, we are delighted with our choice.\n\nFirstly, the welcome we received on arrival was possibly one of the best experiences we have had from a hotel front desk anywhere in the world.  Shariis on the front desk was exceptional, an absolute superstar.  She couldn't have made us feel more welcome if we were family!\n\nIn addition to Shariis, it is fair to say that all of the staff that we met during our stay were fantastic, whether they were maintenance, working the bar, or on the front desk, they all made the hotel feel friendly, and a real home from home, which I didn't necessarily expect in a New York hotel.\n\nWe were on the 31st floor (3101), and had a very nice view over one end of Times Square from our full length windows, also looking out through the buildings we could see the river.  The room itself was very nice.  Spacious, comfortable (great mattress), good bathroom, and a refrigerator.  The only thing missing was coffee making facilities, but a minor point.  I would also add that we weren't bothered by street noise considering how close to Times Square we were.\n\nWe didn't use the hotel restaurant for breakfast, so can't comment on that, but we did use the bar, which was very nice with a good atmosphere.  Jovi, the bartender, did a great job of making us feel welcome, and we really enjoyed our conversations.\n\nIn terms of location, the hotel was perfect for us, close to Hells Kitchen, Times Square, Port Authority Bus\/Subway, and everything was easy because of this.  There were plenty of dining options & bars in the vicinity.\n\nAll in all, we made a great choice of hotel, and would recommend the Distrikt Hotel NYC to anyone looking for a modern and friendly hotel for their stay in the City.  If the management of the hotel do read this review, they really should be proud of the job that their staff do, particularly Shariis, who is a fantastic ambassador for the hotel, and the reason I am sure that many guests would return, I know that we will.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was spotlessly clean with a large bathroom.  \n\nThe room is, however, basic with little or no frills.  This would be a budget hotel standard anywhere else. \n\nHaving said that, if you are in New York, you will probably not be spending too much time in the room. \n\nThe staff were all polite and courteous. \n\nMy main issue is with the air conditioning unit in the room. It is very noisy and woke me up every morning when it kicked in. At one stage, it started rattling. This was fixed by pressing down on the lid.  A simple enough exercise but not one you want to do at 6:30 in the morning. So make sure you pack some earplugs.\n\nThe cynic in me would also think that the hotel receives commission from booking transport with a company called ExecuCar. The Tripadvisor reviews for ExecuCar do not make good reading for them.  My Meet And Greet driver did not turn up!  I had to make five calls, and waited 40 mins in a heatwave in June before a driver turned up. This was a very unpleasant experience and added to the expense as I was using my UK-registered phone at \u00a31 a minute.  So I reckon at least \u00a325 in calls.  ExecuCar put me on hold whenever I called and cut me off several times. \n\nBy the time we managed to get a driver to turn up, it was main rush hour and my first visit to New York was spent in a very long rush hour traffic jam.  When I complained to a lady from ExecuCar during one of my calls chasing up the car, she said that I could cancel and complain.  I did send an email and I have not had the courtesy of a reply. And the driver requested the full Meet And Greet fare.  Appalling customer service. So, with the awful Tripadvisor reviews and this level of customer service, why is the hotel using them?  \n\nI did email the hotel before my visit asking for the best way to get to the hotel from Newark.  I was quoted a range of options with a reference to a \"shuttle\" bus that the hotel told me takes 2 hours. This is not the case, and I am again a little surprised as to why the hotel overstates the time. The answer is newarkairportexpress.com.  This bus takes you to the Port Area Bus Authority station which is a three minute walk from the hotel. It costs $18 and runs every 15 minutes. The Meet And Greet was $123 (I opted for this as it was my wife's special birthday - which makes the appalling service even more galling).","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This is a fair mid range hotel that is well-located in midtown Manhattan. \n\nReservation was made by way of booking.com. Email confirmations came through immediately and full payment was taken accordingly. We arrived an hour before check-in but room wasn't yet ready so we availed of the left luggage facility. Front desk staff were friendly and polite throughout our stay. \n\nOne minor hiccup worth mentioning - the hotel wanted to charge us an extra US$500 upon check-in. We showed them our full payment records and booking.com reservation confirmations. Only then did they check their systems and identify mistake on their end. The extra charges were eliminated and all was well after a few minutes. In the end, not a major problem but equally not something we enjoyed dealing with after a long flight. \n\nWhat we liked: \nAs for location, Distrikt Hotel is in a good spot, just 2-3 minutes walk from the 42nd Street station. There are numerous restaurants, bars and coffee shops in quick walking distance. \n\nLobby area is quite small in this mostly vertical skyscraper. Reminded us of many hotels we have at home in Hong Kong. Many floors with just a handful of rooms each. \n\nOur room was spacious and very good value for money compared to other properties we have stayed at in NYC over the past 5-6 years. Decor was modern and boutique manner. Bed was very soft and comfortable. Plenty of closet and luggage space and some nice views from the upper floor room we had. Bathroom was spacious and modern as well. Room safe was large and fit for multiple laptops. \n\nWhat we didn't like so much: \nA\/C didn't work as well as we would have liked. Mind you we had some unexpected hot temperatures during the week of our visit. Shower pressure was not as strong as we like as well. Room didn't come with coffee & tea facility - this would have been a quick and easy improvement to our stay. Wifi was hit and miss throughout our stay. At times perfect and at times very slow and unstable. \n\nIn the end, not a perfect stay at Hotel Distrikt but the pros outweighed the cons and we found the property to be good value for money at the time of booking.

Cleaners were in daily & provided us with clean towels. The hotel was spotless throughout. Would I return back to this hotel? Absolutely. Thank you for an enjoyable stay!

We were told someone would come and fix it but in the immediate to leave our possessions in our case!!! As time was limited we reluctantly did this but weren\u2019t happy about it. On arrival back at the hotel after a day out sightseeing we found our bedroom door open, I don\u2019t mean unlocked, I mean actually open!!! \nI went to complain at reception and was given a pitiful excuse that it must have been housekeeping (suggesting it had probably been left open since the morning). No sincere apology, frankly not bothered. Offered a free drink voucher but not told they expired that day so when we went to use them the next day they couldn\u2019t be redeemed.\nStaff on reception uninterested. People I\u2019m assuming were porters hanging about on their phones-who knows maybe they weren\u2019t staff and were guests? Hard to tell as no one remotely bothered about offering a good or friendly service. On checking out we were hit with a $50 fee for the WiFi, gym (that we hadn\u2019t been told existed) and two complimentary bottles of water that had been in our room both days. We hadn\u2019t been told of this charge on arrival and were disgusted. Fifty bucks for a gym we didn\u2019t know existed, WiFi which in this day and age should be free and four bottles of small water!! Wow! What a joke. Beware.

The first problem happened when I saw the amount charged by the website, that was completely different from what I saw. At that time I was not allowed to cancel my reservation due the policy rules (Then I thought: Ok! Let's forget this and enjoy NYC.)\nI was 100% SURE that I paid everything, but when I arrived to do the check in the receptionist asked for my credit card. I told her that in my understanding I had paid everything in advance and she agreed, and reverted to me with a smile and said: We are going to charge (block) you USD50 as a guarantee, and in the end of your stay this amount will be unblocked.\nIn this case, I agreed.\nSo, when I came back home I checked my credit card invoice and I was not understanding a charge of USD172 from the hotel. I sent an email to clarify and they replied to me explaining that it was a \"\"City Hotel fees\" - This is a package that includes two daily drinks at our Collage & Bar (teas, coffees, assorted beers or cocktails) and daily gym passes to Mid-City gym (valued at $15.00 per pass). It also includes access to our higher tiered wifi, unlimited local and long distance phone calls, plus two bottles of water replenished daily every day of your stay. The package costs $25.00 per night, with applicable tax. It is one of our best-valued packages. This service fee is applied to any reservations made after February 1st.\"     \nI replied to them that I was not aware of this. In the reservation I did at Cancelon.com this was not written anywhere, the receptionist never mentioned this when I did my check in. If I was told in advance that I was obliged to pay such fee, probably I would have used some of that \"advantages\". Of course I would be pissed of, but not feeling robbed or cheated like I'm feeling now. I tried to cancell this amount with the credit card, but it's not possible. Distrikt Hotel started ignoring my emails asking for solutions and I think it's fare to share with other travelers that this kind of charges can happen without your knowledge. Now I'm paying around R$600,00 for something I didn't have a clue that existed. By the way... I sent an email asking then to charge me with the service I used such as Internet and water bottles. But they still ignored.    \nBe careful.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Always happy to answer any questions and help plan your day, they even stored our bags and arranged a taxi back to the airport on our last day.\n\nWe booked to a room with a view and it was well worth the upgrade.

Our check-in was very smooth and we found out upon check-in that we had been upgraded from a cozy room to a roomy king with a view! Dennis was the chap in the lobby that helped with our bags and showed us to the room. Everytime we saw him in the lobby or in the lift he had a chat with us about where we'd been and what we planned to do next. He also offered advice on how to get there and many other useful tips. When we arrived in the room there was a lovely cupcake and a handwritten & drawn card with a wonderful congratulations message. Our room was on the 32nd floor and had a fantastic view of the city which was amazing to wake up to. The lift is key card access only so only someone staying on your floor or staff could access it. Yes there is a parole office down the street but we never had any issues with anyone lining up to go in or from anyone else. There is a great deli on the corner if you leave the hotel and turn left, it's across the road (Get the meatball sub!). It was a nice short walk to the bustle of times square and an even shorter walk to the subway. We had such a fantastic time in New York City which was only heightened by having this hotel room to come back to. The staff always said good morning when we left and welcome back when we came home. Our stay at the district was flawless. My parents had arranged a limo to pick us up from the airport and a private sedan to take us back. All arranged through the hotel. The hotel was superb, the neighbourhood is rather gritty but hey it's hell's kitchen, and if your looking for a place to stay in New York then this is the place. Hell's Kitchen is all part of the city's character! Thank you so much to all the staff for helping to make our honeymoon one we will always cherish and remember. We'll be back one day!","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was having repairs done on my apartment, so I had to do some hotel jumping over a fews day. Randomly picked this hotel off the Hotel Tonight app because the pricing was good.\n\nThe staff was ok, but not super helpful. Upon check-in (at 10:30p) we asked how long the hotel bar was open and the front desk told us 11p. So we went to our room, got settled and arrived at the bar with 10 mins to spare only to be told they stopped serving at 10:30. The next morning I asked the front desk why there were coffee makers in the photographs but none in our room. She told me she would call housekeeping and get one up there, but then sent me to the hotel restaurant where I could purchase coffee (why should I have to purchase it when it's advertised as free?). When I came back to the room much later that day I noticed there was no machine delivered. I asked the front desk about it again and this woman was much more friendly and helpful saying they phased out machines in the rooms and gave me coupons for free coffee. The location of the hotel is not very safe. Although, it is close to commuter lines and Times Square, the streets around the Port Authority is poorly lit at night and full of sketchy people. \n\nThe room itself was clean, small and basic. Good if you're not spending much time there, but I would look elsewhere.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Myself and my mum stayed at this hotel for 5 nights back in November 2017. Before leaving the UK my mum emailed the hotel to let them know it would be our first time visiting NYC and have heard it can be quite noisy therefore, would there be any possibility of being located further up the hotel rather than at street level. To our amazement we were upgraded the next day from a cozy queen to a roomy king with a view (a complimentary cupcake and birthday card was also thrown in). Upon arrival we were greeted by the loveliest and most helpful staff members going (I\u2019m so sorry, after 12 hours of travelling I couldn\u2019t remember your names). \nCheck in was quick and simple, the hotel reception was a reasonable size and guests were welcome to flavoured water everyday which was located at the front desk. Being 33 floors high I would have thought that lifts may have been a problem however, I was wrong. There were 2 lifts which operated daily, the wait for these lifts was roughly 1 minute (being so high up). Alternatively stairs are an option if you don\u2019t like lifts. Easy access for those with disabilities or families with pushchairs.\nStaff at front desk again were extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble, from getting advice on the subway system to booking cabs to the airport on the last day.\nThe hotel was exceptionally clean in the bar area and reception however, this made up for the lack of cleanliness in our room. Reading recent reviews you\u2019re lucky if you get \u2018Mary\u2019. The towels were changed  daily and were clean however, throughout the whole 5 nights the bed sheets were only changed the night before checkout. There was dust and the floors hadn\u2019t been hoovered since arrival. For the amount of time that was spent in the room, we didn\u2019t see the point of bringing it to their attention. \nThe beds were comfortable, lots of room which was great! Bathrobes and extra pillows were also provided.  Tea and coffee was provided on a daily basis, safe and mini fridge was a reasonable size. \nContinental breakfast was provided with a surcharge however, being in NYC there will always be somewhere cheaper to eat.\nHotel is a 5 minute walk from Times Square and 2 subway stations are located at the end of the road. Walgreens (supermarket) is also located 2 blocks away. Penn station is roughly a 10 minute walk away, restaurant and shops are dotted everywhere. \nThe port authority bus terminal and station is across the road however, noise was not a problem for us. If you leave the window open you will hear some sirens. For the City that never sleeps, we certainly did!!\nI would personally like to thank the assistant manager (Sharisse) and the gentleman who was working the afternoon on 21\/11\/17, your service was absolutely outstanding and for that I thank you. Sharrise thank you for the on the house Strawberry cocktails that were provided on the last day.\nHighly recommend this hotel, friendly staff, reasonable size, friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely be going back!!!","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But besides that, the hotel was honestly so underwhelming and disappointing. We paid a higher rate for what we were led to believe was a room with a view of the Empire State Building. When I emailed a few weeks before we were due to arrive to confirm this, we were told we actually wouldn\u2019t have a view of the ESB but that we would have a view. Our view was basically the car park on the roof of the port authority building. That is not what we were led to believe or asked for when we booked so be very careful. We booked this in April 2017 by the way.\n\nNext was the bar\/restaurant which was honestly so disappointing. I went down the first morning for some food and was charged over 35 dollars for two bagels and two cokes!! I know it\u2019s Manhattan but what a total rip off, obviously I shouldn\u2019t have paid but I was quite tired at the time. The server didn\u2019t even give me my full change because he didn\u2019t have enough coins and just looked at me as if to say tough luck. The previous two times my girlfriend stayed there was a restaurant that was so convenient, I don\u2019t know why they changed it, maybe there was new management but it is a total disaster and a rip off. I asked for room service that morning and was told no you have to come down. How convenient for a four star hotel.\n\nThe top of the wardrobe was absolutely coated in dust, we put a bag up there and were nearly choked by the dust falling down. Our first couple of days we didn\u2019t ask for our room to be cleaned, but after that we asked for the cleaners to come in and replenish the room with towels etc. but they never bothered to leave any toilet paper. I had to ask at reception and they sent someone up with ONE single roll! Unbelievable, like we were causing too much hassle for them. \n\nOverall, you would expect and deserve so much more from a four star hotel, we found it so inconvenient and frankly poor for the price. It felt such poor value for money and we definitely would not recommend.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The lines A C and E can get you literally any place you need. Times Square and MadisonSG within walking distances, good restaurants and fast food very near. Also couple of Delis to grab something quick. Complimentary coffee every morning you can brew in your room was huge plus!

It is ideally situated for exploring the city. During our stay we found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful. On one occasion we accidentally left the do not disturb sign on the bedroom door when we went out so the room wasn't cleaned (our fault) when we returned I went to the front desk to ask for some tea and coffee for the morning which was immediately provided with a smile. Before returning to our room we went into the bar for a drink (happy hour 2 till 7daily). Twenty minutes later we returned to our room to find it had been completely cleaned and tidied. Our room was well equipped with comfortable beds, coffee machine, fridge and safe. It accommodated four adults reasonably well although storage was limited. The bathroom was well equipped and had an excellent shower. The bath robes were a nice touch. When we left the front desk organised our transport to the airport which arrived on time and was of exceptional quality. When we return in the future we will definitely be booking this hotel.
