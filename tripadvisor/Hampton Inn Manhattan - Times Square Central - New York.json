Breakfast always had lots of great options (hot and cold), though I do recommend trying to get down there before 8AM especially during peak travel times.

In the hotel hall there are two sections with tables and chairs that come in great to buy and eat there, those nights when you arrive dead from walking all day. A couple of nights we bought pizzas next to the hotel (spectacular) and ate there. The hotel also has a coin-operated laundry that solves the issue of clothes if you stay for several days.

That's why I was rather surprised to be so impressed by his particular hotel. Not only was the room larger than I anticipated, the recognition of my loyalty was amply rewarded by a nice room upgrade and a generous snack basket with a personalized note left in my room. The unencumbered view of the Manhattan skyline from my room on the 29th floor was absolutely spectacular. Too often, NYC hotel room windows look directly onto adjacent buildings. \nBoth the hard and soft products here were stellar. \nMy room was pristine, and the decor much nicer than Hampton Inns I recall from from the distant past. I would imagine it is the template for new build Hampton Inns. The bathroom was large enough and featured a tub\/shower combo. While some prefer a shower stall, this gives guests a choice should they wish to soak in a tub after a long day of sightseeing. The room was quiet enough to provide me with a night of uninterrupted sleep. I found the bed to be quite comfortable, but I'm not a particularly fussy sleeper. \nAlthough I was on the 29th floor, the three elevators provided fast and efficient travel to the lobby, even during breakfast hours. I never had to wait longer than two or three minutes. Frankly, that shocked me. Many hotels that are tall with few rooms per floor have problems keeping up with crowds using the elevators simultaneously. Perhaps I was just lucky.\nBreakfast was also a cut above the usual 3 star offerings I've seen in the past. Fresh potatoes instead of the more common cardboard deep fried hash browns was a welcome change. The Sysco System type omelets, bread and pastries looked to be typical, though. There was some fresh fruit, such as apples and oranges. A couple of waffle makers were quite popular with many guests. I had no problem having my choice of seating at 07:45. There were plenty of vacant seats upon my departure at 08:30. Staff were proactively helpful throughout. Given my positive experience, I would have no hesitation returning again.

So when we arrived this time, we were surprised to find that the hotel had been refurbished.  And this change was not for the better.\n\nRooms are significantly smaller.  In fact, the King size rooms are just big enough for one person to walk around the bed.  There are small shelves on each side of the bed,  one shelf below the window, and a few small shelves next to the window.  This means there is very little room for comfort much less luggage.\n\nThe bathroom open area is big enough to turn around in.  \n\nThe breakfast area has been reduced and is no where large enough to accommodate the large crowds coming and going for breakfast and offers very few seating options. The water dispensers were empty all morning.  The juice machine was broken.  The food was cold and flavorless.  \n\nThe new smart elevators are a disaster.  They squeeze hold maybe ten people if there is no luggage and stop at multiple floors even when there isn\u2019t room for another person.\n\nAnd if the changes to the hotel were not bad enough, be prepared for poor staffing and management that is non existent.  We booked 2 rooms.  One was not clean\/ready when we arrived.  We spent some time in the city and returned 4 hours later.  The room was still not ready.

We also were within walking distance from our Broadway show, and dining places (you need a slice of Joe\u2019s). \n\nThe staff was so pleasant and treated us with the utmost respect. There is a convenience store in the lobby which made it so great to just run down for a water or cokes. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. My two favorite things are the free breakfast and the fact that they stored our bags for us after we checked out since we had a late flight.

I can`t remember the names of two smiley ladies in the breakfast bar who provided great hospitality.  If it was not that standard you can`t enjoy a week's holiday.

We checked in online via the App and chose our rooms. Upon arrival we approached the desk where Cesar greeted us. He was very slow and just kept pressing buttons behind the computer and didn't speak. After about 5-10 minutes he requested payment of the first room, which we done. The then advised us both rooms weren't ready despite it being 1.5 hours past checkin. We asked how long rooms would be and he said it may be another 2-3 hours and just leave our bags and come back, he was working until 11pm. No apology, no explanation. Nothing!\n\nHe then tried to take payment for the second room which we paid, to be told it wasn't ready. He didn't offer any apology once again and was extremely slow and distant. \n\nHe managed to find one room which was ready after we explained we had stuff book and had been travelling all day. This took another 5-10 minutes. He then tried to take a third payment. \n\nWe left and headed to the room to drop our stuff off and went back to speak to a manager. As there was a queue the bellman spoke to us who was was very helpful and friendly, he got the managed for us who was helping another customer, so Shane assisted us, found us a room straight away and away we went, we are still unclear what the issue was but Cesar should not be on the front desk with the lack of assistance he provided.\n\nRooms are dated but tidy. We had Room 2405 and 2104 and they done the job. The safety deposit box is huge and this was a great help as we travel with alot of camera equipment it all fitted in with space! \n\nWe went elsewhere for breakfast as the breakfast room was full and we had to eat in the lobby one morning as guests were sat not eating in there, this was regardless whether it was 8am or 10am. We walked past one morning at 630am and it was still busy.\n\nElevators are another issue. There are through for the whole hotel, one wasn't working during our stay, the queues for lifts anytime of day were stupid. It took 25 minutes on a morning to get down to the lobby or back to the room. All guests said the same thing and staff were also getting frustrated at how slow they were.\n\nThe hotel size is not suitable for only 2\/3 lifts and a small breakfast room. \n\nThere is tea\/coffee available in the lobby but this was often empty but again the bellman was filling this on occasions, he deserves a raise as was the only one running around trying to help. \n\nWe asked for late checkout which was given to us and we could stay until 1pm this was helpful as the morning we left t was very wet!\n\nThere are a few friendly staff around the hotel but compared to other Hilton properties this is far worse, we will not be returning to this location.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were looking for a hotel right in the middle of Times Square, close enough to subway and train stations, with complimentary breakfast and coin laundry.   Looking through many options on the web, I've come across Hampton Inn, and I noticed that it not only caters to business travelers, but also to families, and since we were on vacation, we booked there and gave it a try.\n\nOn July 11, and after a 3 hour Amtrak delay from Washington DC to NYC, we rushed into the lobby for check-in.  We were panting, and felt and looked hungry and exhausted, so Lizbeth from front desk promptly and gently gave us our keys to room 1105 while we helped ourselves to a cup of complimentary lemon water, and then we headed to the elevators, expecting them to take forever to go down but they were really fast considering that the building is 30 stories high.\n\nRoom 1105 was located right behind the elevators, however we never felt any bothersome noise; in fact, our room turned out to be next to one of just a few ice machines in the building. Once inside, we blinked at the tiny space in front of us; it was so small! Much to my dismay, I looked at the emergency map on the back of the door and I realized that Lizbeth was kind enough to give one of their more spacious rooms because the rest of them were even smaller so I sighed and just said, \"Ok, this is a pre-war building that was reconditioned into a hotel, so I guess they made the most of it... it is what it is.\"  The room faced the back of other Manhattan buildings, and it consisted of two double beds, a closet, flat-screen TV, a small desk, private bathroom with superb Zero toiletries, drawers, a coffee maker, and an ice bucket with paper cups. There was no fridge so thank God we were next to the ice machine in the hallway.  This said, we had a wonderful sleep even though storing our luggage was a challenge; besides, water pressure and temperature from the bathroom faucet was great. \n\nWe completely agreed on and supported Hilton's policy on not doing housekeeping until after three days; after all, we were given enough toiletries for our entire stay and we're not too messy to begin with; this said, I expected more cleanliness in the bathroom... I had to use tissue paper to remove some mold from the tiles prior to showering; besides, one furniture was \"one-legged\" and they put an empty soap carton underneath, this was tacky on their behalf.  Other than that, the room served its purpose of being a good source for showering and rest.\n\nDon't miss the view from the roof!\n\nBoth times we stayed we took advantage from the coin laundry located beneath the main floor. There's only two washers and two dryers, but nobody seemed to make use of them so I didn't have to wait for someone else in order to do my laundry.  Each load was $3(Welcome to NYC) and I didn't incur in laundry detergent charges since I brought one of my own.  You can either pay with coins or straight from the ShinePay app.\n\nBreakfast was filling and satisfying.  Among the items there were yogurt, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, omelettes, milk, tea, coffee, fruits, cold cereal, assorted bread, breakfast potatoes, sausage, and a waffle maker.  There were always several breakfast attendants available, and they were very helpful and open to any dietary request.\n\nBoth check-outs took place right on front desk; they were uneventful.\n\nOur second time we were given room 2206, right in front of the elevator(something great  in such a tall building).  It had a nice view of 41st and 42nd St, however it was even smaller than the first one, and the closest ice machine was located on the 27th floor; still, beds were a delight and the bathroom was cleaner than the first room we stayed in.\n\nOverall I would stay here again because the entire staff was wonderful and rates were reasonable given the complimentary services and the proximity to transportation hubs and main attractions; this said, the only reason I give it a rating of 4 instead of 5 is because I strongly believe something needs to be done with breakfast space.  One thing is to run out tables on peak hours, and another is for guests to have to wait for the elevators to come down in order to take their breakfast to their rooms because even the additional table on the lobby was busy; this delayed the elevators' waiting time, and turned out to be an ordeal duting our first check-out in which we ended up carrying our luggage 11 stories down using the stairs given that elevators were busier than ever because of people having no other way than to carry their breakfast back to their rooms .  The Hampton Perfect Mix Lobby is quite oversized and on the same floor level as the breakfast room, both right next to the elevators, so why not turning some of that lobby space into an additional breakfast area with a second breakfast station? This way not only would guests enjoy their breakfast without it being a nuisance, but also a second station would end the awkward situation of guests bumping into each other for their servings and\/or waiting a considerable amount of time for the waffle maker to finish.  \n\nBreakfast logistics issues aside, I recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Times Square area is a bit frenetic. Don't pick this area if you want quiet. There are endless fast food and other restaurants, shopping, including a Target. There is also a ton of smoking (including pot), chaos from crowds and cars and general congestion. The hotel is also less than a block from the Port Authority. The primary downside is that rooms have \"complimentary housekeeping on request\" and 24 hours notice must be given if you want your room serviced. I found that annoying, and opted not to bother. But I think the rooms are not kept as clean that way. This is not the fault of the staff, but the cost of leaving it up to the guest. Shampoo and other products are from filled dispensers. There was no refrigerator in the room which was a real negative. Ice is available on specific floors. I also had the the absolute worst view of a brick building. The free breakfast is good (limited fruit but waffles, meats, eggs, breads) and served from 7:00 AM by an enthusiastic and helpful team. Coffee is available 24 hours in the lobby. The room itself was small, with plenty of USB ports but limited space to enjoy a meal if eating in room. The bed was comfortable, if a bit soft. The hotel will arrange a fairly priced car to the airport (cabs are just as expensive). The gentleman who did this for me was excellent. The front desk staff were friendly. Overall, it was an acceptable stay but I would also look at other hotels that offer more amenities and features that I like. I have stayed at many properties in New York and this ranks in the middle in terms of amenities and value.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

I didn\u2019t get everyone\u2019s name, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. \n\nIf you want to stay near Broadway Shows, Times Square, and lots of restaurants - this is a good one. The Nealander Theater is next door (now showing Shucked). Shnipper\u2019s is right down the street (burgers, shakes, salads, fries). Pizza and Red Lobster nearby. You can walk to Carlo\u2019s Bakery, Shake Shake, Smash Burger, and Italian eateries all within a 10 minute walk. We saw 7 Broadway Shows and toured Radio City Music Hall and it never took more than 10-12 minutes to get there. \n\nDefinitely would stay here again!","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very accommodating and was able to get me situated with a room very quickly,\n\nThe room itself was fine. To me the first thing I notice is how clean is the room which this was. The size of the room was adequate for my needs. Possibly for more than two people it might get a little cramped.\n\nElevators might take some time depending on the time of the day but if you have an appointment, theatre and such take a few minutes exy=tra into account.\n\nI was late for breakfast the first day but as an alarm in the hotel went off the morning of my second day I was wide awake to try it on day two. Honestly would have preferred to have stayed in bed as it was a late night prior but a fire alarm has a way of waking you up very fast,\n\nThe line for breakfast was very long as I think a lot of people must have come down the  same time with the alarm.\n\nFirst person I saw in line was Fatima who was very gracious with a good morning. I don't know how this woman does it but I swear she was in three places at once in the restaurant. She is a great person to start your day with. As the breakfast was very busy it was nice to see either a manager or GM helping it. I didn't get her name but the theme of very welcoming people continued with her.\n\nAfter breakfast I had a few hours of work to do so I camped out in my room. All was fine till I was in the middle of conference calls when the loudest of a drill started working I believe in the room on the same wall as mine. This went on for awhile so it was difficult to continue working. As the area in the lobby area was always crowded there really was nowhere quiet to continue working.\n\nThe alarm and the drilling are things that I assume would be one offs it shouldn't affect ones choice at staying at the hotel.\n\nThe pros more then then outweigh the cons.\n\nI am in the city quite a bit and would check out the hotel again if I am traveling solo.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

We choose this hotel for 3 reasons: location, free WIFI, and breakfast. We stayed for two nights and three days. The location was central to all the activities and restaurants we wanted to visit. The noise level surrounding the hotel wasn\u2019t intolerable, given the fact we were so close to Time Square. We would occasionally hear car horns and sirens but not the entire night. The free WIFI was useful, other hotels didn\u2019t offer this basic amenity. For the price of my stay, basic WIFI should be offered to guests free of charge. This is just another example of hotel\u2019s price gauging their guests. Complimentary breakfast helped save us a little money. New York is not cheap, and every little penny adds up.\n\nI want to give a huge shout out to two amazing Hilton employees from the breakfast staff: FATIMA and LLOYD. Both employees had excellent customer service skills. Fatima greeted every single guest when they walked in the room. Lloyd made sure the breakfast station was always clean. Both employees are doing an amazing job and it did not go unrecognized.\n\nUpon arrival, we were informed that housekeeping will not be servicing our room due to the length of our stay. If we needed anything, we had to call the front desk and ask. They did not make the beds, replenish new towels, or empty the trash. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LACK OF HOUSEKEEPING SERVICE PROVIDED TO US. I\u2019m sure their excuse is that it\u2019s eco-friendlier. The reality is the hotel industry is getting cheaper with basic room amenities. On the second night, I contacted the front desk to ask for clean towels and to empty the trash. I waited for 10 minutes and then called the front desk for a second time. Someone from housekeeping finally arrived after I called the second time.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The positives being the very friendly professional staff who were very welcoming, informative and helpful. Reception staff, housekeeping, breakfast and porters all went above and beyond.

The negatives being a little disappointed with the breakfast which is served on paper plates with single use plastic utensils giving an impression of a cheap offering and with little variety over our 7 visits. I can't fault the staff who sometimes struggled with the number of guests but some mornings it was a bun fight to find a table. This would be an excellent hotel but the morning breakfast needs a rethink. We visited New York expecting it to be busy, noisy, crowded and chaotic and it lived up to expectations. We perhaps were unprepared for the grim, dirt, drugs and the unfortunate homelessness evident on the streets around Times Square which we can't be blame on the hotel but the city authority. We felt safe in the hotel and its location close to some major tourist's sights and with easy access to the subway with plenty of restaurants and theatres nearby was an excellent choice for a first-time visitor However should we return to NY we would probably stay in a different area away from the mayhem of Times Square.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

A completely unstable wifi what it is simply unacceptable when you travel for work, I lost a couple of virtual meetings. Even worse, when I called the service at 9.30 pm the staff said there was no support and that I had to call directly the external technical service. Obviusly I refused.

Yes, I konow that there are other hotels that don\u00b4t even serve breakfast. In my case it was included in the price. I have been in some humble hostels of the Camino de Santiago where breakfasts are far better and you pay 30$ for the night and food. \nAwful eggs, bread, limited choice of everything, almost no fruit but some dead oranges...cardboard plates and plastic cutlery\u00a1\u00a1 in 2022 such an expensive hotels uses plastic knives and forks. Unsustainable, unacepptable in terms of quality of service.\nThere is no place to meet, just few seats in the lobby. Elevators are collapsed in the morning.\nThe shower was not going well, little water.\nThe reception service was less than average and unhelpful when there is a complaint.

First of all, you\u2019ll be greeted by every staff member throughout your trip. When we arrived our room wasn\u2019t ready, but our bags were safely stored until it was time to check-in and the front desk agents were giving us tips on what to do and where to eat (hint: Carnegie Pizza is a few doors down and one of the best spots in the city). \n\nWhat a luxury to have three elevators in a NYC hotel! We never had to wait more than few minutes, even during the busiest times. Hint: if you do feel you\u2019re riding too long, sometimes go down to go up or go up to go down.\n\nI found our room to be nicely sized for three of us in the middle of the city, and we were even able to request a refrigerator and have it fit comfortably in our room. It\u2019s $20 for the stay which isn\u2019t bad at all. There was an ice bucket and safe inside the room as well.\n\nCOVID protocols are still in place in terms of housekeeping not servicing daily, but you can request it and if you need anything the front desk is more than happy to assist, from fresh towels to toilet paper.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk breakfast. Signature Hampton breakfast with just enough tweaks each day to make it feel new. But here is where the staff really excels. You\u2019re greeted upon entry. You\u2019re told what all your options are. They\u2019ll assist you with any questions or requests and in fact noticed I was struggling with the waffle batter and told me they\u2019d be back to refill it before I could even ask. While it can get super busy, we scored a table each day as the team is quickly wiping them down and helping move it along. This crew made my morning every day!\n\nFinally, if the great hospitality and amenities don\u2019t help make the decision for you, let the location. It\u2019s in a safe location a block away from Times Square\u2026 so you get all of the convenience with none of the noise (especially on higher floors). Plenty of food, shopping, shows and the Subway only steps away. Security was too notch as after a certain time you need your room key to get in and you always need your room key to use the elevator.\n\nAlso, it is walking distance to the bus station (across the street) and the train station (eight blocks). If you want to catch rideshare,  they never had trouble finding the hotel front entrance for pick up or drop off. The team will also help coordinate transportation if you need it.\n\nFrom this hotel we were easily able to do: a Yankees game, a Mets game, The Empire State Building, Times Square, Statue of Liberty, 9\/11 Memorial and One World Observatory to name a few. It is easily able to be your home base for all things NYC. I\u2019ll absolutely stay here on my next trip to NYC. Thanks for a great stay!","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I cannot even do the underground in london- maybe next time!\nThe room we had was large with 2 double beds , TV, fridge, safe,  iron and board and a hairdryer. \nNot great amount of storage for 3 people but we made it work.\nCoffee maker with tea and coffee bags.\nWater and maps on arrival is a nice touch.\nThe room was Spotlessly clean, due to the pandemic the room service cleaning is on request, which was no problem for us. The staff replenished towels or toiletries as you needed them and emptied trash if left outside room.\nThr bathroom was spotless and I personally would have preferred a full size tub after a long day but The shower was hot and free toiletries if forget.\nOur room was on the 25th floor and we had great skyline views and could see the EDGE and the top of the empire state. \nThe windows kept out the noise of the City.\nThe staff at reception were amazing , they all went above and beyond to help with advice or questions. Eddie and Joseph in the concierge service can book tickets and arrange a car service to the airport, taking all the stress from the holiday.\nJust call reception from the room if you need anything like towels and they areive so promptly. Camille is so friendly and helpful on the end of the phone to help.\nThe hotel was always being cleaned and I felt confident all the areas were cleaned.\nCoffee and tea in the lobby from around 5.30am a lovely touch after a long day out.\nThere is seating in the foyer area to rest or eat and a gym on the ground floor.There is also an observation deck on the 32nd floor which is a nice photo spot- don't try to go up during breakfast or you will have to wait forever for the lifts.  I felt very safe as the lifts and front doors you need a key card to access so I appreciated that safety aspect in an unknown CITY.\n\nThe little irritating points were to do with  breakfast. The breakfast room is very small and often having to wait for a table, not helped when we were there by large groups of youngsters not looking where they were going or occupied tables even when finished eating and  looking at their phones and the chaperones of the groups did not seem attentive or remind them of manners. When the large groups had left -  breakfast was busy but not bad. The staff again were amazing so friendly and helpful, they have to go bags if you sooner have breakfast in the room etc. Breakfast was waffles, bread and cake, cereals fruit and 3 hot choices each day with juices and hot beverages,  good way to start a busy day.\nIt was not the hotels fault but maybe the large parties could have an allocated seating time to make it more pleasant for the other guests. \nWiFi on the high floors is patchy but not a major issue for us.\n\nFrom the hotel we walked everywhere we wanted to visit which includes; rockafella centre and shopping on 5th avenue, central park, the edge at Hudson yards, the high line, the circle island ferry round manhatten, the library, St Patrick's cathedral, Bryant Park, MOMA,  took in a show on Broadway and of course times square!\n\nWe had a great week and the staff are superb here and we would return here on our next visit to NYC.  \n","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

So I was so glad to discover Hampton Inn was GREAT!\n\nLOCATION: 2 blocks off Times Square\/ Theater District. Was afraid it\u2019d be loud, but it wasn\u2019t at all. Times Sq is kind of a tourist circus w electronic billboards & such. But the hotel feels nicely removed from it, and very safe. We walked to Central Park & MOMA- around 2-3 miles round trip. \n\nROOMS: If you book thru Hilton, they\u2019ll let you pick your room on their app. Nice touch. We chose the 22nd floor (of ~30) for the view. The room wasn\u2019t big (it\u2019s NY\u2026), but it was clean, airy & decorated in a modern aesthetic. Had a hair dryer, safe, mini fridge, lots of USB outlets & clean bathroom. \n\nBREAKFAST: Great for families. A full hot buffet\u2014 cereal, toast, sausages, eggs, waffle maker, juices, oatmeal, etc\u2014not just a continental breakfast. Hot food changes daily. Not gourmet, but c\u2019mon\u2026it\u2019s great for free. Served until 10am. \n\nPEOPLE: Everyone at the hotel was sooo nice. Esp. the folks in the breakfast area. They went out of their way to be helpful & their friendliness surprised me. :) Good job hiring, Hilton!\n\nPARKING: None at the hotel. Nearby garage prices vary considerably, so I recommend using SpotHero or a similar app. The cheapest we saw was $50\/day and only 2 blocks away. (No in\/out privileges)\n\nPRO TIPS: \n- Download the Hilton app. You\u2019ll be able to unlock the lobby door, elevator, and your room with the Bluetooth digital key on your phone\n- Fill up your water canteens at the breakfast buffet\n- The elevators are super busy btwn 9-10am. You might have to let a few pass because they\u2019re too full. Plan accordingly. \n- Carnegie Pizza is on the block & open late. Yummm Ask them to warm the slice for you.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There is a Target around the corner for your needs. \n\nI do not like to stay so close to Times Square if I don't need to be close. It may be fun for a day or two,  but the noise, grime and smelling marijuana everywhere gets old. I am for the legalization of marijuana nation wide. However, I don't enjoy smelling it and walking through smoke everywhere and Times Square area is full of people smoking on the streets, with mobile weed trucks everywhere. If you plan to walk to Broadway shows this location is great. It's also close to Bryant Park and the lovely main NYC Public library (I recommend taking a tour here.) When we had late night hunger - we had great service from the small walk-in pizza spots. Also had a wonderful lunch and takeout from Tony's de Napoli. \n\nThe hotel Bellman Joseph is wonderful. First Class. He helped my party get an SUV to the airport that was very comfortable when our Lyft driver did not show because he was at the wrong address. The car Joseph arranged for actually cost a little less than our Lyft from the airport to hotel and I was immediately at ease. Joseph is the epitome of professionalism, giving us updates as we waited and offering water bottles for the ride. If you need help - find Joseph and tip him well. \n\nThe hotel front desk staff are very professional - especially Fernando. The first room we were given 605 had us worried. It looked like it had not been cleaned very well, curtains hanging off the hooks, bathroom dirty, surfaces not wiped etc. We went back downstairs to desk and asked for a different room. Fernando got us room 506 and he went up with us to ensure it worked for us. I don't know if a hotel staff member has ever given me that level of consideration. He is first class. The difference upon opening the door was striking. This room was clean. I can recommend room 506 - the only downside is the door opens right up to the elevator doors. We did not hear much elevator traffic from inside of our room but it can be a little awkward to get into when others are waiting for elevator. The nice thing is if the elevators are busy - you have a quick walk up or down the stairs for floor 5.\n\nThe rooms do not have housekeeping unless you ask for it. I don't mind this as we don't need to change linens here anymore than we do at home, and we reuse our towels. However, we were there for 10 nights, and I do think around night 6-7 there should be an automatic cleaning that I don't have to ask for. I wash my sheets and clean my home weekly and considering a hotel room is your place to live, sleep and eat - it needs at least a vacuum. I could have asked for housekeeping, but it required a 24 hour notice - and I would simply forget. In the interest of security too, it seems staff from housekeeping should attend to rooms after a set amount of days. That and garbage fills up so fast, that if you want me to empty my own garbage, please leave some liner bags in the bottom. I don't like calling for garbage bags every other day. \n\nAnytime we called for fresh towels, they came up pretty quickly. I am allergic to feather pillows, and when I let them know they quickly gave me different pillows. The front desk is attentive. I didn't eat at the breakfast, but one person in my party did and said it was adequate and staff friendly. The biggest thing I missed here - having a small fridge. The ice machines were empty at times. \n\nThe staff here works hard to make sure your stay is good. Their job cannot always be easy.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Although, I've been to NY many times this was my wife's and kids first time. What a hotel to stay in, from the moment we checked in with Jenny and Fernando, who were very nice, outgoing, polite, professional and funny, to Eddie the Bellman who brought up our bags. Eddie made my kids feel welcome by letting them pick their own toys from the \"Treasure Chest\" behind the counter.  I knew we picked the right hotel. Besides being within walking distance to Times Square and the Empire State Building, it was the ideal location for all that NYC has to offer. There are a ton of eating options from your mundane Corporate restaurants like Red Lobster and Applebees to your NYC only Carnegie Pizza and Le Pecora Italian Restaurant across from Bryant Park.  The rooms were nice and neat, we did have a slight issue but Fernando and the maintenance guy fixed it ASAP.  The breakfast area was awesome, so much food and variety for anybody's taste. They had make it yourself fresh waffles, to toast, bagels, muffins, yogurt to fresh made eggs, potatoes, and sausages. You really had plenty to choose from. Fatima, Zakiyah, Ray and Jorge were unbelievable. Fatima especially went out of her way to make sure you felt welcome, which we all did. Great staff all around. The only thing is that the rooms are small, so 3 big adults is the max for your comfort, but that's with all the hotels in NYC. They are small and only offer double beds and not queen size bids, because the queen size beds won't fit. We had 2 small kids under 6 and 2 adults so it was perfect.  If we ever want to stay in the theatre district again, we will definitely choose this location for sure for it's location and such friendly staff.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

That\u2019s ok, however it lead to towels and garbage in the room piling up. No fridge in the room. Not a big deal but it would be helpful for drinks and food since there is no room service.  We stayed on an upper level room with a city view. There are only 3 elevators, small in size, and no matter if you\u2019re going up or down, they constantly end up stopping at mult floors. I\u2019d suggest staying in a lower level room\u2026 floors 2-5\u2026 and utilizing the stairs if you can. Two pizza places close by\u2026 Carnage and Joes\u2026 both were great!

Whilst the hotel has no frills, it is simple, friendly and a great location! We had to get over the weed selling, weed vans (legalised in NYC) and general feeling of slight unease on the first night whilst walking in Times Square, but we soon realised it was in the whole city and not just Times Square. The hotel served a basic breakfast but this was a huge help as food is very expensive and with a teenage boy, was a great help! I would\u2019ve like to see fruit, they had apples and oranges, but maybe fruit to go with pancakes and waffles. It\u2019s a busy hotel so you have get amongst the crowds in the morning which didn\u2019t bother us at all. The staff at breakfast were amazingly helpful and friendly! As were the bell boys, arranged a taxi to take us to the airport and stored our bags with no trouble for our 11pm flight. My only gripe was the room noise, which I think was just bad luck with where our room was.  We didn\u2019t have a great view, fine, but we had a big air condition unit outside our room which was very noisy, we asked to switch rooms but they were too full, we then got used to the noise or too tired to care. There was also loud music and talking out on the street the first few nights, which again you can do nothing about. So to round up, a very pleasant stay, location spot on and we had a brilliant time !!","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It would stop on nearly every floor and regularly be full. On our check out morning we timed it and the lift took 22 minutes to take us downstairs. Walking down 28 flights of stairs, with 2 kids and luggage wasn't an option. Our room was tiny, guess that's standard for the city but 4 of us in a room smaller than my bedroom was a bit much. Our bath plug was broken, the panel on our air con unit was hanging off and the walls in bathroom were full of dust and hair! I immediately complained and after speaking to a manager was told it would be sorted or we could move rooms. Moving rooms wasn't an option on our first night as the hotel was full. As promised repairs were made to room and we were given a nice gesture from management too. However for over $500 a night I would've expected way more.

We\u2019d stay here again, despite starting and ending on bad notes. Was notified by the Hilton app that our room was ready before we arrived at 10 AM. Checkin is 3 pm so we didn\u2019t expect to check in as early as 10 am, but the \u201cready\u201d notification got our hopes up that we would have a place to crash after a 6 am flight. Joseph the bellman was helpful storing our luggage and we left for lunch with the understanding our room would be available shortly after others checked out at 11 am. After lunch we ended up sitting around the lobby until 2 pm, when our room was finally available. Again, I know early check in isn\u2019t guaranteed, but I just wish they wouldn\u2019t have given multiple signals that the room would be ready early  so we would have stayed out exploring the city. Last time in NYC we stayed at the Hampton Times Square South, a much less desirable location, and found ourselves walking by this Hampton over and over, prompting me to start saying \u201cnext time we\u2019re staying there\u201d. And so we did. The location is fantastic, especially if you\u2019re using the subway to get around the city. $33 for unlimited rides for 7-days is a steal and a major subway station is literally across the street from this hotel, with connections to virtually any subway train in the city. There is no better location if you\u2019re using the subway. Breakfast was very busy, food just ok, but the breakfast staff was incredible, very upbeat and helpful. Carnegie pizza next door has some of the best pizza in town. It\u2019s sad that pot is being openly sold and smoked all over, unfortunately also in the hotel on our floor. Wi-Fi was ok when you finally could connect, but we had to renew our connection EVERY TIME WE USED IT, not once a day which is more typical (something is obviously wrong). Finally, the most frustrating experience of all \u2014 all week I heard the bellmen arranging car service to LaGuardia for a flat $65, \u201cincluding taxes and tolls\u201d. This price wasn\u2019t out of line with Uber and Lyft surge pricing when we were leaving so we used the car service. The driver took us on an around the world route WHICH AVOIDED TOLLS, but took an hour to get to LGA. I was furious and asked why he was taking the long way (\u201care you in a hurry?\u201d  \u2014 too late to ask this after we were stuck in traffic on the long route). I asked if he took that route to avoid tolls \u2014 no comment.

Good proximity to Broadway shows, food, shopping and the subway. Hotel entrance is on a quieter street a few steps away from the action. Rooms are fairly tight in space but probably on par with most hotels in the area in this price point. Rooms were clean, simple and we had all we needed for our stay. Housekeeping was available upon request and they were prompt and friendly in delivering extra towels, blankets and toiletries. We did not request room cleaning--  with adjoining rooms and 3 teens we just managed our own space. Check-in was easy and since we arrived early, the hotel was able to securely store our bags while we explored the area. Breakfast was provided and there were ample tasty choices. While a bit crowded at breakfast, there was plenty of food and it was well staffed. From the front desk, to the people staffing breakfast, to the housekeepers, all staff during our stay were friendly and helpful throughout the hotel.\n\nA special thank you to Joseph who helped us secure a car to the airport for our family of 5. It was less expensive than 2 Ubers, which we would have needed. The morning of our departure there was a half marathon causing the street in front of the hotel to be closed to cars. He was in frequent communication with the transportation company and even walked us to the street corner to help us locate our ride. Joseph went above and beyond. I would stay here again and recommend this place for families, especially if you want to be near the action but have a quieter exit onto the streets of NY.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We checked in to he told that we needed to leave a deposit of $50 per night per room, for us a total of $250 in advance, refundable when we check out! We didn\u2019t want to use our spending money for this as what was the point of having this back on the day you leave! Fortunately 1 of us had a credit card and 1 of us had a debit card otherwise we would have been stuffed! Be warned as we were not told this prior to coming!\n\nI had also emailed the hotel in advance to tell them that 3 of our ladies were celebrating birthdays and could we possibly have some great views. Firstly they wanted to put us on separate floors, we asked them if we could be on same floor, on the 3rd floor with the mist grottiest and depressing view out of our window. This is a hotel with 31 floors and this was the best they could give us!\nBe warned as well, as we were not, that when you using the lift you have to scan your door key first before you press what floor you want otherwise you just go up and down! \n\nThe room is clean, but very small and pokey, it has tv, tea facilities which we haven\u2019t tried yet. Also a hairdryer and A few toiletries. There are no housekeeping facilities but you can ask at reception for clean towels etc, although I haven\u2019t tried this.\n\nBreakfast is served between 7-10 but again haven\u2019t tried this.\n\nJust so disappointed with view and the large amount of money we have had to leave as a deposit!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I made the mistake of asking for a high floor, thinking I would get a better view.  The elevators in this building are not designed for the number of guests.  It would sometimes take 10 minutes just to get to the lobby or back to my room.  Everyone complained about how hard it was to get on an elevator.  And when you did, it would stop at every floor but there was never room for others to get on.  I would never stay here again just because of the elevators.  They could fix this by designating certain elevators for certain floors.

We arrived at the hotel around 18:00 and went inside where we were greeted by a lady on reception. She kind of just looked at us and assumed we knew what she needed off us. She eventually explained what she needed to see etc and we were given a room on the 23rd floor.\n\n We noticed as soon as we got in the lift that it stunk of pot. We got out of the lift and went to our room which wasn\u2019t clean and also stunk of pot like someone had just vacated. The bed had hairs on it and there was white stuff all over the floor. We went down to reception and spoke with a gentleman on reception and he showed us two room and gave us the choice, we just took the first room as it was suitable and adequately cleaned. Due to covid the hotel aren\u2019t servicing the rooms during your stay unless you go and ask at reception which was fine for us. If you need additional toilet paper or fresh towels you just ask at reception. Personally we prefer this. \n\nBreakfast wasn\u2019t the best and we didn\u2019t go down many mornings for it but the staff greeted you every time with a smile and would explain what was on offer etc. most days we just grabbed a slice of pizza on our way out a few doors down. \n\nThe hotel is in close proximity to the subway and also walking distance to a lot of things. We spent three evenings at the theatre (about a 15minute walk) watching the Book of Mormon (try to go see it when Stephen Ashfield is performing) and one watching Harry Potter and the cursed child (I wouldn\u2019t recommend Harry Potter, it\u2019s mind numbing, the story is horrendous and the acting wasn\u2019t the best). We took the subway to the 911 memorial\/museum. On a Monday you can get free admission from 3pm if you book tickets online. We found that 2 hours wasn\u2019t enough time to get around and see everything in the museum.\n\nThe hotel is quite quiet but we did find that even on the non smoking floors people were smoking pot which is unpleasant. Times Square also stinks of pot and obviously the legalisation of it hasn\u2019t helped along with people constantly pestering you to buy edibles as you walk and if it\u2019s not edibles it\u2019s CDs\u2026 If you don\u2019t wish to purchase the CD or shake hands with the seller due to Covid you\u2019re racist\u2026 I saw many people who would say no to the CD but then would be called racist and quickly change and buy the CD. I don\u2019t have a means to play a CD in 2022 so if they really wanted their music to be heard a link to a streaming service that can be shared would be more beneficial. \n\nHaving stayed in New York previous we probably wouldn\u2019t stay in Times Square again as we just found it extremely unpleasant this time. We had previously stayed at the Wellington hotel but we decided on the Hampton due to the central location the fact that breakfast was included and because they had no resort tax. We had a bumpyish start at the hotel, it was sorted quickly and didn\u2019t have any issues afterwards but we just don\u2019t like the location for walking around in the evening it\u2019s unpleasant. Also you have to use your key card to access the hotel in the evening which is something we\u2019ve never experienced before.\n\nWe also did late checkout as our flight was late evening and this was extremely reasonable in price and easy to arrange at reception.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hotel people told me US$90 from hotel to Newark airport with tax included, cash or credit card. As Uber was US$89, I decided to get the hotel one. At the time to pay the driver was charging me US$95. When I told him it was US$ 90 with credit card, he tried to charged me US$ 99 because of the \"taxes\". I paid US$ 90 cash !!!!","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hotel was very clean as was the rooms. Free internet worked fine. There aren't any vending machines but there is a little pantry in the lobby that you can grab things and charge to your room. There aren't many rooms on each floor so its fairly quiet inside (though you still hear the noises on the road). Rooms are a bit small, but probably normal for Manhattan. The bed wasn't the most comfortable and there wasn't much shower pressure. The biggest annoyance is you have to ask at the front desk every single day for housekeeping and several times they didn't even do it. They also often didn't answer the phone (probably short staffed). Also for a building this tall, they only have 3 elevators, and when we were there it appeared the third elevator was broken. This resulted in long waits and crowded elevators. The breakfast was OK but there wasn't any variety day-to-day other than changing between sausage and bacon. No fault of the hotel, but this area of town now seems to have a lot of homeless, drug users, and mentally ill people walking around, all the way from here to Times Square and Broadway.

Central to all great sites and what you would expect from a Hilton Hampton which I always like (clean rooms, easy snack access etc.). But the reason I am taking the time to leave a longer than normal review is to let everyone know that Joseph is the BEST bellman in the USA. We hit some hiccups on our way out of the hotel with timing and some family issues, had to store bags, switch bags, add things to stored bags, try to leave and then not leave due to car issues. Finally got the car out of the garage and called my wife while sitting in NYC traffic to have the bags taken out to get us on our way quickly as we had a family emergency. At first she was told by someone else that she needed the tickets (which I totally respect and understand) but I said put Joseph on the line he knew right away who I was and started to get everything ready and verified who he was speaking with on the fly over the phone and greeted me when I pulled up with bags in hand ready to load. All in all, I probably single-handedly gave him 10 requests that late afternoon, which is way over the helpful limit and into superman territory. He handled every request as though it was the first, super good natured great smile even though we saw he was very busy with so many requests from many others as it got busy on a Friday afternoon. Whoever manages this property should consider bringing him onto the management team. Anything he manages will turn to gold. I guarantee it, his character and customer focus will help you build your clientele and make the hotel successful. Right as we were finally about to get out of his hair and drive off, I needed to take a quick trip to the men's room as nature called. He let me keep the car running, personally unlocked the door to the closest hall and showed me to the RR, and when I came out he handed two waters to me for myself and my wife and told us to have a safe trip. Thank you Joseph! You made the trip end on a great note for us. If I was a rich man with a business, you would be a senior partner by now.

Good proximity to times square, but the entrance is on a side street that gets a little weird at night, again that's not the hotels fault.

She always made sure there was food while you were inlanders one getting it or updating when it was coming.\n\nCons: I guess it is expected ted if you are neat Times Square there are lots of homeless around the hotel, the strong smell of marijuana outside of the hotel and especially in Times Square pp trying to sell you the marijauna constantly. The elevator can be very slow even with 3 of them as there are so many guest. They don't clean your room or give you towels unless you ask for it however when you do they revery efficient and timely.

Run Down, Terrible Service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-08-09","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"We traveled to NYC four years ago and stayed at Hampton Inn Manhattan\/Times Square Central. We prefer to use Hilton as we use it for work and vacation. We had a wonderful stay four years ago. The rooms were clean, the from desk staff lovely and helpful and the hotel exceeded our expectations so much so that we decided to stay here again for our return trip last week. My guess is there has been a change in management because our stay was awful. I will not return. I doubt I will ever hear from a manager and so I will be writing and calling corporate. Here is a breakdown for anyone considering staying at this location:\n\n1) We reserved this location in advance on our Hilton app and noted that we needed joining rooms because we were traveling with kids\n\n2) I called the hotel location (not the 800 Hilton number, the ACTUAL hotel to confirm in advance that we would have joining rooms where our kids could walk back and forth (not rooms next door to each other  - JOINING ROOMS - and was told yes).\n\n3) When we arrived, we were told our rooms were joining. No problem\n\n4) We get to our rooms, THEY ARE NOT JOINING!\n\n5) Go downstairs to be BELITTLED by a staff member to be told that I could not have possibly called the hotel in advance to inquire about joining rooms because 95% of people call the central reservations line and do not know to call the actual hotel. I said to him that I fell in the 5% and did not appreciate his condescending tone and to also explain to me the staff member who checked me in assuring me we had joining rooms AS WELL AS THE NOTATION IN OUR RESERVATION THAT WE NEEDED JOINING ROOMS. He told me to wait for a manager at 3 pm arriving WHO NEVER CAME OUT TO SPEAK TO ME. He then also said that only King rooms could join. Why did no one tell me this? So we had minor kids in a room by themselves in NYC. \n\n6) There were no coffee cups in our room. I requested them. Never arrived.\n\n7) I needed to use the business center. I could not because there was a homeless person using it for TWO DAYS!\n\n8) I needed to buy water bottles from the snack area at the hotel, they were sold out.\n\n9) We requested room service because our baby threw up on the sheets. Room service NEVER came and I had to sleep on sheets with VOMIT on them. \n\n10) I called down to the front desk three different times. No one ever answered.\n\n11) If you need help from the front desk, good luck, the line is always to the front door. Regardless, it doesnt matter, they dont do what they say they will do anyway.\n\n12) If you need a manager, HA! They wont ever come out to talk to you. \n\nAnd, I dont expect a manager to ever follow up with me on this thread either so I will call a friend I know at corporate and deal with things that way.\n\nBottom line...dont sell rooms you cant staff properly. RIDICULOUS. I am still grossed out and unbelievably frustrated that we paid what we paid to stay on a Hilton\/Hampton property to be treated so poorly. I have never complained ever to a Hampton or Hilton before. But this hotel is in over their heads with management with their heads in the sand. Unbelievable.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff was very warm and friendly except one character on front desk (7\/8\/21 around 10:30am) who was rather unfriendly in attitude and adamantly refused to give me drinking water (after checking my room number, name etc) making the excuse that management has decided to give water only to the new check ins\".

The breakfast was boring all they had was bagels, bread, boiled eggs, juices, coffee and yogurt with brown paper bags to take breakfast with you, I didn't take any and just went to a nearby diner with actual breakfast in it. When I thought the breakfast was to go I thought they would at least have little bowl containers with scrambled eggs, sausages or bacon and some toast but nope it's just a weak continental breakfast because of Covid. The location was great and the subway was closeby. I would have given it 5 circles but my room did not look like a city view room and the breakfast was weak. Would definitely stay here again because of the location but that's about it.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

On the 1 line is also canal street area, the 9\/11 memorial and upper west side - all very interesting to visit. \nThe hotel is also right by Times Square of course for a vast variety of restaurants and fun places like Carlos bakery, Ellen\u2019s diner, juniors and Disney store.

There\u2019s cereals and fruit salad, bagels and smoothies and juice along with toaster, plus the very popular waffle iron. \nThe room was quite small to be honest but would stay there again.\nThe hotel was quite quiet and the lifts quick and reliable.

We were given a room on the 26th floor (think the hotel has 30\/31 floors) room big enough, big comfy bed, the view was ok, could see Empire state building from the room (south side), very clean hotel and really friendly staff. \n\nOnly downsides were breakfast, it could get really busy. Plenty of options to choose from but you need to get down before 7 am \/ 7.30 am to enjoy as it gets way to busy after 8 am\/8.30 am and you'd be lucky to find a table. There was often nowhere to sit and people would overspill to the lobby, the other thing that spoilt it a little was that plastic cutlery, paper plates and cups were supplied.....I think the hotel is better than this. \n\nThe second downside was in our room - the toilet door (not sure if this was just our room though as we were based by the fire exit and it could have been to save space), it was a sliding door and didn't offer much privacy as there was a gap of about an inch around the door. No one mentioned where to find ice (which can be found on the 11th floor). This would have been useful information during check-in or when purchasing drinks from the lobby shop (which is only small but good enough). Deposit of a $100 was requested but there are no resort fees. Free wifi which is always great. Hairdryer supplied which was excellent for a hotel one, there's no need to bring your own. Neutrogena products supplied daily i.e. shampoo\/conditioner\/soap etc. Room cleaned daily. Free cakes\/cookies, tea\/coffee and water at the reception area. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn. Concierge service downstairs who can help with subway links if needed or reservations, theatre tickets etc. Hotel location is excellent. Times Square subway is at the end of the street and Times Square is only a block away which is about 3 min walk. Would definitely stay again.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

They have an observation deck on the roof which offers great views of the city, and it\u2019s in a great location, close enough to walk to the tourist locations and shopping.  Free WiFi was included with our room.  You also get a complimentary breakfast everyday.  The breakfast is a very good value, with either scrambled eggs or omelettes, sausage or bacon as hot food, plus make your own waffles.  Also oatmeal and cereal, smoothies, juice, fruit, toast.  The coffee is also quite good.  I am going to nitpick and say that breakfast is REALLY crowded, and sometimes a wait for a table, plus it\u2019s all paper plates, cups, plastic cutlery, so I\u2019m really hoping the hotel is actively recycling this because the bins were full each and every day.  Also every day they have a coffee bar in the lobby which you can help yourself to.  \nMy only other complaint is the elevators, which were incredibly busy, always full, and we ended up taking the stairs quite regularly, which is fine on the 6th floor but I\u2019m certain someone on the 31rst floor might disagree.

The beds are doubles (rather than king) pushed to the side so access to both beds is through a narrow channel (the width of the bedside cabinet) between the two beds.  We found this to be very close for 3 adults (although we are all family!) and it did impair our stay at this hotel.  I asked if we could move but was told all rooms are the same sleeping area size (some entrance halls a little larger when placed next to a lift).  Anyway, just so you are aware if you are regular sized adults, it's tight for sharing!!!  We booked a Hampton as the breakfast is included - and it was breakfast and the breakfast service that we all enjoyed!  Geraldine, the Irish breakfast manager, was amazing.  And as much as she ran a tight ship in the restaurant (ie all foods were available, plentiful and the serving areas and tables were very clean and swiftly cleared), her natural warmth and enthusiasm for New York really helped us get the most from our stay.  We so enjoyed meeting her - and found her to be the friendliest and most helpful person in the whole of New York City - she is an absolute asset to this hotel.

You can walk into the Square any time day or night and it's active (there's a Walgreens a block away that never closes). The hotel isn't cheap, but given the location it's a great value.\n\nOthers have complained about the elevators. This could be a concern: There are only three elevators serving 30+ floors. But the elevators are VERY fast, and we never found ourselves waiting for more than a few minutes.\n\nBreakfast is adequate---not Club Med, but everyone can find something.

We had a great experience. Having stayed at another hotel in June, we were expecting a small room. The room was not much different from a typical Hampton Inn anywhere, We were on the 10th floor directly beside an elevator and pleasantly surprised at how quiet our room was. The location is perfect. We went everywhere from The MET to The statue of Liberty. Easy walking distance to Broadway shows, restaurants and subway. The breakfast was exactly what you find at other Hamptons:  waffles, a few hot breakfast items, fruit and cereal. I was very impressed with the breakfast staff, particularly Benson and David. They greeted us with a smile each morning and hustled to make sure everything was replenished. The only disappointments we had were that a refrigerator is not standard (seems to be a NYC thing) and that the comforters slid off the beds easily during the night. Small things. We would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":8035866,"title":"Great location\/Complimentary Food and Drink","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-12-31","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"You can't beat this location for the typical tourist activities.  Right across from the subway and so many places within walking distance.  Walked to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th Ave, Bryant Park, Central Park, Macy's, and so many restaurants.  \n\nRoom Location - Since I was bringing my family of 4 there for 5 day over Christmas, I did a lot of research on room location.  I had called and asked several questions as well.  So I was ready to pick my room the day before through online checkin.  I picked a room and called to make sure it met my needs.  After being told by 2 different workers that the layout of the \"03\" rooms is the best I felt great about my choice.  I got a confirmation that we were checked in to this room.  However, when we physically arrived, they had us in a different room.  When I questioned the lady, she made up a lie and said that since we requested a refrigerator, we can't have that room because a refrigerator cannot go in that room.  This seemed crazy since the lady that helped me pick that room said that it would be great for a refrigerator.  After pressing this a bit she got a manager and he said that the person never checked out of that room, so we couldn't have it.  Strange since it usually only lets you do online checkin after there person had checked out.  I assume they just gave it to someone else and were making up excuses.  This started our stay off on a bad note.\nWe ended up in 2212 (which of course they assured was a superb room.  It was facing 41st street, which is not what I wanted for street noise.  The good news is that the street noise was not as bad as I expected.  We are night-owls so the noise seemed to calm down when we were asleep.  You could hear things, but we ran the fan on constant and used a white noise machine.  \n\nElevators - As noted on many reviews, you can wait 10-15 minutes at times.  I would say either stay super low so you can use stairs, or super high.  For getting a down elevator, the elevator always goes to the highest floor first and then stops at every floor requested on the way down.  So the poor folks on floors lower than 20 got passed up all of the time because the elevator was always full.  I felt really bad for those with full luggage carts who could not take the stairs.  We only had issues a few times since we were usually leaving the building after busy checkout time.  \n\nBreakfast - As noted on many reviews it is a zoo.  It is a great perk that they offer this, but you need to have an incredible amount of patience to get your food.  People are going in all directions and cut in front of you and bump you.  The should re-design this room to have one long buffet bar going down he middle with access from both sides.  The pinch points in the corners is awful.  The last few days I just grabbed a \"To-Go\" bag and ate in my room.  These bags are a great perk as well (small water bottle, apple, Nutri-grain bar, muffin).  The staff that works this are great though.  Always there to help.  They will get you a banana if you ask for one!\n\nLobby - Busiest lobby I have ever seen.  It is small and so many people getting the free water\/tea\/coffee and waiting for rides or to check in.\n\nFront Desk - As mentioned above, we did not have a good checkin experience.  Also, they assured us at check in that the refrigerator we requested for medical reasons was already in the room.  It was not and never came.  We had to call concierge to get it delivered.  A few other times during our stay we asked the front desk for extra towels.  They never came either, so we had to call concierge.  \n\nActivities Planner\/Helper - They have someone to answer questions and help with planning for a part of the day.  They were very helpful!  A nice perk!\n\nRooms - Very clean and look to be recently updated.  They are NYC small, but clean is so important and I have no complaints with that.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The front desk stored our bags until our room was ready and then stored them after we checked out (they gave us late checkout, too, so ask if you need it) until our shuttle arrived to go to the airport.  The free breakfast was very popular and I have included photos of when it was busy and when I caught it during a lull on Thursday after many people had left for the parade (Served from 6:00 to 10:00 a..m.).  I generally do not sleep well on my first night in a hotel but the bed was very comfortable and I got a great night's sleep both nights.  Many hotels have pillows that are too thick but the Hampton Inn had 4 pillows on our bed - two were thicker than I prefer but the other two were just right!  Kudos to them for providing two different sizes instead of taking the easy way out and just have one size fits all.  In the shower, there was a nice touch for the ladies -- in the corner there is a bar about 10\"-12\" off of the floor for you to rest your foot on while you shave your legs.  I must also add that the ladies in the breakfast area were also very nice, working continuously to keep everything replenished.  One also offered to take a photo of my wife and I when she saw us trying to get a good selfie!  Eggs and meat are present every morning but may be different each day -- we had scrambled eggs one morning with sausage patties and the next it was cheese omelets and sliced link sausage.  There are also juices, milk, cereal, various breads and rolls, two (2) toasters, smoothies, coffee, boiled eggs, and waffles!  There is sure to be something for everyone.  It is also convenient, only a short walk to the subway and several restaurants.  The hotel also provides coffee and water in the lobby 24 hours a day, as well as 3 computers for your use and a fitness room. If you want a different view than you have from your room, one of the elevators goes to a viewing area on the roof, which I believe is the 32nd floor.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would not hesitate to stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

What an impressive way to start the day and to make us feel that our business is valuable to them.\nWe arrived in the early afternoon and were greeted warmly by none other than Lilly herself. She immediately got us in checked in, made suggestions for where we would like our room (we chose the 25th floor), and got a young man to Valet park our car. She could not have been more gracious and sets the standard by which you would like to be treated upon arriving at a hotel. Well done Lilly!\nOur room was spacious, very, very clean, and overall very comfortable. Our room had a city view which in itself was amazing. Breakfast in the morning was excellent and had a number of offerings including omelets, waffles,sausage, Danish, cereals, fruit and other assorted breakfast items. It was well stocked and plentiful. The breakfast room is larger than it looks when first entering and it too was ultra clean.\nService staff and maintenance people were abundant and every single one of them greeted you in a friendly manner and always with a nice smile and kind words.\nI have seen other reviews where some people complained about the elevator service. I found the complaints to be completely unfounded as we never, not even once, had any issue with elevator service. We never waited more than a couple of minutes and once in, the elevator was fast. An added feature is that, elevators are not accessible unless you have your room key and swipe it. Once you swipe it, you can then select the floor that your room is located on.\nThe hotel is convenient to everything in Times Square. We walked to Radio City Music Hall, about a 15 minute walk that seemed shorter and to Rock Center which is across the street from RCMH. Those were the longest walks we had. Great restaurants, theatres, and numerous bars for a cocktail are abundant within a 5 or 10 minute stroll, or shorter, from the hotel.\nCheck out was smooth and efficient. The valet service does take a little bit of time as cars are parked at an off-site location.\nOverall, this was truly an exceptional experience. The front desk service from Lilly, the housekeeping staff, breakfast room attendants, and the valet service combined with a clean, comfortable, and quiet room made for a very, very pleasant experience. \nWe look forward to another stay at the Hampton Inn Times Square Central!","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Tambi\u00e9n es un gran hotel para ser Nueva York, dado que dispone de desayuno incluido (muy pocos hoteles lo tienen) algo que te ayuda a coger fuerzas y comer algo bien en el d\u00eda, y en el que no se te cobran las famosas tasas aparte y por sorpresa al llegar al hotel como tambi\u00e9n ocurre en la mayor\u00eda de hoteles de por all\u00ed.\n\nLo mejor:\n\n- Como hemos comentado su ubicaci\u00f3n, pr\u00f3xima al metro (parada de Times Square), a la estaci\u00f3n de autobuses, a servicios y lugares de inter\u00e9s...\n\n- No cobra las tasas por sorpresa, entiendo que ya van incluidas en el precio pero no te llevas el susto de aumentar en 500-600\u20ac tu viaje una vez estando all\u00ed y pensando que tienes todo ya pagado como ocurre en otros.\n\n- Desayuno incluido; como hemos comentado en NY la mayor\u00eda de los hoteles no lo tiene, por lo que prepara para gastar al menos entre 10 y 20 d\u00f3lares por persona y d\u00eda para \"mal desayunar\" por ah\u00ed; aqu\u00ed, a pesar de que no es el t\u00edpico desayuno de los hoteles espa\u00f1oles, tienes un buffet, que aunque algo repetitivo, cumple de sobras que puedas desayunar correctamente y coger fuerzas.  Hay leche (normal y desnatada), caf\u00e9, zumo (esto algo malo de m\u00e1quina), nevera de zumo\/batidos naturales, nevera de yogures, fruta (dos tipos distintos siempre que adem\u00e1s es un detalle que te envuelvan en papel film para que te lo puedas llevar para almolzar a media ma\u00f1ana), 5 tipos distintos de cereales, sobres de t\u00e9s, infusiones, \"chocolate\" que podr\u00eda parecerse a nuestro cacao, varios tipos de panecillos (pan de molde, panecillo redondo, baggel), tostador, todo tipo de mantequilla, mermelada, queso de untar en mini tarrinas, dos bols de \"comida caliente\" donde suelen poner tortillas, bacon, huevos revueltos... y por \u00faltimo un par de m\u00e1quinas de l\u00edquido para preparar gofres (de varios sabores) y tres gofreras, con los que poder hacerte un super gofre cada ma\u00f1ana, tambi\u00e9n tienes tarrinas de caramelo y por supuesto nata, y sirope de chocolate, fresa etc.  Como veis algo repetitivo si pasas muchos d\u00edas all\u00ed, dado que el \u00fanico cambio es la fruta (nosotros vimos naranja, manzana, pl\u00e1tano...) y la comida caliente que pasaba de tortilla, a huevos rotos, a bacon, salchichas, y alg\u00fan d\u00eda hamburguesa tambi\u00e9n; el resto son elementos fijos.\nLa capacidad de la zona de desayuno es peque\u00f1a (capacidad m\u00e1xima para 100 personas y ten en cuenta que son 30 plantas), deber\u00e1s bajar pronto si quieres coger mesa, o esperar un poco para poder hacerlo si bajas en horas puntas (tambi\u00e9n dejan sacar comida y vimos a gente desayunando en la zona de recepci\u00f3n o incluso subi\u00e9ndolo a la habitaci\u00f3n).\n\n- La m\u00e1quina de bebidas en recepci\u00f3n; a pesar de que lo que encuentres sea sencillamente agua (tanto fr\u00eda como caliente), y sobres para hacer t\u00e9s o chocolate, est\u00e1 muy bien para cuando llegas, con sed o con fr\u00edo, poder beberte tu vaso de agua fresca y posteriormente  subirte con tu chocolate caliente a la habitaci\u00f3n.  Es sobre de chocolate, que disuelves en agua, por lo que no es un chocolate propiamente, pero sienta bien, sobre todo si le a\u00f1ades alguna tarrina de leche o crema que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n a disposici\u00f3n.\n\n- La mini tienda que hay en recepci\u00f3n; no es barata, aunque tampoco excesivamente cara comparado con el resto de precios de la ciudad, dispones de varias cosas: galletas, todo tipo de bebidas, una nevera con pizzas congeladas, sopas de fideos de estas tipicas de llegar y preparar con agua, y un microondas; si alg\u00fan d\u00eda llegas cansado y sin ganas de comer nada por ah\u00ed, sabes que dispones de esto para comer algo.\n\nLo peor:\n\n- Al ser un hotel tan grande (30 plantas), a pesar de la disponibilidad de 3 ascensores, en alg\u00fan momento de hora punta, por la ma\u00f1ana, se hac\u00edan insuficientes; nosotros alojados en la planta 10 optamos por bajar andando en varias ocasiones, dado que esperabas y cuando llegaban a la planta 10 ya paraban llenos de las plantas superiores; y solo bajamos los d\u00edas que esper\u00e1bamos poco rato o para el check out que l\u00f3gicamente \u00edbamos cargados con las maletas.\n\n- Lo mismo, al ser un hotel con tanta capacidad, la zona de desayuno, con capacidad m\u00e1xima para 100 personas, tambi\u00e9n se queda corta; en este sentido nosotros como madrug\u00e1bamos bastante nunca tuvimos que esperar por una mesa, pero s\u00ed ve\u00edamos al irnos a hacer turismo gente desayunando de pie, o en zona de recepci\u00f3n o subi\u00e9ndose la comida a la habitaci\u00f3n para no esperar, porque en horas puntas es dif\u00edcil encontrar sitio (el desayuno es de 6 a 10 de la ma\u00f1ana) y a partir de 8-8:30 es cuando empezaba a ponerse imposible, nosotros a las 7-7:30 nunca tuvimos problema.  Mejor bajar, desayunar y prepararte en la habitaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s para salir.\n\nEn realidad no hubo nada suficientemente malo, y las cosas buenas, creemos que son muy buenas para visitar esta ciudad.  Las habitaciones limpias, modernas y amplias, tambi\u00e9n tranquilas y con un buen descanso a pesar de donde te encuentras, y el personal amable tambi\u00e9n.  Bien equipadas con plancha, tabla de planchar, caja fuerte y m\u00e1quina de caf\u00e9s en la habitaci\u00f3n). Tambi\u00e9n buena climatolog\u00eda propia en tu habitaci\u00f3n tanto como para fr\u00edo como para calor.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n recomendar\u00edamos alojarte aqu\u00ed, si tu intenci\u00f3n es visitar Nueva York.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

It is just a block or two off the craziness of Times Square with a subway stop right across the street from the hotel. It's a close walk to the Theaters and many restaurants.  One of the best parts was having a breakfast included before starting our busy day.  Yes the breakfast room does get busy as mentioned but we always found a seat and there is additional seating in the lobby if you make a plate and take it out there.  Great variety at breakfast - if you don't like the hot options there was always much more - smoothies, bagels, fruit, muffins etc.  One day we had to be at Good Morning America at 6:00 am and they had grab and go breakfast ready in a bag at the front desk and we grabbed a coffee and ate breakfast in line for GMA.  Not buying breakfast or coffee saved us a lot in NYC!   It was also nice that the hotel had water, coffee, tea etc available in the lobby 24\/7 and cookies often as well.  \nEveryone we encountered at Hampton was friendly and eager to help in any way needed.  Good value for the money - we paid ~$350 per night but remember you are in the heart of Manhattan and breakfast included.  We ended up getting Sunday night half price through a Hilton Honors promotion.  \nOn a side note - had dinner at the bar next door (Gleason's Tavern) one night when we were tired and food was great and enjoyed talking to bartender and a few locals.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed here for four nights during September 2019 in a two double bed room.\nCheck in and out was fast and efficient. Room and bathroom size was good. Room amenities included tea\/coffee facility, room safe and standard bathroom supplies. The entire hotel was very clean and housekeeping did a good job.\nThe staff we came across was helpful and efficient. We organized our car to Newark airport through the hotel and the price was ok and service timely.\nWe could not check out the rooftop view but view from the room was fine.\nThere is a small shop at the lobby for soft drinks and similar items which was helpful for us. The hotel also provides free tea and coffee at the lobby.\nConsidering what I have written so far it should have been five stars but I cannot give that due to problem with elevators and breakfast.\nAs mentioned by others, there are only three elevators and it is not enough for a hotel of this size during the morning rush hours which starts around 8 am. We had to wait for nearly twenty minutes to get into the elevator one day. If you are going to the airport in the morning then make sue you have sufficient time in hand.\nThe hotel provides breakfast which in included in the room rate. The food was ok but the size of the breakfast room is too small with insufficient seating arrangements. Unless you start your breakfast before 7 am getting a table is doubtful. In fact we had to skip the hotel breakfast one day as there were no place to sit and it was way beyond over crowded. Please note there is no other restaurant at the hotel.\nAs a conclusion if you are looking for central location, decent price and a clean hotel and will not mind avoiding the morning rush and skip hotel breakfast then this is highly recommended.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":8035866,"title":"Ubicaci\u00f3n Inmejorable, hotel con muchas \u00e1reas de oportunidad","lang":"es","publishedDate":"2019-09-09","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Sin duda el mejor atributo de este hotel es su ubicaci\u00f3n; se encuentra a media cuadra de la estaci\u00f3n 42st Times Square del metro, que cuenta con accesos a todas las l\u00edneas de dicho transporte, lo que permite que transportarse hacia cualquier punto de la ciudad sea s\u00faper sencillo. Adem\u00e1s, est\u00e1 a una cuadra de Gray Line, por lo que si quieres ir al Outlet Woodbury Common es muy sencillo tomar el transporte y regresar con tus compras y dejarlas muy f\u00e1cil en el hotel. En cuanto a las habitaciones, considero que respecto otros hoteles en Nueva York deben ser de un tama\u00f1o standard, aunque comparadas con otros destinos, son peque\u00f1as. La limpieza de las habitaciones bastante bien. Algo positivo del hotel, es que en el lobby colocan las 24 horas, agua caliente y fr\u00eda as\u00ed como caf\u00e9, y varias opciones de t\u00e9s, lo cual como turista, se agradece bastante. Sin embargo, creo que hay varios detalles que podr\u00edan mejorar dentro del hotel. En primer lugar, el elevador es sumamente lento, puedes tardarte en bajar al rededor de 15 minutos, por que se tarda mucho en llegar a tu piso, sobretodo en ciertos horarios que se llena. Igualmente el desayuno, a partir de las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana se satura de una manera espantosa, es imposible encontrar mesa y se vuelve todo un desorden la zona del comedor, no es nada placentero bajar a desayunar. Considero que el espacio es totalmente insuficiente para la cantidad de hu\u00e9spedes del hotel. Justo en estos horarios, tambi\u00e9n el elevador llega a sus horarios pico, y es cuando m\u00e1s te tardas en bajar. La calidad del desayuno es bastante normal, ofrecen alguna opci\u00f3n de huevos y otra prote\u00edna (Salchichas o carne), fruta (muy poca variedad, un poco de mel\u00f3n en no las mejores condiciones, manzanas y uvas) yogurts, waffles, bagels, jugo, caf\u00e9, t\u00e9 y algunas otras pocas opciones de pan. Algo con lo que deber\u00edan tener cuidado es con el trato a los hu\u00e9spedes, a diferencia de otros hoteles de la cadena, en esta ocasi\u00f3n el personal fue bastante \"tosco\" y poco amable con nosotros. Un problema que tuvimos fue que cuando llegamos para hacer el check in (12 pm) dejamos las maletas encargadas por que no nos pod\u00edan entregar la habitaci\u00f3n hasta las 3 de la tarde (muy puntual, ni un minuto antes, para que lo tomen en consideraci\u00f3n), salimos a pasear por Times Square, y cuando regresamos a las 3 para recibir las habitaciones y refrescarnos un poco, hab\u00edan hecho cambio de turno y resulta que a algunos de nuestros equipajes les hab\u00edan puesto otras etiquetas distintas a las de la tarjeta que nos hab\u00edan dado para recogerlas, por lo cual con muy mala cara nos dijeron que deb\u00edamos entregar la otra tarjeta, afortunadamente, el equipaje tra\u00eda nombre, y nos pidieron (de mala forma) identificarnos para podernos entregar el equipaje. Tambi\u00e9n tuvimos que mostrar el ticket de algunas compras que hab\u00edamos dejado junto con el equipaje. Qu\u00e9 bueno que soliciten alguna prueba de que es tuyo el equipaje, por seguridad, sin embargo, los modos son los equivocados, nos hablaron sumamente mal, hasta de forma grosera, y lo que es peor es que fue por algo que fue totalmente su culpa, porque etiquetaron mal los equipajes. Sugiero que si dejan maletas en resguardo, se aseguren que los etiqueten bien, para que no tengan ese problema. En general creo que la ubicaci\u00f3n vale much\u00edsimo la pena, no obstante, el hotel tiene varias cosas por mejorar.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Breakfast buffet is a HUGE perk. Super-friendly staff in the breakfast room, big smiles, hard-working- great way to start the day: waffles, eggs, bacon or sausage, fresh fruit, smoothies, cereal, pastries, yogurt, etc. Try to hit the buffet as early as possible to avoid the 9-10 AM chaos.

We were allocated our room but were a little disappointed as our Travel Agent had sent in a request for a nice view and also to see if they could do something special as it was my husband's 50th birthday, there wasn't anything special and the view was rubbish. We soon found out there wasn't a shower curtain so every time we showered everywhere got soaked. We mentioned the above points, and so did my travel agent and between Emanuel and Christina we were moved higher up in the hotel with a better view, and to make it special they had put a balloon, card and some cakes from Carlo's bakery,  that was amazing as I LOVE cake boss! This room was good but a little noisier than lower down but ok.  Breakfast was lovely and we never had to wait for a table, there was everything you could want even different hot options and waffle batter flavours every day. Coffee, hot and cold water available in the lobby every day. Great hotel all in all,  the only reason I gave it 4 was purely because of the noise.

First, the housekeeping staff were very inconsistent during our eight night stay. Some days they left no coffee packets, other days they left all decaf, and one day they left coffee but no plastic insert to use the machine. The bottom sheet on the bed was too small for the mattress and kept coming undone at the corners of the bed. Also, we had to ask to have the sheets changed even though we were staying over a week. Second, the wait for the elevator was VERY long in the morning while breakfast was being served. Housekeeping (with supply carts) seemed to use the same elevators as the guests so that complicated the process. The final negative was the crowded breakfast area, lack of sufficient seating and the mediocre quality of the food. After a few days, we ate at places near the hotel.

So close to all of the times square attractions, the subway, and the bus terminal if you are arriving in on the Newark Airport Express bus from the EWR airport (just a half of a block walk from the bus terminal to the hotel).  We arrived before check in, and the hotel desk stored our bags in a locked room so that we could explore the city until our room was ready.  We chose a room on the second floor due to reading reviews about the hassle with the elevators.  We are glad we made this choice.  The convenience of taking the stairs (4 flights of stairs from the lobby to the second floor) during the breakfast rush made us very happy with our decision.  We did not see any problems with elevator wait times at any other point during the day throughout our one week stay in June though.  It is really just a concern at breakfast time.  On the first day, we lucked out and found one dining table open to eat at during breakfast.  The other days, it was so busy, that we just took our food back up to our room and ate there due to lack of seating.  Take note of the sign that the hotel posts about breakfast busy times - we found it to be pretty accurate, so to avoid a wait, go early!  The room was nice and clean.  The beds were okay - not the most comfy, but not the worst.  We were worried about street noise being on the second floor, but it was not a problem at all.  There is the occasional siren that you hear, but other than that, noise was not that bad because 41st street was not a particularly noisy street.  The only problem we had with the room was actually a pretty annoying problem.  Mosquitoes!  We kept finding mosquitoes in our room and I am highly allergic to mosquito bites - where the bites turn into welts, then bruises, then blisters - not fun.  Well, we would kill the ones we would see, but I still would get bit.  Then we would leave for the day and come back in the evening and find that the room had more mosquitoes!  I don't know how they were getting in.  We did notice that the windows to the outside opened slightly, so my guess is that housekeeping either opened the windows while they were cleaning each day which let in the mosquitoes, or they were traveling through the vents.  Either way, I have never had a mosquito problem in a hotel room like I did here.  No matter how many we would kill, there were more, and they kept biting me so that I would wake up with fresh bites each morning.  I did mention the problem upon checkout, so hopefully they can address where the mosquito problem is coming from and treat it.  However, even with the mosquitoes, this really was a lovely hotel and a very friendly staff - we really enjoyed our stay.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":8035866,"title":"Great Stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Great stay at this Hampton Inn. At first wasn't happy with room size, it was small, (city view king) and lack of some amenities - no mini fridge or microwave. Don't know if that's a code thing for NYC or not, unlike other Hamptons that offer them. Made our reservation directly, the woman on the phone was wonderful and so helpful. Upon arrival in late afternoon, valet didn't take long and helpful while we were putting things on cart to bring in. Yes it's a bit pricey per day for valet but much rather have my car to get there and go home. You don't take it out other than that. Had city view king size room with great view, especially  first day, only day we actually saw any sun, can't blame hotel for weather. When I first saw room, wasn't thrilled. Far smaller than any Hampton Inn room I'd had, felt a bit old, purple carpet needs to go, purple black out drapes don't exactly black out, they'reabout 2 inches too short so the light comes streaming in morning time, night time not too bad but the city lights definitely act like a big night light thru the drapes.Hotel pics show a king size room as having a comfortable looking sitting chair but when we got up there, it was only a work desk and chair. Coming to NYC there's a lot of walking and I wanted a comfortable chair to relax in and was shown as part of the room. Went down to the front desk to ask where said chair was, young woman said she didn't know what rooms had those chairs (?) but a manager was right there and immediately said they would bring a chair up to our room. To their credit, chair arrived in 5 minutes delivered by a nice gentleman from housekeeping. We smooshed it in next to the end corner of the bed as the room wasn't that big. Like to see less workspace size and rigid work chair and more of a nice true comfortable sitting chair to relax and enjoy that view with at the end of the day, especially for the cost of the rooms...yes I know it's NYC, rooms are pricey but for pricey I want it comfy. Not much room to put clothes away, 3 small drawers attached to work space desk and a closet. Kept our things in our suitcases for 4 days, used closet to hang up a couple of things. Bathroom, was spacious enough, housekeeping would just give us more towels when we asked. Was disappointed to start putting things out on the counter and realized there was someone's hair right by the hotel soaps and it wasn't mine. Countertop didn't seem clean rest of bathroom did. Broke out some hand sanitizer and wiped down counter and got rid of hair. The duvet didn't have the usual card on it as other Hamptons that say it's basically fresh and clean, always a nice touch to see but not this go around so far as a note but appeared clean. Elevators, in our 4 days we never waited anytime I would even consider close to being long and we were in and out of the building frequently and close to a top floor. Elevator was quick once we got in and selected our floor. Roof top observation deck bit of a let down, expecting more like a patio type but guess that's not possible up on a 32nd floor and there wasn't really a lot of room up there, but it's worth taking a quick look around. Bed, comfortable, shower, always hot water, room, much smaller than I expected a king city view would be. Quiet except for heavy slam sound of neighboring doors. For so many people being there, we had quiet nights. Breakfast was busy but we got in, got our food and we did find seating each day. Waffles are always available and cereals, fruit, muffins, yogurt, juice, coffee, teas, bacon, sausage, etc. It would be nice to offer scrambled eggs every day and then an extra option like the western omelet or plain cheese omelet but that's just personal choice. But still a little hint to the Hampton Inn for breakfast offering. Geraldine works in the breakfast area, she is sweet, happy and hard working. Tea, coffee, cocoa, cold water, etc available all day by registration desk. All in all for a first time stay, we enjoyed it. Hotel staff polite and helpful.With volume of people coming to front desk it can get hectic, but it's a customer service job, for the most part all the staff seemed customer service oriented. Not sure of other Hamptons in area, may check them out but overall this was a good experience, wish room was a bit more comfortable in size but location was fantastic.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I am a fairly faithful Hilton Honors Guest, so I most often make reservations on line.  Shortly before we traveled, I wanted to ensure our rooms were in close proximity, and even, perhaps, adjoining.  Although it is possible to do this \u201cin a little box\u201d online, I opted to call the hotel directly.  I spoke to Olivia, who was at the Front Desk.  I explained the situation and she explained the configurations and possibilities.  At that time there was no availability, but Olivia assured me she would note the request and that they would make the appropriate accommodations should there be cancellations and changes.  \nWhen we arrived, I merely gave my name and confirmation number.   The clerk replied with a genuine smile, oh yes, Miss *** your rooms are ready, we were able to make the appropriate changes and you have adjoining rooms.  I looked at her name tag, and it was Olivia.  She took care of the situation, remembered our conversation, and greeted me in a warm and friendly manner.  Throughout our stay she was most helpful, almost thinking one step ahead of our needs.  Every hotel should have at least one Olivia.\n\tAlthough the hotel is fairly good size, it is set up in a way as to not be overwhelming.  There is a comfortable well-lit lobby area, suited for gathering and snacks.  Beverages are always available.  I particularly liked that one must use a room key in order to access the buttons in the elevator.  This is a good security feature.  \n\tThe Hampton breakfast buffet was busy, but the staff kept right on top of things.  The food was always fresh, and the associates were efficient at clearing tables keeping the area clean; and they did it all with smiles. \n\tThe rooms were very clean, and the housekeeping staff very friendly and helpful.  They were discreet in not disturbing, yet efficient in offering supplies and doing daily cleaning.\n \tOne in our party became ill.  Olivia and the rest of the front desk team were most helpful in providing things we needed, telling us where the closet urgent care was located, and so forth.  The manager allowed us to keep one room through the afternoon until we had to leave for the airport so the patient could rest comfortable.  I put this in the category of going above and beyond.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone searching for a place to stay in the Times Square area.

Mesmo com o alto fluxo de h\u00f3spedes, o staff sempre mant\u00e9m o caf\u00e9 farto e n\u00e3o deixa faltar nada, sempre repondo os alimentos e mantendo o local limpo. Muito bom!

Um lugar muito bonito de ficar \u00e0 noite para observar a cidade de Nova York iluminada.\n\nAcredito que o \u00fanico por\u00e9m do hotel seja a quest\u00e3o do elevador. Eu n\u00e3o tive muito problema com isso, pois, como me hospedei no 25\u00ba andar, maioria das vezes pegava o elevador vazio.

The breakfast opens at 6 am.  Rooms are fine, pretty standard but clean.  Bed was comfy and it was quiet on our floor.

Hotel was clean and our room even though we did have a brief A\/C issue that was quickly resolved was very comfortable and the bathroom was huge. Also it is very close to Time Square and many other places to visit. I would definitely stay again maybe even longer if the rate of $140 available for a Friday night again.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The front staff was very congenial and helpful with information and ideas and places to eat ( Farrell, Kriss, Christine, Johnny, Rachelle) The breakfast was hot, filling and clean ... thanks to the service personnel Benson and Darren !  I will definitely come back here for the cleaniness, the modern elevators, and the closeness to walking to Times Square, Port Authority, Bus Stops and Subway entrances!  We were not lacking anything !  A small but lovely view from the roof top open from sunrise to sunset (maybe 8pm).  If the hotel is available for a similar price I got from Booking dot com (` $172 a night with taxes\/fees) I would definitely go back again.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Hotel was conveniently located around the corner. The play was phenomenal as were the accommodations!\nThe hotel really exceeded our expectations from the time we arrived which was early on Saturday morning. They stored our bags until our room was ready and invited us to join the breakfast that was underway. The buffet was tasty and satisfying after a long flight from Los Angeles. \nAfter breakfast we went on a scouting expedition to get the lay of the land and loved how close we were to everything around Times square! This place is well located for the theater district and many great eateries. \nThe hotel staff was excellent and very gracious, always greeting us and asking if there was anything we needed to make our stay more pleasant. The room itself was smaller than I imagined but otherwise very comfortable with beds and pillows that ensured a good night sleep and an incredible city view.\nWe didn't need a car as everything we were interested in was withing walking distance or a short cab ride away. By the time we left on Monday afternoon we were well rested and thoroughly pleased with our mini vacation. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to the big apple!

The 42st subway entrance was right across the street. Since the hotel is on a side street, buildings blocked a lot of the light and noise that came from Times Square.\nThe hotel itself has been refurbished and looked well taken care of. The rooms were very small, but to be expected in the city. We chose to stay on an upper floor, so we had very little traffic noise which was also nice.\nThe breakfast was typical for Hampton Inn's. Some hot eggs, meat of some kind, breads, bagels, muffins, yogurts, fresh whole and cut fruit, oatmeal and make yourself waffles.\nWe used digital check in and digital key, so we walked through the lobby, onto an elevator and up to our room. We did have to stop at the desk to get the wifi code.\nFor convenience, we would stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}
