We later returned to the room in the evening for our first night sleep, the noise from the outside street which could be heard from the 5th floor room was unbearable and made for a very bad nights sleep. We spoke to the hotel manager the following morning who basically dismissed our claims as \u201cno one else on the 5th floor\u201d had complained about the noise. We were eventually moved to the 15th floor after a good 5 minute discussion with the manager about the meaning of good customer service which made for a better night sleep on our last 2 nights. Please bear in mind if staying at this hotel that the sound proofing is terrible, we could also hear peoples conversations from the room next door. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, however would not stay at this hotel again due to the abysmal sound proofing and attitude of the manager. As someone who has worked in the travel industry for over 11 years this was certainly one of the worst hotel experiences I\u2019ve had.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Led by Khaoula who I had many interactions with made this trip!  Traveling solo and having lived in nyc for years led me to stay close to my former neighborhood.  There was only one drawback to the hotel and that was the pillows which were a size of a larger throw pillow one would put on their sofa.  When I brought this up to Khaoula she was understanding and immediately sent more pillows up to my room.  Yes they were similar size but made it better.  I do think that corporate might want to rethink the decision to have such pillows since they do not have to invest in new bedding since the pillow cases were standard size and folded back to refit smaller pillows.  It would also probably make housekeeping job easier, which by the way the housekeeping staff was awesome. Again HUGE shout out to Khaoula who made this solo traveler\u2019s trip so much more special.  Pillows make this a 4 star rating, but staff 5+++ stars","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

We should have run on the first incident but you book these chain hotels to avoid issues right? \nWe originally had booked to stay in the best western hotel in Herald square as the location was perfect for the things we wanted to do during our week in nyc. We arrive there early evening after a massive day of travel and a very expensive Uber from the airport, to be told by the reception that our room was no longer available??? No one had bothered to contact us despite having BOTH of our emails on file AND the ability to message us directly via the booking.com app, which they had prior to discuss a different enquiry. Anyway, we were told that if we walked \u2018just 20 mins, that way\u2019  the herald square hotel would had a room for us for the same price. That was the extent of any explanation. Right, let\u2019s wrangle all of our luggage during peak hour nyc in the middle of summer. Off we go, praying this hotel actually exists. Thankfully it does and we are determined to not let this ruin our time in the city. \nHalfway through our week long stay I made a considerably large purchase at Gucci. I arrived back to the hotel with the purchase in its lime green shopping bag and keepsafe box they give you to keep your items in. The next day I took the actual bag out with me for the day and had left the extra straps for the bag in the box in the line green bag right next to my luggage. We get back to our room late arvo, and the room has been remade, but the bag and box has disappeared. I go straight down to reception and explain what had happened and the receptionist told me to go back to my room to wait and he would ring me once they had looked through the trash. About two minutes after getting back to the room he calls and says it\u2019s not there. I ask what happens now and he tells me his manager will be in tomorrow and he is the only one who can access the security cameras. \nSo the next morning I go back down to reception and ask to speak to the manager, and surprise! He\u2019s not here today, he\u2019s back tomorrow. Perfect. Every time I pass through reception I ask if there has been any progress and get the same answer. \nDay three the manager is finally here and confirms my things have been thrown in the trash. Three days ago, so they\u2019re long gone. He then tells me that I \u2018shouldn\u2019t have left them in the box if I didn\u2019t want them to be thrown away\u2019 I should\u2019ve taken it all out with me, and that \u2018I\u2019ve still got the actual bag, so what\u2019s the problem?\u2019 Keeping in mind this is over $800usd worth of brand new Gucci products that have gone missing at the hands of the hotel.\n I genuinely couldn\u2019t believe the nonchalant attitude I received from the employees, but I was absolutely disgusted at how the manager responded to this issue. The lack of urgency to help me solve this incident was ridiculous as well, not one staff member took it seriously. It was like it was an actual joke. I spent thousands on dollars to stay in this hotel, and more thousands on my purchase. To be treated like a laughing stock. It was like a pair of socks had gone missing. I didn\u2019t even get as much as a sorry. He was adamant it was my fault, but said he\u2019d knock $100 off our bill. Which hasn\u2019t happened.\n Imagine if I had broken or stolen something from the room and then just refused to accept responsibility and resolve it. Absolutely unacceptable. I wish I could give it less than one star.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I must praise the Gen. Mgr. Jay Singh, who hires the most caring and helpful staff. The hotel feels like a second home to me. Special praise to the women at the front desk,Khoula and Afsheen. One of the best parts of the hotel is that a great breakfast is included,prepared by Maria and Daisy. The food is really good and the breakfast room is spotless.  I loved my room and the maid service was excellent. The complimentary coffee,tea and ice water in the lobby adds a special touch.

If you were looking only at the building (just over a year old) you might be fooled into believing that this is a Premier hotel, but beyond the look there isn't much Premier about it.  I don't think BW should continue to market this hotel in its current brand class.  \nThat said, I stayed two nights in this hotel because of the geographic proximity to some meetings.  The location is very good, if you can get OUT of the hotel.  On the second night, as I was leaving for a dinner, I got stuck in the elevator.  The telephone button in the elevator didn't work.  My cell phone did, but the front desk could barely hear me.  The staff did indicate they would send help, but were noncommittal about when that would arrive.  The receptionist did not know my name or my room or whether I was a guest or visitor, but she was very against my calling the fire department.  I decided to ask NYFD (Ladder 24 gets 5 stars) to get me out, and once they were called they got me out of the elevator relatively quickly from the time they were dispatched.  That said, the hotel played no part in helping me, and once I got out and left for the night, upon return the elevator was still out of service.   I missed dinner because the restaurant closed.  The next day the hotel indicated they had done more than the Fire Dep't (totally untrue).  I also learned that the hotel is used to the elevator not working - again, new hotel, new elevators, but the hotel knows there's a problem (likely electrical) and they haven't fixed it.  While some staff members are nice (hence I'm rating this hotel poor as opposed to terrible), management is terrible and fails to take responsibility.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I greatly appreciated Khaoula for making my experience wonderful. This brings my review of the Best Western Premier Empire State Hotel to a close. I will definitely be returning to this wonderful hotel. ~Khamari\u00a0","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

What was especially impressive about this hotel was that it is in a safe, relatively quiet location with perfectly clean rooms and generous amenities. One aspect of our stay which we found to be particularly impressive was the completely free coffee, tea and water. This might sound fairly insignificant, although having visited a number of other New York hotels with friends, it is surprising how rare it is to find such amenities free of charge. This is excellent for morning coffee as well as allowing you to fill up a water bottle for the day - in the process saving you a fair amount of money. The location is sublime, with Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Times Square and the Empire State Building within good walking distance. There are also plenty of shops around, including the likes of CVS, Walgreens and other convenience stores - useful if you need any necessities. You really do get an excellent value for money here and I must say I am very pleased with the service we received. The single BEST aspect of this hotel is the staff, though. They were very friendly when we arrived and was always helpful when we spoke with her. Some of the staff I did not get the names of but they were all kind, courteous and professional. The hidden gem of this hotel is definitely Khaoula - an absolutely phenomenonal member of staff. She always greeted us with an unparalleled enthusiasm and warm, beaming smile, which made us feel very much at home. Also, (not taking anything away from the other staff) Khaoula is an extremely hard worker who, is always doing her best to cheer up every guest. I am not exaggerating when I say that she might just be one of the best in her profession. What a beautiful person! Like I said, I think everyone working at that hotel deserves high praise. If you are thinking about staying here (and I spent an age trying to decide where) then in my experience this is the place. Absolutely brilliant.\n\n","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Yo voy a contar exactamente mi experiencia.\nLa situacion es extraordinaria, pq esta situado en medio camino de todo, ya que esta a 200 mts del empire state y de la 5 avenida.\nSinceramente, las fotos no tienen nada que ver con la habitacion. Si, las camas comodiiiiiiisimas , pero para subirte en ella tenias que entrar de lado. Lo peor respecto a la habitacion, la poca o nula limpieza, no que no la limpien sino lo pides, que tambien, pero es que el dia de la llegada habia en el ba\u00f1o pelos por todas partes y no precisamente nuestros.\nEl desayuno correcto, a mi me parecio bien el unico problema es que tienen solo 2 ascensores que compartes con las chicas de la limpieza y sus carros, asi que el primer dia tarde 15 minutos en llegar al desayuno ya que no se como los tienen programados pero subes y bajas parando por todos los pisos.\nUna cosa si que twngo que comentar, eso que pone todo el mundo del deposito que te bloquean de 164 dolares no es asi, o por lo menos a mi nada me bloquearon, bueno, miento 1 dolar para comprobar que la tarjeta era valida.\nResumiendo........situacion fabulosa, cama muy comoda y poco mas.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is situated right next to a parking garage and this was super convenient for us to bring our bags in. Abraham provided great service with a smile, which isn't always easy to find in Manhattan. The hotel front desk had friendly staff and permitted early check-in hours before the advertised time. We opted to go for the breakfast buffet, and it was a great decision. One floor below the main they have ample seating allowing for a comfortable breakfast to fuel up before heading out on long walks for the day. The breakfast opened at 7 am and is super convenient to get ready and head downstairs before starting our exploration of the city. We stayed two nights and both days we were treated to a diverse set of items for the hot breakfast. We loved filling our water bottles with ice-cold lemon water before commencing our walk. The rooms are typical Manhattan size, but they've done a fantastic job maximizing counter space with drawers and cupboards to organize items from your luggage. We also had a mini fridge and a discrete safe available in our room. We will certainly stay at this location again when visiting NYC.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Nice king size bed and updated bathroom with excellent water pressure in the shower.  Real estate is narrow and tall there.  6 rooms per floor and there are 21 floors.  Regarding front desk staff, Tara is awesome and knowledgeable about restaurant recommendations in the area. They also were able to accommodate early check in, which was great.  They also offer lemon water in the lobby, which was a nice touch after spending 3 hours at the stadium watching the mets in 85 degree heat.  Hallway is narrow, so keep that in mind when packing luggage.  Price point is on point!  Here comes the ONLY negative review which is not of the hotel, but the parking garage they recommend.  Do NOT use Meyers garage on 9 west 35th street!!!!!  Hotel clerk said they offer their hotel guests a $42\/day parking rate.  Upon entering garage, we knew we would be one hour late after the 24 hours and we were told they would charge $20 for that extra hour.  So we were expecting to pay $62 for parking.  We arrived within the hour after 24 hours like we said we would.  And the total was $79.  Trying to talk to these people, was like dealing with a mexican cartel.  Even though the validation sticker on the back says $42, the \u201cmanager\u201d of the garage, says he doesnt offer hotel validation at that price and went on to say that of you come back late after the 24 hours the discount is null and void and you pay the regular rate.  So first it was we dont offer validation (and he said this very trashy)..then went on to say well you came back late, the discount is off the table.  None of this made any sense.  Upon calling the Best Western, the manager Jay tried saying well, do you have a large truck or van?  No.  We have a Rav4.  Small vehicle. And he also said he tells his guests to get there before the 24 hours is up.  We were not told this at check in (from the front desk staff.::it was not Jay the manager)  AND when we asked at the garage, again, we were told we would get the discount and then pay hourly for each hour after.   In the end, if you have a vehicle to park, use any garage but the garage the hotel recommends. They scam people and upon reading reviews of the garage, they play the same scam on other\u2019s.  You are forced to pay because they have your car and keys.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":23542350,"title":"Good value for money hotel with a great location.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-06-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Stayed at the hotel for three weeks with my two adult kids. \nWhen I started looking for a place to stay in midtown NYC, the hotel would come out as one of the better value hotels. Great that it didn\u2019t have as much of the hidden charges of some hotels that come out initially as cheaper on a per night basis, but then are actually way more expensive when you factor in all the extras.\n\nFor the rate and the fact that this is NYC, room size is okay if you are going to use it primarily as a place to sleep in. Obviously, the space in the room is not what you would get in other hotels in other cities for the rate, but as I said, this is NYC. Any lack of space in the room (especially when you are all still awake and looking to use gadgets, watch tv, etc) is compensated by the living room in the lobby area where you can do some work on a laptop, eat, or simply just hang out if you feel too crowded in the room when you get back from your activities for the day. There is also free cold water, coffee, tea in the lobby. The basement has two computers you can use or print docs from, two extra bathrooms for hotel guests, and a dining area.\n\nDouble bed is big enough for two adults.  No issues with the showers as water pressure was strong throughout our stay and the temperature control was consistent throughout. Our toilet bowl clogged up twice though but the hotel fixed it immediately during both occasions. When we did discover the bathrooms in the basement after a few days in the hotel, we actually used it more for our bathroom needs (especially for no. 2- HA HA), to avoid any further clogging of the bathroom. It was actually better since we essentially had an extra bathroom for the three of us and we didn\u2019t have to wait for one another to use the one in our room. There was no refrigerator in our room but I really did not see the need for it as water is readily available in the lobby. I do know that some rooms do have a ref. No gym on the grounds also. No issues with WIFI throughout.\n\nGiven current COVID restrictions, rooms though across the US don\u2019t get daily clean ups. Obviously getting the room fixed up everyday with fresh new towels would be great, but no issues here given that is the world we live in now. \n\nHotel is definitely in a great location as it is walking distance to many of NYC\u2019s attractions. If you don\u2019t feel like making the 30+ minute walks to certain sites, the hotel is near several subway stations in both the east and west sides. \n\nNo issues with the staff as all were generally courteous. General Manager was very accommodating and would go out of his way to let guests know of certain updates in the hotel.\n\nSome suggestions:\n1.\tIt would be good if the guests were informed both verbally and perhaps given a one page print out upon check in of some of the amenities in the hotel. We actually did not know there was a basement with a dining area, two bathrooms, a mini-business center, until a few days into our stay. We made use of the area a lot in our stay.\n2.\tThere was an open area beside the living room area of the lobby which I was not sure was open for use or not. I did see some guests use it at least once but one time I asked, the receptionist at that time said she wasn\u2019t sure if it was really open due to current COVID restrictions.\n3.\tI personally had no issue with people using the living room to eat since we did so ourselves, but it may be good for the hotel staff to let people know that there is a dining area at the basement. There were times when some groups of guests of 4 or more would have several plates or take out boxes laid out on tables. It might be better if dining, especially big groups, were done at the dining area in the basement or in the outside area (if open) and the living room lobby was more for people to work, have coffee, or just hang out in. Actually, if it is possible, the receptionist or one of the staff could show at least one member of the guests\u2019 party upon check in, the different areas of the hotel. \n4.\tThe last suggestion would involve the booking of transports for leaving hotel guests. The hotel booked our transport arrangements to JFK Airport. Driver arrived on time and we did make it to JFK in one piece. It would be good practice though if guests are advised even without their asking what the expected price of the service may be. I don\u2019t expect it to be the same for all but I believe a general range can be established for some of the more standard drop-offs like JFK, LA Guardia, etc. The guests should also be advised if they will be better of paying in cash or card. While I know it may be beyond the capacity of the hotel, it should be explored if they can make arrangements for a certain pool of drivers to service their needs or ask their guests to rate their drivers they booked as well.\n\nThe one we got for our ride to JFK was not a particularly good driver. Instead of having his phone on a stand on the dashboard, he had it on his lap. He would constantly look at it for updates I guess which of course is not really a safe way to drive. We also had not yet reached the airport and he was already asking for payment. I asked if I could pay by card and he said yes. Not sure if Lyft or Uber drivers have swipe machines, but might be better to do so since this one didn\u2019t have one and he was having problems inputting the payment on his phone. I eventually asked for my card back and just paid him in cash. Still, it would have been good if the hotel advised what the expected charges may be even if I didn\u2019t ask and if I would be better off paying in cash or card. And if the latter, what to expect on how card payments would be processed.\n\nAll in all though, given the cost, the location, and the current facilities, I would recommend the hotel if it is in your budget and you are looking at it primarily as a place to sleep in while in the city and one that is near to many attractions either via walk or subway.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

They charged me 101 USD deposit on arrival which is fine. This was deducted from my card. My bank in the UK has also agreed that 101 USD was taken out and paid to the Best Western as per screenshot. \n\nCalled the hotel who told me that I will be refunded 5-7 days. That\u2019s fine. No refund. Called the hotel who advised me to wait to last Friday and still no refund. \n\nSo I sent an email and no one replied. It\u2019s only when I called for a 3rd time Jay the Asst general manager emailed me saying it\u2019s released on the 22nd April. To wait. I waited. Then a completely different message it\u2019s only an authorisation. I sent proof this was not the case as the money was indeed deducted and paid to Best Western. He sent me a screenshot saying it was refunded but any person can see that the 100 USD has NOT been refunded from his screenshot (Attached)\n\nI told him again the money has been refunded and all he has to do is speak to his accounts as he will see a surplus of 101 USD. Did he? Nope. He told me to contact my bank. I have already and the money has been taken. \n\nSo I ended up the conversation saying I am now taking this further as he obviously has no power in the hotel so I will find someone who can.  I have proof. They do not. \n\nThe moral of this story is that refuse to pay this charge if you can.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The website says New Construction, it is a new remodel, NOT new construction. The narrow hallways where the rooms are have a dark, dank appearance & feel. \n\nThe rooms are tightly spaced and the doors are literally side by side, room layout is super small & the walls are very thin. Street sounds went on all night long, along with partying neighbors in the next room. I always pack earplugs & that helped a lot to filter the noise out. \n\nA single King bed is placed in a room that would nicely fit a Queen bed & chair. There is no sitting area in the room, no walk around room. The bathroom was so tight with no space for toiletries & no space to turn around because the door is in the way. No fridge, no microwave, no closet, no breakfast. The lobby coffee & water was out most days.\n\nThe plus we found was the staff was very kind & accommodating, housekeeping was very nice as well. They seemed to all do their jobs very well. This location is central to the subways which was convenient.

We paid less than $150 per night (including fees and taxes) and the hotel is comparable to those charging $300 per night. \n\nIt is brand new and being kept up to excellent standards. When we stay at a new hotel, I look to see if it will \u201clast\u201d, especially at lower cost\/brands. BW Empire State has not been made cheaply (good fixtures, furniture, etc) so I would expect it to keep its value. \n\nYes, the rooms are pretty small (like many in NYC), but so well planned and laid out, it is very comfortable for an extended stay (desk\/stool; long bench\/stool - we used that as a little dining table), hanging space and drawers. They provided us with a refrigerator upon request that was helpful. \n\nThere are some cons that I would deduct 1\/2 point for. First, there is poor soundproofing of the rooms. We heard our neighbors a lot. We sleep with ear plugs, but still heard the loud noises (especially the group that partied at 3am).  Luckily they only stayed a couple of nights. Second, on two separate days our room key cards stopped working (and we had not kept them near our phones or cc\u2019s). Maybe they are working out that glitch. \n\nI would keep my eye on the reviews going forward; if it keeps up its quality and pricing, this is a good option for a NYC stay.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}
