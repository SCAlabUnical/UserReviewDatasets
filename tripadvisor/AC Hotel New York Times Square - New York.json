I liked the fact that it was centrally located and near major transit hubs. There are two restaurants on the premises, one is Boqueria, a tapas bar and the other is Castell, a rooftop lounge. My room was very comfortable featuring a large double bed with a widescreen TV and blackout curtains. A nice option about the TV was that you could access Netflix, Pandora, or Your tube provided you had a subscription. There was ample place to hang up you clothes and two drawers for smaller items. There was also a small refrigerator and a safe. The refrigerator is not a minibar. There is also an ironing board and an iron. The floor is wood throughout. There was a nice desk and chair with adequate outlets and USB ports. A coffee and tea service is provided. You can adjust the temperature of the room easily to your liking. The lobby is a nice size and there is also a place adjacent to the front desk where you can purchase snacks and have them credited to your room. The bathroom is large, very comfortable with a handheld and raindrop shower with good water pressure and hot water! The restaurants do serve breakfast at your expense but there are plenty of places in the area and on 9th Avenue for breakfast.

I feel bad about the delay because of one young man in particular, Josh. Josh was the best, he was the second person to greet us and say hello, and was the first person to go above & beyond to make sure our stay at the AC Marriott was as good as it could be. It was not Josh\u2019s fault at our room placement. We chose this hotel because of some of the great reviews we read and the opportunity to get a nice photo on their rooftop. We came to New York to celebrate our daughters 21st Birthday. Unfortunately our room was facing the street so if you go out in the city that never sleeps, don\u2019t think you are going to get any sleep if your room is facing the street, you will hear the traffic going by on that street and unfortunately for us there was construction on the street that started very early the jackhammers were busy & loud. I was told the Hotel was sold out, we had made our reservations early, I thought there was an option on the type of view when I made the reservation, nevertheless I wasn\u2019t happy at all about the jackhammers in the morning & all I got from the front desk was, \u201c we can\u2019t control the outside construction, or the noise\u201d  I was then informed that the hotel was sold out, we could not switch rooms. Two days into our trip I\u2019m downstairs on my way up, I stopped by the desk, this hotel offers complimentary water, & I hear a nice young lady at the desk talking to a customer saying, \u201c Well let me help find you a room\u201d  I asked the nice young lady if the hotel was sold out, she answered no,  my wife convinced me to just relax and enjoy what we could, we were on vacation ,  I just do not like it when you are not told the truth, one night we could not access the rooftop bar it was booked for a private event. \nThe location of this hotel is great for experiences for broadway or Times Square you really are walking distances to both locations, you will be able to walk to many stores for shopping. And of course the staff at this hotel will help you navigate the subway system with expertise, helping you get to your locations you want to explore in New York. An Uber or Lyft ride leaving this hotel can be a challenge depending on what time you get a ride share. \nBack to Josh, out of all the hotels we\u2019ve been to, we have never received service as good at as attentive to the service we received from Josh, Josh helped us with everything he was able to, he explained the services offered to get back to the airport, asking us to research first other options based on price. We scheduled with Josh when we arrived at the hotel , we researched price options Josh is an honest man the service he suggested was just about as good as any other service and it was one thing less to worry about. \nThe service from Josh the highest 10 you can give.\nThe stay at the hotel a good 6 . I never read about the rooms facing the street on how noisy they could be, I never would have agreed to stay at this hotel had I known about the street noise, & not to high of a score about honesty. It seems like only Josh was the honest person we encountered with while we were there, I\u2019m sure others might also have great characteristics but nobody working at the AC Martial Hotel In Times Square was  as good as Josh, we watched him help many guests , giving his best effort in making sure every guest he helped had a good experience at that hotel.

We'd stayed in an AC Hotel in Mainz, Germany, and liked it, and we wanted to be in a pretty central location in NYC so that everything was in walking or cheap Uber riding distance.\n\nThe hotel is beautiful, new, modern, open -- a good impression upon arrival. The staff at check-in were really friendly. Our room wasn't available yet, and it was pouring down rain outside, so we opted to go to the bar on the main level to have a light lunch and a few birthday drinks. The food and drinks were phenomenal, but I was disappointed to find out when we were leaving that it was happy hour, and the bartenders didn't tell us. It's not posted on any sign or on the menu -- you literally have to ask them if it's happy hour and THEN they'll break out the happy hour options. That's how we found out -- we heard another customer ask. That's not typical of where I'm from, so I wouldn't have thought to ask.\n\nMy husband had asked for an upgraded room because he's a Marriott Bonvoy member,and at this hotel, an upgraded room is an accessible room--one for people with disabilities --- because these are the more spacious rooms and ones with balconies. They also have open closets, the open showers, lower countertops, etc. So if you don't like being in an accessible room, keep that in mind. It didn't bother us, and I liked having the open air balcony for the views and for some great Instagrammable photos\/videos.\n\nThe room has a very comfie bed, lots of pillows, shelving\/open closet, lots of drawers, a spacious bathroom with lots of counter space, great shower, good toiletries, hair dryer, big screen TV, a safe, coffee\/tea station, etc. I really liked the clean, modern lines of the room and minimalist decor. (I don't think there was a fridge -- I can't recall there being one.)\n\nOther than that, all the staff is great, they give you free bottled water at the front desk for your room (which is much appreciated). There is a Starbucks immediately across the street from the hotel. I never noticed any street noise in the room and we slept comfortably each night.\n\nThe hotel was in walking distance of Times Square, loads of restaurants and bars, Rockefellar Square, etc. We took an Uber to Central Park, to the NYC Comedy Club, and a few other spots that were a bit further away, but usually an Uber would \"be arriving in 1 minute\" or \"has arrived\" the second we ordered one. There are so many that you never have to wait!\n\nWe took the Vamoose Bus from Bethesda, MD, to NYC, and the dropoff\/pickup point is just a 3 or 4 block walk to the hotel, so that was also very convenient. \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the AC Hotel. If you want to be in the center of the action near Times Square, this is a great place to stay.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Despite being so close to Times Square, quieter street. The windows are great at blocking out street noise and noise from the hallway was minimal even with us being near the elevators. The bed was comfy for me but too soft for my wife. Shower took a minute to figure out. Everything was spotless and in working order except our window shade was broken - it still worked but had a huge tear in it along with it not being on its track when rolled up. The hallway was also missing some molding on the bottom. Mario at the front desk was friendly and helpful. Every time we left the hotel or came back, we were greeted by someone at the front desk.

A few drawbacks were the tinted door to the bathroom, the poor lighting, and the limited closet space; thus, the 3.5 star rating is appropriate.  But there\u2019s plenty of room to put your suitcases on a counter and retrieve items from there. The ironing board also converted to useful surface space. There were more than sufficient outlets for charging whatever you have. The window shades in the room, however, were installed upside down in my opinion.

We have not had a vacation since before the pandemic and really wanted to have a great experience. We chose this hotel because we had tickets to see Wicked and the location was perfect. From the moment we arrived in the lobby, we were greeted by Davon from the front desk in such a warm and welcoming way, we felt like we arrived at home. He was awesome! He recommended the Boqueria restaurant in the hotel, which we immediately went to after going to our outstanding room. We loved the modern decor and the floor to ceiling windows, rainfall shower head in the walk in shower, open closet area with glass-door fridge, the padded bench for our suitcases, plenty of wonderful lighting and the awesome TV with all of our streaming services on it. We got the city view room and loved looking at the lights and sights. We had never had tapas before and we absolutely loved the food at Boqueria and the service was outstanding. We could walk to see Broadway shows of course, perfect location. We also ate at the Castell rooftop lounge and had an awesome experience there as well. We reserved all our dining on the open table app. We also ordered online and picked up food. We used their limo service to get back to LaGuardia and they also helped us get cabs from the desk. Our entire stay was outstanding and we want to thank Davon and the entire staff for making it the best trip ever to NYC.

I choose it based on all the positive reviews AND the fact that it had 2 beds (oddly hard to find in NYC) in my price range.\nPROS: awesome front staff, friendly and helpful... no waiting at front with questions etc. Hotel was clean and modern, but basic. We had a coffee maker! Location, very near the action but not in it, so easy to have uber pull up or walk to corner for subway.  We went to 4 shows in 7 nights, walked every time.  Onsite restaurant was good for evening drink or bar snack, didn't eat any meals there.  \n\nCONS: I have nothing to compare this to in NYC but I was surprised by so many positive reviews, the room was ok, crazy small (that's NYC) and 2 beds no extra seating and no tub (which I really wish we'd had)  Cleaning was every other day and they missed a day so it was our first 4 days before room was clean.  Our hallway (floor 5) needed refurb, baseboard was missing.  I double checked we had late check out 2x when checking in and on last day, a hotel worker still walked into our room at 11:30am the morning we checked out.  One person told us we had until 2pm one 4pm so, I'm not sure.\n\nThe nice thing is that it is across from a low building so if you're on the city facing side even on the 5th floor we got sunlight streaming into our window, bad part we had no window sheer, so we had to use the blackout curtain or wave at the NY Times workers across the way.  If you're not in your room much this is a great place to sleep and location to be a tourist from.  \n\nIn general I would choose the next level of hotel in the future, for the cost this was very basic, limited lobby seating, no door man, small rooms.  One time a homeless person came into the hotel while I was in the lobby, the staff handled it well but they had to handle it.  The block it is on is also a little sketchy, we never had a problem but it was the only one in the Times Square area where we saw active drug dealing (at the corner McDonalds) and more panhandling.  It must have been outside of TS enough that I only saw 1 NYPD patrol in 7 days, we saw tons of them in other areas on other blocks, maybe AC could request more presence.

It was a sisters \/ cousins \/ nieces trip.  My daughter and I arrived at 10:00 am, and was greeted by Ricardo and Davon.  We needed two rooms, and asked if they could be next to each other AND if one could be ready for us to check in at that time.  Davon worked his magic and found us two rooms on the eighth floor, we were so appreciative after a 3:00 am wake up to get there.  Ricardo greeted us with his mega watt smile, and told us whatever we needed just to ask.  We asked about local attractions.  Davon and Ricardo both chimed in with many great suggestions.  At check out Joshua and Sonia were equally as kind.  Joshua asked how we were getting to the airport, and suggested a service.  Truly the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have encountered at a hotel in a very long time.  Each time we came into the hotel out from a day of exploring, we were greeted as if by an old friend.  They asked what we did, how our day was, and asked if we needed anything, then gave us a water bottle.\nThe hotel was centrally located.  We went to see Moulin Rouge at the Al Hirshfield theatre, and it was a close walk.  It is in close proximity to Times Square, and there are tons of great restaurants around.\nThe room was very modern, very clean, and by NYC standards, quite spacious.  If I ever plan on going to NYC again, I will stay here!\nThank you for the perfect stay.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Not only is the room well-appointed, but the balcony\u2026 it literally takes my breath away every time.

First of all, Tatiana. I believe Tatiana is the manager. She went above and beyond to help my best friend and I locate an item we wanted to use. Second, Davon. So hospitable and quite possibly the best customer service this side of the Mississippi. Third, Mario. I really enjoyed talking to him.

He made sure to address us every time he saw us. His warmness and outgoing personality made it wonderful to walk in each day. I also met the maintenance man there. He was extremely nice and let me know that what we broke (on accident) was fine because it was a child protection measure that was put in place to help families with little children. The location was perfect. I usually travel to NYC a few times a year and we usually catch the train in. With its prime location, we could get to the train station within 10 mins and from the hotel, to Times Square in 7 mins. They have several places around there to get some dim sum, pizza, and bagels. The location is safe and very convenient. I would def stay there again. I should also mention that the front staff was very accommodating and wonderful. They made you feel welcome by speaking to you the minute you walked into the hotel. The hotel has a bar on the rooftop and a restaurant downstairs.

I'm in NY almost once a month and it wasn't possible to book my two go to hotels so thought I'd try this property.  To begin with I hate the location, I knew that going in but I thought that there would be other redeeming qualities and it was only a 2 night stay so I could overlook it.  In order to get anywhere I want to walk to I have to walk past the craziness of the Port Authority and 42nd St, I usually stay more north and don't have to deal with this.  My biggest aggravation with the hotel is this...I am Gold Elite with Marriott.  I have a standing request on my profile for a high floor and have never had a problem at any hotel in NY having that request fulfilled.  This hotel has 21 floors, I was put on the 7th floor, this is not a high floor and to top it off my room was at the end of the hall directly overlooking the brick wall of a building.  I could not even open the curtains as you could see directly into the rooms of the other building.  I enjoy open curtains and sunlight, this really bothered me.  As gold Elite you are entitled to a room upgrade if available, I wasn't even looking for an upgrade this room to me was the bottom of the barrel.  The room itself was clean and neat but in my opinion it was dark, especially with having to keep the curtains closed and the furnishings were too stark and modern for my liking.  On the positive side the elevators were large and seemed to always be there when you needed one.  The lobby was very nice and the staff was cordial.  I tried it once but won't be back at this hotel.

As I checked in and wanted to double check, the front desk person said the room is booked only til 1pm. I explained the communication that led me to believe it is until 2pm, however the front desk person repeated that it is until 1pm, and told me 2pm late checkout is for gold members, and he generally had the attitude that seemed like he didn\u2019t want to help me or be empathetic of the situation, other than the fact that he mentioned, after I showed him the actual chat I believe, that they can hold the luggage after checkout. No apology for the miscommunication, the whole checkin experience felt generally unwelcoming due to the front desk person\u2019s attitude that felt rather not very responsive or empathetic. \n\nHowever, The room was nice, except for the fact that there were two bath towels instead of 3 I expected as I had put in the request for another one before the check in.

I will start by stating that the hotel was very clean (lobby, common areas, room upon arrival, etc.) and the location was outstanding based on our needs. We upgraded to get a room with a better view - and the room itself was really amazing.\n\nOutside of that, everything is completely uneven and in need of attention.\n\nThe front desk staff are casual and unprofessional. I spoke with them on four occasions and it was clear that some additional training is critical. Basic requests fluster them and go unresolved.\n\nI will not go into everything, but the major challenges were as follows:\n1) Room was never cleaned the entire stay (despite every 2nd day policy)\n2) Room cleaner got into a verbal altercation with a guest on our floor when they asked if their room would be cleaned at some point (didn't make me feel great about reporting the fact that our room was also overdue for cleaning)\n3) Was denied late checkout - and guest right in back of me (traveling with us) was granted late checkout without a single question asked - literally a wink and a nod\n4) Went back down next day and asked for late checkout, got it with absolutely no questions asked from a different front desk clerk (appreciated, but calls out uneven and randomness of process)\n5) Multiple issues with room key not working\n\nI will choose a different Bonvoy hotel next time. Not worth the hassle...but everything above is fixable.  Some small changes and this hotel could be a winner.\n\nTip: if you don't want to stare at an abandoned factory out your window, you will need to upgrade to city view (which basically gets you a \"view\" of the New York Times building).","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The rest not so much.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-06-13","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"The hotel sits in a prime location, and the building and rooms are very nice.  Unfortunately this is where Marriott gave up.\n\nCheck in was a nightmare.  I arrived in the morning after a red eye flight.  The front desk informed me that they had no rooms available due to the hour. Fair enough, it was a bit early, I forgave this even though they knew we would be early.  They said it would be roughly 45 minutes and that breakfast was available in \"the restraunt\" (more on this later).  I asked if it was complimentary due to the delay, the answer was no.\n\nAfter roughly 45 minutes of trying not to pass out in the lobby a large group of 20 people walks in looking to check in.  Surprise!  They have no delay and keys are handed out to the whole group!  I walk up, and ask for my room key, and am told it isn't available yet.  I get angry.  They say the previous group \"booked yesterday\".  My reservation was 3 days old.  I ended up waiting almost 2 hours falling asleep in the lobby before a room was provided.  Not a good start.\n\nThe hotel restraunt, that is literally in the lobby, with signs in the elevators and appears on the hotel website, \"isn't part of the hotel\".  If you are a Marriott rewards member you will receive no discounts, benefits, and collect no points for eating there.  Of course they don't point this out until you pay.\n\nThe rooms a very nice looking, and quiet, (as quiet as Times Square can be).  The beds seem to be aimed at Asian clientele as they are much like beds found at hotels in Japan.  They are basically futons, very firm.  If that's your thing great.  Its not mine.\n\nThe next morning I got into the shower and found that there was no soap or shampoo.  This hotel has gone with the \"three seashells\" motifs where they have 3 large pumps in the shower to save money.  Thats fine, I actually like this.  No need to create more waste.  The problem here is that  for both the shampoo and soap pumps to be empty it means the cleaning staff haven't checked them in WEEKS.  This gives me pause about the cleanliness of the rest of the room.  If they aren't checking the soap for weeks how often is the bedding being changed?","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After a LONG day, with a wet\/hungry toddler my patience had worn thin. I needed my room without another delay! My husband, staying sleeping at the hotel to prepare for his night shift, was completely disturbed by all the alarm bells. His rest was broken. Once I got to my room my 6 year old discovered a pair of glasses under the bed that didn't belong to anyone in my party. This made me feel that perhaps the room wasn't fully inspected or cleaned from the last guest. It caused immediate anxiety especially surrounding the Covid issue & cleanliness in common areas.

Soon after checking in, I was sent a text to see how the stay was, and I explained how our room was missing the bathroom door and how it was not ideal and unexpected and received no response back. After an additional text that I received after check out encouraging a review on Trip Advisor, I texted back that I would be leaving a review on the missing bathroom door, lack of customer service after being notified of the missing bathroom door, and lack of room maintenance. I received plenty of responses then. Very disappointed because this was a weekend of auditioning for my daughter and this situation proved very awkward, inconvenient, and a lack of privacy coupled with zero timely responses to remedy the situation.

Was there for a quick weekend to see The Music Man with my 90 year old mother after I bought tickets in Nov '19. Tried to reach Marriott in advance numerous times to make this a special weekend- even stopped into the hotel in person in Nov \u201821 to talk to them directly when I was in town. They would not commit to a specific room until 48 hours prior to our stay. Room was average, view was marginal, I got stuck in an elevator and had to pull the emergency alarm. The worst was the lack of accommodations for my mother. The handicap accessible room had no bars for the toilet or shower (she had to use her walker to brace herself to use the toilet).. The rooftop bar made her wait with her walker while we tried to get a table Sat night. (There is no preferential treatment for guests who are actually staying in the hotel vs. just visiting the lounge.) We were finally seated.....outside under heat lamps in 10 degree weather. They moved us to an indoor table after I made it clear how bad our stay had been. All I received from Marriott by way of customer service were texts about \u201chow sorry\u201d they were about my experience. Can't wait for the automated response to this review from the hotel saying \"We are sad to hear that our hotel did not meet your needs or expectations. Nonetheless, we are grateful for the opportunity to serve you.\" Will also be filing a complaint with the Dept of Justice about lack of compliance for a handicap accessible room.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

But overall, the AC hotel was not what we\u2019d expected. \n\nThe minimalist decor was so basic we didn\u2019t have enough space to hang our clothes on the rack. \n\nThe only option for food in the morning is \u201cbreakfast to go\u201d from  Boqueira. They don\u2019t serve patrons in the restaurant until 12 noon. We wish the website had clearly stated their new hours and policy, as it would\u2019ve influenced our hotel choice. We enjoy being served breakfast while on vacation, on premises. So this was a big take-away for our family. \n\nWe also weren\u2019t informed the room wouldn\u2019t be cleaned during our 4-day stay, So we had to stop at the front desk to request fresh towels. At that time, we were told we could request for the room to be cleaned the next day\u2026which we did. However when we arrived back to our room after a day out in the city, it hadn\u2019t been touched. It was disappointing they did not meet our request.\n\nSince it is so basic, it\u2019s a good place to stay for a single night. But at nearly $400\/night, the room rate  isn\u2019t basic!

Alan and Roberto did not disappoint!  They even helped me download a subway and train app that helped us navigate transportation.  Roberto gave my little girl candy the first day and we got hugs on other days.  They remembered our names and knew what coffee we liked from the Dunkin a few doors down.

Having visited NYC fairly often in the preceding 5 years, it was fittingly my first business travel destination.  I wanted to try a new Marriott property and the AC hit the mark in terms of location and amenities.\n\nLOCATION\nThe AC is between 7th and 8th on 40th St.  This location is convenient and walkable to Times Square, theater, and most of the office locations in the Midtown area.  There are multiple restaurants at different levels of class nearby, and you can reach the hotel in about 30 minutes from LGA with normal \/ low traffic.\n\nROOMS\nThis brand seems like Marriott\u2019s version of Starwood\u2019s Westin: it\u2019s more of a business traveler hotel in terms of minimalist luxury, function, amenities, and overall feel.  I advise choosing a high floor to avoid the typical NYC street noise, and it didn\u2019t matter to me that I faced an industrial building.  The nightstands are ample for electronics, and feature AC as well as USB.  The telescoping reading light and bedside lamps are a nice touch.  King beds are offered, but with the standard mush pillows that collapse to the height of a credit card when you put weight on them.  The bed is still comfortable but not like Westin\u2019s bed.  TVs in these rooms are huge, but this is fairly normal in modern times.  The desk is a bit small, and I\u2019d like to see AC use a smaller space for coffee and sundries (perhaps move them to the small microwave and refrigerator area) to leave more room for a workspace.  However, offering a microwave and refrigerator (with a glass door) at all is welcomed.  There is no closet, but plenty of room for business casual wear for 4-5 days.  The bathroom has a rainhead shower that also offers a handheld (in typical Westin fashion), and the counter space is excellent.  I never felt cramped in this bathroom as the designers thoughtfully used a pocket door.  Great job, AC!\n\nAMENITIES\nA rooftop lounge sits on the 21st floor of this building, and I heard it had a great view and bar, but never went up there.  The restaurant selection seems a bit poor, as the only breakfast option currently offers \u201ctakeout\u201d-type meals and no seated service.  While the lobby is quite large and nicely adorned, it seemed like an area where you weren\u2019t ever really going to hang out.  The fitness center, which is the priority for me with business travel, is actually quite good, and especially good in comparison to some of the other nearby Marriott properties.  Moxy Times Square has good equipment but hardly any space, and Moxy Chelsea has plenty of space but a lack of equipment.  AC seems to have prioritized both.  There are kettlebells up to 50 lbs (HUGE bonus), 6 cardio machines, and plenty of floor space to use dumbbells, mats, and any other equipment.  There\u2019s also a cable machine with several attachments, and a filtered water dispenser on the wall.\n\nSERVICE\nThe front desk at the AC did a nice job being warm and welcoming, especially in the wake of COVID19.  It was so long since I had checked into a hotel for a work trip that I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, especially in one of the most restrictive cities still remaining in the US.  The staff was helpful, but the text messaging that the hotel initiated seemed to be largely ignored.  They contacted me first about 30 minutes after check-in, to which I replied with a request for more bottled water.  It never came.  I repeated the request the next morning, and although they responded, nothing happened yet again.  It wasn\u2019t until I asked the front desk in person, and they immediately accommodated my request.  Front desk staff = good, digital staff = not so good.\n\nOVERALL\nI\u2019ll definitely stay here again, especially to return to the same office, only 10 blocks away.  It\u2019s not perfect, but the priorities for me are met.  It\u2019s not quite like a Westin although it tries to be similar \u2013 better in some ways, not better in others.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The best way I can describe this place is that it\u2019s a rooftop bar\/lounge\/cafe that happens to have a hotel underneath it. There\u2019s people coming and going in and out of the lobby all day that aren\u2019t even hotel guests, they\u2019re just going to the rooftop and take up the elevators for the people actually staying in the hotel. We waited on our floor for over 20 minutes on a Friday night for 6+ elevators to go because they were FULL of partiers (elevator says max 2 people for Covid but on average the rooftop patrons were filling up the elevator like it was nothing. At one point I counted 12 people). One of the three elevators was down which contributed to the delays but that was only announced to us via a memo that was left in the hotel room. That should have definitely been an email to hotel guests prior to arrival or a disclaimer on their website prior to booking.\n\nWe stayed in a top floor room with balcony. The room is small but I\u2019m learning that\u2019s normal for New York. I literally opened the door and the nightstand and bed is right next to it. First thing we noticed when we got off the elevator was that the hallways were dirty. This was typical of many floors that we saw as the elevator was going down and stopping. There was a cloth dinner napkin and trash on the balcony when we got there and the toiletries that are locked in a shower caddy were half used. I asked the front desk if they reuse the same bottles between guests and just refill them and the girl said no- and she did genuinely seem concerned and upset that it had happened and said she would send some new ones up immediately. 20 minutes later someone brought three bottles (shampoo, conditioner, body wash) and replaced the ones in the caddy. The \u201cnew\u201d bottles were clearly old used bottles they had just refilled to the top so I opted not even to use them. My partner seemed unmoved by that fact, but to me especially during Covid, the thought of reusing toiletry bottles after strangers in the shower is just ridiculous.

I ended up cleaning it and throwing the garbage out because I did not want to come back to a dirty room. The staff said it is because they did not want much contact because of the virus.\n\nI thought the front desk staff was a little abrasive. I had to check in before a friend who had gotten us the room and I practically got the third degree. I understand that there is a global pandemic going on but there is also basic customer service as well. I stayed at two other hotels recently upstate and they could not have been nicer.\n\nThe problem with the room was that everything was so low. For a tall person, this place is a nightmare.  The sink, toilet and beds are perfect if you are five feel tall. I had to lean down to do everything.\n\nThe upside is that the location by Port Authority was excellent and the views are amazing from the room.

To exacerbate the problem, the worst customer service experience.   I checked into my room.  First thing I noticed was a trash bin liner laying on the desk over the trash can.  Weird I thought, but maybe I\u2019d I have trash they would prefer I just use the liner.  \n\nThe next morning I realize no face towels in the bathroom and only one towel.   I call down to housekeeping and ask face towels be brought up and received them straight away.   I wash my face using my own face cleanser, get ready to take a shower and there is NO soap in the room.  No shower gel.   There is an empty space for a shower gel bottle but it is missing.  To body soap bars either.  Then I start thinking, trash liner on desk, missing towels, no soap....did my room even get cleaned \u2014 because at best they didn\u2019t FINISH cleaning. \n\nI called to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager on duty.  Maybe there was some weird protocol they didn\u2019t explain I thought.   The front desk clerk, Miranda, lets out a heavy sigh and said I can help you.   And I said oh are you the MOD and she said no but she was available to help me and I said ok, explained the situation and she starts responding that they don\u2019t clean the rooms daily because of COVID and I explain I am a new guest, this was how the room was sold to me and she sighs again and says well I will have someone send you towels, I said no they were already brought up to me.   I have questions about the cleaning protocols.  She sighs again and said \u201chow would I know about those?\u201d   To which I replied, I didn\u2019t assume you did which is why I asked to speak to the MOD and you wouldn\u2019t let me.   She said well he is busy and I said that is fine he can call me when he is free.  5 seconds later I get a call back from a man who identifies himself as the AGM and says he was listening to the conversation and I immediately said oh \u201cso you were not busy\u201d and he said he was listening while helping another guest.   I said oh so you weren\u2019t listening to the other guest and listening to me instead.   He got upset and I said I see where his front desk learned her bad attitude from \u2014 her AGM and he then proceeds to argue with me and when I ask about the cleaning protocols again tries to explain that they have limited housekeeping due to COVID.   \n\nI am so sick of hotels using this COVID excuse.   Either hire enough people to properly clean rooms and provide a clean room or DO NOT OPEN.  I have plenty of out of work friends in the hospitality industry who would love to go back to work.\n\nAnd listen to your guests!!! My room wasn\u2019t properly cleaned and stocked when I arrived!   This has nothing to do with daily housekeeping!   He refused to listen.   Was more interested in arguing with me than understanding me.   \n\nI immediately checked out and moved to another property.   If you stay at this hotel you do at your own health risk and God forbid you have a question as they will not listen and might just argue with you.   Bad service, uncaring, unsafe and staffed by unprofessional people from management on down.\n\nThankfully I hold Marriott\u2019s highest tiered loyalty level, called the concierge at the corporate reservations Ambassador desk and they were more than helpful in getting me out the rest of my reservation and rebooking me at a hotel that actually has good service AND cleans their rooms!    \n","travelDate":"2020-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

A few days later I received an email cancellation one week prior to my arrival date, I called the hotel to inquire about the reason for the cancellation but I was put on hold several times without any explanation, finally I asked the agent if he can simply reinstate my reservation but he stated in a rude manner that he won't do that as he didn't know the reason for the cancellation. I called Marriott Guest Relations department and they informed me that my Amex on file has expired but that's not a reason for them to cancel my reservation 1 week prior to my arrival without even calling me to update my credit card expiration date. At that point I thought it was just an usual incident and the rude agent was having a bad day so I made a new reservation which I eventually cancelled due to the riots that erupted in the area during that weekend. To my surprise, I found myself getting charged $1 for the first reservation that they cancelled without contacting me, then they charged me a full rate and taxes for the cancelled reservation. I called the hotel to speak to a manager and all I got was the runaround from the front desk agents who claimed there was no manager available. Finally I spoke to someone who didn't believe the reservation was cancelled before the deadline so I forwarded the cancellation email to him hoping he will issue a credit for the charges they applied on my account as I wasn't expecting anyone from the hotel to take ownership of the poor experience I've encountered before I even step foot at their hotel. Unfortunately, and until this moment I still haven't received a reimbursement for the charges on my card almost 3 weeks later.","travelDate":"2020-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Even though i was early, a room on the 18th floor was ready for me, and even though he did state that it was right next to the elevator, I said \"let's do it\".  The room itself is very small, even by NYC standards, but it was clean and quaint.  One very big complaint:  it's dark in the room because the lighting switches are just weird and hard to figure out.  \n\nThe roof top deck was very nice.  I had a couple of drinks up there along with a couple of sliders.

I was on the 15th floor with a city view. Typical NYC noise which subsided after 11pm. Lots of accessible plugs & ports, mini fridge with complimentary water, floor to ceiling windows with shades for sleep and privacy. Bed was more comfortable than other AC Hotels Izvestia stayed at. Bathroom has great counter space, fabulous shower with dual heads. They provide a hairdryer, Korres bath products, shower cap, cotton balls and q-tips. Check in was a breeze. Several hours ahead I received a text from Andrea my room was ready. Brian at check in was very personable and informative. They had their tree lighting when I was there which was a wonderful event. All the staff I encountered were so friendly and always smiling. Upon leaving and returning, Ricardo was there to greet me and chat. And he arranged for my transportation back to LGA in a nano-second when my Uber driver bailed on me. They can arrange car service if you need it and it\u2019s comparably priced to Uber, depending on time of day (most likely rush hour). Next door there\u2019s a cafe with reasonably priced, fantastic breakfast (eggs, omelettes, bagels, muffin, etc.)  Or a few blocks up, Best Bagel. If you\u2019re here for fun, you can walk to most places. If not, Subway, taxi or Uber is easy from here.

Complimentary water is a nice touch!  \nI booked a higher floor room to give my son a nice view for his first time. We were put on the 8th floor. I was hoping for higher, but learned that the high floors start at 6. That was the only room with a decent view they had available that day. It was ready, so we took it. \nI was messaged by Sharon the next morning to see how our stay was going. I told her about the floor confusion, but also told her we did like the room and amenities. She replied back to tell me she was holding a room coming available that afternoon and we could switch to be higher. We were pleased. It was an easy move. I didn\u2019t have to go down to the lobby. They came up to our room with the new room keys. And up we went to the 16th floor.  My son was happier. And that all I wanted. It was his trip. Thank you Sharon!\nThe guys at the front desk were so awesome too. They are all very friendly and helpful with questions. \nI would definitely stay here again. Great hotel.

Rooms are clean and modern.  Rooms are small but pretty standard-sized compared to similar hotels in NYC; my family of four did not have issues with space.  Staff was always professional and friendly.  I had to work after checking out, although there's plenty of space to sit down and work, I couldn't make any calls because there's not a quiet place in the entire lobby, there's very loud music everywhere. The \"meeting room\" was locked and was being used as a storage space.\n\nWe did have some issues with the service, that when looked at each instance individually they don't amount to too much and could be easily dismissed in many other cases, however, they did influence our stay in a negative manner so I am sharing them with you...\n\nWe kept having to ask for extra shower towels because we were only given two, even though my Marriott profile says to leave extra towels. Even when we asked sometimes the towels never arrived.\n\nI was charged for a meal that we never had.  First time I brought it up, the gentleman at front desk said they would have to review the receipts from the restaurant to make sure it wasn't me.  After it wasn't fixed and nobody checked, I brought it up to a different lady at the front desk, she said it was a default charge for incidentals.  After I argued why it said \"restaurant\" and not incidentals she finally took the time to check and removed it.\n\nTwo nights before our departure my daughter got sick and vomited in the toilet and the toilet got clogged.  I called the front desk at 11pm and said they would send somebody over to fix it, one hour later nobody had arrived, called again after midnight, while still tending to our daughter, and was told someone would come in ten minutes.  It was 1:30pm and nobody had been there to fix it.  After deciding it was too late for somebody to come I reached out and asked for somebody to come in the morning and that time they did.\n\nI have not received a survey from the hotel, so I have not posted this review on their website. I will if they do, but I'm not sure if I'll get a request for feedback.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

First time stay  at this property, but did enjoy dinner with few friends at their Boqueria tapas place on previous occasion. In general, I rather like AC Hotel concept, modern and minimalistic with Spanish flair.\nOne of the disadvantages of staying at this property is location.  It is right across the street from Port Authority Bus Terminal, and fairly close to Penn Station. What it really translates to is that it is not the most attractive city block. Moreover, and, that is alarming: it is not easy to have a business meeting there during the day. Few unsavory characters from across the street were wandering into lobby, got seated to rest, talked to themselves, etc....  Not the best smell. We were distracted.  You got the picture.  I am not making any political statements here, make your own conclusions.  \nRooms are a little too small, no upgrade this time, no view.  The rooms and bathrooms are functional and clean though.  The towels in the bathroom were cheap and bad quality. For this price could be better. Service is not bad, but rathe mediocre and indifferent.  Well, I burned my Marriott points, so it was free night for me, otherwise, I might be less charitable towards this hotel. It is definitely better than horrible Moxy Times Square, and can be 3-4 star rating, with improvements, and lower rates.

I travel often and as a result I usually stay at a Marriott property, but this one is the worst and needs someone to seriously train the employees. Upon checking in the front desk employee was trying to multi-task as she was checking me in. After she pulled up my reservation, she did not thank me for being a Gold member or even acknowledge that I was one. There was another front desk employee that was beside her checking in another guest where she acknowledged the guest's status (Gold), asked him did he need a late check-out and told him how many bonus points he would receive for his stay. I then asked the woman checking me in was there an upgrade available and she said there was, but I would need to come back later to access the room. I had plans on check-in day, however I walked around the city and came back at 2pm which is the time she indicated. Upon returning she indicated that the room was no longer available as it had been given to another guest. I asked her why she would tell me to come back at specific time, yet the room upgrade was given to someone else when she has my phone number to text me if it was available sooner than 2pm. She then began to explain the program to me and that the upgrades are not guaranteed, which I am fully aware of how the program works.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":12695463,"title":"A GREAT, new place to stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-08-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This is my first time staying in the AC Hotel Times Square, but it certainly won\u2019t be my last. Over the past 20-25 years, I have stayed in the Sheraton Times Square. Now with the Bonvoy merger, I found this alternative, staying on points; this hotel was significantly fewer points. The location for the AC is grand: steps away from the 42nd Street train station. Also I took the plane train and the E line from JFK, spending $7.75 to get to the hotel and avoiding all traffic! It was so easy to do! The only challenge was hauling my suitcase up two flights of stairs upon arrival at the 42nd Street stop, but it was not a big deal. The hotel does offer a car service to the airports, and my daughter, who came in to spend the weekend with me during my trip, used it to get back to LaGuardia. I wish we had known about this for her arrival! It is only $55, a flat rate to the airport (plus tip), which is significantly less than Uber\/Lyft (depending on the day, time and weather, of course). She arrived later than we anticipated, and we had a show to go to, so we took the bellman\u2019s advice and grabbed a slice at the 99 cent slice place just a couple of doors down; we could have gone to Kiss my Slice if we were walking the other way \u2013 both places convenient, cheap, and delicious for a quick slice. I got a meal from the Hummus and Pita restaurant on the corner of 40th and 8th Avenue, again just steps from the hotel, and took it back to my room to eat one afternoon. That was delicious!  In addition to the convenience factor, the hotel has first rate service! Ari at check in walked me to my room, showing me how to use the app on my phone to access the elevator and then to open my room door. Ricardo and Warner, the bellmen, were so helpful and kind and professional! It seems that \u201c110 percent\u201d is the motto for these service providers, and it makes for a great experience. The housekeepers left everything as I requested, and the room was always made up quickly. One tiny inconvenience for a green situation: the AC goes into dormant mode without movement, and this cannot be changed. I asked the front desk and the maintenance man who came up to my room. I kept my bathrobe on the bed and waved it up in the air whenever I woke up in order to get the AC to come on ; ) When we traveled to Europe last year, all of the hotels had this feature, but we could override it by inserting our room key into a slot in the thermostat. I wish the rooms had this feature, but it was not terrible. The bath products are so nice, and the shower is strong, coming from a rainshower faucet. So nice! The room also has plenty of USB ports, and it has a small refrigerator! SOOO nice for our leftovers and to cool our water jugs overnight. A little nicety: the hotel offers FREE small bottles of water both in the room and in the lobby. Many guests were offered cold water upon arrival and\/or when returning from a day out on the town. In the mornings, they also have complimentary newspapers: WSJ, NY Times, and\/or USA Today. Food carts are set up just outside of the hotel on the NY Times side of the street, and I grabbed a smoothie and a bagel in the mornings. My daughter and I checked out the rooftop bar -- very pretty, but very pricey. We went down to the Spanish tapas restaurant next to the hotel instead and enjoyed some delicious sangria for a much better price, sitting at the pretty bar.  Overall I was very very impressed with the AC Hotel Times Square.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Besides the great staff at the front desk I was not impressed. The ambiance and the quality of room cleaning did not resemble a \u201c4.5 star hotel\u201d. Our bathroom was not cleaned, they left us with no toilet paper and for some reason the only thing they did in our bathroom was leave us with excessive amounts of shampoo and conditioner. I felt like the hotel was done on a low budget. The towels were very thin, our door wouldn\u2019t shut properly and some of the light switches wouldn\u2019t work. On the other hand the employees at the front desk were excellent! Every night when we came In they were very friendly and went out of their way to do everything they could to make your stay better.

I was told the room needed to be checked and I could go have a seat and the reception clerk would bring the key over in a few minutes.  I waited a 1\/2 hour and the woman had disappeared.  I went over and inquired about the room and was told it was ready. Extremely irritated that I was basically forgotten about.  My overall observation is it is definitely a 3 star.  The reception desk is not very friendly to guests whether they are checking in or out.  The location is okay and the hotel is clean.

Like someone else said, it's Times Square...On top of that this hotel is located across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Right there should give you a good indication of what you are going to encounter once you walk out the front doors. Do yourself a favor, if you want a central \"Times Square\" location stay over by Bryant Park. A few blocks to the east but honestly a world away! As for the hotel itself, all the staff that we encountered were very friendly except for one front desk person. The rooms were on the smaller side for NYC and after two nights we were definitely feeling cramped. Although clean and \"sleek\" they did feel somewhat cold (no cheap slippers in our room either for the tile \"wood\" floors.) Could never get the temperature right, either too hot or cold. The glass bathroom door rattled every time it was opened\/closed not ideal for the middle of the night when sharing a room. Our glass shower door never stayed closed and would always roll open as well. The rooftop bar is small and if you are traveling with kids they're only allowed up there between 4-7pm. The room did have plenty of USB outlets and nice reading lights. Hydration stations were also a nice touch but not located on every floor. Odd number rooms are in the back of the hotel, small windows over-looking brick wall. We were moved to the front, same size rooms just felt more open with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the New York Times Bldg. The rooms in the reviews with the slanted floor to ceiling windows were located on the top two floors and seemed to only be king. Overall good \"basic\" modern\/clean accommodations on the small side with a few minor flaws... if you really need to be in that area.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I typically keep it low key because travelling and staying in hotels often is no longer exciting for me.  For this hotel chain, I am currently classified as an Ambassador Elite (Lifetime Platinum Elite).  I checked in the day after the city experienced a power outage.  They advised me when I had checked in that there was no wifi\/internet, cable TV and the elevators were organized by calling a head as they had to be manually controlled.  I understood this and had no issue with it.  I was offered a complimentary coffee when I checked in but it was so hot outside I asked for a raincheck.  The room was clean, bright, modern and very functional - no complaints.  I was informed of the location of the closest Starbucks so I could spend the afternoon and get my work done (because they had wifi).  After spending 5 hours at Starbucks, I returned back to the hotel to grab some dinner.  I was informed when I returned that the wifi\/internet, cable and elevators were at the same status.  I had asked about getting my cup of coffee and was told it was $4 ... no exceptions.  The hotel is running a Nespresso machine behind the reception counter; the paying guests have been inconvenienced to work elsewhere if they need internet and going the extra mile of handing someone a cup of coffee was out of the question.  I paid the $4. More annoying was that the hotel offered no type of compensation for the inconvenience caused by the outage and the duration of impact to the paying guests.  The only individual that offered any type of professional service was when I checked in.  I stayed at the hotel for 5 days.  Any time I had approached the front desk to ask any question there was either no one present to ask or they were too interested in their own conversations I was invisible to them or if they did ask me if they could be of assistance their attention span was less then 5 seconds.  One morning it was raining so hard, I had asked about the best place to catch a taxi for myself and 2 co-workers.  The person I was talking to started to tell me and half sentence was distracted by another co-worker and actually walked away from me.  I kept telling my co-workers that joined me on this business trip that I would write a bad review.  This was our 3rd trip to NYC in 3 months and we all agreed the worse hotel when it came to service\/friendliness, but agreed the rooms were good.  Today, the reason I am actually taking the time to write the review is because I received an email about a returned package.  When I checked in, I had informed them that I was expecting a package.  Every day after work, I had asked about the package and was told it never arrived.  When I checked out, I meant to call the sender to let them know but time got away from me and I forgot.  Today, the email I received informed me that my package was returned.  When I contacted the sender the reason they were given and I quote \"The receiver determined this is a duplicate product order and has refused the delivery. \/ The package will be returned to the sender.\"  I checked out on July 18, this message was given by the hotel to UPS on July 24!  I had to spend an hour on the phone to explain that this was not me and I wasn't even at the hotel at that time.  I also had paid $20 for express shipping to ensure that the package would arrive on time.  According to the UPS slip, the package arrived on July 15 when I was actually at the hotel.  They gave me the tracking details and the package was actually at the hotel on July 15.  I had to now convince the sender to reimburse the $20 shipping fee in addition to the return of the package since it was not me who returned the package.  Service speaks volumes to how people react and feel about a hotel stay - I hope someone learns something from this.  I definitely will not return to this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'll stay there again.\n\nThe rooms in the back face another building so it was always dark looking and no view...but it was quiet. Don't know if the rooms facing the front had street noise or not, but I can assume much brighter  Bathroom sink is very shallow (not a problem) and the faucet is short.

Nosso quarto era composto por cores neutras, mobili\u00e1rio elegante, pisos de madeira, ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o natural, um o\u00e1sis de design moderno com uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o sofisticada de espa\u00e7o aberto muito agrad\u00e1vel.

Lembrando que os quartos s\u00e3o acess\u00edveis \u00e0 mobilidade. O acesso \u00e0 Internet de alta velocidade \u00e9 gratuito. A roupa de cama e as toalhas eram extremamente macias, era quase uma miss\u00e3o imposs\u00edvel conseguir levantar daquela cama confort\u00e1vel no friozinho de NYC. O caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 tem uma taxa de 30 d\u00f3lares por pessoa.

So I unloaded the family and six bags of luggage because there is also no bellman or luggage assistance after 11 PM. Once the bags and family were inside I had to \u201cself-park\u201d which meant I had to drive to a parking garage two blocks away in seedy section at 11:30pm and walk back to the hotel.  The next day we were checking out and I had to walk back to the garage and wait 40 minutes for my car and then drive back. Whole process took over 1 hour with traffic.

I received an upgrade as a result of my Elite status and got a very large room with a sofa and sizeable bathroom.  The modern bathroom is beautiful and the room itself is extremely functional with a nice desk, plugs everywhere, good hairdryer, nice area to open my luggage, good lighting and \u2014 last but not least \u2014 great crisp sheets and feather pillows. The vinyl wood flooring was also a nice change from carpet. My biggest complaint? Everything, and I do mean everything, is a shade of depressing brown, with not a single splash of color anywhere. I really suggest putting some fake plant life in the room just to make it less drab. Also, there was no room service but that is to be expected at this price point. The gym was nice except there is no full length mirror so you can\u2019t see yourself doing certain exercises. The Spanish restaurant did have nice croissants for breakfast.  I wish the hotel\u2019s  grab and go had fruit. I did not have a chance to check out the cool rooftop bar as this was a quick trip. My conclusion is that this hotel is an excellent value and spotlessly clean with good service, but luxurious it is not.

The hotel is very modern and clean. It is well located for all the touristy bits. The main reason I stayed was one minute walk to my office.\n\nThe rooms are pretty small even for NY standards. You walk in and are almost standing on the bed. My room was located directly opposite the lift so could be a little loud at night with people coming back. Housekeeping is not the best here. Most days my towels were not done and I never had toilet paper replaced. On my final day I actually had to go and ask house keeping for toilet paper after they cleaned my room. The room has plenty of plug sockets and USB plugs. The lighting isn't great and you need to use your bed lamps. The TV is very large and there is quite a bit of wardrobe space. The actual bed is large and very comfortable. \n\nThe wifi is good in all areas of the hotel. The roof top bar is not great and but you do get a free drink token when you check in.

The location is excellent.  It is a 10-15 minute walk from Penn Station directly up 8th Avenue.  It is close to the New York Public Library, Bryant Park, and, according to my daughter who lives in NYC,  many trains.  It is obviously near 100's of fine restaurants, but cheap places like Dunkin Doughnuts and Kiss My Slice, are a minute's walk.  \n2.  Check-in was a touch slow, but the clerk was friendly and gave us water and a complimentary drink ticket.  \n3.  My room is very sleek and modern with a large window facing 40th Street.  I don't really like the sliding glass door for the bathroom.  It saves space, but it does not afford privacy.  I wish the room had an overhead light.  The shower is fantastic.\n4.  The exercize room is located below the lobby, and it is very nice.  The bikes seem a bit balky, but you have many choices.\n5.  The elevators really zoom, but I periodically forgot to use my room key, and the elevator will not move without it.  It is a good safety feature.\n6.  I did not visit the rooftop bar, but my daughter and I had had drinks in the tapas restaurant in the lobby.  It is a touch swanky for me, but the beer was excellent and the server polite and friendly.\n      I hope to stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We didn't eat at either of the restaurants but I appreciated the little coffee maker in the room so I could make tea. The room was clean and comfortable, but the best part was the engineered-wood floors!  No scuzzy disgusting hotel carpeting where you get your socks black just by walking on it.

I remember staying here since it opened and I am always pleasantly surprised with the incredible people who work here, the design, hotel cleanliness, space, modern touch, rooftop, restaurant, and all of their amenities. \n\nStaff:\nTo Lynn, Sharon, Jeremy, David, Benny, Sofia, Ricardo, Angelo and the many others whose names escape me right now - THANK YOU. Every time I stay with you, you guys make me feel like I'm at home. From upgrading my rooms, to helping me with my bags, directions, food recs, and more, you always make me feel so comfortable and at home. I was sick one day, and Lynn and Sharon sent cookies, water bottles, lavender pouches and a sweet card to my room! So kind.\n\nDesign:\nThe architecture and modern design is beautiful and the hotel is one of my favourite in the city. New York can be super daunting in how big everything is. This modern marble with hints of greenery hotel is beautifully designed and you'll feel super relaxed.\n\nRooftop & Restaurant:\nCheck out the rooftop and the restaurant which are both gorgeous. Order the \"Pulpo\" or grilled octopus at Boqueria - so good! Miguel at Boqueria is the coolest barman too - he'll hook you up!\n\nLocation:\nTimes Square and 1 min (not even) away from the subway, and NY Port Authority (buses). Perfectly well located! \n\nExtras:\nLavender pouches are given to guests and eucalyptus towels to relax. \n\nI honestly can go on and on about this hotel. You have to check it out. If you're platinum - try one of the suites either with the balcony or the ones with large windows with James Bond blinds. Amazing.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

First time staring at an AC Brand Hotel and I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was activated and the staff friendly. The location was prime but set back from the craze of Times Square. We were upgraded to a city view room that had nice large windows that faces towards the NYT building. The room was cozy, but have everything you need. I personally liked how the entire room was flooring and not carpet. Made it feel larger and modern. The bathroom had a great shower head and korres brand products. My only complaint was the breakfast at Boqueria. The service was terrible and the food even worse. Stay away from there and head to another spot in the city to eat. On the contrary to Castell rooftop which had great drinks with awesome views. So to summarize, great spot to rest your head in an excellent location.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

High ceilings, spacious, pleasing to the eye. I walked up to the desk to check in, the two desk associates (man and woman) were involved in happy chat and didn't pay me any attention even though I was standing there with a large suitcase and made direct eye contact with the man who went right on with his conversation. So I said \"Hi, is this where I check in?\" The man, who's name is  Christopher, replies, \"yea, what's your last name\"? I have to tell you, I have stayed at many Marriotts (I'm a rewards member) and this is definitely the worst welcome I ever received which is surprising considering this is New York City. \n\nSo anyway, the elevators were fast and well lit, the room was clean with a simple yet modern decor. The television was pretty large for a hotel and the bed was very comfortable. \n\nOn my second night, I went out for dinner and Ricardo was very helpful in getting me a cab and making sure everyone in the lobby was taken care of. He's awesome. There was also a woman with blond curly hair who was also very attentive and pleasant. I regret that I didn't get her name. \n\nI was disappointed that the TV didn't always work. It would be a scramble of pixels with audio. I tried calling the front desk about it but there was no instructions on how to dial the front desk and dialing \"0\" and even dialing the general number for the hotel got me nowhere. I ended up watching Netflix on my phone. At least the wifi worked. \n\nUpon checkout, I was ignored yet again by Christopher and helped by Sharon who I told about the TV issue and showed the picture I took. She seemed genuinely concerned and apologetic and asked me to email the picture to her which I did right on the spot. After checkout, Ricardo once again held the door opened and offered to help with transportation. The next day, Sharon sent an email apologizing once again for the TV issue and assuring me that they are addressing it. I appreciated that very much.\n\nGiven the inconsistent customer service and the price, I would likely consider a different option if ever I need to stay in the city for work. I've grown accustomed to a certain level of service from Marriott that just missed the mark in areas where it's too easy to get it right (like stop your conversation and attend to arriving guests) . This is what kept me from rating this hotel a 4 or 5 though the potential is definitely there. \n\nI should also mention that my colleagues thought the rooftop bar was great though I didn't get a chance to make it up there. Also a prime location in the heart of the times square action.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel has been open since the spring and the staff seem very proud of the ambience of the property. I found the staff friendly and helpful, the room more than adequate size for NYC with a modern look and feel.  There is a small fitness centre with nice modern equipment that is in good working order.  It is located in the basement of the hotel so no natural light but lots of connectivity for streaming devices. \nWe had breakfast in the hotel each morning and it was reasonably priced.   There were wifi issues that were not resolved within an 18 hour period but apparently the issue was not local but network driven - an unfortunate inconvenience for international visitors not wanting to incur roaming charges for devices while in the hotel.  On the third night the fire alarm went off at 2:45 am. After about 5 minutes of bell running the fire and safety officer did announce over the intercom that there was no need to vacate. However the alarm re-engaged three additional times and we were without the benefit of a follow up voice to confirm that we were all safe. Word of mouth spread to say it was an all clear - a very good thing - but it was a tense 15 minutes in the middle of the night. I recommend the property and commend the staff that we interacted with - we found them warm, friendly and helpful. ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

While you could hear the occasional sound from the hall, it was minimal.  \n\nThe only negatives I would say are the lights.  When coming into the room (which was dark), the wall light switches did not turn on any of the lights except for the one near the door. We even hit the switches between the bed but that didn't turn the light on.  Only after using our phones did we see the small black switches on the side.  Maybe we were just dense but the wall switches should turn on the lights.  The other negative was when my friend in an effort to find a light switch opened the area where the air filter was for the air conditioner.  Apparently the filter was very dirty and was due for a change.\n\nThe location of this hotel was great.

The check in was easy.  We got room 508 with the view overlooking the street.   I was worried this hotel would be noisy because it\u2019s close to Times Square however it wasn\u2019t so bad.   On Tuesday morning when everybody was back at work I have to say it was a bit more noisy earlier than expected however I still had a good night sleep.   From the moment you walk everybody is extremely nice and helpful.   One day early morning I was coming out of my room and there was Chinese rice on the floor next to my room, it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight!  I told the staff at reception, went for my breakfast and when I came back to the room probably about 30 minutes later it was all cleaned up!   They were grateful I told them and the staff took care of it immediately; I definitely was impressed.  The rooms are bit small, comfortable beds and clean.   Nice size bathrooms with two shower heads.    Overall I was very happy with my choice as this hotel is located in a great location if you are coming to see shows.   There is a staff member that I really appreciated; her name was Sharon.   She helped me with a lot of things, like setting up my Uber application and teaching me how to use it.    She also gave me many suggestions of things to do.    I must let you know that they have a beautiful terrace on the 21st floor; after 7pm it is only for 21 and older.

The hotel has recently opened so everything is quite clean and fresh. Decor is minimalist and tranquil - lots of brown, cream, and grey. Room is decent size by NYC standards, as is the bathroom (shower only, but a large showering area.) Korres amenities in the room. No carpet on the floor (yay!), which added to the modern feel.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if all the rooms are the same way but ours, which faced 40th, had an entire wall of glass as the exterior wall. This lent the room a very open feel and I loved the floor-to-ceiling glass. There are two shades, one sheer and one blackout, that operate electronically and will cover the entirety of the glass. Really great feature! \n\nRooftop bar is excellent. Carefully hand-crafted cocktails (NYC hotel prices, $18), and just an all-around wonderful space to be in. It manages to be open and intimate at the same time.\n\nService at the front desk and the rooftop bar was very good.\n\nThe location is great for the Times Square area. You\u2019re just steps away but it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the madness. And there was almost no street noise at all.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

And during the call there was definitely a feeling I was inconveniencing them.  The next day I referenced the issue again and while the person was nicer, it was too late.\n\nIn terms of security I always worry when a hotel in a city like NYC, Chicago, Boston etc. doesn't require a key card to get to hotel floors.  If I walked through the lobby 7-8 to get in the elevators, at least 50% of the time no-one noticed me.  Plus having a bar on the top floor is nice, but when people in the bar who aren't hotel guest can get straight to someone's floor its an issue.  I am fine but wouldn't want my wife or daughter staying there.\n\nThat being said location is amazing and the rooms are very nice.

The property itself is fairly new and is modernly aesthetic in true AC style.   My room was small (perhaps normal for NYC) which featured a \"great view\" of garment sweatshop in an adjacent building.\n\nThe gym had enough equipment and free weights for a decent workout.  Thumbs up to the filtration machine there where I could fill up my shaker bottle with fresh water (I don't trust the stuff that's been sitting around in a tank).  Another positive here was the rooftop lounge \"Castell\" which I found to be a classy place to cap off the night, taking in the skyline with a Smokey Manhattan.\n\nUnfortunately, they have unbelievably slow internet and to make matters worse, the \"high-speed\/enhanced\" internet was down.\n\nDesk staff I spoke to could do better with their customer service skills.  They were apathetic when I raised issues with the enhanced internet and a billing mistake.  Additionally, they charged me for a market item I was told was free due to my Marriott Platinum status.\n\nOverall, it's a decent hotel in a good location.

We had our choice of Marriott hotels in the city, as well as other hotels since we also have Hilton Honors, hotels.com, IGH points,etc.  This hotel is in a great location, brand new and very modern.  We had tickets for several shows so we wanted to be near the theatre district.  That said, I will never stay in the theater district again unless I have tickets.  It is a zoo.  The AC is so new and modern that the amenities that are missing are truly notable.  The elevator system is not key operated.  Anyone can go up and down.  Glaring oversight in my opinion.  Check-in was smooth and very welcoming.  The lobby area is large and moderately comfortable.  It is clear they don't want you hanging here for long.  The revolving door should have censors for smooth and easy movement.  The automatic doors worked about 50% of the time.  There is a very small lobby shop, but with a Walgreens, CVS and Duane Reade (also now Walgreens) on every street corner, there is no need to overspend here.  Our room was very pretty. 1712 overlooks a number of office buildings and hotels.  The floor to ceiling slanted window allowed great light and we could see the Empire State Building Spire change colors at night.  It would be great if you put a cushioned built in bench along part of that window so your guests can just stare out at the world while sipping coffee or wine!  Speaking of coffee, Marriott could have spent a few extra dollars and put a Nespresso machine in the room instead of a cheap knock-off. Minimal storage is available in the room, though the room is a nice size.  There is a fridge.  There are tons of outlets and USB plugs so bring your electronics!  Forgettting a wall charger is no problem. It isn't a room that is set up for a work situation, but there is a small desk.  How about a comfortable chair to sit in?  How about 2? The desk chair is a cheap joke and the other chair is also cheap and small.  The bed was comfortable and there were real pillows!  The floor is laminate wood.  Good-bye gross carpet. The black out curtain and opaque shade are electronically controlled.  There are no cords for kids to get tangled in.  The bathroom is a nice size with lots of counter space.  There is no tub, a plus as far as I am concered.  Why they chose to go with the little bottles of shampoo, conditioner, etc. is a mystery.  They hold very little product and how many are recycled, refilled, etc.?  I would much prefer the large shower wall installed pump style product dispensers as you can get as much as you need and the waste is minimized.  That said, the hotel uses Korres products which is very nice.  The AC is powerful, but it blow straight across the room from two vents at ceiling height. The room was always cool, but having the air pour on you isn't pleasant. There is a lovely rooftop bar and lounge with very few wine and beer choices and even fewer bar food choices.  Bring your own up.  The restaurant Bouqeteria is accessible from the hotel.  It is an excellent restaurant.  We actually ate at the one in Flatiron.  I wouldn't stay here again, but ony because I like something a little more upscale.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room with two double beds didn't feel cramped even though it was occupied by four people. We had a room with floor-to-ceiling windows that made it seem like even more space. With the blackout shade down, you couldn't notice any light from the outside. The bathroom was a nice size as well. The hotel was sold out several of the nights we were there (we stayed for 8) but we only experienced a line at the elevator one time. The staff was some of the nicest I have ever experienced in NYC. From the moment we stepped out of our ride until we walked out at the end of our stay, they made us feel welcomed, responding to most of our requests or concerns quickly and competently. \n\nI would have given this hotel an excellent rating if it hadn't been for one major issue. I reserved a high floor room (as I usually do when in NYC), paying extra for the room. In a hotel with 17 floors of rooms (floors 2 through 19), I was placed on the 6th floor. In my stays in NYC, I have never been placed on so low of a floor. When I questioned an evening staff member what is considered a high floor when a guest requests one, I was informed it was 14 and above. That didn't seem correct to me, so the next morning I asked again at the desk. A very helpful person said that 10th and above were considered high floors. He said he would have the manager contact me to see about changing my price since I wasn't on a high floor. The operations manager attempted to call me in the room but we couldn't see that we had a message (you have to be standing above the phone to see it's flashing). When I finally spoke with her via my cell, she informed me that at this hotel high floors are 6th and above. She would not agree to adjust my bill but did offer to move us to another room (after we've been in the room for 6 nights and only two nights remaining). The 6th floor of a 17 floor hotel is a high floor? That means that only 4 floors are not considered high floors. Or - to put it another way - 3\/4 of the floors are high floors. \n\nIf you're wondering why I didn't say something when we picked up our keys (I checked in via the app), I thought I had made a mistake and not requested a high floor. It was when I had to request towels via the app (4 people in the room and there were only 3 towels) that I saw I had requested a high floor. If this is truly the policy for this hotel, I'm disappointed in Marriott. Even the DoubleTree down the street starts their high floors at the 8th floor.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Nice and new near Times Square. Our favorite is the Marriott Marquis but last minute high pricing dissuaded us from staying there or other favs. This one is nice and new and greeted warmly by Lynn at checkin, Loved being able to check in early before 1PM. Rooms are quaint and clean. Nice touch with the two small cold waters in the room frig. Safe in room, small area to hang clothes with iron and board. Beds new and comfortable.  Didn't use the wifi. Great location as subway is within steps and saw lots of philly fans probably going on the 7 train to citifield. We walked to numerous dining favorites and the theatre.\n\nNow the not so good. Very noisy. Room walls seem to be paper thin and hallway and other room noises will be heard. Trucks outside could be heard very early and we were on the 10th floor.\n\nMost aggravating is the rooftop bar area. Very nice and one reason we picked this. Went after a show on Wednesday night and got there at 1053PM to be told they already had last call and bar was closed at 11. They were certainly in a hurry to close up. Would have been nice to have a drink on a beautiful night in there rooftop area. Came directly from our broadway show and this was\/is a negative to not have access in NYC to at least midnight. We travelled over to the Refinery Hotel Rooftop. It was very nice, busy and maybe a consideration for next stay. Seems strange too as the AC hotel TV states their rooftop is open to 2am everyday. They should change that if only on weekends and consider what their losing in revenue on weekday nights in the summer. Come on , its NYC and midnight closing would work much better for those coming from broadway for one drink nightcap.\n\nThe shower, new-yes, pretty- yes, effective, not so much. It seems to drizzle out of the shower head. Not specifically a- this hotel-  issue, seems to be an industry wide issue now of saving water and most we've stayed in problem, but jeez, you can't find nozzles that give off some pressured spray. \n\nFor what we payed think with all the competition we'll try another.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We chose a package with breakfast and every day we ate at Boqueria, a small spanish restaurant in rhe lobby.

The hotel has been open for 3 months (pretty sure its a new building no less).  This is a new \"boutique\" brand of Marriott.  It is not full service, nor are the rooms sized such, so don't expect a lot of amenities.  My second stay at an AC Marriott. Worth it though. I've stayed at Marriott properties well over 500 times in the last 5 years, along with other brands.  This hotel is VERY well located with many subway lines just a hundred feet away (give or take).  Times Square\/Theater district just a couple of blocks away.  Expect some city noise but it was not as bad as it could have been (try to get a higher level floor for this reason).  Very clean hotel (which is not the case with the subways and city in general...but hey!  It's NYC).  Staff was very helpful with solicited and unsolicited recommends for food.  Hip Spanish tapas\/Catalan restaurant\/bar on the ground floor had a wonderful paella.  Roof top lounge (17F) was a great retreat at night.  Kung Fu Kitchen is around the corner for really seriously fantastic Shanghai foods (get the soup buns aka Xiaolongbao \u5c0f\u7b3c\u5305).   Difficult to think of criticism...but here it goes.  Charged $120 for \"extra person\" but had to request additional hangers, and daily requested extra towels, water, shampoos etc.  Sink is a nice visually but too shallow for my ladies morning and evening rituals.

Location is great. Hotel is located across from NY Times and Muji. Hotel is within walking distances to Port Authority Bus Terminal, Times Square, Theater District and the NYC MTA (A, C, E, N, Q, R, W, 1, 2, 3, 7). Hotel is closest to the subway entrance and exit located on W 40th St & 8th Ave SE. Front desk agents are very courteous and helpful. My room (on 6\/F) is available before 3 pm, which is great. Hotel does offer to store your belongings if your room is not ready and also after you checked out. King bed is comfortable. Comforter does not even has it own duvet, the hotel only place a flat sheet on top on the comforter. In-room AC is quiet and works really good. The room itself does not have enough lighting. After turning on all the lights, room still seem dim. The in-room fridge works nicely. Hotel gives guest 2 small bottles of water in the fridge. The bathroom is pretty spacious with a shower (no bathtub). Hotel offers the usual soap bar, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower cap and shoe sponge in the bathroom. Complimentary slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste is available upon request. Water pressure for the shower is very, very weak. Toilet is not good because does not flush well. If you dump too much toilet paper into the toilet or use it for anything more than number one (peeing), it will clog the toilet. It may take a while until a service engineer come to help you resolve this plumbing issue because they only have one service engineer in this hotel with 200+ room. If you have to use the toilet for number two, I suggest using the toilet located on the \"C\" floor next to the water fountain or dispenser. The automatic Toto toilets in those restroom works a lot better than the one in the guestroom.  Housekeeping did not do a good job in cleaning the room because I found cream and chocolate on the window trim or molding behind the curtain. Bed is almost right again window, so it is not easy to open and close the curtain.  Overall, my experience staying at the AC Hotel by Marriott New York Times Square is disappointing. I won't stay there again and do not recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived early around noon and we tried to check-in. The room was not ready, which was fine, as we knew that check-in time was 3pm. I asked that we store our luggage. The man at the front desk said that they could text us when the room was ready, which I thought was great. I gave him my number and he said, oh no sorry, we don't call non-US numbers. Okay, fine. We came back at the hotel at 3.30pm, the room was still no ready. The lady at the front desk said it would take another 30 minutes. We did not want to wait as we had to be somewhere, so the lady said that they could text us once the room was ready. I said that her colleague mentioned that because I had a European number, they couldn't reach me. She replied that it wasn't a problem. Why did we lose time coming back to he hotel to be told that the room was still not ready if someone competent could have just texted us?! So, we left and it was a good thing we didn't wait at the hotel as the room became ready at 6pm!!!!! This is totally unacceptable, especially when you've had long travels and you just want to freshen up. \n\nThen, once in our room, we noticed that the room had been cleaned really quickly. You could see hair on the floor, the corners had not seen a vacuum in a while, the sink was already stained although it's a new hotel. The cherry on top was when I pulled down the duvet, the bed sheet covering it slipped and the duvet was clearly stained with makeup (foundation). That was absolutely gross as I am positive that the duvet had not been changed from the previous guest. They came to change it, but it was 10pm, we were tired and were looking forward to some down time. \n\nThe other drawback was the fact that the room was not well soundproofed. Given the location, it's fine that you hear what is going on outside, but it's not acceptable to hear everything that is going on in the hallway. \n\nHighlights: \n- great location, walking distance to Times Square, Bryant Park, Macy's, etc.\n- rooftop terrace is really nice \n- Boqueria is really good with great staff\n\nI cannot recommend this hotel, there are so many great options in NYC, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Other reviewers have said that the rooms are small, but I have to say for New York I was plesantly surprised! We had 4 large suitcases and hand luggage and we made it work! The room itself was beautiful!  The decor is lovely, clean and fresh - with it most importantly being kept spotlessly clean! The beds and pillows where very comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping with the AC on. (However I always use ear plugs on holidays).  I would however agree with other guests that the AC is highly sensitive - 1degree of a change makes you either too warm or too cold. \n\nThe location of the hotel was good, with hardly any noise from the street. (We stayed on the street side of the hotel on level 11.) Although there was no 'view' we where overlooking the adjacent New York Times building which was plesent enough. It is really close to Time Square, Maceys, Empire state, New York Public Library, Grand Central Station and had great transport links to the rest of Manhattan and beyond.  The only down side to the location is that the eating choices are all set up for tourists - so expect your usual chain restaurants within the local vicinity. \n\nThe staff - What can i say about the staff?!

Hotel opened in April and is the newest in Marriott's AC Hotels, a Spanish chain Marriott acquired several years ago. First, the staff were terrific. You can see Marriott's Ritz Carlton customer service training really pays off. The hotel is clean and comfy. The rooms are average size with engineered wood floors and modern bathrooms. A few tubs, mostly big showers with both handheld and fixed rainforest heads. The platform beds were good. Some rooms have floor to ceiling windows with views. Most of the amenities you come to expect are included, such as free wi-fi, safe, coffeemaker, a few rooms with balconies, small refrigerator, big screen TV, plenty of USB and regular charging outlets. My list of nits are: no nightlight in bathroom, no glasses in bathroom, soap wrapped in plastic (not paper, and other less environmentally friendly options), low to the ground Euro toilets, hard sitting desk chair, cheap rough toilet paper, and loud elevator dings (can be heard in nearby rooms). They teamed with the popular Boqueria tapas chain for access to fresh breakfast, lunch and dinner choices. The just opened rooftop Castell Rooftop Lounge has great city views and its own restaurant with some great small dishes, like a chicken kabob and sliced steak. There is no room service, but you are steps away from dozens of food options, plus delivery. Location near Times Square and the Fashion District, bus terminal, is a big plus.  We'd go back.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel itself was very clean and upscale however the front desk was rude and unwilling to resolve my issue.\n\nI was traveling for work my coworker and I needed a room with 2 beds.  We had to pay a premium for the city view where our view was a brick building with broken windows, rusted out AC units, and lovely view into a sweatshop.  The fact they charged their guests a premium for this \"city view\" is disgusting and not what I would expect of a hotel associated with the Marriott brand.  I did not want to deal with switching rooms but upon my check out I requested we were reimbursed for the difference between a \"city view high floor' and a \"high floor\" room and the front desk would not honor the request.  They advised that anything above the 17th floor (we stayed on the 17th floor) was considered \"city\" and that there was nothing further they could do for me.  They did not apologize for it either just defended it because we were on the 17th floor we had to pay a premium.  They said had we stayed in a king bed room we would have had a view of Manhattan but all doubles face the other direction.  I would have had no issues paying for what we purchases as a \"high floor\" but to have a category as \"high floor city view' is unacceptable to charge a premium for what was outside of our window. \n\nIn addition, I even had pictures showing the view (shown here) we paid for and no one cared nor did they have any interest in resolving these concerns.  Their exact response was that I was the first one to complain about this in addition to saying had I booked a king bed it would have been a non-issue.  I don't know who has trained their staff but this is an unacceptable response for a customer. \n\nI will not be back and will ensure no one from my company uses this hotel again when traveling to NYC.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

So if you like the hustle and bustle of Times Square or the convenience of being close to the theater district, the AC could not be better situated. Also, it was only a few steps from the nearest subway entrance. \n\nThe style reminds me a bit of Starwood's W concept. Somewhat minimalist and very contemporary. The rooms are small, even by NYC standards. There is no separate enclosed closet but just a small hanging space for clothes.\n\nThe air conditioning unit was substandard in my opinion: noisy and a one degree change in setting made it either too warm or too cold in the room. We were constantly fiddling with the thermostat. \n\nThe fitness center did exceed my expectations; spacious and well equipped. The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful. However, there is no concierge staff and the front desk personnel were not that well versed on the surrounding area enough to make useful recommendations. \n\nIn summary, the rooms are quite small and better suited for a single occupant.

Although the hotel is brand new, the shower was already showing some wear. There was only one very uncomfortable chair to sit in while in the room and the lighting was very dim. The biggest disappointment was that my husband called the hotel in advance to order a bouquet of flowers to be waiting in the room upon check in. When we got there, the flowers were not there. The hotel did leave complimentary cupcakes which was nice. We went down to the front desk to ask about the flowers. They informed us they never received the credit card info from my husband. My husband showed me his phone log and he literally called the hotel 9 separate times the day before arrival to confirm. The hotel confirmed they received everything and the flowers would be waiting when we got there. The next day my husband went down to the front desk to complain to a manager. The front desk said they would look into it and we never heard anything. He was obviously very upset and frustrated with the situation and felt the hotel did not do anything to make it right.

It was outstanding!  Everyone at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful especially Angel.  He went above and beyond helping us out with a late checkout, advice and service.  The facility is a great location close to Times Square but without the noise. The rooms were immaculate and super comfortable and the noise insullation in the walls and windows was great.  Good night sleep and super quiet even though the hotel was sold out.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":12695463,"title":"Good service, a little noisy and weak water pressure","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-04-27","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I stayed after the hotel was open for about a week.  The hotel has a great location on 40th and 8th, easy to Port Authority subway stop (A and E trains). The service was excellent, friendly staff all around the lobby.   The rooms are modern, comfortable bed, large tv, and decent wifi.  My two issues with physical plant are corridor noise and shower water pressure. The rooms feature faux wood floors, however, they do not absorb noise very well.   When guest room doors close up and down the room corridor, you can hear every one of them close.  They are quite loud.   Water pressure in the shower was very weak as well.  \n\nI like the AC concept and those who are loyal Courtyard customers will likely prefer the decor better.   If ownership can work out the corridor noise and increase water pressure (i.e. take out the low flow restrictors out of the shower heads), they will have a winner.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Everyone at the front desk made us feel welcome each time we passed by. When we departed I had a question about airport transportation since our party was going in different directions and the bell staff checked different transfer rates and even checked the rail schedule from Penn Station. As far as the facility itself, it's a great location only a couple blocks from Times Square but without the noise. The room size is pretty standard for NYC. I must say that the bed, pillows and bedding was awesome!","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Cannot say enough about how great the entire experience was.  From the moment you enter the staff is welcoming and extremely helpful, after a few days they seemed to anticipate our needs before we ask. The whole of the hotel was absolutely amazing.  Close to theaters, great jazz,favorite restaurant , garment district, museums, everything we go to NYC for.  Thanks to Benny,Alon, Svetlana, Ricardo,Lynn,and all the others for making this a great stay.  We will definitely stay there again.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Staff was over the top helpful from cleaning crew to front desk.  Five minute walk to Bryant Park Whole Foods, Long Island Railroad Penn Station, multiple subway stations.  I've stayed in AC brand in Portland, and the property is much alike - clean lines, hardwood floors, european breakfast style, no lounge but in my case a $10.00 voucher (Platinum Marriott).  My room was normal size (i.e. small) for NYC, but felt quite adequate.  Was on 18th floor and unique floor to ceiling windows angled inward about 25 degrees with automatic sheers and blackout blinds.  I'll stay here again for sure.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
