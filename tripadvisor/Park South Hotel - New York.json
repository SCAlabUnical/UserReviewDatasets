A family of 4 sharing a third floor room with two double beds. A small room but not unusual in New York, well decorated, with an adequate bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and the shower had good pressure. If I was going to be picky, the window wasn\u2019t particularly good at sound proofing the room so there was quite a bit of noise, a higher room would help this. The heating unit in the room was old and very loud, so we switched it off when we were in the room. Room was cleaned daily to a high standard. \nOne gripe was the room tax, on checking in I was told they would \u2018hold\u2019 $400 on a card for room tax and incidentals. On checking out, I was informed the room tax was all that would be charged, approx $138, however they took the full $400! Husband had to call up to query it and was told they take the whole lot then refund the difference, which is not what I was told at check in & also makes no sense. To top it off we have to wait 5-7 days for the refund and probably lose money on the exchange rate. Instructions need to be made clearer at check in if this is the actual process. I was present at check out, the $400 being held could have been cancelled and I could have given you the card to charge the correct amount. \nIn better news, Chuck on the front door was an absolute legend, always had a smile, happy to help and very personable. A credit to the hotel. \nWould I recommend the hotel? Yes I would, comfortable beds and decent shower. Just make sure you check the exact procedure for paying room tax, because current procedures as they are would unfortunately put me off staying there again.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We booked via booking.com and had what the site described as a family room. Breakfast was included in our booking. Below is a summary of our stay\n\n- The hotel is in a good spot. There is a subway station on the corner and it's a short walk to the Flatiron building, Fifth Avenue and the Empire State building.\n\n- The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful. Checkout was at 12.00 and there is an area to store your bags if you are leaving later like we did.\n\n- We had breakfast included in our rate which I was glad of. There is a small cafe in the hotel where breakfast is served and you get 4 items per guest. It's typically things like croissants, bagels, yoghurt, granola etc. plus coffee and juice. if you were to pay for it all there it would be quite costly. There is a bagel place next door though which seemed very popular and a McDonalds on the corner of the block if you fancy eating outside the hotel.\n\n- There's a restaurant on site (we didn't eat there) and a very nice bar which we went a couple of times and we could take our sons in there too. It's quite pricey but everything in NYC is.\n\n- Our room was clean and tidy but was small. We booked a room with two double beds as booking two rooms was too expensive but the double beds were very much on the small side. There was also not much storage space for clothes with 4 of us in the room and it could get a bit cramped. \n\n- The decor and facilities in the hotel were very modern and stylish, especially in the lobby and restaurant\/bar areas and were nicer than I anticipated. We had looked at booking a package through TUI for a similar price but I'm glad we booked separate as this was a much better hotel than the Hilton Garden Inns on offer through the package deal.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the hotel, it's a good spot, staff were nice, facilities were good but the room was on the small side for four people.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I wanted to experience staying in a different location and this hotel didn\u2019t disappoint. It was the perfect location for getting up and downtown and was lovely to come back to somewhere away from the crowds of people, bright lights and noise. The staff were really helpful and didn\u2019t come across like they expected tips unlike other hotels I\u2019ve stayed at before, making you want to tip them. I loved the reception areas. There were comfy seats by a fire and large tables for us to sit and eat our bagels from the bagel shop next door. Bagel shop icing on the cake and could even make a decent cuppa. There\u2019s also a McDonald\u2019s close by. EPSB, time square and MSG all within easy walking distance as are subways. We only drank at hotel on first night and my son ate there once but both experiences were great. There was fresh water in reception every day and bottled water available for your rooms and if heading out for the day which was a massive positive for me especially when some places were charging 7usd per bottle. The original room we were in was a little small for 3 people with lots of luggage, could have made it work but asked if anything else available and we were moved to a larger room free of charge. The room wasn\u2019t available until later in the day but they took care of everything for us so we didn\u2019t have to waste our day. Beds very comfortable!

We opted for the Brownstone King Room (one of only three of this room on this property). It had windows facing the street, plenty of room, and is somewhat private at the end of the hall. \n\nThe bed and pillows were super comfortable and everything in the room worked well - Good AC and strong water pressure.\n\nThis hotel also has a really nice full service restaurant\/bar, plus another smaller restaurant for quick breakfasts and coffee as well as a rooftop bar. The food was great and the drinks spot on. \n\nWe did experience an issue checking in. We arrived early at 2:00 for a 3:00 check in, and were told to come back around 3:00. No problem, we came back at around 5:00 and the room was still not ready for another 30 minutes. Kudos to Francesca at the front desk. She took the time to apologize and comped us on some free breakfasts for our trouble. Not only was she helpful, but was always welcoming with a great attitude and smile every time we saw her. We were traveling on our anniversary and the hotel added a nice touch by recognizing that with a complimentary bottle of wine and cookies.\n\nAlthough the room is large, it surprisingly doesn't have a dresser or much space to store clothes if you want to unpack, and the counter surrounding the bathroom sink is not very big to hold your toiletries. We also had problems with the Wi-Fi which was spotty at best on some days. \n\nAside from some shortcomings, every person we dealt with from the doorman to the waitstaff was great and we would certainly stay there again.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel was well presented, clean and welcoming.  Staff were all friendly and helpful.\n\nWe thought the location was great - about 5 mins walk from the Empire State Building and 2 mins from the nearest subway (line 6).  Times Square was about 25 mins walk.  Financial District and WTC could have been about an hour on foot but a quick subway ride was easy.  If you want a Midtown hotel this one will work for you.  We did nearly everything on foot with just a few subway rides in four days and a couple of taxis. \n\nThere is a restaurant which serves dinner (although we did not use) and the coffee lounge serves breakfast (limited to pastries, croissants, egg bacon and cheese croissant, tea and coffee).  Breakfast for four was about $45.  The roof top bar was very nice although not sure the rules on U21s after (?) 7.30pm - on one day we were told we couldn't go (with 18 and 20 year olds) and another day we did, and had dinner.\n\nThe rooms were clean and beds really comfy.  Others have commented on the AC being noisy and I would have to agree although it was not a major problem.  AC is 100% needed in July as the windows only open about 4 inches and it was stifling without.  We had a king bedroom which was a good size.  We later had to move to a double because of a problem (which was sorted without difficulty with a number of options and entirely to our satisfaction) and that was smaller.  As a sleeping base though the smaller room was fine.  \n\nThere are restaurants in the area and Eataly with a number of options is a short walk away.  Plenty of other offerings too within a short walk.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel and if we return to NY at some point in the future I would be more than happy to stay there again.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It\u2019s more on the boutique side and the staff is very nice and efficient.  The room was perfect, spacious (especially for NYC) and we were lucky enough to have a view of the Chrysler Building.  The hotel is located in more of a neighborhood setting, which we loved. The subway was just a few yards away - super convenient. Again, we love The Roof bar on their rooftop.

Absolutely none of the supposed benefits are worth this fee and they refused to substitute tea for coffee. A discount is offered for One World Trade but a booking fee is added, which no other vendor adds, so there is no discount at all. This makes the hotel more expensive than average and just not worth it. The one free drink on arrival was nice, which did use up most of the $30 fee for one day as the bar prices here are very high.\n\nTo summarise, an ok hotel, very nice staff but overall I feel totally ripped off and simply cannot recommend to stay here whilst they a charge an additional fee.

Beautiful rooms and great common areas including a library with a warm fireplace and a rooftop bar. There are at least two restaurants within the building and they're both fun. Neither feels like a \"hotel restaurant.\" Breakfast off the lobby is simple and delicious. And it's just a storefront away from The Schmear (which is legendary).

I would call this a typical NYC boutique hotel with small rooms and limited amenities. We upgraded our room to a larger floor plan with a view, however we just looked at the building across from the hotel with no view to speak of, so don't waste your money. You probably won't spend much time in your room anyways.\n\nThe breakfast consisted of a continental pastries, juice and fruit. A croissant was the only hot food available. Skip breakfast here. There is a busy bagel joint next door. \n\nAt night there is a very popular rooftop bar. Kitchen closes early (10pm), so if you are hungry after a night out, stop at the New York Pizza Company on the corner. They are open to midnight. \n\nThe best part about this place is the staff. Friendly, accommodating and anxious to help you with directions or catching a cab. Location is ideal if you like to walk.

The hotel's shared spaces - including the lobby, lounge, main floor bathrooms, and rooftop - were also all beautiful, and the hotel's location was very central to everything we wanted to visit (Central Park, Washington Square Park, Bryant Park, etc. were all a reasonable walk or quick ride away).  What really made the Park South Hotel stand out, however, was its excellent staff.  Everyone we met was friendly, engaged, and genuinely eager to help us have the best trip possible.  Especially awesome was Chris Ortiz, who was always there to enthusiastically welcome us back to the hotel, help us manage all our luggage (and all my commencement attire), assist us with calling rides and figuring out how best to navigate the city, and just check in and see how we were doing on any given day - even as he was juggling many other things for many other happy guests.  Chris and the rest of the staff at the Park South Hotel are excellent at what they do and truly made my family and I feel at home in New York City.

It punches way above its mid-range boutique class. Received an upgrade as a Globalist to a high floor King Room with City View; while its square footage is pretty standard for a superior room, it's especially well laid out; furniture is tasteful and well maintained. Bed was comfortable and I loved the bathroom with its rainhead shower & a towel warmer.\n\nThe hotel staff was exceptionally friendly (this is a rarity in NYC hospitality, even with flagship hotels!). They took great care of me during my stay and handled requests exceptionally. Housekeeping was thorough as well.\n\nThe only weak point was breakfast - the benefit is currently outsourced to Butler - unfortunately this service has issues with its order system, and always delivered later than the quoted 45 minute time. However, this isn't an issue exclusive to this hotel and I totally understand the situation the hotel is operating in at the moment.\n\nThis was a refreshingly delightful Midtown stay.

And although the rooms were very close together, we could barely hear next door, which made for a restful stay. The location is in \"Curry Hill\" and away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas, and thus centrally located if you wanted to head uptown or downtown. These attributes helped make up for the tiny room and rusty sink\/vanity area. Also I am particularly unhappy with the Hyatt redemption - despite 30,000 points, I had still paid $500 for 3 nights - crazy! The Sweet Briar restaurant on premise (but not run by the hotel) is convenient, but not terribly kid-friendly. Avoid the breakfast butler\/room service at all costs. Our breakfast of pancakes and avocado toast arrived with no utensils, no syrup for the pancakes and 1 hour and 18 minutes after ordering. Also given there is no room for a table to eat on, that just added salt to the wound. Not sure we would stay again, if not the for exceptional hotel staff! ","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

There was nothing about the hotel that stands out. Nothing memorable. I feel you can stay at a considerable amount of other hotels in the area and get a much better experience, and you'll likely pay less.

Staying at the Park South got us into an area of the city that we don't usually see. We used the location to access SOHO, Chinatown and Little Italy via a comfortable walk. The Tenement Museum is a must see. We also used it to access the theater district to see 2 shows. It proved to be quick by car from there (39th St to 8th Ave. to 44th St.) and a comfortable walk (as long as you weren't wearing heels). \nThe hotel itself was very clean, modern and cozy. The room was not big, but was certainly comfortable. Access in front of the hotel was one of the best I've ever experienced in NYC, probably because it is in a little quieter part of town. We pulled right up to the front door and when we left our car came quickly from the valet. I do want to note that the 2 bartenders were cocktail crafters of the highest order. I can say that I would go there for a drink (or food) even if I wasn't staying there, and I rarely say that about hotel food and beverage operations. \nSpeaking with the doorman\/bellman as he was loading our luggage into the car at departure, he indicated that many of their guests are repeat customers.

Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly employee who checked us in without incident.\n\nWe stayed in room 209 and noticed it was small, but cozy, just enough space for smaller luggage, with a cabinet\/armoire to hang clothes and a few drawers. I was immediately \"offput\" by the floor. Strangely it was uneven and appeared the carpet was applied over an unlevel subfloor. I'm not sure if this was isolated to room 209, but odd for a JDV\/Hyatt hotel. \n\nThere was no coffee maker in the room, but enough cabinet\/shelf space to accommodate one. This would have been nice, as we also did not notice complimentary coffee\/tea in the lobby area. (I know that I will get a reply from hotel management informing a coffee maker might be available upon request, but....If there is space for a coffee maker in the room, then it should be in the room and not requested). It's kind of the standard now.\n\nThere was no compact fridge\/cooler in the room, but doubtful the size of the room could accommodate one.(hotel management, yes, you can reply that one might be available upon request....this I understand).\n\nThe bathroom shower head water flow was very low. It was the adjustable type from shower\/massage etc., which after adjustments, still did not improve the water flow. Not sure if the was isolated to our room (209).\n\nThe \"seasonal\" roof top bar was closed, perhaps due to the cold. Although we did visit another outdoor venue in the area which utilized \"podium\" and overhead heaters to accommodate patrons. I've yet to visit Park South's roof top bar, so I am unsure if they have these types of accommodations.\n\nWe did not visit the Hotel's restaurants (Covina and o ya). The prices were higher than some of the other NYC restaurants we have dined in and further....the hotel's restaurants were rated considerably lower on Tripadvisor. \n\nIn summary, the Park South Hotel is average compared to other NYC hotels we have visited....but the staff really shined. On several occasions we interacted with almost all of them....they were always helpful, friendly and courteous.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Problems with Hyatt as a chain.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-11-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Beautiful hotel and rooms with super friendly front desk and bellman staff.  I stayed in a single queen bed room with a \"courtyard view\".  My view was buildings so I'm not sure where the courtyard was but I didn't care.  The room was Great for one person but a little tight if you are thinking you could squeeze in two.  The room was immaculate.  You could not hear any street noise and rarely could you hear other guests.  A good night sleep!    On the negative side, there was no refrigerator or coffee machine and my bathroom shampoos were never replenished during the stay.  \n\nI knocked the rating down a star for a couple of reasons.  First was price.  I secured a pricer much lower than the Hyatt website offered at the time of booking.  Hyatt has a lower price guarantee where they are supposed to drop their price by an additional 20%.  The Hyatt customer service personnel did not honor that saying you must book on their website before they would consider reducing the price.  Additionally, I learned that even if I had booked directly through Hyatt, they would not have honored the lower rate guarantee because I used my AAA website which they consider a \"paid membership\".  So don't be fooled by Hyatt's guarantee and get stuck at a higher rate thinking they will help you out.  \n\nMy reservation also was supposed to be \"paid in full\" to include breakfast and loyalty points, which they did not honor when I arrived.  This could be a AAA problem in how they transferred the data to Hyatt, but buying breakfast in NYC adds $30 a day to the cost of the room.  Finally on price, at checkout, I was surprised with an additional \"destination fee\" and associated taxes per day.  My room rate was $297 per night, but by the time all was done, the rate was over $400 per night.  Booking and rate issues would have me think twice about staying here again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I have other preferred hotels in this part of lower midtown, but wanted to try something new on this visit.  Park South does have double-bedded rooms, which is not always the case in boutique hotels in NYC, so that was a prime reason for staying here.  The rooms are lovely and of decent size for NYC.  The bathrooms are serviceable but nothing special.  The decor is simple, modern and refreshing.  The views are mainly of other building facades, not a true city view as described, but that is very standard in this part of the city.  This is not the place to stay if you are wanting sweeping views of iconic buildings.  But the location is hard to beat, with a subway stop (4\/5\/6 line) and a pharmacy at the corner and many tourist-friendly things within walking distance.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout the stay.  We received free drink tokens for the bar when we arrived and the bar staff was friendly and attentive.  There is a rooftop bar, I believe, but we never made it up to that one.  The only thing I did not like was the pushiness of the valet staff regarding transport to the airport.  They will try to coerce you to use their car service (or whoever they contract with) when it is far cheaper to take a cab (particularly to La Guardia).  Don't fall for it!  I had to push back quite a bit as he would not let up on trying to get us to use the service.  This is not unique to this hotel, though, and you will find that many bell staff in midtown hotels do the same thing.

The service was excellent, from pick-up at the airport to help with all of the logistics of travel on a long weekend. The hotel was perfectly located for my needs: within ten minutes walking to my sibling's apartment, one block from the subway (the 6), which I took multiple times into the Bowery and Soho during a glorious, sunny weekend. I also partook in the Indian restaurants on Lexington Avenue and ate well-- some incredibly tasty dosas! The money I saved by staying in this location went towards meals and shopping (of course, it's New York!), and I honestly loved every minute of the trip. The room colors were not to my taste-- dark shades with splashes of white-- but that was fine. As an avid traveler, I've learned that location, safety and service are really the keys to a wonderful stay. And the design of the lobby-- sunken, low couches built into the walls, a few steps down into the space, etc, made me feel as if I was in an apartment building vs. a hotel.

While it's located in a great central location to the local neighborhoods restaurants and attractions, it's also central enough of a location to commute to midtown or downtown should you need to get there.  Considering the affordable (and I say that in terms of other New York City hotels), this is a solid choice for either a work or holiday stay.\n\nAs a lifelong New Yorker, I really enjoy this part of the city that has lots of options in terms of restaurants and bars, is very close to Madison Square park and surround shops but also has more of a local neighborhood feel just a street or two east.  It should be noted that this hotel's location on a side street is both a pro and a con - a pro because it's very quiet despite being in the heart of a busy area but also a con because the block can feel a bit isolated\/seedy depending upon who is loitering a few doors down and\/or what kind of construction is going on. That said, I know the area well so I never felt unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\nBecause the hotel is small and unassuming, it almost feels as if you are entering a doorman apartment building rather than a hotel. The front door\/desk staff are friendly in that same familiar way rather than the type of welcome you would expect at a more upscale property.  \n\nThe room itself is adequate.  A reasonably comfortable bed with white unfussy linens. About average in size, it was more than enough space for one person.  The towels were on the small and scratchy side but nothing too terrible.  I appreciated the good selection of television channels available. The d\u00e9cor choices were pleasing if even a little on the traditional side. Mostly importantly, the room was very clean.\n\nIn terms of things that could be improved:\n-The air conditioner was quite loud and (I realized this as I was packing up so it wasn't a huge deal for my one night stay but might have been if I had been there for longer) leaked onto the carpet during my stay.  I did not notice any smell of mold or mildew but if someone had a more sensitive allergy to mold, this could be an issue.\n-Partially because of the above note but also partially just my personal preference, this room would be much cleaner\/nicer with hardwood floors instead of carpet.\n-Larger and a few more towels would be appreciated.  I was just one person staying alone and used all of the towels provided.\n-There is no door on the bathroom AND the mirror on the closet reflected the toilet so even if you weren't standing by the door, the view of the \"throne\" is plain for all to see.  Fine for me staying alone but would be awkward to stay with anyone else.\n- Would be nice to have a way to stream or cast Netflix in the room.\n\nOverall a good option for someone looking for a moderately priced hotel in NYC.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room was small but efficient and nicely updated. It was behind the elevator which was not much of an issue as long as the a\/c was running. What was an issue was having to get my room rekeyed every single night I was there. The desk staff couldn\u2019t have been nicer but offered a different excuse every time for why my key did not work. When I was getting my key fixed on my last evening I mentioned that I\u2019d be checking out at 5am. The bellman on duty suggested that he should call me a cab because one might be hard to come by at that hour on a weekend. When I got downstairs the next morning there was a very nice suburban waiting for me and I\u2019m informed that it would be $65 plus tip for the 20 minute ride to LGA. Why on earth there was such a large car for 1 passenger is beyond me.

No fridge, very few electrical outlets. I mean tiny!. Usually we stay at Marriott hotels but this time tried elsewhere. The bed was on the soft side, which both of us do NOT like. As a result, the next day we were both feeling the effects of this soft bed all day long. When I checked in, the BIG POSITIVE note was the bell man. Christopher Ortiz. This fine man saved us $42.95 + tax (for 1 x 24 hour period) to park  (Fri 7pm to Mon 7AM is free) Thank you Christopher!\n\nThe Park South has a roof top bar (you cannot smoke) even though you are in OPEN space with no roof. Yeah really REALLY F--KING stupid. The TV had FOX issues. That is, the audio did not work for FOX NEWS\/BUSINESS  channels ( we don't watch FAKE news like CNN). Quality of service..   when I called front desk reporting the issue with FOX NEWS\/BUSINESS they had the 'engineer' up in our room in < 10 minutes. Once the 'engineer' reported back that in fact the audio was not working, they put us in another room right away. NOW THAT IS TRULY EXCELLENT SERVICE!\n\nIt's a very nice BOUTIQUE Hotel. Very friendly staff, and Christopher Ortiz, will make YOU feel like you're royalty!\n\nI just wish the rooms were at least as big as Marriott but they are about 40% smaller than the average Marriott.  \nThe COVINA restaurant in the Park South Hotel is EXCELLENT!

What a great place!  The staff are super friendly an hotel is very clean.  It is in a great location, with a subway entrance on the same block and a Duane Reade around the corner if you should need any snacks for the room plus any toiletries you may have forgotten.  There are many restaurants and bars in the area. We had dinner in Covina one night and went to the roof bar both nights.  We had burgers in Covina which were really good.  The drinks at the roof bar are good but pricey.  They are normal prices for NYC but any drinks over ice, are sucked down in a few sips.  I watched one of my glasses sit on the bar when I was done with it.  The ice melted and it filled the glass 3\/4 full with water.  The rooms are small, (standard for NYC) but clean.  The beds are really comfy and we never heard noise.  We were lucky to find street parking both days, so I can't speak @ the parking but the front desk told me it would be $55 for valet during a 24 period.  There is a parking lot right across the street as well.  I would definitely stay here again if we are coming back to this area.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

First and foremost, the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. They seemed to really enjoy working there, from the doorman to the registration staff to the bartenders in the restaurant. We were always greeted with a huge smile and were treated like family. The owners are so lucky to have these dedicated people on their staff. The room was modern and oh so clean. Not a speck of dirt anywhere. The beds and pillows were so comfortable that we didn\u2019t want to get up in the morning. My friend had warned me that she snores, but I never heard a thing. There is a refrigerator in the room to keep water cold (they give complimentary water) and they leave chocolates in the room. The subway stop is on the corner about 500 feet from the hotel, so it\u2019s convenient to get places. There are also good restaurants within walking distance and a grocery store on the corner as well. You can turn on a light to indicate if you want housekeeping or not (don\u2019t forget to turn off the do not disturb button before you leave for a day of sightseeing). The only thing that makes it not perfect is the little counter space in the bathroom, and I wish there was a makeup mirror in the bath area, but it\u2019s NYC, and rooms aren\u2019t big. I will definitely stay at the Park South next time I visit NYC. It was a great spot away from the huge crowds. I felt more like a New Yorker coming home than a tourist entering a hotel. Love it.

My first room was okay - no tub, but nice shower and giant TV.  An alarm right by my head woke me up at one AM. The man who came to fix it explained: \"This happens quite a bit - our alarms are quirky..\". and he unplugged it. My 2nd night, a dump truck directly under my window woke me up at 3am. I was then moved since construction would be going on all week with late-night dump trucks the entire time. My second room was a tiny squished little rectangle room with barely space to walk by the beds, but it was nice and quiet. The bathroom was tiny and old, but clean. This hotel has an awesome restaurant. I suggest having breakfast in the restaurant downstairs  (something I'm destined to do - I visit NY often, but don't recommend this hotel.

When I arrived, the manager refused to honor the credit, insisting I'd book on another site. After I proved that I booked through the hotel, his assistant said, \"Well, our rep doesn't know what deals each of our hotels offer. Why in the world did you believe her?\" A sweet third clerk took the manager in another room to talk sense to him. Upon their return, the manager honored what we'd been promised, but later stubbornly called up to my room with: \"You better use up your credits!\" - too aggressive for words. The first night, a quirky alarm in my room woke me up at 3AM. When I asked the manager if it could be unplugged (the furniture was too heavy for me to move alone to get to the plug) he again became angry. \"It's probably noise outside!\" When the hotel fix-it guy came to check, he laughed and said, \"These things are always going off at the wrong time - they're quirky. Yep, let's just unplug it.\" The next night, a dump truck under my window woke me up at 1am. This was not the fault of the hotel - just bad luck - construction ongoing in the area. I was moved from an okay room to a squishy room with beds so short, my feet hung over the side. My room was quiet - I stayed. We've been searching for a hotel to frequent near our son who lives a block away. This hotel could have made well over 6 thousand dollars off our family per year for years to come, but now we'll be looking for a better run hotel. Covina, the restaurant downstairs, is amazing. That's how we found this hotel - my son and his GF eat there all the time. I shared our family info with the manager right up front. A good manager would have done the math and been gracious.

Especially the doormen say goodbye and greet you every day with a warm greeting. My mom and I have been the first time in NewYork. The location of the hotel was excellent - we could do everything on foot. Around the corner is the subway and nearby is the Empire State Building. And we LOVED the beds. So cozy... The only thing: we did not arrived to open the window which usually I prefer to sleep. It was very heavy. And to people who are delicate with noise: you will hear a lot from floor-side like talkings, the elevator etc. It was not too worse for us but if you have a light sleep ask for a quiet room. The promised city view after upgrading the rooms was very poor - on 5th floor we only saw a few walls from the buildings on the other side. We expected a nice glance on the city. Anyway- those are just small things to be ignored :-) We can warmly recommend the hotel.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Staff are excellent. The bar really terrific with great food and a lively early evening atmosphere. Room allocation makes this either a poor or very good stay. I switched rooms after a night in search of  a quieter room. The new room was larger,  bright and a very good size for NYC on the 8th floor ...but the noise from the street and trucks  was continual throughout the night . There is construction around the hotel and the window sound proofing just isn\u2019t good enough to keep noise out. Which is a shame as this is overall an excellent boutique hotel. A couple of other points swing this from very good to average on this visit. They still charge an additional  daily facility charge of $26 on top of your agreed room rate . This is just a not so smart way of being seen as cheaper on online travel sites and hitting you after the  event. Not transparent and not evident what you get for it as there  is not even bottled water in the room. Finally the showers whilst looking good lack any power at all . So, I want to like the hotel because it has a lot going for it  but the overall experience ends up being average and not as good value as expected. ","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I have travelled quite a bit and find that even high priced hotels often do a terrible job of doing the basics.  Clearly, hotels are most specifically charged with providing a place in which you can sleep.  That is job one.  Yet, here I am in the big apple exhausted from a sleep interupted night.  And, the noise was all the hotels\u2019 doing according to management.  Drilling in the hall outside our room at 2 a.m. and lots of other banging and clunking noises.  Doing duct work.  Why?  Why would management choose that time to have workmen making noise in the hall in a fully booked hotel? And, their response to our complaint? To take a facility charge off of our bill for one night.  I do not want a minor bill reduction - I want SLEEP!  Last time we stay here.  Really, I could get a bad nights sleep at a Motel 6 by the airport.  In the city one would think an upscale hotel (advertised as such) would be run better.  ","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms were beautifully done, everything looked brand new and very chic. There is not a lot of room for storage, we left our clothes in the suitcase and worked with that. The iron board feature was very convenient. You do hear street noise, (it did not bother us) but if you are a light sleeper ask for a higher floor.\nWe had Corvina for Christmas dinner, everything was very good. My son said it was the best caesar salad he ever had. The bar was a great spot to stop at, at the end of the night for a night cap. All the bar tenders were very friendly and we had great conversations with them. My son tried the cafe frequently and loved everything he got from there, especially the Carmel Coffee.\nNever quite made it to Corvina for breakfast because there is an amazing bagel place two doors down, everything they have they make in house, even the bagels, we would go there get our breakfast and eat it at the hotel library that was beautifully done, interesting books and a fireplace. If you go through the hotel cafe you are on 27th street, there is a Jazz club there and some really good restaurants. Try Blue Smoke the brisket is the best I have ever had.

First, it would be great if all hotels made it clear up front if they offer curb side baggage assistance or not, not maybe. Here, while my wife went inside to check in, I waited in my car a good ten minutes right in front of the hotel before a hotel staff member finally came out and asked me if I was going to need help with my bags. I also had to ask about him about valet parking even though I knew in advance that they offered it. The room we were given was so small it was actually uncomfortable & the walls & ceilings are not sound proof. They have a great roof top bar\/restaurant but, to access it, you need to leave the hotel and go around the block and then take the elevator up to the roof! However, when you are leaving the roof, you don't need to go around the block again...you can access the floor you are staying on from the elevator!! When it came time to call for our bags & car, I tried calling the front desk several times on the room phone but nothing happened when I pushed the \"Front Desk\" button. I finally called the hotel directly from my cell and the person I spoke to apologized stating that it was a \"little confusing\" and that you needed to dial \"0\" for the front desk. I suggested that the hotel should either fix the \"front desk\" button on the phone or remove it and put a sign on the phone instructing guests to dial \"0\".  I did that and finally got through but was put on hold and then hung up on twice. We gave up and carried our own bags. We then had to wait for our car.

Overall the hotel is good. Friendly, helpful staff and in a good central location close to the subway. My room was very comfortable and spacious, with everything I needed and there was very little noise from the street (which I believe is a rarity in smallish NYC hotels).\n\nAs a traveler on my own, the hotel did feel a little awkward at times. After sight-seeing and before dinner, it would have been nice to have chilled out with a beer and a book. This is where I felt the victim of the hotel's success. The foyer would have been too conspicuous, the library was oddly too dark to read in and the bar too busy. Even when I thought I'd have a coffee in their coffee shop and have a read, with only two other people in there, a member of staff (doing her job, but not really assessing the situation) clocked it was 5pm came in and turned the music on and the lights down so I couldn't read. The rooftop bar would have been perfect, but be warned, this is a destination for young, trendy New Yorkers and fills up quickly. People even queue at the back of the hotel to go up there, so for the paying guest it's a hard place to chill. At times I felt quite uncomfortable relaxing in the hotel and preferred to nip to a pub behind the hotel on 27th street (oddly next to the queue of people wanting to get up to the hotel's roof).\n\nBreakfast in the hotel is expensive, but very nice. The bar is also quite pricey with cocktails being better value than wine or beer.\n\nAll in, for me it was a very nice hotel, but probably a bit too 'boutiquey' for my tastes and clearly a very successful operation.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

Convenient area with informal eating places close by. But room size was very small for the money. Times Square area has better value. I did like smallness of the Hotel.

But also like to sign up for the rewards card to be sent to my home and to receive points from this visit.  Staff is very helpful and the breakfast that I had at the restaurant was very much enjoyed.  Can\u2019t wait to stay again!  Rooms are very spacious but recommend a microwave also be added to the rooms as a convenience for the customer. Unfortunately I experienced  to nats were in the room in which I had to kill but overall cleanliness was displayed.\n","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. However, the room was very small; the bed was too soft that caused me with terrible neck pain after the first neck. Even I reported the problem, nothing was done by the hotel. The hotel never responded to my several emails regarding my experience. It is one of the worst experience I had with a hotel stay.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The rooms are good size for NYC, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms well accommodated, the water pressure great, the service excellent and the location is great.  The people who work at this hotel are professional, friendly, caring and competent.  They truly care about their patrons.  I stay here every time I stay in NYC now.  Love this place!!!","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Comfy bed, spacious rooms by Manhattan standards, and this hotel has a fantastic location right by Madison Square Park, the 6 subway, midtown.

From the very helpful staff at front desk (thank you Luis M) to our sweet house maids who kept our room nice and super clean we loved the stay there. The location is perfect and the city can be easily navigated from the hotel and the neighborhood is also filled with restaurants, coffee shops and bars. The Covina restaurant and coffee shop at the hotel is also very nice and the barista at the coffee shop met  our high standards when it comes to good coffee. Would recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again \nThanks guys, it was lovely\nOddny M \nReykjavik, Iceland","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
