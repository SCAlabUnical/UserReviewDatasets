It was the first time our 4 daughters (all middle and high school ages) had been to the city.  The James was a great hotel for us. The suite wasn't huge (not sure that many hotel rooms in NYC are), but it was just fine for us.  We had 2 sleep on the pullout couch and that worked fine for us.  The pullout bed wasn't the best, but my girls made it work.  Having the table and seating area was super helpful as was having 2 bathrooms. My girls really appreciated the lighting in the bathrooms. The room was clean and we really appreciated the daily maid service .\n\nAnother great thing about the James was the location. It's not a far walk from Times Square and all the action there if you want to walk, but it's also just a couple blocks from a subway stop which made getting farther up and downtown super easy. There are some great coffee shops close by as well as some really good restaurants away from Times Square and the more touristy areas. It's also across the street from a Whole Foods which was nice for us to get snacks to have in the room. \n\nThe few things that weren't stellar were the morning coffee (it was fine, but we like stronger coffee so for us it was like bean water), the bed in the pullout couch was a little broken (although we made it work), and the queen beds were more firm than we like them (although that's a personal preference and my husband actually enjoyed that).  Overall, The James was great, especially for the price and I would gladly stay here again. ","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Great location for our trip to NY. \n\nWe had to have 2off rooms to accommodate us. We had originally booked 1off Queen room ( 1 queen bed for wife and daughter) and 1 twin queen ( 2 queen beds for myself and son). We booked this all through TUI. \n\nUpon arrival I was offered an upgrade which I took. After a confusing conversation with the receptionist  I thought we were upgrading our single queen room to a suite for $125 per night.  This meant my wife and daughter would get a much better room. \n\nHowever, when I opened our room I found only 1 queen bed. I headed back down to reception to explain. The receptionist said she could upgrade the 2nd room to a room with two queens for $50 per night. I explained that had I have known I\u2019d not have bothered as now I had to upgrade both rooms! \n\nUpon entering the new room I instantly saw it was dirty. There was a towel on the bed that appeared to be used, white paper looking debris all over the carpet, a flannel on the bathroom floor that had been wet and had dried and the most surprising a large tablet of some kind on the table. \n\nI headed back down to reception to let them know I wanted a new room. \n\n3rd time lucky we were up on the 12th floor in a room that we were happy with.\n\nDuring the check in fiasco somehow the hotel got 2off card details from me. A debit card and a credit card. They had charged me sizeable fees on both cards. When I challenged this I was informed by a particularly rude lady on reception that  I was going to be charged $50 dollars per room per night \u201chotel facility fees\u201d and $100 per night per room \u201cincidental fees\u201d. She actually said  it\u2019s nowhere near enough-as if she knew how much we were going to spend.\n\nTUI had not mentioned the addition fees which I will be taking up with them upon our return to the UK. \n\nThe rooms were nice. The bar next to the hotel was nice. We ate there for breakfast 3 times. But it was very expensive. \n\nOverall our hotel bill for the 2off upgrades, 3off breakfasts  ( for 4 people) and a few items from the room mini bar was over $1900!!!

We'd already settled in and unpacked by the time we realized this late at night, so we didn't feel like swapping out. I ended up putting in my earphones and listening to white noise, which helped somewhat. Oddly, the windows are not the noise reducing, double-pane type, which I would expect from this level of hotel.

We booked a standard king room but decided to upgrade to a king deluxe as a special occasion -extra $60\/night. \n\nAt check in, the person on reception hurried through the process, took my credit card and charged over \u00a31000. I realise that hotels put a charge on a card but it would have been polite to tell me the amount. She mentioned that there was complimentary coffee\/tea\/fruit offered in the lobby in the morning and wine and treats in the afternoon. She spoke so quickly that my husband and I didn't really take it in.  The first two mornings, apples and oranges were indeed offered in addition to a small selection of teas and coffee. However the next 4 mornings of our stay, no fruit was on offer and only one kind of tea. Other treats were never on offer throughout our stay. This in itself is very poor for a 4 star hotel. At check out, when I asked what the 40 dollar\/night facility fee was for I was told that it was for wifi, gym, drinks in the lobby. As said above I was told that drinks were complimentary. I also thought wifi and use of gym was complimentary. \n\nThe room was basic\/dated\/shabby - most definitely not luxurious or deluxe as advertised - see photo. There was only 1 bathrobe and pair of slippers. There were no drinking glasses\/cups (neither cardboard or china). There was no blue tooth speaker as advertised. The bathroom was shabby - see photo attached -ceiling of shower cubicle - and freezing (no heating).  I had wanted a bathtub rather than shower, so I phoned reception and they found a room with a bathtub. We moved to that room which was much smaller and the bath was actually a raised shower tray, about 30cm deep. It was stained. We asked to return to the previous room as it was, at least bigger. I asked the woman at reception whether the second room was also deluxe and she said yes - she said all the rooms have a different layout.\n\nThe wardrobe in our room was very small - see photo. There was also nowhere to store our suitcases. I called Reception and asked for another bathrobe and pair of slippers. I asked if we could have a kettle and some cups and teabags and asked where the blue tooth speaker was - the man I spoke to said it might be in the drinks cabinet - it wasn't. I politely asked if I could have a pottery cup and saucer and teaspoon, not too much to ask for in a 4 star hotel. There were no drinking glasses or cups of any type. Eventually I received 1 pottery cup and a tablespoon which was removed the next day when the room was cleaned. I asked for replacements which we were told would be delivered in 5 minutes. An hour or so later, we had to make another phone call to reception and we eventually received 2 cups, one tablespoon and a small jug of milk, two hours after our initial request\n\n I phoned again about the blue tooth speaker and we were told that someone would bring one. The person who brought it couldn't get it to work and thought it had to be charged but didn't have a charger. He used the lead I had for my mobile phone. It still didn't work. The next day I took it to reception and explained the situation and the woman said she would have it set up. I said to her that the website clearly says that there is a bluetooth speaker. She said people are stealing them. When we returned later to the hotel nothing had been set up. I phoned reception and finally someone came to the room and sorted it out. I think this was 2 days after our arrival. \n\nThroughout our stay we asked for basic amenities which should be a given in a 4 star hotel. If we had wanted to spend less and stay in a 2\/3 star hotel, we would have booked one. My husband and I are utterly disgusted at the service\/amenities at the hotel. The only thing that was acceptable was the lobby area. The staff on reception were not particularly friendly or informative and do not deliver on what they promise, which frankly is very disrespectful to their guests, however the people offering to help with luggage\/taxis were nice.\n\nCould be a great hotel given its location. \n.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have stayed at The James NoMad MANY times over the years, both for work and fun. I usually attach on a personal few days to a work trip. Most recently did this in mid-Dec '23.\nThe Pros: \n-Big rooms by NYC standards. I love the NoMad\/Flatiron location as central to get to most things I want to do in NY uptown or downtown. \n-Booking on The James website always yields a good rate\/deal which I appreciate\n-Most (not all) of the bathrooms are large with a lot of counter space (esp. nice when more than 1 person in the room)\n-Door staff and housekeeping have almost always been friendly, which is nice and makes for a good impression\n-Wine hour in the lobby is decent and a nice touch in the midst of Manhattan and coffee downstairs too in the morning (but would rather have a Nespresso maker in the room, if I'm honest) -- also it's a great lobby space that gets used for lounging\n-Plenty of working elevators\n-Bathrobes (and slippers) in room -- sometimes have to call to ask for them, but I love a hotel bathrobe so gets a big plus for me\n-Nice old-school feel to this hotel w\/o being stuffy and has modern furniture\/artwork \n-Peloton bike (2) in gym\nThe Cons:\n-I have stayed here many times over the years, as mentioned ,and the front desk staff never acknowledges my return and are often cold -- a missed opportunity to make a good impression. This one is so simple to get right with a little care by management.\n-When I book a double room I email directly to request a room with a closet (some only have armories), the last two stays this hasn't been honored. Before my last stay I received a nice reply that the management was noting it and looked forward to my return, however that room was not what I got. I did get a nice note and bottle of wine we didn't drink (thank you!), but would have appreciated the closet and maybe a greeting by woman that checked me in as well, who has checked me in and out many times.\n-Bell staff, while almost always friendly, aren't always at entrance and you have to go up steps to lobby with your luggage.\n-Bath towels need replacing -- thin and scratchy and on my last stay had one with a huge hole in it. \n-Gym is not well maintained -- make sure it has towels restocked by each early morning and cleaner for the equipment (!!!)\n-Hotel rooms are a little tired...a deeper cleaning of carpets would help\n-Not always enough hotel staff at front desk - esp. during checkout\/checkin times\n-Would be nice if there was an amenity for hotel guests to get a drink at the bar in basement of hotel (Seville) or at least preferential option to book a seat or get spot at bar there or in restaurant\nOverall, I recommend and will likely stay again, but I would appreciate a little more graciousness from front desk and care in rooms they book guests into. Like I said, this is such a simple thing to get right and goes a long way w\/o a lot of effort or expense by hotel. ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The service there was fantastic, the little amenities like fresh cookies and there always being water, coffee and tea throughout the day plus wonderful pastries in the morning not to mention the cocktails and appetizers in the evening. The rooms were large and beautiful with floor to ceiling windows.\n\nWe knew this location would be different and looked forward to a different James experience.\n\nWe booked through your hotel website, even though I could have gotten the room cheaper on alternate sites. Your website shows the Jimmy suite King as 475 ft. and the Jimmy suite king deluxe as 545 with better furnishings and obviously more space.\n\nWe were traveling with our son for his birthday so we booked the deluxe for more space. When we checked into our room it said our room was only 475 square feet so I requested being moved to a room that had a view different than that of an exterior wall of another hotel room and one in our category. We were told this was it and everything was sold out so we couldn\u2019t move.\n\nI witnessed others checking in after us into suite categories as well as others changing their rooms.\n\nI then checked online to see if rooms were available and some were. When I mentioned this I was told repeatedly that we were in the correct room. If that\u2019s the case I\u2019m not sure why the website is factually inaccurate nor how you can call what we had a suite let alone deluxe. I will attach pictures. \n\nA few small other details, we never had soap in the dispenser, our phone didn\u2019t work the first night. Robes or bedding for the pull out was not in our room and didn\u2019t come the first night when requested.\n\nOur son has never complained about a pullout couch bed and has always enjoyed them but couldn\u2019t sleep on this one. I tried it and it was horrible, springs sticking up and digging into you. He slept on the couch the following two nights but said it wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable that way either.\n\nLastly my husband and I went to the Seville to have a drink our first night, it was early and empty yet we were treated like interlopers. The hostess was extremely snotty when we didn\u2019t have a reservation. She finally sighed and said I guess we could sit at the bar, there were only two other people in there when we sat down.\n\nThe drinks were good though and the bar staff was great. We tried to go back our last night with 2 friends and were told they couldn\u2019t accommodate us. Again the hostess was very rude. This was disappointing as we are staying at the hotel and our friends wanted to experience it.\n\nAll in all the James Nomad was not remotely worth the amount we paid. Nothing like our experience in Soho. I honestly feel we should be refunded a significant portion of what we paid for our stay.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Having experienced the nightmare of bedbugs before, my husband and I both know intimately how to identify them and we know how just a couple bugs can ruin your life if they get into your luggage and are brought home. Yet the hotel continues to deny it and provided faulty investigation reports. I documented this with pictures, videos and we even saved the specimen I killed, yet they keep denying the obvious facts. They may be evading city fines for now but this is only going to get worse for them. Hotel management and potential guests, take this seriously.\n\nOverall sanitation was also lacking. We found a dirty rag left on the bathroom floor, no hand soap was provided, and the room smelled like damp carpet mildew. Tiny room and bathroom too.\n\nResponse to our google review: At no point were we ever content, but I don\u2019t have unlimited time to waste so of course I have to go about my day at some point. The first manager said he would comp our laundry \u201cno matter how the report comes back\u201d. The offer was reneged later until someone else agreed that laundry was the bare minimum. The first manager spoke to my husband, not me directly and my husband needed to go to work without time to discuss a better outcome. Of course a 1-night refund (they first said 50% off one night) out of 3 nights spent in the bedbug-infested room is not close to enough compensation, furthermore it is a drop in the bucket compared to the thousands+ they will inevitably need to pay to control the bedbug infestation not to mention lost revenue from all the potential guests they will alienate. We found a bedbug, and the pest control company is either scamming this hotel or they never did a thorough investigation. The public deserves to know this and I don\u2019t appreciate the gaslighting.

We had room service on two occasions and both times tipped in cash, hence not adding tips to the receipts when signing for these items, to then find that they\u2019d added large tips to our bill.

All credit due to Bradley Concepcion for saving the day and understanding the benefit, courtesy and wisdom of listening to a customer with respect. His intervention changed what would have been a one star review in fury to four in gratitude. \nFor two days the bath only had tepid water at sink and shower. This inconvenience, along with a room too small to swing a cat and a broken window, did not make for comfort or purported Nomad luxury. Sadly compounding the frustration were less than responsive front desk clerks and a front officer manager who definitely needed \u201cbedside manner\u201d training.  Considering that maid staff confirmed the boiler was struggling, the disbelief and disinterest on the part of the front office manager were not only unproductive, his response \u201cwell obviously nothing I can do will make you happy\u201d hardly scored 100 on the customer service scale. Ride to the rescue the manager who immediately apologised for surly mediocre treatment And researched the problem was genuine.  Presto pronto a new room was assigned, a bottle of wine delivered, and no offensive instruction to leave the water running to warm was deemed necessary. Perhaps he had the training to spot seasoned luxury travellers who had somehow reached maturity knowing how to operate a shower valve! And his efforts proved customer satisfaction was an achievable goal.  \nTo be honest, many of the rooms available at the James are small and lack views. But the location and staff - with the aforementioned notable exceptions - are trying and working hard to be hospitable. So this is overall a cautionary tale: hotel management can save the day if they have the training to be hospitable which one would assume the hospitality industry requires as the bare minimum.

Definitely not a four star hotel as advertised (on our Chase card travel website). We stayed five nights.\n\nThe GOOD: Good location if you like mid-town, easy to get to subway etc. in the Flatiron district.\n\nWe had a suite and the rooms were quite large for NY. Bathroom was decently sized too, with a bathtub and a shower. Comfortable bed. \n\nNice lobby with coffee in the morning and wine and sandwich type things in the afternoon. No one could figure out how to use the hot water machine. They need a little sign.\n\nFriendly helpful doorman. \n\nTHE BAD:\nThe rooms look like a college student decorated their dorm from garage sales and Z gallery. And, believe me when I say the couch and chairs in the living room are ridiculously hard (cheap furniture).  My husband couldn't even work in there they were so uncomfortable. \n\nThe place didn't feel clean. Not like housekeeping clean (which was very good) but just tired and kinda... grubby? \n\nWhile the bed may be comfortable, the sheets are cotton\/poly and the pillows are foamy. We then requested down pillows which were inexplicably hard. \n\nWe had free continental breakfast. They gave us 10 little cards (the size of business cards) as vouchers to use in the restaurant (Scarpetta) with our name, room number and dates of stay hand written on them. Which felt kind of old timey. At Scarpetta one morning the espresso machine was broken so no lattes etc. On two mornings they only had one server and (on one of them) the place was full and the server was completely overwhelmed. It took so long to get coffee I walked out into the lobby and got some myself. I even had time to go back and re-fill my cup before our food arrived. When my latte did arrive, it was cold.  \n\nThe front desk:  If you call and request something, it will fall into a black hole. I asked for water, they said they'd send up \"filtered\" water. Not sure what that meant but it never arrived. Asked for down pillows (never arrived). Called housekeeping and they brought them.  There was no bar soap either for the sink so I called the front desk... well, you get it.\n\nFinally, the manager at the desk seems not particularly friendly. Kind of just... disinterested. And bored.\n\nWon't stay there again.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We splurged one night in the Penthouse suite (there are two) and then downgraded to the James suite for the next night. Family of four who have stayed at The James Nomad multiple times, enjoyed our stay leading up to Thanksgiving. We enjoy staying at The James because the suites are spacious and we usually stay in the James suite (bigger but only one bathroom) or the Jimmy suite (two separate spaces with a bedroom and a living room with pullout couch separated by a teeny hall area but TWO bathrooms). The Penthouse suite is beyond spacious and luxurious. The only reason why it's not a full 5 stars is because there is no pull out couch. With all that space, there should be additional sleeping options. One kid slept on the couch and we got a rollaway for the other kid. \nWe downgraded to the James suite for the next night due to the hefty price tag. There were no bars of soap but we actually brought our bars down from the Penthouse because we didn\u2019t want to waste. \nWe REALLY wish the James Nomad would get rid of the expensive resort fee or give the option of not partaking in the happy hour. Hotel resort fees are the biggest turn off. I'd rather drink my own wine or go to the many bars the city has to offer. If you're not going to get rid of the resort fee, bring back those delicious breakfast croissants!\nStaff are super nice and friendly.

While this hotel is not the cheapest, we felt that we got what we paid for, which is by itself saying something in NY. The location is phenomenal, the staff were super nice, the room was great, and it was very quite. By far the quietest place I've stayed in the city, including Brooklyn.

The Benjamin and the Nomad in LA are some of our favorites but we will stay our 3 nights here, pay the crazy rates and make sure we tell all our friends to beware of this place.

It was also very accessible for us, as we were using a double side by side stroller, and had no issues at all.  The location was brilliant - close enough to everything to allow us to walk all over Manhattan (big walking days of course but definitely achievable), but also very close to the subway if we chose to use it. The hotel was quiet and peaceful, and only a couple of blocks north of Madison Square Park and the Flatiron Building. Excellent amenities nearby including the usuals like Starbucks and Wholefoods. We loved the buzz in the morning where we enjoyed complimentary tea, coffee and fruit in the lobby (with its big street facing windows, some with views of the Empire State Building, and airy space) and also the end of day wind-down at the 5pm happy hour, also in the lobby.  We ate at Scarpetta on our last night and had a wonderful meal to finish off our stay at The James.

It could definitely use some refreshing to feel a bit more luxurious.\n\nThe staff were fine, though the bellman was a little concerning after he told us he could get the key to the gym for us if we didn't have vaccination cards to show.  Otherwise, he was very helpful, bringing us water, extra glasses, and bedding to make up the sofa bed.\n\nThe cleaning of the room was not thorough.  Dirty glasses were left behind and not replaced with clean ones.  Empty water bottles were left behind and not replaced.  Some used washcloths were left in the bathroom while other towels were taken and replaced.  It all felt haphazard.\n\nWe had to call the front desk a few times because the things we requested came very piecemeal.  We called for clean glasses, and because the light switches were not working.  The glasses came, but no one came for the lights.  Finally, after calling again, someone came and looked at the lights, and apparently the lamps  needed to be plugged into some device in order to use the switch.  The man who came said he would go look for one, and when we asked how we were to turn off the light if he couldn't fine one, we were told, \"Unplug it.\"  Really, for $1k\/night, we have to unplug and plug in the lamp!!

NYC was going through one of its bad summer heat waves.  During the last two nights of the stay the AC broke down.  The entire hotel was SWELTERING.  Staff were telling us it is not the hotel but the utility which is reducing electricity supplies.  For my final night I moved to another hotel a few blocks away which somehow, miraculously was spared by the utility - they had good aircon.  When I checked out Robinson told me I was going to get a refund.  Obviously nothing came.  When I called they passed me to someone called Erika who never picked up and had a full voice mail box so couldn't leave message. I then asked the card company to do a chargeback which the hotel refused to honor.  I asked for $270 which was just one night.  This hotel has zero sense of doing the right thing.  Stay somewhere else.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Every morning they offer coffee and in the evenings they have drinks and music. The location is fantastic being only blocks from Madison square park, which always has a wonderfully creative art installation, a playground, Shake Shack and is almost always guaranteed to have musicians. Also there is Eataly and the Lego store, amongst other shops. Bryant park is not far going uptown and Union square is just a bit further going downtown. On Madison Avenue there is a great view of the new One Vanderbilt skyscraper and on 29th street, just steps from the James entrance, there is a phenomenal view of the Empire State Building. There is plenty of shopping nearby on 5th avenue and is also just blocks from Herald square and Macy\u2019s. After we left, my son asked many times to \u201cgo back to our home-tel\u201d.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":12197432,"title":"Not a good location for handicapped customers","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-08-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Like most hotels in New York, The James NOMAD is expensive, but when I made my reservations, I was excited because the website makes the hotel look very nice. The pictures on the website are deceiving, whatever renovations were made to upgrade the look of the rooms were very poorly done and the room was more of a disappointment. \nThe James NOMAD is NOT good for Handicap customers\n1)\tSmall elevators: There is a small elevator at the street level that is not easily accessible and is hard to fit a small folding wheelchair and the person pushing the chair and one of the three elevators that takes guest from the lobby to the rooms is also too small and is difficult for someone pushing a wheelchair to use. \n2)\tStaff laughed at us as we were trying to get into the elevator: When we first arrived, we were stuck using the small elevator from the lobby to the floor that our room was on. Not only did our children have to ride the elevator separate from us, but we also had an extremely difficult time getting into the elevator with the wheelchair and our small carry-on sized bags. While we struggled, the staff snickered instead of helping us. Overall, it was extremely embarrassing for me, and especially embarrassing for my wife that is handicapped because of brain cancer.\n3)\tWe had to send our children up on a separate elevator because we could not all fit into the elevator: On both elevators, from the street to the lobby and from the lobby to our room, we had to have our young children ride separate from us because they could not fit in the same elevator as us.\n\nThe main Light kept turning on and off the entire stay: I informed them of this, and they did not fix this issue. There is a light that runs behind the headboard of the 2 queen sized beds in the room that provides most of the light, this light would randomly turn on and off, since we stayed for a full week, this became increasingly annoying. \n\nThe website says they have room service, we did not find out until the night we arrived that they shut down room service when COVID started and never opened it back up, even though the restaurant operates during normal dinner hours with a large crowd every night, and a lounge with none of the patrons wearing masks. If you want to dine in your room, you will have to order through one of the online delivery services, which meant that most of the time I had to meet the delivery person in the lobby.\n\nThe Television shuts down after around 2 hours with no way of preventing the shutdown. A notification would come up on the TV saying to press \u201cOk\u201d to continue watching, but none of the buttons on the remote would prevent the TV from shutting down. So, if you are watching a movie, expect that you will have the TV shut off during the movie and then must go back through the James Hotel TV menu to get back to your movie.\n\nThey added an extra charge of $97.52 initially and then changed the charge to $53.49 claiming that we used the min bar, WE DID NOT USE ANYTHING FROM THE MINI BAR, we either went to Walgreens or ordered everything from Doordash. When I tried to call about the charge, they could not tell me what the charge was for, just said it was from the mini bar.\n\nTheir customer service is very poor.\n1)\tThe hotel does not offer help with catching a taxi or any assistance in the morning. I attempted to have a ride set up at 9am to the ferry for the Statue of Liberty and the Hotel staff said they do not offer help with rides at that time.\n2)\tThe gentleman at the front desk when we checked in was extremely rude. While he was checking us in, he barely said anything to us, seemed to be irritable when I asked questions about my accommodations, and did not even look up at me the entire time he was checking me in.\n3)\tThe hotel staff at the front desk and the front door watched and laughed as we struggled to get into the tiny elevator with our small folding wheelchair rather than offering to help.\n4)\tIf you attempt to call billing, you will be sent to a recording that suggest you send an email, I spoke with the front desk about the issue with them adding charges and they transferred me to a manager, but the manager did not answer. When I called the front desk, she put me on hold, hold time so far 36 min. It has been over a week since I spoke with the hotel staff about the fraudulent mini bar bill and the list of other issues, and even though I left messages with my name and my call back number they have not returned my call.\n\nI would not recommend staying at The James NOMAD","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

We have stayed in NYC one or two times a year and like to try different hotels, locations, etc. The location is fine, convenient, relatively quite, all good. The Hotel itself, is not nearly as impressive as the website makes it look, so don't be deceived.  Staff are all friendly and helpful. Room was a good size, especially for NYC, it also had an impressive bar set up. Outrageously priced but very impressive. We had a drink in the restaurant and that was fine, the restaurant looked to be very popular and busy. Unfortunately you can not get a \n drink or any food at all until the restaurant opens at 5:00 PM. The negatives are that the Hotel is not very clean, carpets in the room and in the halls are dirty and stained. Rooms themselves are poorly decorated, I think they are trying to be retro, but missed the mark by a lot.  Very drab, dark, and generally uncomfortable. In summary,   the Staff are fine, the location is good, the problem is the Hotel itself. Not at all as represented on the website. Also, the +\/-$200.00 per night room charge ends up approaching $350.00 per night once all the fees are added on.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

All and all had a great experience. And as someone who used to live in NYC, it felt like being back home. For the most part friendly staff and courteous friendly doormen and good value for your $. Stayed in a corner room, clean, minimalistic, well appointed, super comfortable bed and definitely spacious by hotel standards with plenty of room to stretch out and work. There were a few minor issues with housekeeping\/room upkeep but they were quickly rectified as well as an adjustment to my final bill upon check-out which was a nice surprise. Located in a great location with nearby Madison Square Park along with bars, coffee shops and restaurants aplenty as well as subways, PENN and GC within walking distance. And \"scarpetta,\" the well known Italian restaurant sits adjacent to the hotel, with both inside and outside dinning. Food is very good though also a tad expensive. There is also a bar downstairs with either live music or a dj depending the night. A great part of town to stay and and the James made it all the more nicer. Will definitely be on the top of my list of hotels to stay when I return as well as to recommend.\n\nNote to Mgmt: Realize not always easy, but consistency amongst ALL staff is the key to great customer experience.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

However, we could not wait to get back to NYC and visit some of our favorite places and introduce our 5 kids to NYC. Safety has now become a high priority for traveling, especially when traveling with kids to NYC. We were pleasantly surprised that The James Nomad was available for our stay with adjoining rooms to fit our group. \n\nI have to say that driving to NYC was a little nerve racking; but upon arrival, the James's staff made everything easy (even the process of unpacking and parking our car). Immediately, I was met by \"Manny\" who took charged of my family, luggage, and directions on the street so I could safely park the car. Everything was under control, and our arrival set the tone for our amazing stay. \n\nThe rooms were clean, swanky-cool, and comfortable. One of my kids commented \"This is the greatest bed ever...\" and she is a tough critic (apparently we are buying that king bed). Everyone had space, and the amenities in the room are NY-unique. This centralized location made every trip easily within walking distance or near a safe mode of travel. All staff members are completely hospitable, constantly cleaning, and fun to chat up. Safety and cleanliness are tip-top here. \n\nMy daughters want me to make sure that I mention \"the coffee and pastries from the morning.\" Packed in a sack to go, each one was an artisan delight... We tried everything as we raced out the door to meet: NYU, Madison Park, Shopping, and yes lots and lots of pizza... Best first trip back with everything we could ask for in a NYC hotel. The only tears were the ones in the Lincoln tunnel as we officially left NYC behind. \n\nThanks James Nomad... You are a keeper.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

A special shout-out to Pradley for going above and beyond the call of duty to resolve a problem I had.\n\nI found the best rates offered on the hotel\u2019s website and it\u2019s always best to book directly so the hotel has more flexibility in room assignments.  I suggest paying extra for the larger and more comfortable superior king room. \n\nMorning coffee with croissants and muffins is offered free in the stylishly designed lobby. There are plenty of window seating and chairs and sofas to enjoy your start to the day.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Manhattan and is great for walking to 5th Avenue shopping, Madison Avenue furniture shopping, Times Square theater district and  a quick subway or cab ride to Meatpacking and SoHo.\n\nScarpetta\u2019s fine Italian restaurant is located on the ground floor of the hotel. The food and ambiance are so great that I found myself eating there 3 out of 5 nights! You must try their signature spaghetti.

We had an exceptional stay and experience at this cozy, safe and secure boutique hotel in the Nomad area of NYC.  The location was ideal as the hotel is close to all major public transportation hubs including many subway lines, making all parts of the city easily accessible, not to mention the ease at which the doorman happily hailed a taxi to the airport for us the next morning.  Contrary to what we\u2019ve heard about the current state of NYC, the Nomad area was bustling with locals enjoying outside dining and everything felt very safe, even during our evening walk home from dinner.  \n\nWe arrived in the early afternoon to open arms and many smiling faces wholeheartedly welcoming us to the hotel.  We have never experienced such a warm and genuine appreciation for choosing a hotel as we did at The James NoMad and it really set the tone for an amazing stay!  \n\nUpon check-in we were advised of the health and safety protocols which throughout our stay made us feel very safe and secure at all times.  During check-in there was no transfer of a credit card which was nice.  There were hand sanitizer stations at all elevator banks and scattered throughout the hotels public space which was a great measure.  The protocol that gave us the most confidence was that each guest room door is completely sealed after being inspected and sanitized by housekeeping staff.  We literally had to peel the seal off to access our room and it felt good knowing that no person had entered the room after it was sanitized.  All in all, we had a great stay and want to encourage fellow travelers to stay at The James NoMad and visit the ever-energetic NYC!","travelDate":"2020-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We booked a suite but were unable to choose the beds at our time of booking, so I specifically called the hotel two days before arrival to confirm we could get the two queen bed suite (as there were 4 of us.) I spoke to Hector who assured me this would be no problem (and I figured that since it was COVID, this would be true given low occupancy.) \n\nWhen we arrived, of course, the story was different. The person at the front desk told me this was impossible as the rooms were booked (how could Hector not have known this two days before?!) So now we were unprepared. He promised me he would waive the resort fees to make up for it (this did not, but we made peace given it was out of his hands.) We pre-paid the hotel so assumed there would be no other charges (spoiler alert: my credit card has not one but two charges on it from The James and I never saw an invoice or approved said charges. Had to contact customer service to even find out what they are.)\n\nWe then got to our room and noticed that the bedroom was cool but the living room was sweltering hot. We had to go out to pick up supplies, so informed the hotel on our way out and they said they'd send up someone to look at it while we were out (COVID.) We returned back almost 2 hours later and assumed someone had looked at the AC (though there was no note or confirmation of this.) The living room was still sweltering. We finally called back down again and they let us know they were UNABLE TO REPAIR THE AC! Who does that?! Why did we have to call down to find out?! And they were willing to just leave us in the room hoping we'd not notice? \n\nThis was totally unacceptable of a hotel of this class. They ended up offering us another single room to sleep in for the night (this was at around 10 PM, and meant we wouldn't be together), which was fine, but I don't get how they just hoped we wouldn't notice. \n\nFinally we go down to check out in the morning, the lady tells me we're all set and we leave. I'm thinking that's the end of it, but again, now there's two charges on my credit card from this hotel that I never approved or even saw. \n\nHonestly - the room was fine (nothing special), the bathroom was very nice, it was very quiet given due to COVID there looked like there was perhaps no one else on the floor but overall the service was terrible. They did nothing to show us they wanted or appreciated our business. Really disappointed.","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"NONE"}

But, starting at 7:30am, I heard loud knocking somewhere on my floor that didn't stop. I assumed it was a rude guest, until I looked out my peep hole to see a hotel staff member BANGING on doors and sliding a piece of paper under them. When they got to my room (at 7:50am), they did 3 sets of loud knocks, and then slide a piece of paper under my door. It turned out to just be a printed summary of the charges for my room. I had no additional\/unexpected charges - just the standard hotel receipt. They then moved onto a room further down the hall.\n\nI would expect that kind of inconsiderate behavior from staff at a lower quality hotel, and was honestly shocked it would happen here - especially given it was a weekend day and they have later checkout times. I also may have expected it if there were a ton of added charges to my room, or some sort of payment issue, but that just wasn't the case.

We love NYC but have not been back in a while. We chose The James NoMad because we recognized the name, but remember the service from the Chicago location. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by all the hidden gems in this location. The first thing we both commented on was the very pleasant aroma that greets you every time you enter this building (I want my 'life' to smell like this). It is both welcoming and extraordinary. Plus the decor of the lobby sets the tone for things to come. It is both NYC modern chic and inviting with plenty of places to discover in little nooks. Guests are surprised nightly by free intimate events (like wine tastings). Our room was equally as inviting and spacious. The surprise in the room was just outside the window with a spectacular view of the Empire State building (amazing at night or in the snow). \n\nThe staff was memorable and helpful. We were able to \"chat up\" the front desk team as they were extremely helpful in finding the perfect suggestions for everything we requested. Special thanks to Jadda for her suggestions and attention when my wife was not feeling well. We felt comfortable and welcomed. \n\nFavorite moment was in the Sevilla basement bar. Live jazz, amazing cocktails and cool underground vibe. This is a unique and vibrant must for our next stay. Equally as awesome was my afternoon cocktail with upstairs bartender Ellio. Entertaining, educational and fun... best old fashioned ever from all the cities I have traveled... Spent the time trading notes on drinks and travel... Awesome. \n\nFinally, I have to say that our close proximity to landmarks in both north and south Manhattan within easy walking and entertainment options everywhere made this location the true unexpected treasure. We minimized long cab rides, avoided major traffic congestion, always felt safe walking, and never tired of trying the local spots. The James NoMad won our hearts and will keep us coming back...

The answer from the hotel was that they didn't have one available but that they will put us in a waiting list. The result was two nights, 3 people, sharing a double bed.

We are still guests of this hotel for another 5 nights but if we had not already prepaid would have checked out by now and paid more elsewhere! \nBefore leaving our home I emailed the hotel (4 days prior) to advise of our very late\/early arrival (27th) into NY requesting our room to be ready with sofa bed (as booked for 4pax) made up. Also requested a separate single extra bed at this time. Nobody replied for days and when they finally did they acknowledged our needs assuring us all was understood. Ah but after advising the extra cost of the rollaway which we had no problem with advised on the day of arrival but prior to checkin, they had none. So we check in at 2am 27 Jan & get to our room to find the sofa not made up. After 43 hours of straight travel (and very little sleep) from the Southern Hemisphere I am at 2am making up a sofa bed which I was not happy about. The extra bed we made out of two lounge cushions on the floor - just like camping! \nLater that day we go to use the safe for the first time only to discover it has been locked in the open position by previous guest\/staff? So a call to FD & security were prompt in responding. In the afternoon we return to the hotel and request to a lady on FD, two bottles of water (previously delivered in glass bottles & free of charge). Given the terrible service so far we then as a second measure ask the same of a man at FD. All bars covered one would think & I witness the man taking note of the impending delivery. We return after dinner and no surprise.. no water as requested to two staff members!! So we call down to In room dining, front desk & housekeeping to which the phone just rings out. I go down to FD personally aiming to collect rep bottles that I can fill with water, only to be told by Nia that they have run out of glass bottles hence no water but we can use the minibar water free of charge! Ensuring no charges are made I march back up very put out by the lack of care & attention to please the customer. This is our holiday and so far it\u2019s been very hard work! Americans self proclaim to offer the best service by world standards. All good in theory but how about you act on it. I would not stay here again & would not recommend this hotel purely due to the lack of service or even care to serving.

Got the \u2018jimmy suite\u2019 and was intending to stay for about ten days. I bailed out after 5. Here\u2019s why. \n\nThe staff are great on arrival. Front desk is friendly and helpful. But then you get to the room. \n\nMy \u2018suite\u2019 wasn\u2019t in the best state (damp patches on ceiling by window, peeling wall paper in bathroom) and the bathroom is literally the smallest I have ever had in a in NYC. As in - can\u2019t get in shower with bathroom door open, one person only at a time. No way on earth two people could ever use it. Their version of a \u2018suite\u2019 also weirdly includes only low sofas and a solitary coffee table. No desk. No chairs. Nowhere to work or eat. Just a granny style sitting room you\u2019d expect the furniture to have plastic wrapping in. \n\nSmallest TV I\u2019ve ever seen in a hotel in the bedroom, stuck in the corner behind the door. Really bad interior planning. Nowhere to open your suitcase and this is meant to be a suite? \n\nBut you can see what they\u2019re trying to do. That kind of old school thing that\u2019s worked at the Grand. But this hotel is small. So it doesn\u2019t have that scale. So it just feels a bit knackered. Room had the sort of cobbled together boho soft furnishing vibe you get in any Soho house - but way way cheaper and without that sense of warmth. \n\nI stayed at the other James in Soho and it\u2019s literally a class above this one. Was told this one used to be something else - a Carlton or something - got bought, had a \u2018refit\u2019 (a very skin deep refit methinks) and I just think they\u2019ve now ended up with mutton dressed as lamb. Marble sinks and bad service. \n\nIt is kind of trying to be like the Crosby (boutique, arty, high end) but simply doesn\u2019t have the chops, the budget, enough staff or the authentic depth to manage it. I wouldn\u2019t mind - but they\u2019re charging proper money for a product that the Ace hotel would find a little too cheap, tacky, superficial and lack lustre. \n\nThe restaurant is either super super busy in evenings (forget about getting a table without a reservation) or terribly disappointing in the mornings (apparently scrambled eggs and smoked salmon is just too much of a stretch and a simple request for some privacy which was agreed to before seating - was immediately revoked when 2 incoming diners were shown to the tables directly adjacent to mine when other tables were still empty - it was almost obtuse to the point of deliberate insensitivity. Ending up leaving and eating elsewhere). \n\nApparently there\u2019s a club but there too, hotel guests clearly aren\u2019t that welcome. I was a regular at the Gramercy in its heyday with the Rose bar in full swing. Always had a good time. Didn\u2019t feel even slightly interested here though given the cold vibe the door staff give out. Ended up at Indochine which was brilliant as usual. \n\nI heard stories about big tipping rappers and what not staying there so perhaps they were waiting for heavy tips before extending common courtesies. But seriously - this place is trying too hard to be something it\u2019s not - \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have the class of the Crosby. \nIt doesn\u2019t have the vibe of the Soho Grand. \nIt doesn\u2019t have the authenticity of the Gramercy. \nIt doesn\u2019t have the restaurant of the Bryant. \nIt doesn\u2019t have the energy of a boutique hotel like Soho House (loads of exhausted looking blokes wearing suits and Hugo Boss commuter coats with back packs squeezing into the lift for free lobby coffee in the mornings). Yet doesn\u2019t have the facilities of a business travellers hotel. \n\nSo what does it have?\n\nThe cleaning staff were really lovely. Mable did her job with good humour and clearly works hard - but there\u2019s only so much you can do when the carpets are stained, the windows haven\u2019t been cleaned from the outside for months and room temperature is controlled by those old school units under the windows that rumble through the night like a steam engine having a coughing fit. \n\nThe location is good. But the Royalton is literally at the end of the block which offers more for less money. \n\nThe lifts are nice. Old school marble. The minibar has nice snacks. Room service - can\u2019t even remember so couldn\u2019t have been too bad - but then again it can\u2019t have been that good can it. The gym is small but has all the basics. You can feel I\u2019m reaching here right. \n\nI wanted this place to be cool.  I really did. \n\nBut I think they\u2019ve just positioned themselves all wrong. \n\nToo much money for too little and the service for some things is just so bad you can\u2019t forgive it in a hotel of this size. Met another guest on arrival who was coming down to the lobby to try and get some towels as her room didn\u2019t have any. \n\nI rarely have a go like this but like I said - I had to check out and find somewhere else it got that frustrating.  \n\nEnded up at Nomo Soho - an old tried and trusted place. Wish I\u2019d gone there in the first place now. But hey - hindsight is a beautiful thing isn\u2019t it.  \n\nI can\u2019t recommend this place. Sorry. Not the fault of the staff.

All I want is for them to acknowledge there error and give me back credit to my bank but instead i\u2019m left to dispute charges through my bank and honestly the hotel was just not worth this headache.\n\nI stayed in a King Size Room but had to pay $45 when I checked in to upgrade to this room because the Queen rooms were \u201cnot ready\u201d.

My room phone wasn\u2019t working which lost them money on room service because that was never resolved issue when I mentioned it to fron desk but I will say the bathroom was nicely upgraded however it was a very small sink area.\n\nAll in all - A lot of better hotels charging the same prices in similar areas that offer better service. I wouldn\u2019t stay here again because of the bad service I experienced from my weekend stay. Is there really anything worst then being overcharged during the holidays? Yes.

This trip was 2 nights personal and 3 nights business.  The location of this hotel was perfect for my needs, at the corner of 29th and Madison.  It was in an area that felt safe and was a short walk to the office where I was working.  It\u2019s also only a few blocks from 5th Avenue shopping and the Empire State building.\n\nAs for the hotel itself, it was clean, up to date, and the staff was friendly.  Unfortunately, it always felt dark and cramped, even in the lobby and restaurant areas.  I know that space is an issue in NY, but my \u201csuite\u201d was barely large enough to move around in and the bathroom had just enough room to turn around, but only if the door was closed.  The \u201ccloset\u201d was also very tiny with only 4 hangers, so I had to keep most of my clothes folded instead of hanging them.  It was almost comical, definitely the smallest hotel room I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n \nWashcloths were not provided in the room the first 2 days, so I asked housekeeping to send some.  I received them promptly, but once those were used, I received no replacements.  It\u2019s odd that something as simple as a washcloth is not a standard amenity in the room.  Glasses or cups were also not available in the room.  It would have been nice to have these in the room to drink water, but I guess then I wouldn\u2019t have been forced to buy the $12 bottle of water in the mini bar.  And beware of the room service menus.  The prices are listed, but at the bottom in small print you are informed that not only is a 20% gratuity added, but also an $8 delivery fee.  So room service isn\u2019t really an amenity either.\n\nThere was free coffee in the lobby in the mornings and at times there was water available there too, which was nice to have.  I didn\u2019t have an opportunity to try wine and cheese in the afternoon, but it\u2019s a nice gesture for guests.\n\nI would stay here again when traveling alone for business because the location and area are perfect for that, but due to the size of the room, I would probably look elsewhere for a personal stay.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I remember when this first opened and always wanted to try it out. I got a great rate for one of the suites. A big disappointment! First off - customer service was terrible! I checked in around 9am (completely understanding that the room would probably not be ready and I would just leave my bag) - the 2 people at the front desk were not friendly or approachable. I\u2019m pretty sure the man who checked me in didn\u2019t even smile! He pre-registered me and said they would call as soon as the room was ready...I returned to the hotel at 5:45 and hadn\u2019t received one call from the hotel all day!!!! When I mentioned to another gentleman at the front desk checking me in his response was \u201cI just got here I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t call you\u201d Nice. And he had the nerve to have an attitude when I asked for 2 keys! \nI left for dinner and called the front desk asking for turn down service. I had to call 3 times before someone picked up and then talk to someone for 5 minutes explaining what I meant by turn down service. So take a guess - I returned to my room and there was no turndown service- no made up bed, fresh towels etc...\nLastly, checking out this morning at 9am I was met with the same man who checked me in the previous morning. He had the same aloof attitude and because I had breakfast in the restaurant couldn\u2019t provide me a receipt at that time but said he would email it to me shortly...it\u2019s 3 hours later and I still do not have my receipt. I will not be returning to the James Nomad.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The staff is in a perpetual state of indifference and certainly don\u2019t bother trying to hide their displeasure of being inconvenienced when asked for an extra blanket or if there\u2019s an emergency because the fire alarm is going off (it went off twice last night). They either put the front desk and housekeeping lines on silent or completely ignore them. We had to go down to reception and ask if something was wrong with our phone as no one from housekeeping, in room dining or the front desk picked up the phone when we called. The front desk woman didn\u2019t bother looking up from her computer or speak to us. Another staff member came out from the side door and starting complaining to us about what a bad day they\u2019ve had. He never asked what we needed. The only redeeming quality about this hotel is that Scarpetta is located inside but still not worth staying there. Our hands were full of luggage and The door man actually asked if we wanted him to open the door! Lastly, it appears they spent all their money on new carpet and paint and didn\u2019t bother with sound control. You can hear the room doors next to you opening and closing and people taking in the hallway. If you can hear that, I\u2019m sure you can imagine how loud all the street noise is. Zero insulation\/sound control  measures were taken. If you expect horrendous service and blatant rudeness from all the staff then this hotel is for you. Otherwise, there are plenty of other hotels in the area that are far superior.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Housekeeping didn't replace amenities so we had to call and wait for toilet paper. We had to go find our own towels because we never got them. One person forgot a toothbrush. It took them over 24 hours to bring one (by then she had bought one and was using my toothpaste). Also, when we were leaving we mentioned to the front desk how we were upset that they never answered the phone when we called from the room (we even tried calling from our cells to see if they'd answer) and they said that it wasn't their fault they didn't answer. No apology, which at the bare minimum they could have said \"Oh sorry for any inconveniences.\" Nope. Just wasn't their fault. I've had better service at worse rated hotels or Airbnbs. Oh, and they had all these deals and events listed in their elevator for the month we stayed and when we went to the coffee shop to get it, they said the deal never existed and they had no clue what we were talking about.

I had several concerns\/complaints that I thought was fair to share with them to give them a chance to fix it, they responded with mockery. For example, I was calling the front desk, operator, housekeeping...trying to find someone to answer yet no one answered. I finally called the restaurant and someone answered. But they couldn\u2019t help me with my request. The restaurant worker walked to the front desk to relay my message yet no one from the front desk called me back. I came downstairs to find the staff chit chatting. I told them that no one was answering and their response was \u201cis your phone working? Maybe it\u2019s not working.\u201d Then how did I reach the restaurant?? And isn\u2019t it their responsibility to make sure the phone works well...why even ask me the question? She also acknowledged that the restaurant worker relayed my message. Then why didn\u2019t anyone contact me back??\n\nThey charge a hotel fee that covers water. They didn\u2019t fill up the water for 2 days. When I asked for water, they gave me tap water in a reusable glass bottle. When I asked for bottled water, the supervisor said \u201cmust you really have bottled water?\u201d  It\u2019s a 4 star hotel and I expect 4 star service and amenities. We had no amenities in the bathroom on day of arrival. I called to tell them that and they brought 1 soap. \n\nTo summarize, the treatment we got was as if they were doing us a big favor by allowing us to stay in their \u201cpalace\u201d, which has dirty windows, rooms without the amenities that was promised (or any amenities for that matter), and staff who really don\u2019t care. \n\nI travel a lot for business and leisure.

So, I stored my luggage with them, spent some time working in the lobby where the Wi-Fi was excellent and went to my business lunch and meetings.\n\nArrived back around 5:0 pm, and they quickly gave the keys to my room.  The room itself was fine, but its stench was intolerable - it appeared like a heavy smoker had done a lot of smoking there.  I called them and they promptly offered to send ventilation equipment to the room, but it would require that I be out of the room for over an hour.  This would have been fine as I had a business dinner to go to, but considering the amount I was paying for this hotel, I went downstairs and asked if I could get another room.  The first response was that they were fully booked, but with some gentle urging they found another room, which turned out to be an upgraded room as it was huge and more upscale than the first room.\n\nWhat's interesting is that this room too has a distant whiff of the stench - perhaps it traveled through the ventilation system.  But this room overall was perfect.  The room sizes of both rooms were huge by New York City standards.\n\nScarpetta is a lovely restaurant, and it does amazing breakfast too with avocado toast and poached eggs.  The check-out was quick, but at first they were unable to print receipts because their management company was changing and they were getting a new system.  Had to call later to ensure I got the receipt.\n\nThe location is super convenient, within walking distance of a lot of sights and venues.  There are lots of great restaurants nearby.  \n\nIt has a great bar in the basement that is fully stocked and open till very early in the morning.  This bar just got rated among the top 50 best bars in the word by CNN Travel.\n\nOverall, the service is variable and can stand to improve, though when it's good, it's really good.

The lobby offers plenty of seating with great atmosphere and complimentary coffee in the AM and a wine and cheese happy hour. All in all a great stay and I would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting the city.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

JAMES NOMAD HOTEL ON MADISON!!! BEWARE if you do not want to be ripped off!  My account this morning was robbed by them, and they do not want to do anything about it, are not taking it seriously, and referring me to numbers that are not answering and denying me to speak with a Manager.   IS THIS A WAY FOR A PRESIGIOUS NYC HOTEL TO DO BUSINESS??? YES OR NO?  I say NO!!!  WHERE DO I BEGIN????  How about BEWARE!!! I was having a happy Saturday morning until I tried to use my debit card which was rejected.  I panicked and said why is this happening, I just got PAID yesterday!  As an elderly and disabled woman trying to live on one paycheck after my divorce of 27 years, I was robbed of over $500 today, and they will try to commit theft on my account for ANOTHER $500+ tonight.    Now my car payment is rejected, and after bills I am left with $29 to live on for the next TWO WEEKS.  I WILL BE FILING A COMPLAINT ABOUT MY TREATMENT WITH BBB.  Both I and Booking.com tried relentlessly to deal with them this morning until late afternoon.\n\nI have been given nothing but the runaround from the time I began calling.  They claimed I am not in the system and it is not their fault.  Why rob $500 from my checking account then?? I was told to call Booking.com com, who were LOVELY and tried desperately to help me.  THEY could NOT get in touch with the hotel until I GAVE them the number that my bank gave me regarding the withdrawal.  The wonderful lady from Booking.com tried her hardest to get in touch with St. JAMES MOMAD Hotel.  NO ANSWER.  I told her to try the number my bank gave me.  She did, and after I waited 45 minutes for her to return to the line, Booking.com said she spoke with a Director of St. JAMES NOMAD finally, that said she looked the reservation up, said it was cancelled on AUGUST 5th, and admitted they should not have taken my money.  Now, still, no reversal.  I can go in my local $ General Store and get an immediate reversal let alone a prestigious hotel!! Ludicrous.  WHO is hiring for this place.  Are they educated? Are they trained?  Lousy management skills and lousy help that cannot answer questions \u2013 TRIAIN YOUR PEOPLE.  TRY paying your help more, and getting decent help for your $500 per night rooms.\n\nAlthough the theft from my account came directly from St. JAMES MOMAD Hotel, they denied they did it, and said Booking.com did it.  So after bouncing around from phone call to phone call, I finally found the most wonderful representative and QUALIFIED, both in customer service and their business\u2019s knowledge protocol at Booking.com, I found out the deduction from my bank account would come from Amsterdam where Booking.com\u2019s major headquarter is, not the St. James NOMAD HOTEL had they done it.  First lie the hotel told me.  Second, I was told by a manager that there was no record that I had a reservation for Sept 20th or 21st  2019 in their system, 2nd LIE.  So then:  WHY WAS I ROBBED for over $500 from my checking account this morning by them??????\n\nWhen Booking.com called them back with the number I had to give her, Nancy the Director said \u201cOh yes, here is the cancelled reservation in the database\u201d.  Ok, you are WRONG \u2013 give me back my money!!!!  Do the reversal you told Booking.com you said you were going to do!  Furthermore, Nancy the Director, denied me ANY compensation for my returned car payment and other bills I was planning to pay with my paycheck which I got yesterday and NO APOLOGY, (ESSENTIALLY \u2013 TOUGH LUCK  - ITS OUR FAULT AND WE DON\u2019T GIVE A CRAP about the trouble we caused this woman.     AND THEIR MISTAKE?  IS THIS GOOD BUSINESS ETHICS??? PRESTIGIOUS HOTEL???? I THINK NOT!!!!!!  On the other hand, Booking.com did all they could to rectify this, and felt so bad about what I was going through because of this hotel that they offered to compensate me one of the fees for $27, although it was not their responsibility to do so, where the hotel manager, Nancy, flatly said \u201cNOT GIVING ANY BANK FUND reimbursements from overdraws\u201d.  WOW!  Now that\u2019s a good way to get a good name around town!  I was done wrong and I am furious.   Upper management \u2013 get qualified people \u2013 pay them more and maybe you will get competent and educated people that have good communication skills and don\u2019t just shrug off customers in trouble to numbers and extensions that don\u2019t work because they don\u2019t want to be bothered.  Very furious over this mishandling of my situation.  My advice upper to MANAGEMENT \u2013 take a good look how your hotel is being run by unqualified people, and maybe you won\u2019t have to see another review like this.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They asked us to take a seat as their manager investigates. 30 mins later he comes over! Basically telling me air miles is closed and there is nothing they can do. I asked if we can book the room on credit card and figure out the payment with air miles the next day. He was agreeable to this. By the time we got into our room the process had taken well over an hour and we had to cancel some of our other pre made plans. No compensation was offered. The next day I phoned air miles who were very helpful and pleasant. They stayed on the phone with me through the whole process. We got the mangers name that day (Nancy) and this was escalated with her. They fixed the payment after about one hour of being on the phone... as the hotel staff was inept. I asked the front desk staff (not the manager) while I was on hold if this happens a lot he said that they were changing systems and that it has in fact been happening a lot with air miles bookings and that it needs to be addressed by management (this is their own staff saying this). I was on the phone with air miles still and I asked them why this happened? They also communicated to me that the hotel had changed their emails and not updated the booking websites. While all this was happening I found several other people encountering the same problem and the hotel telling them they are fully booked so they don\u2019t have any place to put them. Once air miles resolved the problem I spoke to the manager (Nancy). This was quite the experience. I told her that air miles said that it was the hotels fault she denied this. She said they never got the email so not their problem. I said even still I have now wasted most of my morning dealing with this and that not my problem. It shouldn\u2019t be the guests responsibility to do all the work to figure out what is going on wrong. I told her this is terrible customer service and that I deserve to be compensated for my lost time and stress. This is when she got confrontational and told me that I was just fortunate to have gotten a room last night because they could have just told me there\u2019s nothing they can do. I said that is the hotels responsibility to its guest to fix issues that come up not kick guests to the curb. She reiterated that we were just lucky enough to stay there in a very aggressive manner which took me back as I was very calm the whole time. The front desk agent that was next to her actually had to physically push her back and say she would take it from here. That agent apologized and said she would speak to her GM and try and figure out something to apologize. She took down my number. I never received a call.

We booked as part of a Virgin Holidays package, which included flights and transfers. \n\nWe received a warm welcome on arrival at the James and were upgraded to a larger room by the receptionist when we mentioned it was my partner's first time in NYC. We'd had a long trip and it was really nice to have such a great welcome. The room was much bigger than I'd ever had in a NYC hotel and it was immaculately clean (like the rest of the hotel). The furnishings were quirky, without being ridiculous, and there was plenty of hanging and storage space. \n\nThe bathroom, as well as containing the largest sink either of us had ever seen, was functional with a hot, powerful shower. The complimentary products were superb quality and, as someone who is trying to reduce my plastic footprint, I was pleased to see the large bottles, which could be refilled. \n\nThe hotel offers coffee and fruit in the mornings alongside a free wine and cheese event every evening from 5pm to 6pm. On Wednesday, the wine and cheese comes with a side-order of live music; a brilliant way to relax before a night out. Although neither the wine nor cheese were particularly to my taste, others were certainly enjoying them. Perhaps the hotel could look at their use of single-use cups to help reduce their plastic footprint further? \n\nAll of the staff were friendly and efficient. Reception were happy to help with our transfer when we were having some phone-related issues and the guys on the front desk were helpful and always had a quip. Great service from everyone - congratulations!\n\nMy partner and I didn't make use of either the hotel bar or restaurant - with so many options on the doorstep, we just didn't get the chance! However, they were certainly busy whenever we were coming back to the hotel in the evening - not that we would have known from our room, which despite overlooking the road was almost sound-proofed. We had great wi-fi connectivity in the room and in the lobby, and the wide-range of channels on the TV system was much appreciated. \n\nThank you to everyone at the James for making our stay such a great one - can't wait to do it again!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Perfect for our 5 night stay as a couple in NYC.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-08-09","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This review is based on my 5 night stay here with my husband in the Guestroom with King Bed in June 2019. \n\n--GETTING THERE & LOCATION-- \nThe hotel is a 45min Uber ride from JFK Airport for us but it's very easily accessible via Subway also (11min walk from Penn Station and 15min walk from Grand Central). \n\nOn top of that, it's walking distance from some of the main attractions we wanted to see. It was our first time in NYC so this was quite important for us! The landmarks nearby are: The Flatiron Building & Union Square, Madison Square Park, Macy\u2019s Herald Square, Empire State Building and Top of the Rock NYC. \n\nIt's also surrounded by a lot of cafes, restaurants, pubs and convenience stores. A lot of them were open late night which really helped because we were extremely jetlagged and awake until about 3am most days! \n\n-- THE HOTEL ROOM-- \nWe stayed in the Guest Room with a King Bed which was surprisingly quiet (we thought it would be much busier in Manhattan). The room was comfortable, clean and spacious room and we kind of felt like we had just moved into our very own NYC apartment haha.\n\nThere were also all the hotel amenities we needed: body and skincare products, strong WiFi, stocked mini bar and pantry, hotel robe and slippers, ironing facilities, hair dryer, in-room safe, in-room dining, bed head USB ports, air conditioner, TV. No complaints there! \n\n-- DINING & RESTAURANTS -- \nThere are three dining options available at the hotel:\n\n- Scarpetta: Italian Restaurant open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Although we didn\u2019t dine here, this seemed to be quite busy at most hours of the day and had great reviews online.\n- The Seville: This is a classic NYC style cocktail lounge and a hotspot on the weekend. It\u2019s open from 4pm till late night and there is a bar menu available also. Cocktails are great!\n- In-room Dining: There\u2019s a breakfast, lunch, dinner and kids menu available for in-room dining. But to be honest there were so many food options around the hotel that we didn\u2019t get to order any in-room food. I guess this does come in handy for any lazy nights when you just feel like curling up in the comfort of your bed though. \n\nIn the lounge area (located at the lobby) there is also free coffee, tea, fruit infused water and fruit available every hour.\n\nOn our check-out day we had a very early flight so it was very convenient to be able to grab a coffee and a snack on the go.\n\nThere is also a wine tour available daily in the late afternoon that we wish we had time to experience (maybe next time!)\n\n-- ACTIVITIES & WELLNESS --\nThere are also a few different wellness activities:\n\n- Boxing Class: This was hosted at a local Throwdown Boxing Studio every Wednesday morning at 8am and is complimentary for guests if you make a reservation at the front desk.\nYoga Class: This was hosted with Yoga Spark and runs every Sunday from 10:30am-11:30am. Guests are required to make a reservation at the front desk.\n24 Hour Fitness Centre: The gym is open 24\/7 for guests.\n- In-room Massage: We didn\u2019t get to take advantage of this but the hotel also offers same-day in-room massages upon request also.\n\n-- SUMMARY -- \nOverall, this hotel was very comfortable, spacious, easily accessible with reliable customer service and all the hotel amenities we needed. We settled in very well into our hotel room and would have happily extended our stay if we needed to.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for somewhere with a central location that isn\u2019t buzzing with the sounds from the busy streets, this is a great option and highly recommended for couples, families and business travellers too (there are meeting & conference rooms available also).","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Good location for subway and tourist attractions. Staff were friendly and helpful. There was a good selection of minibar items for sale.

I was not inspired to bother with this thereafter. Cold bottled water was available in the rooms but you had to phone housekeeping for this even though there was a mini bar.\n\nThe free wifi was poor and could only cope with basic tasks like email & WhatsApp. Even the paid wifi was not adequate to download videos.\n\nThe rooms were not inspiring either. We were upgraded from queen rooms to king rooms which was a bonus. Despite this, the rooms felt cramped. There was only a small wardrobe with 2 drawers and a small circular table with a single dining style chair.

We just flew in from Europe so we\u2019re feeling tired and hoping to check-in early so we could rest.  We were so happy when without even having to request it we were quickly given our keys and allowed to go up to our room.  I had booked one of their James suites and it did not disappoint.  The size of the room was like having our own apartment and we both commented that we felt like we were living in NYC again if only for a night. Although the building itself is older and the windows not as sound proofed as they are in other places the noise at night was not noticeable and we were able to sleep well in the very comfortable king size bed.  There is a wine hour in the late afternoon but we did not partake in it since we were napping. There is no coffee in the room but I was able to go to the lobby in the morning to grab some and it was good.  They also had tea and fruit infused water as well as fresh fruit to grab and go.  What made this hotel really stand out for me was the friendly and helpful staff.  Everyone we met had a smile on his or her face from the bell hop to the front desk to the managers and housekeeping!

I assumed it was just so hot that the A\/C couldn't keep up, but on our last night, a staff member stopping by noticed how hot it was and suggested Engineering check our A\/C.  Long story short - they moved us to a new room which was bliss!  I was appreciative but couldn't believe we suffered in the hot room almost the entire stay (housekeeping didn't notice the hot room?). I didn't really expect credit for the sweaty days & nights, but at the same time I was surprised nothing was offered (complimentary cocktails or cold drinks?).  The next day when we were leaving, a pair of my shoes were missing.  Looked everywhere in the room, had Housekeeping check the old room - no luck. I spoke to the Manager and explained (calmly) that if the A\/C had worked, we wouldn't have had to change rooms and my shoes wouldn't have gotten lost in the transfer.  He was polite but only offered to take my contact info in the event they should turn up.  Again, no offer to reimburse the cost of the shoes or any other accommodation.

I rarely stay in hotels since my family prefers vacation rentals for more space when we travel, but I needed something close to several Midtown meeting sites and this fit the bill. I loved the James New York - NoMad's location. I walked everywhere I needed to be.\n\nPlus, the hotel itself is very quiet, despite being in a very loud and urban area. I occasionally hear police sirens, but other than that, it's quieter than many small city hotels I've stayed in.\n\nI did not partake in the morning coffee\/fruits, as I stayed on California time and didn't get up until 9 am, and they only offer it 6:30-8:30 am. I had work events but I did stop by one afternoon and saw the large cheese platter and bottles of white wine. There was also a large dispenser of \"spa water\" but I did not try it.\n\nIn the room itself, the wardrobe is a bit tight (I brought 3 dresses and had to squeeze them into the narrow left side for long items). The cool retro mini-fridge had an array of expensive treats ($10 water bottle!). When I checked in, the front desk clerk told me I could have one item for free, a snack or non-alcoholic beverage, so I grabbed the giant $10 bottle of water. I haven't checked out yet, so let's hope I understood him correctly and I don't get charged $10!\n\nI normally prefer King beds, but since I was alone, the queen was more than sufficient. The bed was dressed with nice linens and a down comforter duvet, too. The room also has its own thermostat and the unit was relatively quiet. The fancy lighting system took me a minute to figure out. I also couldn't figure out why the ceiling light fixture over the table turned itself on at 9 am every day. Good thing I brought an eye mask!\n\nNote that the light switches for the tiny bathroom are BEHIND the giant barn door. I spent a good 2 minutes walking in and out of the bathroom trying to find the switches and almost called the front desk. You have to completely close the barn door, turn on the lights, and then completely open them again. That's not very intuitive at all! \n\nYes, it's small but it's NYC. A spacious hotel room here would cost twice as much (or maybe 3 times?). I was in room 403, at the end of the hallway, For one person, there's plenty of space to walk, put down a suitcase, and even do a little yoga or martial arts routines. See photos! I will say it's too bad my room overlooked AC ventilation ducts on the roof.\n\nI did work from my home one afternoon and the WiFi is strong. I also was able to print a boarding pass downstairs in the lobby computer workstation\/printer.\n\nFinally, the staff were uniformly helpful and pleasant. I had Caviar deliver some food from Russ & Daughters and they refrigerated it for me while I was at a work event. I otherwise wouldn't have had time to go there so I was thrilled to have some great smoked salmon, sturgeon, and sable while here.\n\nI'd definitely return to this hotel the next time I had business in Midtown.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":12197432,"title":"Perfect for a family of four","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"The James Hotel was our saving grace after an Airbnb host cancelled on us a week before our travel dates. I selected this hotel as one suite option offered two bathrooms which is critical for my family and I. Upon arrival, I was nervous because we arrived later than anticipated and our room was not ready. We were tired and hungry, but thankfully only waited about 10-15 minutes. We were assigned The Jimmy Suite (room 1412) which is a lovely corner suite and for 475 square feet, it felt surprisingly spacious. What we loved most was the decor and the 2 bathrooms. That alone makes this an ideal hotel for a traveling family of 4. The Midtown location is great - we walked everywhere for our basic necessities and with the subway station being a short walk away, it was a great location for our home base. The front door concierge was EXCEPTIONAL. They offered food suggestions and arranged our ride to the airport. We were always greeted with a smile by members of the staff and received a welcome bottle of wine,  chocolates for us, and gummy bears for our children. Lastly, the beds are incredible. All four of us slept in every single day. \n\nI only have two critiques for this establishment. Our suite had small flying insects everyday. I believe it is because there is a plant in the room. Though lovely, tiny insects like that tend to call plants home and with the minimal decor, a plant really isn't needed. \n\nAlso, a tiny thing about housekeeping. On our first day we noticed a card about housekeeping only replacing towels on the floors which we support as we wish to conserve resources. No matter what we did, our towels were replaced daily unnecessarily. We didn't want to be wasteful. One day, we had new towels with false eyelashes stuck to them. Lastly, we tried to tip housekeeping daily and they never took the tip until we left a note insisting that they take it. I don't know if not receiving tips is a New York thing, but that was odd. Finally, full sized bath products are advertised, and photos are body wash are in the advertisements, but there is no body wash. \n\nAll in all, this was a great stay and we will stay here again when we travel as a family.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived by taxi and there are about half dozen steps to the hotel door, the concierge kindly opened the door for us at the top but didn\u2019t bother to help any of us with a bag or suitcase.  \n\nCheck-in (early) reception staff, very helpful staff allocated us our rooms, gave us a run down of what was included, cheese and wine in the evening, coffee in the morning, one free non-alcoholic item each day from the mini bar, wifi details etc., (might be helpful for a little list, as we had to ask again later for timings).\n\nRoom \u2013 Double Queen \u2013 When I booked the hotel having read the reviews I knew that the rooms were compact\/small but thought that we were mainly in New York to see New York and not spend too much time in the hotel.  The room was small and very dimly lit, had to open the blinds to get some light into the room which opens up the fact that your rooms are overlooked (back of hotel) so be mindful of others being able to see you!!  \n\nThere is literally no-where to put anything (a small wardrobe in the corner of the room and a coffee table) we used the coffee table as a dumping ground and lived out of our suitcase for the days we were there. Inside the wardrobe \u2013 dressing gown, slippers, iron and ironing board, maybe room to hand a few items. \n\nThe bathroom, lighting very poor, complementary shampoo\/body lotion etc., however we didn\u2019t need to use them as we had our own. Again not much room to place your toothbrush and toiletries.  Shower power \u2013 excellent.  Good selection of towels including face cloth.\n\nHairdryer \u2013 which I found in a drawer in the bathroom.  Using the hairdryer was an uncomfortable experience. No plug socket near a mirror, lead on the hairdryer very short, I ended up sat on the floor in-between the bed and room door, I had the wardrobe door propped open with my suitcase at the other end of the room which had a mirror inside, and felt like I was playing peek-a-boo just to get my hair dried. FARCE. Appreciate the building is old and maybe wasn\u2019t originally built as a hotel, a bit of planning\/designing would have given some customer comfort.\n\nBed \u2013 The comfiest bed I have ever slept in, in a hotel. Bedding and Pillows great. What a great night\u2019s sleep!! \n\nRoom information pack \u2013 couldn\u2019t find it. Would have helped with remembering the rules and times of the services.\n\nOur room was cleaned and were given fresh towels, which was unexpected.\n\nFree Coffee in the Morning \u2013 At the reception seating area - A good opportunity for a quick drink in a paper cup, whilst waiting for your fellow travellers\/taxi. Coffee\/Tea\/Apples available.\n\nWe didn\u2019t use the cheese and wine service as per out exploring.\n\nLocation \u2013 The hotel is in a fabulous location for getting about and sight-seeing, we walked, used Lyft and Uber to explore Manhattan. Didn\u2019t hear any noise from outside.\n\nCheck-Out \u2013 I had emailed the hotel before we travelled to get the check-out time (to help with sight-seeing and airport taxi planning) and were emailed 2pm. However, at the hotel we were told 12 noon and were not flexible even though I had the email. On check-out we were told nothing to pay (we had pre-paid).  Again, no help from the concierge with our bags to our taxi.\n\nCustomer Services on our return home \u2013 website \u2013 One Good, One Bad.  When both couples returned home we checked our credit cards, we had both had charges on our accounts. I would assume it was for the one non-alcoholic item from the mini bar, (one water, one cola). \n\nCouple one \u2013 full refund within 24 hours. \nCouple two (me)  - Automatic responses, promise from the web team our query would be dealt with by accounts. We got completely ignored \u2013 in the end we disputed the transaction through our credit card company, had to have new credit cards issued and the issue was resolved by our credit card company. Still no response from the hotel, thanks for the inconvenience). \n\nOverall the hotel was as expected, a few disappointing aspects, but a great location and slept in a comfy bed after a really busy day of sightseeing!!  \n\nWould I book again? - NO\nWould I recommend? \u2013 If you\u2019re not fussy \u2013 perhaps just for the bed and location\u2026.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It has individual temperature control in the rooms (which actually works!!) is quiet, has super modern plumbing and clean; pristine. It has an exercise facility which I did not use, and a restaurant, but I only had room service breakfast, which was fine and delivered quickly.  They serve something in the lobby around tea time, and fruit with coffee in the AM. It really is a 4.5 hotel, but only because it isn't palatial, or rather the lobby isn't palatial, because we all know about the grand old hotels that are beautiful in the lobby, but not necessarily in the rooms.  I highly recommend the hotel, and I've stayed in several in NYC over the years.  I am from NY originally, own a condo there, but do not live in it. Hence the stay in hotels when I visit.  Sometimes very central in NY, such as over looking Central Park, you are paying for location and nothing more; absolutely nothing more.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

Bathroom nice and toiletries provided and replaced daily. Beds made and fresh towels daily too! Tv in room and also bar (not free!) didn\u2019t have any of the bar but as well as your usual alcohol, soft drinks, crisps and chocolate I noticed there was also the option to buy useful things like adaptors which I thought was great! Also a little something there for the adults at bed time if you catch my drift!! \nStaff were so friendly and helpful! Couldn\u2019t do enough for you! Really really great!

Let us check out a couple of hours later too! All the staff we spoke to went out of their way, especially Dan, thank you!\nThe free cheese, wine and crackers were such a nice touch!

The staff was professional, despite some very difficult customers. I was checking in next to a couple who had apparently just made an online reservation. Immediately, the man next to me became irate and started to berate the hotel staff member who kept his cool and quietly informed the gentleman that since they booked the room online, they would need to wait a few minutes for it to hit their system. Surprisingly, that was not good enough and the man continued his tirade, completely unprovoked. Finally, several minutes later, it was all settled - I like to think of this as a good reminder - people have a job to do, so let them do it. Kudos to the training staff and to the professional staff of this hotel - customer facing jobs are difficult and sometimes that means dealing with people like this.

The manager on duty showed us 2 other rooms and we ended up settling for the 1st one, but it was great to have the option and see what else might work. The rooms are nice and clean and modern. We ordered room service on New Year's eve and brought it to the lobby and played cards till midnight. It was a very rainy night so staying in was perfect for us. We had a view from our lobby window seat (when the clouds let up) of the Empire State Building and that was cool. I love this location because it's easy to get uptown or downtown from here. And it's close to Madison Square Park which I love. I would definitely stay here again!","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Just enough to fit the bed, no window with a view or space for a desk; which wasn't great for business purposes. Felt like they could have included a desk at the very least. Because of the space (or lack there of) could not relax in the room. The walls were very thin - there were people shouting in the corridors at all hours (esp on weekends) which would wake us up. It could've also done with a more thorough clean. I had lost the back of an earring so was searching the floors - it definitely could've done with a vacuum!

This was our first time staying in NYC, we've taken day trips from Philadelphia, but this time we wanted to stay a little longer. We booked The James Nomad as it was part of the LHRC through our Chase card. Maybe we had high expectations. We pulled up to valet and there was no one to be found, we waited a good ten minutes then just decided to find garage parking nearby. we arrived around 1 and our room was ready. However, as part of our Chase parks, we were able to get a free upgrade to a Jimmy Suite, which was not ready. Was told we'd get a call when it was. We never got a call. \n\nThe room itself was spacious - for NYC. It was like 2 rooms put together...there was one main entrance then split into 2 rooms - one had a King size bed and a bathroom and the other had a sofa bed and a bathroom. Although we had 2 bathrooms, they were tiny! No counters space and the hair dryer did not work. There was a decent view from our window, but the windows were dirty. There were dirty spots here and there, think housekeeping could've done a better job.  \n\nDining - There's a mini bar that was conveniently stocked with drinks and snacks, but its pricey. We, fortunately, has a credit so we did utilize some items and the room service as well. We did order a lobster roll from room service, and it was HORRIBLE. It tasted like can tuna. We couldn't even finish it. And with the fees, tax, and tip, it was over $50.The worst experience however was our 2 free breakfast that was included with our credit car offer. We took our vouchers down to Scarpitta and was offered pastries and coffee for the vouchers. NO meat, fruits, anything. We were appalled, so we just left.\n\nDuring checkout the room service and mini bar items were taken off the bill (from our credit); however, it showed up on my credit card a few days later. It took forever to reach someone about it, but it was eventually credited back to me. The good things about the hotel is the location - we walked to Korea town and Empire State building. And the lobby is pretty nice. Customer Service was neither here nor there. Being a Chase sapphire reserve card holder, there was no special treatment as stated when booking, but that's ok.

There should be a kettle in the room instead of telling the guest to get the coffee\/tea at the lobby since it's inconvenient for guests to go down for a cup of hot water\/tea.  I believe with such rate that you charge for the hotel ($350 per night) you could afford to provide kettle in the room.

We chose The James as although it seemed more modern as opposed to cool and contemporary, we would be moving on to another in Brooklyn two days later and so wanted to spend a little less on our Manhattan hotel. My expectation therefore wasn't particularly high, especially as reviews hadn't been great (although it looks like the reviews on here have been reset?). Anyway, I was wrong. This was a really great hotel, very accommodating and for that reason, the better of the two hotels during our trip. \n\nWe were welcomed by two doormen and helped with our bags. Check in was fast and our room was ready. Expedia had sent me a $20 food and beverage credit plus we were advised that we were each allowed a complimentary mini bar item each night.\n\nRoom was one of the smallest they do but still a good size - bathroom was really quite big! Mini bar was cool - looks a bit art deco and good variety of items. Comfy bed, thick soft towels and useful bathroom items such as shower hat. No view really but this is Manhattan and the 6th floor so didnt expect one. Small wardrobe but as we were only staying for 2 nights, we didnt really unpack. Plus American Airlines had lost our bag so we had nothing to unpack on night one anyway!!\n\nWe went to the hotel's speakeasy Seville Bar a for a few (gorgeous) cocktails whilst discussing where to go to buy some items of clothing to get us through the evening and the girl behind the bar was very friendly and offered up some places to go. But not before we enjoyed the complimentary cheese and wine in the lobby.\n\nThe weather was horrendous and so both days the door guys offered us umbrellas and went to find more when they had run out. When our bag finally arrived, it was brought up straight away after calling reception as it arrived in the middle of the night. We found the baggage guy and doormen to be really great - Julio in particular made sure doors were opened, umbrellas were available and taxis if we needed them. \n\nWe didn't have breakfast in the hotel but a cup of coffee in the lobby area was useful and it was a nice bright place to stay in. Wifi was good and everywhere was clean and tidy. I really liked the minimal Christmas tree in reception too!\n\nThis hotel is in a fantastic location and I'd recommend. I really like the Nomad area as its easy to get to on the Green Subway line so makes travelling from the Airport on subway relatively easy, but also its right by the Empire State - such an amazing building and a great marker for knowing where you are!","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This hotel was clean, staff friendly and sufficiently attentive but, 4-star it is not.  Even for NYC.  The location is great \u2013 perfect for someone wanting to visit the touristy spots.  The rooms are small with no space for your luggage.  My husband and I had two carry-on size bags \u2013 there was a ledge we used for one bag and we had to use the table-top and radiator for the other.  The door barely cleared the bed when it was open\/closed.  If he wanted to hold the door open for me, he had to straddle the bed corner to do so.  The bathroom was cramped without sufficient usable space for toiletries.  Our items fell into the sink so many times that we kept a towel over the sink whenever it was not in use.  You cannot have the bathroom door open while getting ready because then you cannot stand in front of the mirror.  I have lived in NYC, I have visited numerous times, stayed in many a hotel\u2026 this isn\u2019t the case of not understanding NYC sizes.

We will definitely return.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Dit geldt evenzo voor de badkamer en het toilet. Zeer goede, royale bedden met geweldig liggende matrassen. Zeer goed restaurant aanwezig voor een fantastisch diner. Het ontbijt doe je natuurlijk 'New York Style' en lekker buiten de deur in een van de vele take aways. Receptie professioneel en vriendelijk. Gelegen in 29th street, een rustige bijzonder sympathieke straat van New York en vanaf het hotel een '5 minute walk' naar Fifth Avenue. En daar kun je je lol op.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}
