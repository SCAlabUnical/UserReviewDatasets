Despite being a Titanium member and arriving early, I was surprised and disappointed to find that I wasn't upgraded, even though the hotel wasn't at full capacity. When I inquired about this discrepancy, the front desk's response was unsatisfactory, citing my early arrival as the reason for not having a room ready, despite my returning later in the day. While I eventually received an upgrade, there was no acknowledgment or apology for the inconvenience of spending two nights in a room with a view of a brick wall.\n\nThe lounge experience was underwhelming, with the same breakfast and dinner offerings every day, accompanied by a staff member eagerly soliciting tips despite the self-service setup.\n\nFurthermore, I caution against leaving any items at this hotel. When I returned weeks later to retrieve a forgotten item, the process was frustrating and costly. It took multiple attempts to ascertain what had been left behind, only to be informed that retrieving my suite jacket would require going through a third-party courier service at a steep cost of $220, which exceeded the price of my flight to New York. The lack of flexibility or assistance in resolving this matter left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Sheraton TriBeCa New York was subpar, characterized by inadequate customer service and opportunistic pricing for lost items. This experience has certainly diminished my desire to return to this hotel in the future.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

When that happens, you rely on your hotel to step up.  In our case, the hotel restaurant \u2014 Henrietta \u2014 was a bit of a disappointment, probably because it competes with fuller establishments nearby.  The dinner menu was very limited and the dining area extremely chilly because the lobby\u2019s outside doors fanned cold air across the first floor (the hallways aren\u2019t heated, either).  The food was very good, just didn\u2019t have many options, which might explain why there rarely was more than a small number of diners in it.  \n\nAs premium elite members, we had access to the 21st floor club lounge, which was too small to accommodate the larger number of guests for morning breakfasts.  There\u2019s a nice outside terrace connected to the lounge, but the winter keeps guests inside the small lounge. The meals there also did not stand up well to similar amenities we\u2019ve had at other Sheraton properties \u2014 powdered eggs, reheated sausage links, wafer thin bacon, etc.  I strongly recommend Tribeca Bagels right next door for great breakfast items.  \n\nI was also surprised that the hotel registration desk was unable to break a $20 bill; I went to the small coffee stand in the lobby for change, but the cashier there provided it from his own pocket, not the register.  \n\nThe bellmen were very polite and helpful. \n\n Our accessible room had several good accessible features, esp the bath, but the king bed swallowed up all living space \u2014 anyone in a wheelchair or with a rollator would be unable to get around it or over to the windows.  The hotel does a poor job of handling the parking issue, a major challenge in Tribeca.  Its website only says \u201cself park\u201d for $55 a day, which means parking at the Wooster parking garage across the street and down the block.  I had hoped that Sheraton would\u2019ve cut some kind of discount deal there, but no luck.\n\nOur stay was pleasant, but Sheraton needs to invest a bit more in this property\u2019s restaurant and club lounge.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were \u201cupgraded\u201d to room 2016 on a Club floor, which was a nice perk, but that perk didn\u2019t begin to compensate for the tiny size of the room, the almost total lack of storage, the meager air conditioning, and the motion-activated bathroom light that could not be turned off at night. \nLiterally, the only storage consisted of a small shelf below each nightstand, the desktop, and two cubbies for shoes or small items. The bathroom had only two 8\u201d x 2\u201d glass shelves.  The worst feature was the air conditioning.  It could not be set colder than 68 degrees Fahrenheit, which seems to be the way hotels are going these days, but there was a motion\/body heat sensor that not only turned the A\/C off when we left the room, but even worse, turned it nearly all the way off at night when we went to bed!  The one time I really appreciate A\/C is while sleeping, but the room was so warm at night that we could only tolerate a single sheet.\nEqually as annoying as the A\/C was the motion-activated bathroom light.  When entering the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light went on at full brightness, thus fully awakening both me and my husband, who slept facing the bathroom door.  It always took me one or two hours to go back to sleep.\nThe Club Room was well maintained and its large terrace very inviting.\nHousekeeping did a nice job and only one time was the room not made up until late in the afternoon.\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

All of the front end employees we encountered were great as well but Eka really went above to make sure we had everything we needed. Another nice feature was the water they had in the lobby everyday that was infused with cucumbers and lemons. Very refreshing to come in to the cool lobby and grab a cold, refreshing water after walking around New York City and being on the subway all day. The only negative caveat I had was our room was pretty small (smaller than a normal double occupancy room), and there did not appear to be a way to change the air conditioning in your room. There was a thermostat but it didn\u2019t seem to do anything and I felt the room was not as cold as a normal hotel room gets but nothing that I was sweaty or uncomfortable - I just like to sleep in a very cold room.

Mainly it was teeming with street-entrepreneurs selling knockoff designer wares on the sidewalk, wreathed in the aroma of ganja.  The only place we liked nearby was the Nancy Whisky Bar (an English\/Irish NYC dive bar, which we like) around the corner.  But the Sheraton Tribeca does a great job.  Nice staff, super-clean, stylish rooms - just be skeptical about the actual hours of services (which is not uncommon).

The rests  of the hotel were pity (or even pathetic). TLDR; you might bare with this hotel if you are staying for one or two nights as a Platinum Elite (or higher) member. But otherwise don't be fooled by the fancy pictures and find somewhere else. \n\nBonvoy Platinum Elite (and higher) members are supposed to be offered complimentary room upgrades and also a selection of member perks like extra points or free breakfast at check in. None of these happened in my case. I had to beg for an upgrade to a club room, and the staffs were not aware of the member perks until the check out.\n\nThe staff assigned a corner room on 19th floor. At the end of gloomy hallway I was embarrassed to find two other rooms' doors just few tens of inches away from mine, foretelling bunch of noises from ins and outs (which actually happened till 1 am). Entering the room was another panic to only face red-bricked wall of the next building straight through the window (see the attached), and to see way too much tired bathroom and furnitures which definitely don't look worth of the $3M renovation as the hotel advertises. Not enough power outlets next to the bed without a single USB port in year 2023 is another minus.\n\nI could bare with these as I was thankfully staying for just one night anyway. But when I returned to the room after dinner in Soho, the room was full of bad odor like rotten onion even though I didn't unpack my luggage and didn't use the toilet. I couldn't stand anymore so visited the front desk to get a different room. But not a chance; the answer was \"just open the window as there's no other room available\". I would have believed if the staff at least spent few seconds to type something in their computer, but the staff didn't hesitate to instantly answer that. I get it, you don't prefer changing the room for a one-night guest at 6pm. But you could have made up some fake efforts to look better.\n\nThe only reason for my two-star review is the friendly & hard-working staffs at the club lounge. The staffs literally struggled to serve breakfast and beverages (including complementary wines in happy hour, which is quite unusual in NYC) in a tiny lounge less than 1,000 sqft, but it gets easily crowded with 25+ people with not enough tables\/chairs. The staff explained that the hotel is aware of this problem and plans to move the club lounge to a bigger hall on a lower floor. Not sure if that would help, as this will lose the panoramic view from the current club lounge on 21st floor.\n\nSo I can't recommend this hotel at the end. Fresh lobby with not-so-nice front desk staffs is hiding outdated and not-so-pleasant guest rooms and hallways behind, where the super-busy club lounge is on its steep downhill due to the lack of resource. You can give a shot if you are looking for a short stay in a budget club room in NYC, but otherwise, think it over.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

BUT, when my friend arrived from London the payment had not been taken from my credit card and they requested my friends card and put the full payment on their's even though she has told them what should have been done, the person would not allow her into the room until full payment was done.When I arrived I was not happy that this had happened and asked for their credit card to be refunded so that I could pay the account, which was always the request from the beginning. So when I paid they only took part payment and continued to processing an amount of my card each couple of days and still taking money even 2 days after checking out, this total around $5,000 when the full amount for a 5 night stay was $2,000.00. I  could go on and on but I think you understand by now that the billing system in this hotel is absolutely disgusting.\n\nThe twin room for a New York hotel is quite roomy and found the dining OK for breakfast and staff were friendly but the way the account was handled totally turned me and my friend off this hotel and would not recommend it at all.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

There were plenty of places to eat nearby. \n\nThe hotel itself has a clean, modern lobby with a restaurant and bar.

We didn\u2019t have any issues at all with long waits for elevators, and from what I remember there are 4. (If anything, we were pleasantly surprised by how fast they were given the number of floors!) The room we stayed in was on the Club Lounge floor. The Club Lounge was convenient for a free breakfast buffet. There was also a nightly happy hour (5:30-7 I think) with snacks, chips\/salsa\/guacamole, cheese and crackers, deli meat. They served free wine and beer (you have to ask for the beer, it\u2019s in the storage room fridge).  When it\u2019s not breakfast or happy hour, there is basically a cooler with water and sodas available. There are also bags of chips, some fruit and trail mix packets. We could see that the view was beautiful from the lounge\u2019s patio, but in January the lounge was closed for repairs. There\u2019s a gorgeous sunset view over the Hudson, even from inside! \n \nThe king room was adequate size, but a little tight if using the desk chair.

The bathroom was fine, but the towels are not soft at all. The room is a bit in need of updating, but it was clean and very comfortable.

If you are you have added benefits.\n\n3) Rooms are quite decent sized for New York and sleep quality and bathrooms are considered good for the hotel\n\nCons\n\nThis hotel is very transactional. Staff are trained to do the bare minimum and when situation arises they won\u2019t be able to assist further.\n\n1) Front desk team led by Kim have to answer both phones and handle guests at the same time. Some times they will hold on the phone and check you in. Things with credit card info or payments are highly secure and should be dealt in a professional non multi tasked manner\n\n2) The Sheraton is an international brand and training should be provided to the staff to handle international clients as well. Tones should be watched. Talking in 3rd person when the guest is in front is very rude. \u201c e.g I was assisting him but he decided to go to you instead\u201d when I am right in front. \n\n3) I had a left item and calling the hotel to ask what item I left. The front desk is not prepared for this and I had to be diverted and assisted by 2-3 different agents. It\u2019s like this is a complicated issue let\u2019s get the newest member to handle it. Don\u2019t bother me kinda impression.\n\nWell it seems that the front desk team as the face of the hotel has lots of improvement in customer service. Since these are the only cons.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We had an awesome time, can\u2019t say enough about the staff. We arrived late and had some family issues to deal with so didn\u2019t pay much attention when we checked in that evening but soon realized that the floor we were on, club level, was a bit too noisy for us. We asked to be moved to another floor that morning and thanks to Kimberly, one of the supervisors we were able to move by 1pm. The room was on the floor below and had an awesome view! Club room was great for breakfast, snacks, and evening wine.  Angie and Carla at the front desk were exceptionally helpful as well. Conveniently located to the subway. Planet fitness is next-door if you want to squeeze in a workout. If you have a membership.  I only mentioned a few names, but every staff member we met was gracious and helpful  There is a section up the street that is a little sketchy because of the street vendors, but, we had no issues and spent a lot of time walking around. Would definitely stay here again, they made our 20th anniversary trip extra special.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Special thank you to Wilmer at the Front Desk for being so genuine, friendly and so patient with us, explaining how to use the Subway and giving such clear directions! Housekeeping services were excellent and they came daily and followed up on requests promptly. They were able to provide us with a microwave in the room during the stay too.

We had four big suitcases but repacked while in Orlando, so we needed only to open two suitcases for the 9 nites stay in NYC. The beds are actually super twin beds becos it was a tight squeeze for me and husband as well as for my two kids. The difference in size was apparent becos we stayed in a double (beds) room in Orlando but was so comfortable there. Hope the hotel will be more honest in their publications. \n\nHaving said that, its a lovely hotel and I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a property with good rates and excellent location \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Rooms are tight, bathrooms are tighter, and many staff members appear to be unempowered when something goes wrong. Tribeca is not a haven of quality hotels, but our son and his family live here, hence my third time at this hotel. My minimum expectation is for a comfortable bed, electronics that work, support for current traveler tech, and a hot shower. The bed was fine, the TV was good; but I found the number and placement a places to plug in were below standard for a hotel at this level; and hot water was non-existent during my three night stay. The first two nights the shower was barely tepid despite letting water run for several minutes. The last night there was no hot water in the hotel as the boilers must have failed. The resolution at the front desk at checkout was a 50% discount for my last night and an offer of 11,000 Bonvoy points which they failed to deliver. I am a Bonvoy Titanium member and normally  well-received at Marriott-branded properties. This response was much less than expected and hence one of the very few 2-point ratings that I feel they have earned. In the future, I'll stay further from my family and Uber when necessary.

Having stayed at the Moxy East Village before lockdown there\u2019s obvious differences deciding to stay at a more \u2018traditional\u2019 hotel like the Sheraton Tribeca but based on the room rate we got and having a slightly different location we felt this was a good move which we were proved correct on.\n\nAs I said, the size of the room for NYC was excellent and location wise it was perfect as a base point for visiting the areas of NYC we planned to.   Even for alternative areas - because it was so close to the Subway it allowed us access to all points.\nEven for our journey home as we were heading back to JFK at rush hour we were concerned on how much time we\u2019d need - based on a local friends advice we took advantage of hotels location and got subway instead followed by the Airtrain which is something I didn\u2019t think would have been a good idea but this was great due to close proximity to subway and allowed us to fully make the most of our last day.\n\nI do understand the comments from those unhappy with street sellers etc but by same token you turn a different corner out the hotel and you are in the streets with all the high end shops so it really is in an interesting location but one we viewed as a positive.\n\nThe club lounge was a highlight of the stay.  It was clearly not the Ritz but having the happy hour with a selection of beers and wines and nibbles each night as well as complimentary breakfast was great.   The fact it had its own rooftop seating area was amazing too and we were gutted weather didn\u2019t allow us to make more use of this although I don\u2019t blame for the weather!! :)\n\nStaff in lounge and reception were helpful and friendly and overall we had a really good stay and were pleased we opted for the Sheraton Tribeca.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff told us that the sofa bed was already made and was 'very comfortable and the room was 'much larger. We got to the room to find the bed was folded up with old dusty sheets, the room was small and the bed was not a true king size. We are good friends but did not want to share a bed. Called back downstairs to find out the truth that no double rooms were available. We also found out that the rooftop was only for the executive levels. To try to make us happy they gave us access to the executive lounge and roof. The rooftop had old furniture, dirty, views into their laundry room, and is also a storage for items at one side of the roof. Not as shown in any way. The breakfast in the morning was minimal and they ran out of coffee and black tea. The attendant stayed in a small room and was not in attendance. When we walked into the small room to ask for coffee and tea, we were told they were out of black tea and the coffee would take a while.

It was nice to see how attentive, friendly and helpful the front desk staff still is.  However there were a few glitches.  As a lifetime Bonvoy Titanium member I was entitled to a room upgrade.  Even though a higher level of room was available to book online not 10 minutes prior to arriving at the hotel, I wasn't offered one.  I can only think this was down to the fact I had gotten a look no further rate. I also checked in online and requested extra towels and hangers as I was travelling with my husband.  Guess what?  There was 1 bath towel, 1 hand towel and 2 washcloths along with empty shampoo, conditioner and body wash bottles and 4 hangers in the closet.  Now they knew there would be 2 people in the room so what was up?  I went downstairs to get what I had requested and they were delivered.  Maybe I can put that mix up down to staffing?  Who knows?  But 1 set of towels and 4 hangers for 2 people is just plain ridiculous!  \nNow I also had access to the Executive Lounge.  Imagine my surprise when I entered to see the exact same stained and filthy chairs and the ripped carpet!  This is a lounge for people Platinum and above or paying for an executive level room.  There is absolutely no excuse for this.  Especially as it was already horrible 2 years ago!  I also gave to say the breakfast was disappointing.  The eggs were always overcooked and dry.  3 of 6 days the bacon was cooked so little it looked raw.  The other days the bacon was so overcooked it could have been used a crumbles in a salad.

First impressions of the hotel weren't great- outside looked a bit shabby, but this was our first time in New York- and after a few days we realised that a lot of Manhattan looks this way!  We went in through the doors and were met with a lovely, clean hotel. \nThe receptionists were very friendly, offered us water, but I don't think there was enough detail in telling us about the hotel. I'm not sure if this was just a Covid thing- to get through as many check ins as quickly as possible, and we did get an email with information but we were literally given our room cards- without being told where the room was, did we need help with bags?, what time breakfast would be, where we'd find the lounge etc. \nOur first room I wasn't happy with. The window was like a postage stamp in the corner of the room. I had specifically requested a city view and expected to have one of the floor to ceiling windows like in the pictures. I went straight to reception and requested a new room. They didn't have any for that night- but promised we could get one the next day. We didn't unpack- which was a slight inconvenience, and we thought that they'd be able to move our cases and bags during the day without us (we left them on the bed ready to move) but were told that we needed to bring them down- and take them back up when we came back that evening. It was a little bit of an inconvenience but the new room made up for it. \nWe had the most beautiful view of the empire state building and NYC. The room was spacious, clean and our room servicer 'Ana' always left us nice notes. We found we needed more coffee - a decaf for night- and one for the morning each, requested it on the notepad, and it was there each day for us, along with extra milk and water. The bathroom was immaculate, and the bed was so so so comfy! \n\nWe paid extra for club room access- another real winner. I've used club access and lounges all over the world and you usually fine that its awful wine\/ beer. We were impressed by the choice, corona, brooklyn beer- and some other local one- all really nice according to my other half, wine there was 2 reds, 2 whites- one of which was my usual oyster bay- which is usually a more expensive wine and I didn't expect it for free. From 5.30-7.30 you can have beer and wine for free! There's a server who will pour your drinks, I'd have rather had a glass though instead of a plastic cup- but I'm assuming this is another covid-safe thing. \nThere was salad, a selection of cheese, cold meats, dips, crackers, crips, and a hot item such as pigs in blanket, or samosa with spinach and ricotta (i think). Either way, it was a nice snack before we headed back out for our evening in the city each night.  Through the day you can have breakfast items in the morning and help yourself to cans of drink (they did have diet options-  it worried me in a previous post they said they had none!), water, coffee throughout the day and night. \nThe lounge also gives you access to a rooftop area with the most beautiful view of Manhattan. \n\nI loved the location. literally a minutes walk from one of the main route sunway station, You could get from your hotel room to times square in about 10 minutes! the trains were so regular we weren't waiting longer than 5 minutes at any point. There was always a presence from staff\/ police on the subway and I felt pretty safe at most points. No one likes seeing homeless people\/ people on drugs- but we did see a few around Manhattan. Not really any near the hotel though. \n\nThere is a shop next door that sold sandwiches- try their sliced meat sandwich with swiss cheese- game changer! We thought their pizza was great- but if you come out of the hotel- turn left, cross the road.. there's another pizza place there thats even better. \nThe lift was fast, wasn't waiting long for it even at busier times. There was 3 available. One day they were servicing the lifts and only had 1 in operation- it was a bit of a nightmare, but they ended up opening a staff lift, and the manager had a table in the foyer at the evening handing out free wine to all guests- which was a nice touch. \n\nThe staff- probably the only let down of the hotel (apart from the view on that first night). The guys on reception were amazing, nothing was ever too much. \n\nOne of the days we ordered breakfast from the room- omelette, it came with the option of bacon or vegan sausage. My partner didn't want it with meat- he wanted some mushrooms. But was told that he needed to pay 2 dollars for it with mushrooms, and we needed to give card payment to cover the additional 2 dollars. I said id pay cash- nope... needed card. I felt uncomfortable doing this. Bacon costs more than mushrooms so we couldn't see the issue with swapping- but they weren't willing to be flexible. \n\nOne evening we used the bar. The barman served us, and another gentleman around 9pm. He then disappeared. We wanted another drink... went to the reception desk but they didn't know where he'd gone either. We (and the other gentleman) ended up going and buying some drinks from the shop next door and going to our own rooms. \n\nMy partner appeared to have issues most mornings at breakfast- he ate his meal with a spoon once because a fork wasn't given and even after requesting one- it never came. \nMilk wasn't offered with tea\/coffee- I had to ask for it\n\nBut... they were the only issues in our 5 night stay, pretty minor. \n\nWe 100% would opt to stay here again on our next stay. Staying away from time square was a worry for me at first- but the location is amazing, the subway is literally on the doorstep (and for 34 dollars all week a cheap option !) ... and I'd say it has one of the best bedroom views in the city. Why stay within a concrete jungle with noise, chaos and expensive food- when you can stay just outside the madness for a fraction of the price!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

No problem!\n\nI made it up to my room (1111), which greeted me right off the elevator. Inside was pretty standard amenity-wise, but a bit on the smaller side. Understandable, as space in NYC is a premium. There were only two gripes that I could come up with. The shower space was laughingly small but the extra, smaller shower head made up for it. I'm not a wide guy but if I stood shoulder to shoulder to the wall and curtain (facing the shower head), the curtain would drape over a quarter of my body! The other gripe was the telephone in the room. It was extremely dirty (see picture) and looks like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Not sure what the policy was on that one. The bed was average, but a bit worn out.

Jokes aside, this Sheraton left more than a few things to be desired. We chose this hotel because of the club lounge and rooftop deck we\u2019d have access to as Bonvoy titanium members. When we checked in, we were told the lounge was closed and had been replaced with a pop up bar from 4-11. ANYONE (even those not staying at the hotel) could come to the bar so it was always at capacity. So we were on the club floor because of the status with no perks of being on the club floor. Aside from that debacle, there were lots of other smaller issues. There were no washcloths in our room and we only had two towels. In the photo of the room before booking, an area by the window with a chair was shown; however, our room was tiny and had no chair. The room had very few amenities. There wasn\u2019t even a mini fridge and the coffee pods were too large for the coffee machine. The room features listed a duvet but this consisted of a sheet with a comforter (which was stained) and a sheet on top. The sheets weren\u2019t attached to each other to make a duvet cover so they just fell off. The pillow cases were also too small for the pillows so they just sort of fell off. Additionally, there was a persistent stench of marijuana in the hotel lobby and the hand sanitizer dispensers by the elevators were empty the whole time we stayed. After the first night, we considered calling Marriott corporate to see if we could be accommodated elsewhere but decided not the bother with the hassle. Don\u2019t fall for the good price.

I also found it odd that they were not in any professional clothing, just casual t-shirt and jeans as if they are chilling in their living lounge.\nAnyways, I have given the staff the exact emoticon with the expressions with which they had treated me.

For being in NYC, this hotel is actually a great deal.\n\nThe hotel itself is out of the hustle and bustle of Times Square (where I ended up anyway due to a broadway show). It was an easy subway ride from our hotel to Times Square. If you are traveling by subway keep in mind it\u2019s $2.75 per person per ride. The subway stop is Canal St but it\u2019s a few blocks walk to the hotel. It\u2019s easy to miss it if you aren\u2019t looking for it, look for the large post office on the southeast corner. We got to the hotel around 5PM and during our walk we were harassed by the typical Canal St dealers selling their knock offs. If you aren\u2019t interested, keep your eyes down and keep walking. \n\nWe got a standard room for under $100\/night which was an amazing price for NYC. Being Marriott Elite we were hoping for an upgrade but on a Saturday night there were none available. Hoping for the best but preparing for the worst, we made our way up to our room and was pleasantly surprised. Room 1620 was the typical small size but had a gorgeous view of the city. The room could use an upgrade but it met our needs just fine. The room looked right out to the NYC skyline, seeing Hudson Yards, the Empire State Building and everything in between. During the day it was nice but at night you can\u2019t capture how pretty it is. \n\nThe bed was comfortable enough and we both had a decent nights sleep. We got 2 free bottles of water in the room along with a larger bottle for purchase for $4. If you have lounge access, just go and grab a few bottles from there if you need. The only time the room was too small was when my wife was sitting at the desk and I needed to get to the chair on the other side of the room. I couldn\u2019t squeeze through so I had to roll over the bed to get there.\n\nBeing elite, we get access to the lounge on the 21st floor. This was also small but nicer than other lounges we\u2019ve been in. They have the same gorgeous views of the sunset but just a bit better because of the additional height. They have a nice happy hour every day from 5-7PM. They offer free wine or beer plus some snacks like cheese, hummus, veggies w\/ dip and chips and salsa. We heard there was food there and thought we\u2019d be able to eat dinner there but that wasn\u2019t really the case. There was a good amount of food but I wouldn\u2019t plan a dinner around this. We did enjoy about 7 glasses of wine amongst the 2 of us so I can\u2019t say anything bad about the lounge. \n\nThe noise wasn\u2019t too bad from the outside. Not sure if it was the fact that we were on the 16th floor or that there wasn\u2019t too much car traffic in this area but I didn\u2019t hear anything throughout the night.

For me it served ir's purpose for a 4 night stay but I don't know that I would want to stay longer.  That being said, I am planning on returning January 2021.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms have no frills but are comfortable. No shower gel but soap and shampoo are provided. Staff very pleasant and helpful. There is a fitness suite. You can borrow an umbrella for a $50 deposit if it\u2019s pouring down. They offer a green deal without housekeeping for 500 points a night. ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1783324,"title":"Worst Marriott Property Yet","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-02-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I'm a pretty low maintenance traveler and do not expect perfection, but my recent experience at this property was so bad I feel an obligation to share it in this forum. We stayed for one night this past weekend and had the following issues: 1) 20th Floor room was incredibly noisy from both the street (which is understandable, it's NYC) but also from the elevator, which generated a loud banging noise all night. This hotel is poorly maintained, has thin walls and is long overdue for renovation. Do not stay here if you need to sleep. 2) The Sheraton \"Lounge\" is a gross exaggeration of what you're getting. The Sunday breakfast ends at 9am, the earliest I've ever seen for a weekend breakfast, and food\/beverage options the rest of the day are minimal. Not worth the upgrade. 3) Service at the front desk can best be described as apathetic. There seems to be no incentive or desire to do anything but the bare minimum. With all the great hotels in the area, don't waste time or money at this outdated property. ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

This is a great hotel. Staff are professional and friendly. We always got a lovely greeting when leaving or entering the hotel. The location is just brilliant. We used the subway for the week and it seemed that every train stopped on Canal Street where the hotel is based. Yes turning right out of the hotel means you do come across some street sellers which may seem intimidating at first but they are not. Once you say no they move onto the next person. Turning left and then left again puts you into a really lovely area with great restaurants and the best pizza slice I have ever had. Room was very clean and much larger than we expected for New York. No real noise issue but then again we were tired from exploring all day. One block up and you are in Soho and would pay much more per night. Easy to walk to One WTC. We will definitely stay here again as it is a real gem in an expensive city.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We usually stay in Mid Town and then fall into the trap of never leaving the Times Square area.  We got outside our comfort zone a bit and hung around Chinatown, Little Italy and the Village.  The hotel is an area that might scare off some people.  It's a little sketchy on the edge of Chinatown, but it's the \"charm\" I love about the city.  \n\nThe hotel itself is great.  Modern with a huge bar area on the first floor.  The young man who checked us in, Sal, was super cool and very professional.  We did not utilize the gym on such a short stay, but did check out the lounge on the 21st floor.  24 hour access to water, pop and snacks is always appreciated.  There is also an outdoor patio up there, which offered a fantastic view of the city to the North.  We stayed in a King on the 11th floor.  Typical small NYC room, but quite cozy.  Good AC, fantastic shower and comfortable bed for all activities!  Clean and modern.  Not much more to ask for.\n\nWe also received a nice email from the assistant manager, Mai, when we returned home.  Direct service from the hotel itself will keep us coming back.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

No email address across, Expedia, trip advisor, Sheraton website, Facebook page. Nothing! No way to confirm your room prior to arriving!!! Something that needs to be addressed! \n-Check in process was ok, nothing special with staff, didn\u2019t really go above and beyond however was quick. Didn\u2019t touch on wifi so we had to check that it was complementary. \n- room wasn\u2019t serviced until really late in the day or early morning so be sure to use your do not disturb sign if you would like to sleep in.  \n- Rooms are not quite, noise from hallway and outside sirens\/ traffic is normal.  This only bothered us a few nights with loud people in the hallway, however the rest of the time was ok. We were on level 10. \n- Rooms are not smoking however we did smell weed within the hallway etc.\n- Towels and linen are clean and crisp. However there is no doona per se it\u2019s sheets on top of the bed. \n- Room is small, hard to have two cases with luggage out. You get that most places in NY so this is average. \n- We requested a fridge on the third night we were here to be told they had none available, after requesting again in person they were able to send one up. Rooms should come accompanied with a fridge, wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if staying one night however for two weeks it was nice to have a cold drink or milk available for a tea or coffee in the morning. If your staying a while I\u2019d request one prior to arriving. \n- Pillows were very flat! It did say on the website they had a pillow menu available however it wasn\u2019t on the in room guide. \n\nWe didn\u2019t eat in the restaurant, only had a drink at the bar. Was good value during happy hour. \n\nIt\u2019s not advertised however Friday and saturdays have free drinks and nibbles for members in the 27th floor lounge. This was a nice touch, along with festive drinks and hot chocolates in the afternoons in the lobby. \n\nThe location is central to those using the subway and if you don\u2019t mind walking to locations like china town, Wall Street, little Italy etc. 99c pizza and delis are a short walk too! \n\nOverall it was ok. I wouldn\u2019t stay here again however I wasn\u2019t overly impressed nor disappointed.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

He also had an iPad in the front seat and I do not think it is ieagl to watch programmes on it and still drive, To add insult to injury he over charged us by $13 despite it being an agreed fare with the hotel. \n\nI emailed Marriott customer services at least 3 times and never had a response. I eventually rang the hotel (at international call rates) and complained to Sal (the hotel manager). He assured me that they would take that particular taxi driver off their books and refund the $13 via the travel agent. My issue is that the hotel should throughly vet the drivers before and not put their guests lives at risk. Ina addition, I have never received my $13 refund, despite t at least 4 emails to BOTH Sal and Mia. I have also rang the hotel and every time I get to reception and ask for Mia and Sal I am always cut off. When everything is ok, the hotel will communicate with you. When they need to learn from experience, they seem to not bother or care about their guests. I have stayed at a number of hotels in Manhattan and I have to say the customer service in relation to this incident has been atrocious. I am sure I will get a stock response, asking me to reach out to the hotel. What is the point when they cut you off the phone or never replay to emails!","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Inside is a little better but rather old fashioned.\n- Our room looked tired and not well maintained. The phone didn't work, light bulb was hanging from the socket, etc.\n- Our window \"view\" was a brick wall. We asked to change but we were told curtly that this was the only room available... As we had booked 11 months previously, I would have hoped for something better and also a  more helpful response from reception staff.\n- Some reception staff (not all) were generally quite rude and unhelpful. For example, I asked about the Club Lounge when we checked in and we were told it was available only for Club members. After a couple nights, I learned from a different staff member that this was untrue and anyone can pay $30 for access.\n\nWhile the price does help to counterbalance some of the negatives, it wasn't the stay I had hoped for.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Sheraton Tribeca was the latter. The staff were very friendly and made us feel extra special for visit to NYC, something that we don't expect at a NYC hotel.  The subway is just around the corner, 2 minutes away (blue line).  We had Club Lounge access where breakfast was served daily.  The lounge was super crowded at 8:30am everyday but the staff worked hard to keep food replenished and tables cleared.  Through the lounge you could access an outdoor terrace with amazing panoramic views of midtown Manhattan.  If the weather is nice, grab a drink during Club Lounge happy hour and sit outside. Room was average size for NYC. Clean and efficient. Elevators get busy during rush hour so expect a bit of a wait, which was to be expected.

Check-in time was 3pm but we were coming off a cruise so arrived early at 11.30ish. We knew the room wouldn't be ready but wanted to leave our bags to walk round the city so we did this and were told our room would be ready, as expected, at 3pm. We walked miles and ended up getting back, totally exhausted, at 4.30pm. Plenty of time to have a quick nap and get changed in time for our restaurant booking at 6.45pm. But our room wasn't ready. We were told to wait another hour and that we could wait in the club lounge. They made this seem like a special treat even though it was included with our booking anyway. So we waited until 5.30pm and called back down. Still not ready!! They said it would be at least another hour which meant we'd have to go to our restaurant booking as we were, sweaty and under dressed. I also have a slipped disc in my back and it was hurting so much that I really needed to just lie down. We went for the meal and returned for us to finally be allowed in our room at 9.30ish. We collapsed onto our beds and I logged in to the WiFi (included with our room)... or tried to. There was no WiFi signal. I stepped outside the door to the room and tried again and sure enough it worked. Our room was seemingly the only place with no reception! Over the next two days I wasted hours of my holiday on the phone to their tech support who seemed to subscribe to The IT Crowd method of turning everything on and off again, and with the hotel's own engineer, but to no avail. This was massively inconvenient as we needed to make plans and call family members, especially as I had my 30th birthday while we were there. Also, on the last morning we had breakfast in the hotel and one of the waitresses was literally holding her head in her hands when greeting us, clearly suffering from the night before!\nSeriously, the price might be tempting but this hotel is not worth it!!

They also moved the club happy hour downstairs to the \"dining room\". Basically a bare room with tables and chairs put in. Definitely not up to Sheraton standards. We did order food 1 day.

I was surprised the bartender didn't know how to make an apple martini! She did make a good chocolate coconut one though. All in all it is a clean hotel with nice people. They just need to put in a little effort to decorate the dining room, up the quality of the club breakfast and give the rooftop back to the people paying extra for the perk.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Our room rate had no restrictions.This was a return visit as we enjoyed our previous stay. I sent an email to the hotel advising them that we were celebrating a special birthday, unfortunately they did not acknowledge receipt of my email.The ground floor needs upgrading. There is an old coffee bar near the bar that is not longer in use. The staff were using it as a meal room. \nDue to family reasons we had to cancel the last 2 nights of our stay, Friday 9th and Saturday 10th August.\nI advised your reception desk in person on Friday 9th August at 930am of the cancellation of my last 2 nights and will check out around 12noon on Friday 9th August.\nThe gentleman (Raul) who attended to us advised that it will be fine and I will only be charged for the 2 nights.\nI checked out at 1130am with Raul and he advised that my account will emailed to me and for 2 nights only. He confirmed the last 4 digits of my credit card.\nI left my 2 suitcases with the bellman and returned to collect them at 145pm.\nWhen i received my account account folio the next day i had found that they had charged me for the night of 9th August for Room \"RT716\", when in actual fact I checked out on Friday 9th August at 1130am from Room 2006. I was actually back home in Australia when I received my account. \nI called the hotel from Australia, Saturday 10th August 707pm (New York time) and spoke to Kimberley and Room Supervisor Star. Star advised she will look into the discrepancy.\nI received another email that evening with the same invoice amount.\nThe following day I received another account folio charging me for a 4 night night stay. 2 nights in room 2006 and 2 nights in room 716. I asked myself, How is this possible ???????\nIt was so difficult to get an email contact address for the hotel. Very frustrating. I finally managed to get an email address for Room Supervisor Star Mc.....\nSo I emailed Star again, this time with a copy of my Flight itinerary and boarding pass to prove I had actually left New York on the 9th August. It felt like I had to prove my innocence. Very uncomfortable. Star replied to my email on the 14th August as follows\n\n \"Good Morning ,\n\nHope that your having a great day . I have spoken with My manager and she approved for me to give you back one night. As far as the other nights being that we were never made aware that you checked out early unfortunately we wouldn't be able to refund you the rest of the nights. I will send you over a folio with the refund amount . Sorry about the inconvenience and if there is anything else that I can help you with please feel free to reply back to this email. \"\n\nI thought to myself, I am wasting my time corresponding with hotel over charging me for the 10th August for a room I never stayed in. So they charged me for 3 nights for a 2 night stay. They quite obviously don't believe in customer service or satisfaction. It would be great if I could discuss this discrepancy with the Hotel's General Manager, but unfortunately I am unable to get those contact details.\nI have used Sheraton Hotels for over 30 years around the world, this experience has left me extremely disappointed.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Great front desk staff and I had room service twice both times fast and food good.  I flew SFO-EWR because this hotel is literally a couple of blocks from where the Holland Tunnel starts and ends.  The issue, it was 9\/11 and while I arrived around 8 PM I had goosebumps the entire time I was a mile or less from Ground Zero and the lights that night were over powering.  I was in SF on 9\/11 but the emotions I felt 18 years later being near that hallowed ground were as if it happened all over again, very, very emotional for me and I have to say the hotel staff was prepared and I was not the only person having these feelings.

In addition, the property itself was comfortable, the rooms were well sized by NYC standards and the rooftop lounge gave a fabulous view of the Manhattan skyline. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Overall the staff were very helpful and always offering a greeting and advice when requested.  The Executive Lounge on 21 was full most mornings and nights due to the holiday period.  Due to special events the evening drinks were served in the lobby restaurant over the holiday weekend.  The lounge staff were always polite and helpful.  Guests sometimes pushed them a bit given the number of people wanting to be served but they did try their best to accommodate all.  When the numbers reduced service was excellent.  Food choices were limited but overall reasonable variety and quality.  Was great to be able to get a water and soda whenever required.\n\nAs expected the room was not the largest in the world but good enough for our needs.  Great views of  Empire State Building and Times Square area from room with better view of three sides from the Executive Lounge Balcony. The location was great for local restaurants in Little Italy and Chinatown with a good coffee shop, Italian and Japanese restaurants within a two minute walk of the hotel.  Also great takeaway pizza place for late night snacks within 50 metres. Access to the subway was excellent for visits to Chelsea, uptown and Brooklyn.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Normally, I don\u2019t like to stay on lower floors due to the street noise of sirens, honking cars, etc.. But the patio rooms are on the back side of the hotel overlooking a side street, with very little traffic.\n\nThe patio rooms are the way to go, if you can get one, there are only 4 of these rooms. While the room was small with little space to move around, the patio was very large with seating for 4. I think the patio was bigger than the room. It was nice to have a private outdoor space just to myself to relax after a day of activities.  Just wish there was a table on the patio. \n \nThe room consisted of a standard bathroom with shower, king bed, wardrobe for storage, safe, desk with chair, and TV. The room was a bit dated and could use a refresh, however, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was adequate with excellent water pressure in the shower. One issue we discovered is that the thermostats are off by about 10 degrees, we set the a\/c to 63 get the room cool. I noticed in the concierge lounge the thermostat was set at 60 and the lounge was comfortable.  \n\nThe concierge lounge is accessible 24\/7 with access to a rooftop patio that faces uptown. In the evening, a bar was setup on the rooftop. In the morning, we had breakfast which consisted of eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast, yogurt and pastries. It was a bit crowed in the morning, with folks waiting for seats. We ate around 8 am. \n\nThe hotel is conveniently located near multiple subway lines. Several restaurants within walking distance. \n\nThe price was very reasonable at $190 a night and no destination fee. I tend be more price conscious in large city given the amount available hotels. I would stay here again, if the price is right.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is great, the hotel and service was a major let down.     We had two significant issues during our four night\/five day stay.    The first issue was our room AC did not work.   Our room was a good 10-15 degrees warmer than the hallway.    The first night we were tired from our travels and slept ok.   The second night we both woke up in full sweats as room kept getting warmer,    We visited the front desk the next morning and we were told it would be fixed or we would be moved to another room.   Later that day when we came back to the hotel and it was not fixed.  A new front desk person then told us she had no record of our morning report and that she had no other room for us.   She sent up maintenance and he played with it and then said not to open the curtains the rest of our stay.    We hardly slept the next two nights, we made an effort to not stay in the room at all during the day.   It was miserable,   I made two reports to the front desk and never heard back until I filled out a random survey after the stay and then they said here is 6,000 points for not sleeping.    The second issue was the club lounge.   They could not handle the crowd and made no adjustments,    Two of the four mornings they ran out of hot breakfast an hour before closing.    They were consistently out of bottle water and soft drinks.    The entire experience in this hotel was poor.   With so many Bonvoy options in NYC we recommend you skip this one.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our room was not ready when we arrived but Sal Angioletti the front office supervisor let me look at some of the rooms that were and as soon as I saw our room I knew we had scored a great room. He took so much time out of his busy day to make me happy and I could see he did that for all the guests he helped - it was wonderful to be made to feel at home in a hotel we were about to spend the next ten days. I cannot say enough about how helpful the staff were (especially Sal) they helped in so many ways and everyone was so pleasant.  My only complaint is that the Buffett in the lounge was pretty limited as was the Buffett in the restaurant however the staff in the lounge worked hard to keep it stocked and keep a busy lounge flowing smoothly.  I have been a Marriott member a long time and most of the lounges supply more options for hor\u2019dourves and breakfast.  The other issue was the fire alarm went off at 9:00 am and there wasn\u2019t an announcement made quickly so people were confused as to what to do and the elevators were shut down (as they should be) but still not working at 11:00 long after it was determined there was no emergency (which was the only time I regretted being on the 20th floor.)

From the moment we checked in it was all positive. My wife had emailed them previously and told them this was in effect our honeymoon combined with our wedding anniversary as we had been unable to take a honeymoon when we got married. We were very kindly upgraded to a higher floor with club access and a fantastic view out over the city to the Empire State Building. How awesome is that for a first visit to New York!\n\nCheck in staff were lovely and welcoming and very helpful. Our room was great. Not huge but certainly big enough for our needs and was clean and tidy. Only thing I\u2019d say was missing was a fridge. Especially as the weeks we were there the temperature was between 28 and 34 degrees. But other than that we could not fault the room at all. As part of our upgrade we had breakfast included in the lounge on the 21st floor. What a wee gem this place was. Breakfast was great with a pretty good selection of food and drinks and to top it off a\nRooftop terrace with fantastic views of the city and the Empire State Building. This lounge and terrace also has a happy hour every night between 5 and 7 with drinks and snacks and a bar out of the terrace on a Friday and Saturday night. Nothing nicer than a cold drink sitting out on the rooftop on a nice warm summer night with views of New York City all lit up\n\nThe Location Of The Hotel on Canal\nstreet was perfect too. Close to a host of Subway stations for the various lines on the subway made travelling anywhere easy. Also situated just outside Chinatown, Little Italy and Soho making all\nOf these places accessible with just a short walk\n\nEvelyn from housekeeping was fantastic. Very friendly and helpful she kept our room spotless and kept us well well supplied with water and the usual toiletries and towels etc. A real credit to the Sheraton\n\nCheckout was easy and again the staff were helpful. We had to check out at 12 but our flight was not until\n11 that evening. They stored our luggage for us in a secure room and this was no issue for them. After we went some last minute sightseeing we spent the time in the hotel bar. The doorman arranged a car to collect us from the hotel and took us straight to terminal 4 at JFK airport taking all the stress of getting there with out cases out of our hands\n\nDownsides to the Sheraton?

We paid for a club level room which comes with access to the roof top terrace and a free \"bar\" every afternoon. If you are a club level guest, breakfast is also included. The price was pretty high, but we ate and drank enough for it to even out. The most awesome thing about the roof top wasn't the free drink and snacks, but the amazing view of Manhattan. People pay good money for that kind of view, and there we were, having free drinks and enjoying said view. \nI suspect the club level rooms are bigger than the rooms in the rest of the hotel. This was very nice as it allowed us to spend some time in the room when we needed rest. \nWe had a great time at the hotel because we had club level rooms, but the rest of the hotel was unimpressive. The reception lounge was cold and uninviting and there weren't really that many comfortable places to hang out on the first floor.

I had a very positive experience.  With such a long stay, I sprung for their 'Club Level' package; so my room was on a higher, (actually the highest), floor.  Which was great if you're as sensitive to noise as I am.  (This is NYC people - pack some ear-plugs!  Or download a white-noise app.)  The bathroom had the GREAT addition of a magnification mirror on the side wall.  The toiletries were ample & of decent quality.  The water pressure & temp remained at a consistent level throughout my morning showers.  There was a full-length mirror just outside the bathroom.  In addition to the chair at the work-desk, there was a very comfy lounging chair with ottoman in my room, (such a great touch!).  Every single Sheraton employee who I had dealings with, or even a short encounter with, was terrific.  (This was a bit of a shock to me...)  The Club Level breakfast offerings were ok, (though the scrambled eggs weren't very good, unless I used a lot of ketchup!).  I really liked their addition of sauteed onions along with the sausage.  There were three options of cold cereals and an ample variety of breads, muffins, and pastries, etc..  Also, plenty of coffee, water, juices, and even soda.  For the evening offerings, there were basic noshes - crackers & tortilla chips, one kind of cheese cubes, and then one kind of luncheon-meat (rolled up).  Also a pasta salad.  They served several wines & beers.  (Also, they had a cash-bar in the Club room, if you wanted to have hard liquor as well.)  I'm not much of a drinker; so I mostly just enjoyed the breakfasts and then the viewing deck for the Club Level upgrade.   The Sheraton Tribeca is VERY well situated with short walks between four (4!) subway lines that I used every single day of my stay - such a great location for public transit.  I can think of two areas for improvement - the lighting in the bathroom was on the dim-side.  And, the in-room coffee maker was a bit of a spitter.... After the first cup of coffee, I made sure and kept a washcloth handy to contain the water leaks\/spurts.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It wasn't that awful, but some might be bothered by it.\nThe free WiFi was no good.  If you want good WiFi you have to pay.  I just used my data and it was fine.

House keeping was reliable and kept the room very clean. Great location, various subway lines (the A,C,E, and N,R,Q, 2)  within very easy walking distance. Canal Street had always been kind of dicey but never felt unsafe at any time. Restaurants galore within easy walking distance and across Canal Street is SoHo, Little Italy, and Chinatown. There's a little deli right next store to the hotel whose food was really good, bialy's bagels, etc., and a wonderful Italian restaurant named Pepolino's is right around the corner. We must've used the subway to get to and from our hotel 20x...Don't bother with Uber (we did 1x) because the traffic doesn't allow you to move from where the hotel is located in any reasonable amount of time. When we left, the hotel coordinated a ride for us to Newark Airport and that worked seamlessly. We would have no problem staying at this hotel again in the future.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I arrived several hours before check in and the front desk took care of checking me in (room was not ready though) and storing my luggage (no charge - did tip when I picked them up).  I am a Marriott Bonvoy member do they upgraded my room to include Lounge access (complimentary breakfast, snacks, coffee, waters and soft drinks).  \n\nThe room I stayed in on the 15th floor had a decent rooftop view looking east. Decent sized room (for NYC) with a queen bed, desk (with desk chair) and restroom.  Bed was comfortable and you are able to open the window a few inches which is nice.  The heat\/air worked great.  I left the fan on high to drown out some of the hallway noise.  I will say that my room was near the bank of elevators so I did hear lots of loud conversations while others waited for access to them. The windows did a good job keeping outside noise out as you could hear a tremendous difference when you opened them.\n\nLots of shopping in nearby Soho too - just a couple minutes walk away.\n\nSeveral subway lines were within a block or two that would get you to most places in a short time.  I flew into LGA and it was about 55 minutes from getting in the MTA system.  \n\nThe lounge breakfast was simple with eggs, sausage, pastries, breads, yogurts and juices.  It was a great treat if you are trying to save a few dollars on a meal to get your day started.  \n\nHappy Hour - this was a very nice treat that I didn\u2019t expect.  During my stay (Saturday-Tuesday) from 5-7 each evening there was a FREE Happy our in the Club Lounge in the 21st floor.  A few wine options, a few beer options and light snacks.  I had a few beers each night (prior to going out for dinner) and simply tipped the gentleman that served us.  Other places I ate charged $7-$10 for beer so this was a crazy good deal.  It was busy each night with little room to sit.  There is a rooftop area with additional seats and nice views but the temperatures were a bit chilly during my visit to linger outside.\n\nYou should consider upgrading to Club access if a free happy hour, free breakfast and drinks excite you.  I think if you have two in your group that could easily add a significant value to the room at the Sheraton Tribeca.\n\nCheckout was noon and the desk was happy to store luggage if you wanted to explore and come back later to retrieve the luggage.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Unfortunately these are the only positive things I can say about this establishment. Upon checking in, I was not greeted and had to ask to check in. The lady had some serious attitude despite my reservation being incorrect on Sheraton's behalf (I had called to make this reservation). Two rooms were booked when I specifically asked for one room to be booked. This same disturbed lady made it seem like it was my fault for this mistake and said they will have to late cancel this room for a fee, but since I have \"status\" they waived the fee. No apologies were made. Unacceptable. \n\nI ordered a bottle of champagne for the room and when it was delivered it was room temperature. I asked the delivery lady if I could have a chilled bottle and she said she would \"check\". She did end up delivering a chilled bottle, however I had a hard time paying the already included 20% gratuity when there was no attention to detail. \n\nThe morning of checkout I had a knock at the door and it was someone \"just checking to see if our room was still occupied\" at 10:00 am. Checkout is 12. \n\nAfter already being irritated at my stay, I again asked the front desk to check out. The lady just looked at me waiting for me to speak. There was no greeting, she did not acknowledge my request, but just looked at me like I was bothering her. So I just rattled off all of my info because I didn't know what she needed. \n\nThese all might seem like small complaints, however for this Hotel to be considered a Marriott property, is unacceptable. Being a lifetime Gold member I have definitely had enough stays to be able to compare. I choose to stay at Marriott properties because of the great service and overall great experience, but sadly I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NY.

From the moment we checked in it was apparent that this SPG hotel was substandard. Adjoining rooms were not available even though I booked these 2 rooms months in advance. Excuses were many and I was never given an option other than we had rooms \u2018near\u2019 each other. (I did ask for a suite that could accommodate 4 adults but was told they were all booked) My reservation confirmation clearly said extra towels and feather pillows. When we saw these requests were not provided, we called the front desk only to be told \"no you did not request that\" even though it is clearly on my reservation! Additional supplies were delivered but short 1 pillow and we were told the extra pillow would be up soon - never saw it in 7 days!! After that day we were never provided extra towels either. The elevator hallway at the lobby level is very dark and has illegal light level. We told the front desk and we were told that this is Marriott standard. It was under 10% and one of my guests is an architect who knows the regs! It was increased for a few days but lowered again later in the week. Elevators require a key to access floors and we noticed that many people had issues with their key cards allowing them floor access \u2013 we had the same issue intermittently over the 7 days.  In one room (1907) we had various disappointments - one day no toilet paper another no Kleenex another no bath mat. We had a plastic drinking cup on the floor for 4 days - we left it there to see if the cleaners ever really looked. The hair on the bathroom floor (which was ours due to hair washing and drying) was never swept up. Beds were always poorly made with linens lumpy looking and bed skirts caught up in the sheets. Breakfast in the lobby on Saturday 9 Feb was cold because the Sterno pots were not lit. The waiter ,when told, quickly took off to find a way to light them and came to us to say they must have just gone out. I had already taken a picture and surprise there were no Sterno pots!This is a big health issue - needless to say we ate bread products and stayed away from the \"hot\" foods. The website says it has airport shuttle - well that is not true however the front desk will call a cab or limo service. I said I could do that myself. Our second room 1906 was extremely small and suffered similar issues. I am an SPG Platinum Premier Elite with Ambassador member. I obviously travel a lot. And have many SPG nights in the cities where their hotels align with my needs. I travel globally. I can say without reservation that this hotel (which is a franchise to Ascott Reit) is very poorly run and the staff under trained. Sheraton and now Marriott are allowing this franchise to diminish their brand. All a hotel can offer, after a bed to sleep in, is SERVICE. Not everything can be perfect all the time however staff can respond to issues in a way that underscores that quality and service are job ONE. This hotel is just OK - nothing special, just an older and dated facility with staff that are not engaged or excited about working there. The club floor food is very poor (try the Hyatt Grand Central for a good Club Level experience) The staff we met over 7 days did not even try to enhance our stay. My Ambassador did try to connect with me by phone 2 times but I choose not to call back because this was a problem too big to be fixed by one call from Corporate. So bottom line is I will not be back to this location and I will return to the Hyatt Grand Central as my NYC hotel. SOHO was great and a nice change from Midtown but like hotel rooms in NYC there are also many cabs in NYC. Next time I will pay for cabs to SOHO and stay in a hotel that will offer superior service to their valued members.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I did not book an advanced purchase rate so I was puzzled as to why my card had been authorized when I wasn't scheduled to arrive until the next day. I called the hotel and spoke to someone named \"Sal\" who reported that no matter what rate you book, it is the hotel's policy to authorize 1 night stay prior to arrival. This is mentioned no where on their website nor in my confirmation email. He was very rude and kept repeating that this is their policy when I informed him it was not okay as this was not mentioned to me at all nor on their site \/ confirnation. I later learned this was a lie. I asked to speak with a manager and he said he was the manger. I also later learned he had lied again. He was not helpful at all and told me to take up my issue with corporate. I called Marriott and the lady said this policy is incorrect and no where did she see this policy nor was it in my conformation. She escalated this to her manager as she wanted an investigation into this \"made up\" policy and apologized for the unacceptable charge \/ error. We didn't even know what the total amount unauthorized was for because there is no invoice or confirmation stating the random amount he charged my card. The next day upon check in, my card was charged AGAIN for the 1 night but this time the amount matched what was on my confirmation!!!! I was only paying for 1 night but because my card was charged twice, I spent over 900 for a mediocre hotel room. If my card had not been authorized without my consent the day before, I would not have had double charges on my credit card. They are completely unprofessionally and it's a scam. The quality of the hotel is equivalent to a 2 star hotel , not 4 star and for the headache of scamming your credit card, it's best to stay elsewhere. I will NEVER stay here again and definitely not another Sheraton property ever. Sal doesn't deserve my business and Sheraton TriBeCa is not worth it if this is the low level of professionalism I must deal with before, during, and after vacation.

One large tip: ALWAYS spend the extra money to stay on the business floor. Why? Because you get access to the rooftop that not only has incredible panoramic views of NYC but also offers a quiet respite after a long day. There are unlimited snacks, water, coffees, teas and sodas available to you there throughout the day and night - and a breakfast spread in the morning. This is also with NO additional cost. The best part though is the rooftop happy hour that offers wine, beer and cheese for several hours as the sun sets. After spending $20 for a drink most places - especially in Tribeca or the neighboring Soho - you will be delighted to enjoy a few beverages with this particular view for \u201cfree\u201d ... and nice wines at that. Deon - who has been there for nine years - is phenomenal during the Happy Hour. The rooms are pleasant but pretty standard. The staff is very kind and quite attentive in my experience. I have thoroughly enjoyed that I have always been given the same room each time I\u2019ve stayed - I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s coincidental but it feels very comfortable every time I arrive.

Overall, I found it ok but below what I expect from a SPG\/Marriott hotel at that price point, and apart from the lounge access I didn\u2019t feel like my platinum status was recognized. The service was a sloppy, and employees were doing the bare minimum while making you feel like they were doing you a huge favor when they were just doing their job. For instance in 2 of the 3 checkin occurrences, there was no shower gel in the room when we entered the room. I also asked for them to bring and prepare the bedding on the couch for the one night that I had planned to sleep in my parents\u2019 room, but I had to ask 3 different times for them to only bring the bedding to the room and not even prepare the bed. There were a couple more instances where service was lacking but let\u2019s move on to other annoyances: elevators take forever in that hotel (it can take more than 5 minutes to get to the lobby or the lounge), and it just feels a bit old in general. The rooms are small but that\u2019s ok, I\u2019ve never had a huge room in a New York hotel. The breakfast is also disappointing, very few options and the ingredients don\u2019t seem to be of the highest quality. \nOn a more positive side, the location is very convenient to visit the city, and right by a metro station.

Green Village and Washington Square Park are an easy walk up West Broadway which is right outside the front doors.  \n\nThis hotel is a great value with room prices that are very competitive for NYC.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating including housekeeping which left us notes every day.  This is not a convention hotel.  The rooms are typical NYC rooms, which is to say smallish, but very clean and adequate.  There is no concierge but the desk staff work hard to meet that role.  On our recent visit, my husband was celebrating his birthday.  He loves chocolate cake so I contacted the hotel in hopes of securing a small chocolate cake.  They could not accommodate this request but they sent someone to a nearby bakery for a large slice of chocolate cake (at no cost to us) that was waiting for us in the room with a very nice note.  \n\nGet out of Time Square and enjoy NYC as the people who live here enjoy it.

Last week was a high occupancy week in NYC between this and Pride events.  My travel plans came together at the last minute, and I missed out on advanced booking discounts.  This hotel was one of the few that had rooms in my date range under 400.00 a night. In a panic, I booked and was eligible for the AAA discount, so my room was 312.00 before taxes, discounted from 380.00.  \n\nCheckin was a disaster.  The CSR, let's call her \"Twinkle\" with the platinum wig,  seemed angry from the start and rushed through my checkin.  When I asked to verify the rate and the perks offered by the AAA booking that I made over the phone a couple days before, she rudely retorted that no such deal was in the system, and that my room was 379.00 before taxes, and there was no city view, no access to the lounge level with breakfast and cocktails.  I showed her my confirmed reservation email, and she said there was absolutely nothing she could do, and that was just how it was going to be.  I then asked for her manager, and she angrily stormed off and found her supervisor who took over the checkin process.  Well Twinkle kept interjecting while the supervisor attempted to locate the reservation that showed my deal.  I eventually complained about her attitude to her supervisor.  Neither seemed pleased that I went there.  Well  miraculously, a room with the specifications promised to me appeared on the system...but I was made to feel this was a grand favor being granted to me, and something was mumbled about a failure of their system to have synced with the central reservation system, or some such excuse.\n\nThis hotel is old and dated, but the room was immaculately clean.  The breakfast and cocktail hour buffet in the 21st floor lounge was excellent, and redeemed my stay.  I had dinner in the lobby restaurant the first night as it was very late.  Terribly overpriced for a micro slice of frozen salmon with veggies.  I paid 70.00 for that meal and one glass of red wine.  Cafeteria quality for fine dining prices.\n\nI cut my four night stay in half, and moved to another hotel (Dream\/ Chelsea\/ See my review) which was incomparable at a rate of 389.00.  \n\nDo not be fooled by the proximity of this hotel to SoHo.  Crossing Canal street from SoHo to this hotel take you into another world...one of whinos, and the stench of weed, urine and garbage combined.

We arrived and had about twenty minutes to check in, get to our room, change, and leave for our anniversary dinner. The front desk staff could tell we were in a rush and got us checked in and on our way in record time all while being courteous and friendly. It was incredibly hot for our weekend stay and every time we came back to the hotel, the front desk had water bottles available for us. When we checked out, we asked for a cab to Newark Airport and they got us a private car in less than 5 minutes for a flat rate fee. It may have been a bit more expensive than a cab, but the driver got us to the airport in a half hour during rush hour.\n\nWe booked a Superior King room and were put in a room right next to the elevator. I was concerned about noise but we only heard other guests one morning and it was after 8am. The Superior room was spacious with a comfortable seating area and room to move around, which is hard to find in Manhattan. The rate was below other hotels in the area that would have offered a room half the size.\n\nLocation was great - easy to get to JFK and EWR, as well as being walking distance to the Village, Soho, Tribeca, and Little Italy. There is a subway stop around the corner, too, which made it easy to get to Williamsburg and Midtown.\n\nIt's not as stylish as other hotels in Soho might have been, but between service, location, and price, this was an all around great stay.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Compare to other Sheraton hotel in Asia, Sheraton Tribeca are a way behind in variety of menu in breakfast. Hospitility wise just enough and efficient, like other New Yorkers. Nothing to complaint, but the one that stunning are the bell boy Fery; American Chinese who always look after and attentive to any guest at the Hotel. This is much appreciated.

Hence I verified with Front Office. The lady who assisted me was just arrogant and unhelpful. She didnt even ask my surname and just said: There is no upgrade available. For me, its totally fine. However her attitude was so unwelcoming. She added: there is no membership on profile in 1 second. Oh come on, there were 2 registered guests! Obviously she just checked the profile of the one who was not a member. So I stated my surname and asked her to check again, she finally confirmed that I am a platinum. This is really awful. At night, I found my room is very noisy due to the mechanical sound of the lift nearby. I should have quiet room preference on file! I called to guest service and the lady just: There is not any other room available tonight within 1 second. The lady must be very familiar with their room situation. Alright, but, how come I can still find different room type available to reserve in official website? So now I am typing this review in the noisy sleepless room.\n\nThis is all already addressed to the hotel and i am glad there is a front desk supervisor return email to say they would like to follow up. However, it is disappointing that i still not receive any reply from them. It has already been three weeks. How awful the service it is here!","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"NONE"}

He always had a positive attitude and sometimes the room was overflowing with guests. He was always moving either cleaning, serving or preparing. \n\nMy only concern is that since I've been coming here a few years, I have noticed the quality in some areas decreasing. Specifically, the food available in the club lounge. Breakfast used to include eggs, bacon, etc. but now it is strictly stale pastries and fresh coffee not even available at 7 when they open. In the evening they used to serve beer. Now it is just wine. I was given a coupon to try the breakfast buffet. They also open at 7. I was there at 7:15 one morning and the eggs were already extremely dry and sausages burnt.

Great location.  Check-in was effortless, quick and pleasant.  Every employee we came in contact with at this property had a great attitude and seemed genuinely happy to be working at the hotel.  \nWe traveled with another couple and we both had rooms on the 7th floor next door to each other.  We both payed the same price but their room was a bit larger than ours.  Our room was small but extremely clean and very quiet. There was a coffee pot, iron and safe in the room.  Not one complaint about this place.  The elevators were always available and the bar had a great atmosphere and it was the perfect spot to start the evening.  We were each given a complimentary drink coupon at check-in which was a really nice touch.  We didn't eat at the restaurants but they looked pretty good.  The area was bustling and it was a 10 minute walk to our nightlife scene on McDougal Street.\nGreat stay and we would definitely return if we were in the area again.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's off-season (January) and the price was great! The location is right on Canal St on the west side, near the Holland Tunnel so there is a lot of traffic and outside noise. The interior is clean, comfortable, and bigger than a lot of other comparable downtown hotels. Close to subways, restaurants, shopping, and other points of interest.\n\nI thought they had an on-site garage but I was told to pull up outside for the valet. However, the cars were stacked 3 deep and double parked into the middle and right driving lanes so it was impossible to pull over! I circled the block a few times, then gave up and found a nearby garage. \n\nThe woman (Alexis) at the front desk was super nice. She had great positive energy, gave us two comped drinks, and a buffet ticket for breakfast. We had a room on the 10th floor with a view north, of midtown and the Empire State Building. Lovely! We requested a room away from the elevators and they were able to accommodate us. \n\nThe room was a good size for a downtown NYC hotel room! We even had a chair to relax, a desk area, and an armoire. The bathroom was nice as well, with a shower, no tub. Be aware that you are staying on Canal St, and you can hear traffic\/honking\/sirens\/people all night. But it's not a big deal if you travel with ear plugs\/white noise apps.\n\nIt looks like there is access to a Planet Fitness next door as well! Sadly, I did not have time to go, but it is available.

Our room keys suddenly did not work, which was annoying since we had to go back down after just receiving them.

We ended up being late to our dinner reservation and had to wait even longer, throwing off our plans.\n \nOn the positive side, the place is clean(expected), the front door gentleman\u2019s were very nice\/accommodating and location is nice.

Rightly so, the location is good.  Close to three different Metro lines with walk-able entertainment while being outside of the insanity of midtown.  Unfortunately, this is a substandard Sheraton.\n\nCheck in was completed by a very friendly agent (the only good service I had).  However, my SPG status was not recognized nor was I offered an upgrade (the hotel was not full). The rooms are standard NYC rooms, small but comfortable.  The hotel is clean as would be expected at a Sheraton.  Before heading out for then evening, we wanted to enjoy some cocktails at the hotel bar.  Enjoyment was not possible.  The bartender was rude, barely seemed to care we were there and seemed annoyed every time we ordered a drink.  The tab was extremely expensive ($25 for a double vodka and soda), which I can understand due the location, but I would expect the service to match price. \n\nThe next morning comes around and I was woken by slamming doors and chatter, which went  on for hours.  Again, as expected in NYC, noise does occur; this was excessive.  It turns out the problem is twofold, 1. My neighbors were coming and going all morning, and 2. The room attendant staff is loud and my room was positioned next to service elevator and entrance.\n\nWhile cleaning rooms, the attendants come in and out of a room, allowing the door to slam each time and not propping the door open.  I called down to the front desk requesting to move.  The agent on the line was rude, did not apologize, offered no compassion or compensation, telling me I was already on the quiet side of the hotel.  When I requested to move anyways, the agent sounded exasperated and put me hold.  I was given a new room, however I would have to go to the front desk to get the keys.  \n\nMy new room was similar to the previous, as expected, except it includes old towels with holes and frays.  Also unfortunate was that the noise and slamming doors of the room attendants was not better. Overall, the hotel is fine.  But the service, lack of attention to detail and treatment of customers is borderline terrible.  I get the impression that management does not care or is not present.\n\nAbout the reviewer:\n36 year old single male, well-travelled American.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1783324,"title":"We Enjoyed the Sheraton Tribeca","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-11-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"My family and I stayed in a Club Double Room for three nights and we had a great visit overall.  I would describe the Sheraton Tribeca as a mid-range hotel, with average-size rooms and amenities.  It is perfect if you are looking for an economical place to stay, that is modern, clean, and has friendly staff.\n\nCheck-in:  At the front desk Kaylene (I'm pretty sure that was her name!) greeted us and helped us get checked-in.  Although we were early, and our room wasn't ready yet, Kaylene made sure we had access to the Club Lounge so that we could go ahead and have breakfast.  Fantastic!  We checked our bags with the bellman, ate, and went out for several hours to explore the neighborhood.  We returned later to pick up our luggage and headed up to our room on the 19th floor with a fantastic view.  \n\nClub Lounge:  On our first night we also made it back in time for the nightly Hors d'ouevres in the club lounge.  Now, I realize that Hors d'oeuvres is a fancy french word, but you shouldn't really expect fancy, French (or otherwise fancy) food; again, this is a mid-range, economical hotel.  What you will find are a good selection of cheeses, crackers, chips, dips, fruit and, most importantly, wine!  Perfect for us, and we actually had \"dinner\" at the club lounge several evenings during our stay.  And I want to add that Deon, who staffs the club lounge in the evening, provided excellent service.  He's very friendly and helpful, and can get you what you need if something isn't available that should be.\n\nThe lounge space is actually very small, and does get crowded.  But it is attached to a fantastic rooftop area that is pretty cool to visit (weather permitting). The lounge is open 24\/7, and always has water, pop, and milk stocked.  Snacks may or may not be available depending on what time of day it is.\n\nRoom:  Our room seemed normal-sized to me.  We had a decent view (not sure which direction) and the beds were comfortable and clean.  We did discover two issues with the room once we were a few days into our stay.  First, the tub drain was very slow, which meant that water backed up during a shower.  It got to the point that we would turn it off to let the water drain out before continuing with our shower.  Second, the dehumidifier fan in the bathroom was not working.  So the room often ended up being super-humid and hot after several people showered.  And the shower curtain was not completely drying and had a smell to it as a result.  We had to keep the air conditioning blowing to solve the problem.  So, you might want to check your shower\/bathroom fan before settling in.  We'd been there for a few days already so we just tried to make it work.\n\nNeighborhood.  It's Tribeca folks.  Not Times Square.  Not Central Park West.  Not kiddieland.  If you need something to do the best tip is to research the neighborhood before you go and plan out your activities accordingly.  To me, it really wasn't a \"walk outside your hotel and find all these amazing things to do\" kind of area.  And if you end up walking the few blocks down the street towards Chinatown, yes, you will absolutely run into some sketchy characters (and maybe get a contact high).  But, that could happen anywhere in NYC, or probably your 'hood too.  If you're into artsy stuff, there's lots of independent artist spaces, pop-up shops, boutique clothing\/furniture spaces a few blocks over.  If you want to do serious shopping, there's a great mall at One World Trade Center that is partly underground and partly above ground where the designer stores are located.  There are two playgrounds that are fairly close but we only had time to visit the one at Pier 21.  My kids had a great time there and even jumped into a pick-up basketball game.  There were sit-down restaurants but we didn't go to any.  We did visit the Black Burger (a tiny burger joint), which was just aiight, and Billy's Bakery for some cupcakes and brownies, which were good.\n\nStaff:  I've already mentioned Kaylene and Deon.  There were a few bellmen and another front desk person who were great as well.  Was everyone perfect?  No.  Was the cleaning lady a little cranky?  Yes.  But I cut her some slack because I had to bother her for like 17,000 towels after one of my kids got sick and I understand that she probably wasn't expecting to use all the towels on her cart in my one room.  :) Overall, people were friendly and happy to help us get the things we needed.\n\nWhew!  In sum, have realistic expectations for the price you're paying and the neighborhood you're staying in, and you will enjoy this hotel.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Location: Pretty much in the middle of all action in New York; very close to Holland Tunnel, and walking distance from many of the tourist spots of the city.\n2. Staff attitude: Friendly, unobtrusive and prompt attendance to requests\n3. City view: Excellent view of the city from the rooms on the upper floors.\n4. If one just wants to stretch one's legs a bit and don't care much about other comforts, this is a decent place to go to.\nNeeds improvement:\n1. Rooms and decor: Badly need facelift.  \n2. Maintenance: Purely business-like and no effort to give a thought to what could be done to make the stay a bit more pleasant.  Least impressive.  In the 15 days that we stayed, not once were the bed linen changed.  No attempt to study our habits\/likes\/dislikes and structure the service accordingly.\n3. Breakfast: A rip-off.  Package said breakfast is included.  What we found was a lounge-based cold breakfast offer, just packaged cereals, croissants and coffee vending machines.  Even fruits were missing.  There was no kitchen so you won't get cooked food.\n4. Price: The hotel is definitely cheaper compared to the other hotels in the vicinity, but only after staying there did we realize why.  Having said that, the price definitely wasn't worth the experience we had.  We shouldn't have gone by the brand name of Sheraton.  The hotel certainly didn't live up to it.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The black mark was the restaurant. I'd also factored in the Italian restaurant when choosing the hotel, and the menu that I'd looked at on-line.  It looked fantastic. But when I got my chicken dish, it was inedible. All I could think was Podiatrist Convention rubber chicken.

We picked the Sheraton Tribeca due to its close proximity to the Holland Tunnel so we wouldn't have to spend eons of time sitting in traffic on our way out of the City. If you want quick access to NJ, easy access to the Subway, and a clean and basic place to stay, then this hotel will be enough for you. If you expect more, then keep reading!\n\nWe requested an early (12:00 pm) check-in. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30 and our room wasn't ready. We'd been upgraded because we were celebrating my birthday. Therefore, we decided to wait the hour for the room. We returned 90 mins. later to find out our room still wasn't ready. I was unhappy since we had to get ready for dinner and the show. Therefore, the front desk manager scrambled and found us another room. When we got upstairs to room 1809, we discovered it was directly across from the elevator (which is counter to what my SPG profile says) and it was hot and stuffy in the room. We called guest services who advised us to turn down the temperature and place the unit on auto fan. We did this, but it was still warm when we left 30 minutes later.\n\nWe arrived back at he hotel around 11:15 pm to discover our room was still hot and stuffy. We requested a room change. We were given room 1706, which was also warm, and significantly smaller than our previous room. However, by 11:30 pm, we just wanted to go to bed. By the time I turned in after midnight, the room had cooled a bit, but the air was blowing directly on my neck in the bed. I was bone tired so I sucked it up, pulled the covers up to my chin, and went to bed. Unfortunately, my neck was still when I woke up thanks to the Ir blowing on me.\n\nOur stay wasn't great.

It was just there... very obvious. \n\nPersonally, I think there should be a law against hotels renting out dirty rooms !!!  Someone needs to pay. Right now there is no recourse. \n\nWe paid for the club floor (higher floor), the manager said he would move us to the second floor without refunding the difference. \n\nAt this point, we did not feel comfortable anymore. What if they move us to another dirty room? \n\nWe decided to book a different hotel - we ended up at NoMo SoHo.

It was very nice after a day in New York, coming back to the hotel, visit the roof top lounge, sipping a glas of wine together with cheese, nachos, guacomole etc. All served by Duane, who was very nice and serviceminded.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hole in it. During our 3 nite stay we never obtained a bar of soap for shower, ran out of Kleenex, and although the burnt out shower light bulb was replaced they obviously did not try it after replacing as that too did not work. I had to place a towel on the ironing board as it's cover was stained and dirty. Those things aside, the rest of the room, tho small, was fine. The hotel itself centrally located, and employees nice.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1783324,"title":"Fantastic Hotel with nice staff","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-07-19","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Check In\nWe opted to spend a week in this hotel for a special occasion. I found the hotel was clean and tidy on entry. Jamie on check in was the first person to greet us and she was really lovely and had us smiling even though we where tired from our travels. She managed to check us in really quickly without any problems. I spoke with Sal a little after check in regarding a delivery I was expecting and he did a great job helping me with that and the subsequent follow up that was required, after the delivery firm made an error. It would have been nice if that had made it to the room however it was all a little thrown out by the delivery error. \n\nThe Room\nThe room was a good size for NYC and the view was amazing from the room. The only issue was the toilet flush tended to be a little intermittent, and on a few occasions I had to fix this myself, I'm sure had I raised the issue it would have been sorted. However for me it's quicker to get stuck in and sort it out. Victor was looking after our room each day and he did a great Job I can't thank him enough. He always took the time to say hi to us and crack a joke as we passed him, a really nice guy and he was always working really hard whenever we saw him. \n\nClub Lounge\nThe club lounge was tired and didn't have a toilet on the same floor we found this a little odd. You had to go back to your room if you needed the loo. The outside club veranda had the best views you could want in NYC easily on a par with the Empire state and Rocker fella, however it was in need of a tidy up and a few $ spending on it as it was tired and dated, I expected more from a big NYC hotel in this area. The evening snacks where very basic. Little things like bringing cushions in when it looked like rain was going to come down, background music and modern lighting would have been good. Possibly a wind-out canopy and power wash the floor. All small relatively low cost things that really would make a difference.The club staff did a great job at breakfast and of an evening. Deon and Alexia (I think her name was) really went out their way to keep the lounge tidy and well stocked in the evening even when really busy. Both really lovely people and put a lot of effort in to checking in with us to make sure we had everything and give us advice on the city. On a few occasions people seemed to be using the club lounge to hold personal gatherings for friends or associates that where not staying in the hotel, that was a bit off putting as we paid for that privilege, and the bar should have been used for that type of gathering especially when busy.   \n\nLocation\nOverall a great hotel and location sitting on the edge of China town and Little Italy. This offers fantastic transport links and access to subway lines within a block or two. E line subway takes you uptown to time square within 15 mins and down town to the trade centre within a few stops. Loads of places to eat and drink around the hotel all within a walking distance. We stayed just off Time Square last time and would never do it again after staying in the Sheraton Tribeca 100% better quality and the staff actually acted like they care. \n\nRecommendation\nTry dining, we stopped in one evening and decided to eat down stairs. The restaurant was quiet and the service was really good from both the guys. The food was spot on, the rib eye steak was cooked to perfection and even me being a fussy eater enjoyed it. It was quite big as well. The Lamb dish was also very good. And the cost was the same as local bars only issue the meals could have come with a few more sides. 100% recommended.\n\nBad Points\nThe lack of beer in the bar on arrival. We got told a few different things and only two beers ended up on draught by the end of our week. The club lounge had no beer at all after our fifth day of being told no beer we got given a few beer vouchers. This meant going down to the bar and carrying the beer back up to the 21st floor. I was really disappointed with this and the solution provided by the hotel on the whole. Although the staff did their very best it was just not acceptable for a full week, I ended up drinking wine however it was not that nice. I'm sure management must have been aware of the issue and see no reason a few crates could not have picked up from the store. This was the most disappointing thing for me during our stay.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had to ask most of my 7 mornings there could I have cereal and the staff would go into store and hand you out one. They seemed to do this to all people wanting breakfast .I was miffed as to why they just didn't put the cereals they had out .I also had to asked for boiling water every morning too to make my tea as water in the flask which said hot water was only ever like warm.I noticed the staff were too busy texting in their mobile phones to replenish the breakfast items as they ran out.Even getting a plate was difficult as they put out about 3 at a time. Also breakfast was suppose to be at 7am but never ever anything ready at that time and my family wanted to eat early to get out early as a lot to get in on the holiday . Also there were 4 of us in room but towels were always lacking. Left 2 hand towels for 4 people and got face cloths one day but were never replaced again once used .I never saw a cleaner once and also wasn't left toilet roll so had to ask for that . Every thing just seemed to have no regular routine to it . If these things were all addressed it would be a good hotel as in great convenient location for tubes one minute walk away.

SPG Corporate offered little choice and I had to stay in a hotel that was not in my desired area. As a frequent business traveler, I was flabbergasted by the deplorable customer service and lack of standard cleanliness at the Sheraton Tribeca.

If my son was an older teen this might have been a reasonable option but in a strange city on one of New York's busiest and most chaotic streets, he did not feel happy about sleeping alone. Consequently we had to have those heavy adjoining fire doors constantly propped open by a chair and we never felt properly relaxed and of course we couldn't unpack.  \n\nThese rooms were not great, being right outside the lift. The next day we did some early sightseeing so that we could come back in the early afternoon to claim our new room. However, when we came back we were told that we were welcome to keep the extra room at no extra charge as there would not be a twin room available that day either. I really couldn't believe their casual attitude about all of this and how they didn't seem to appreciate how inconvenienced we felt about it. \n\nAt my insistence I got complimentary access to their 'club' area which was a lounge on the top floor which was a very pleasant and stylish lounge with a 24\/7 supply of drinks and snacks and spectacular views of New York from the terrace. However, only the next day did I finally get a twin room and what a sorry sight it was. It actually had a badly cracked basin in the bathroom, and when leaning over the sink to brush my teeth I had a close-up view of just how filthy the overflow hole was. One of the towels also had black staining on it - like mascara although it had been laundered so it really should have been de-commissioned. The desk chair had a revolting stain on it - nothing that upholstery cleaner wouldn't shift - but it just seemed typical of the lack of care or attention to detail. The beds were very comfortable so no complaints there. However, I was surprised and disappointed in a four star hotel that there was not even a little fridge anywhere to keep our drinks and fresh milk. There would have been space for this if a couple of shelves were taken out of their poor quality and unattractive brown furniture. \n\nSo I wouldn't recommend this place - the staff did not treat us well and there are better hotels out there for the price.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The bathrooms are also too small with no space to put your toiletries. The closet was tiny and looked like the closets they have in a college dorm! One more thing--we usually had to wait at least 5 minutes for the lift as there were 3 lifts but 1 was out of order, which apparently is the case all the time. The lift then kept stopping at lots of floors since so many other people had been waiting. Overall, very disappointing!! I would not recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Maybe I would consider to stay here next time im in NYC.\n\nBut dont expect any of the normal Sheraton standards. The rooms feel old, with furniture falling apart, dust everywhere, torn towlels and mold in the shower. I asked the reception twice (both second and third day) to get someone to remove the mold, but none of the mold were removed (the second time I could see the roomkeeper had cleaned the shower but still mold). I was not offered a new mold-free room.\n\nDont waste your money on the breakfast. The breakfast is small and expensive. They do have scrambled eggs (though rubbery) and awesome bacon, and great waffle-machine, but if you want a bagel for breakfast (or something healthy) they are dry (didn't feel fresh, though they probably were) and sweet and with nothing but peanutbutter, jam and philadelphia (cream cheese) to put on it (no cheese, ham, salami etc.).. This could of course be a normal US\/NYC breakfast, but as a European I would recomend you go out of the hotel for breakfast where you can find something more healthy.\n\nTo conclude: okey hotel, perhaps I'll stay here again, but if you ever stayed at a Sheraton hotel before - don't expect the same experience. Personally I think it is a bit strange Sheraton accepts its name on this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They all have made a definite impression on us though! \n\nWill the Front Desk Manager is a wonderful asset to not only this hotel but to the Sheraton Corporation! \n\nThe Conceiarge Level is wonderful! They really put out a nice spread for appetites of all kinds. \n\nThe view from the top patio is phenomenal! We look foreword to spending much time up there this summer with our family!! \n\nThe rooms are nice! You can never go wrong with a think Sheraton bed. The rooms are nicely updated and have many extra touches to make use of all of the space in a New York size room :) Which exist at any hotel you go to in any big city! \n\nWhat I feel is an added bonus is that there is a fine dining restaurant located inside the hotel. There is also a wonderful deli (24 hour) located right next door. There is a Pizza Parlor on the corner about a half a block away. \n\nAt this property you are walking distance to the underground subway, Canal St & Little Italy. \n\nYou really can\u2019t go wrong with this property.

It was all great until we tried to place an order for room service breakfast the next morning. We followed the directions on the card that was given to us and hung it on our door for them to take. We requested a delivery between 10:15-10:30am. Woke up the next morning and no breakfast. Checked the door and the card was taken, so they must have received the order. We called to inquire about what happened and to cancel the breakfast since we had made plans that we needed to get to. Spoke to a gentleman who said he would get back to me about what happened and we never heard back from him. So that was very disappointing. \n\nWhile we were getting ready to leave for the day, housekeeping came by our room. We simply told them we were leaving shortly and to come back in a half hour and they said no problem. On our way out, we even spoke with the front desk and told them housekeeping stopped by and we want to be sure our room gets cleaned and she said she would notify them now. So, we came back well after five hours to our room not cleaned. We went down to the front desk and the man told us they were \"backed up and he'll check on it for us\" he also thought we had our DND sign on the door, but we never used it. Nothing ever happened, there was no follow through, so we gave up and had to request a whole set of things for the room (towels, soaps, shampoo, toilet paper, coffee, etc) and the woman rushed me off the phone so quickly and forgot half of the items we requested. \n\nEverything about this trip and hotel would have been wonderful had those few things not happened.

Also perfect for metro access both uptown and downtown.\n- Excellent value for money (IF you book in advance)\n\nNegatives:\n\n- For a Sheraton hotel\/4-star hotel, it could maybe do with some\n  renovation work\n- Breakfast was average in the Club Lounge. The evening service is above average, Dion was very welcoming and the wine selection is good (nice Malbec!)\n- The Antica bar is a tad pricey but they have a good selection of beers, in particular the ales.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Laut Information auf der Webseite, liegen die Club Level R\u00e4ume auf der 21+22 Etage. Zus\u00e4tzlich bekommt man Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck incl in der Club-Level Lounge.\n\nBeim einchecken, bekammen wir aber nur ein Zimmer in der 17 Etage angeboten. Wir haben der Dame am Empfang direkt gesagt, dass wir aber ein Club-Level Raum gebucht haben. Diese Zimmer w\u00e4ren aber nur auf der 21+22 Etage. Wir haben extra diese Zimmer gebucht, damit wir einen besseren Ausblick haben, Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck dabei ist, und diese Zimmer kosten auch mehr Geld\n\nLeider k\u00f6nnten wir ein Zimmer auf diesen Etagen heute nicht bekommen, weil die ALLE ausgebucht sind.\n\nTja, was soll ich sagen?!? Die Club-Level Zimmer kosten mehr, sind auch nur auf 2 Etagen angeboten und wir bekommen ein Zimmer auf ein paar Etagen tiefer.\n\nDie Dame am Empfang meinte noch, es w\u00e4ren eh alle Zimmer gleich - aha, und wieso kosten dann die Club-Level Zimmer mehr?? Wir k\u00f6nnten aber in 2 Tagen umziehen.\n\nNaja, 1x den Koffer ausgepackt, wer zieht da noch freiwillig nach 2 Tagen um??\n\nMit den Zimmerkarten hat man dann automatisch Zugang zu der Lounge. Leider ging unsere Karte nicht, die T\u00fcr blieb verschlossen. Warum? Weil wir eine Zimmer-Karte f\u00fcr einen Standard-Zimmer hatten und eben nicht Club-Level Zimmer. Also, wieder runter zum Empfang, Problem angesprochen. Wir wurden dann manuell daf\u00fcr freigeschaltet, sodass unsere Karten f\u00fcr die Lounge funktionierten.\n\nZimmer: Zimmer war sauber, aber sehr laut. Obwohl es in der 17 Etage war, konnte man jedes Auto h\u00f6ren, da es mit Fenster an der Canal Str. lag. Man hatte das Gef\u00fchl, man h\u00e4tte das Fenster ge\u00f6ffnet.\n\nFr\u00fchst\u00fcck: In der Lounge flogen \u00fcberall dreckige Teller rum, es wurde nur sporadisch abger\u00e4umt. Deswegen sah es teilweise echt ungem\u00fchtlich aus.\n\nIch bewerte hier oft und habe durchaus auch viele positive Bewertungen, aber hier gibt es einfach zu viel zum meckern.\n\nFakt ist: Das Hotel mit Standardzimmer, ohne Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist mit Sicherheit ok. Aber wenn man schon Club-Level Zimmer anbieten und daf\u00fcr bezahlt, m\u00f6chte man auch so ein Zimmer haben. Wir haben kein Geld zur\u00fcck bekomen, und wurden einfach so am Empfang vertr\u00f6stet.

Five minutes later, Luis (front desk) saved the day and brought me wine, even though the lounge and restaurant (and room service) was closed.

But during my stay the room was absolutely filthy and some of the towels were torn and stained. I don't expect a large or fancy room (this is not the W) but don't expect it to be dirty. In addition the wifi did not work and never rectified. Ended up having to use international roaming to send work emails that could not wait. Housekeeping did not provide turndown service one day after I called to make sure it would be done in the morning. When I called the manager with these issues he said he would email me with a detailed reply and offer points as compensation. Neither happened. I also had an important package being delivered to me which the hotel said they never received. then later said the person did not give them my last name so they couldn't locate me.

We did not use their valet parking - it would have cost us $150 to valet our SUV for 48 hours.  We parked it on our own close by & it was $125 for 48 hours.  When we arrived 90 minutes before check in time we were told our room was clean but it hadn't been released by housekeeping.  No problem - we checked our bags and went out & explored.  The room was small as most NYC hotel rooms are.  It was clean.  The previous occupant left a suit hanging in the wardrobe.  We gave the suit to the maid in the hallway and she didn't seem to know what to do with it.  The first problem encountered was the shower stall.  In order to reach the shower knobs, you have to get into the shower & the first cold blast of water lands right on you. Then you have to back up & stand against the back wall while it warms up so only your feet are exposed to the cold water until warm water comes out.  The next problem were the bed pillows - they were all super soft and feathery & didn't support your head or neck at all. My husband went without a pillow - I took the throw pillow off the chair and wrapped in it a towel & used that.   Throughout the night we discovered these rooms have zero sound proofing.  We were by the elevator & heard every person (most of them loud since it was after midnight) who was coming back for the night.  Some decided they needed to use the ice maker after midnight which was also across from our room & very loud.   The next day we went out from 8:30-10:00am &  11:00am-2:30pm.  Housekeeping did not clean our room during this time.  I took two clean towels off the cart in the hallway so we could shower for the wedding.   We took a nap to make up for the bad night's sleep the night before & then got ready.  As we were leaving at 5:30pm we went to the front desk and told them that our room was not cleaned by housekeeping today and we would like it to be serviced now.  The man at the front desk did not seem to care so it wasn't a surprise when we got back at midnight & it was still dirty.  My husband called down for clean towels for the morning & they did bring them up right away.  At 5am I was awoken by 3 people who decided to sit on the floor near the ice maker and have a conversation at full volume.  Finally after 20 minutes - I opened the door and asked them to please take their conversation elsewhere.   I was more than happy to leave this hotel on Sunday morning.  I've been to other Starwood properties in Manhattan that were great so we will not be going back to this one.   On Monday morning I got an updated folio for our stay.  They added a $4 water charge to the bill.  The Evian water was $4 and we did not touch it.  The Dasani was complimentary & we did drink that.

The hotel is in very good condition and is very well maintained.  Despite being a high traffic property it is still not showing wear and tear in my experience.  \n\nI use this hotel for both business and personal stays in NY.  There are multiple subways that are very close so it's easy to get anywhere.  The location is awesome if you like a more neighborhood feel, lots of shopping and dining nearby.  I much prefer being down here to midtown which feels very generic and touristy compared to SoHo\/Tribeca.\n\nMy experience with the staff has always been terrific, particularly the front desk.  In particular Sal is awesome and remembers me by name.  You have to care quite a bit to pull that off, especially when it might be a couple months since I've been in and this is a busy hotel.  Also, Katie on the Guest Relations team has been very proactive and helpful in reaching out to get feedback and help with any questions and requests.  Again, she obviously cares quite a bit.  I feel bad I don't remember all the names of the other great folks, it's not because they don't offer great service as well.\n\nSPG recognition is the best I've experienced in NYC as well.  I've been to just about every property in midtown (all brands) and this hotel is consistently the best with upgrades and amenities.\n\nFinally, I usually find this hotel to be very reasonably priced compared to the other SPG properties in town.  \n\nSome tips:\n\n1.  The club lounge is awesome.  Good service, food selection, extra snacks during the day and one of the best views in the whole city and an amazing roof deck.  If there weather is nice you don't even need to go out, hang out and have drinks on the roof deck.\n\n2.  Peppolino for Italian right around the corner is terrific.  \n\n3.  Nancy Whiskey is a great dive bar with good burgers right around the corner\n\n4.  The gym is decent but there is also a Planet Fitness connected\n\n5.  Canal St is very busy, sometimes it's easier to have your Uber\/Lyft\/Car meet you across the street or around the corner\n\n6.  Like many NYC hotels, the rooms can be small.

The gym was immediately below our $300+\/day room, and the treadmill noise -- thumpa, thumpa, thumpa, thumpa -- woke me at 7:00 am and continued non-stop for an hour before I finally gave up after only 3 1\/2 hours of sleep); 3. NO SHELF\/DRAWER SPACE IN THE ENTIRE ROOM, SO WE WERE FORCED TO LIVE OUT OF OUR SUITCASES FOR 2 DAYS BEFORE WE MOVED OUT; 4. terrible night staff attitude and service (day staff much better and accommodating); 5. view of pipes and brick wall outside both of the rooms to which we were assigned, AND THESE WERE SUPPOSEDLY THE BEST ROOMS IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL!!!; 6. I could go on, but why bother? The bottom line: THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST 25 YEARS, and my wife & I are seasoned world travelers (each of us has visited more than 80 different countries)!!!","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Sheraton TriBeCa is on Canal, nestled in between takeaway shops and closed shops. The subway connections are good and it's a short walk to Soho and Downtown but on an evening there are questionable characters lurking outside and the atmosphere can be uncomfortable. \n\nI didn't have a great arrival or start to my stay here, problems with the room rate I booked, a dirty room and argumentative manager. Eventually all was resolved, I was given a different room, given the correct room rate and promised points for my troubles; the female manager didn't get why I was frustrated and didn't come back to me to follow up. \n\nThe problem with this property is that it's dated, never particularly feels fully clean and the club lounge and lobby bar are always incredibly crowded; it makes relaxing anywhere but your room difficult. There is a Starbucks concession in the lobby which is an added bonus. \n\nThe rooms here do need updating and the furnishings do need replacing. The rate here is not cheap compared to other hotels in the area and hence the value for money is questionable. The TV's are terrible but the wifi is good. \n\nThe service, in general, was good. Reception team were friendly and the bell boy and concierge was also welcoming and helpful. The night manager was good; he tried to resolve the issues I'd faced on arrival. \n\nRoom service was always good and quick.\n\nI think more attention needs to be paid to housekeeping here and with ensuring SPG benefits are delivered consistently. This could be a great hotel instead of a good hotel if standards were improved. \n\nI am still waiting a response from the hotel as to why my rate changed before my arrival and why I was downgraded. They did eventually sort this out but still annoying and shouldn't happen. \n\n ","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Being on the 18th floor, I couldn't just nip down close to the scheduled time, so I phoned the front desk... and it rang and rang and rang for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, my client is phoning from Spain and similarly, no-one is picking up. The client, my publisher and I are all swapping emails and still no-one is picking up. Eventually a man does pick up and I say, 'where have you been?'. 'Right here', he replies. So I tell him about the calls, and he claims no-one rang through. BUT I RANG THROUGH! So frustrating. \n\nSo overall, a well-located hotel (bring ear-plugs - Canal street is noisy even if your room, like mine, is not on Canal Street itself - but a business hotel this is not!","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

You usually have to choose between location and cost, and getting both is pretty rare. NYC has a good number of hip boutique hotels that spawl across Tribeca and Soho, but these usually come upwards of \u00a3300 per night. If you are like me, it's great to stay in cool and hip hotel, but a great location and price that isn't going cripple me is more important.\n\nThe Sheraton Tribeca is located on Canal Street, a busy road linking the Holland Tunnel and Manhattan bridge and splits the Tribeca and Lower Manhattan neighbourhoods. At first glance you feel like the hotel is sandwiched between two busy lanes of traffic, which it is, however you are also positioned within 15 minutes walk from some of the nicest places to eat and drink in Manhattan. A Metro stop is around the corner so you can reach the heights of Central Park and Times Square easily, however if you want to sightsee around either of these locations then I wouldn't stay here and instead opt for somewhere further north.\n\nWalking out of the door of the hotel to the north is the delights of Soho and Greenwich, with the Meat Packing district about 30 minutes walk. Bleekers Street, famous for eateries and live music is 15 minutes away. 15 minutes to the east is Little Italy and Chinatown, and 15 minutes to the south is the WTC.\n\nInside the hotel the rooms are of average size, a little dated, but clean and comfy enough. The sound proofing isn't great as the doors don't really keep the noise out, however the beds are very comfortable which makes sleeping after a long day of walking the streets nice and easy.  \n\nAll in all if you are looking for a good location then The Sheraton Tribeca ticks the boxes especially if you are a foodie and live music junky. Don't expect boutique decor and long velvet curtains or you will be disappointed.\n\nTransfers to JFK are 1.15hr and Newark approx 1hr.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is a good location if you want to be down here.  The gym is OK as long as there are only 2 or 3 people in it.  The free breakfast is probably OK if you get there the minute they open, otherwise it is really picked over and sort of gross by 10:00 am.  The housekeeping is what really made me drop it to 3 stars.  I stayed 5 nights and I had to finally ask for them to vacuum my room and clean my desk and my sink.  Plus the housekeepers bang the doors of whatever room they are cleaning 10 or 15 times.  I do not understand why they can't stick a towel in the door but instead they let it slam shut each time they go out to their cart.  It woke us up early every morning and then in the late afternoon when I would try to rest before going out to dinner, bang bang bang all over again.  So, housekeeping is not good,not very clean,  but the rest of the people at the hotel are really nice.

The linens were nice and the bathroom was clean. I think the one change this hotel could make is the LOBBY. It's tiny -- probably can't do much about that -- and really quite tired.
