There is also a ferry to Long Island City and a bridge to Long Island City. We were a short way from the action! \n- Hotel was Modern - felt new and clean overall \n- Fun rooftop bar - beautiful (over 21s only) \n- Restaurant and bar that was just fine in the hotel on the ground floor\n- Lifts were fast and accessible \n- We parked in the Cornell Lot just behind the hotel and paid $25 a night \n- The Roosevelt park at the end of island is well worth a visit. \n\nThe Bad:\n- Housekeeping did not clean our room when we were out for the day (11 am to 10 pm). \n- I asked the receptionist about the above and was told that housekeeping had to be requested. The need to request, was not posted in the room or shared at check-in, so we were disappointed to return to a room that needed to be refreshed. A four-star hotel should have a straightforward procedure for communicating when and how to access housekeeping. \n- The bathroom did have a subtle smell of dampness, and mildew was starting to show in the shower by the shower screen attached to the wall (you need to be in the shower to notice it). It just needed a power wash (room 1213). \n- The shower gel was empty in the shower (it was attached to the wall, but the shampoo and conditioner were good), which was annoying.\n\nFor us, the good far outweighed the bad - we would return. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

A technician came shortly after and tried via multiple attempts to fix the A\/C issue. Ultimately, the A\/C issue was unable to be fixed and I had to spend the duration of my night in excruciating heat while I was completing a cumbersome assignment due the next morning. To compound the issues, the Wi-Fi in the hotel is atrocious (used to be okay) and I had to resort to using my personal hotspot to get my work done. I give kudos to the excellent front desk staff and the A\/C technician who were (and always are) very responsive and attentive to any issues I face regarding the room.\n\nMy frustration with this hotel stems from the sheer incompetence from management once I spoke with one of the managers the next morning to see what could be done to avoid this issue going forward. This particular manager (Brian) offered me no resolution with the A\/C and Wi-Fi issues I reported to him the next morning. I have connected with some of the other managers at the Graduate Hotel and I cannot blanket my feedback for all of the managers as I am sure there are some proactive and empathetic managers from the management staff. Although I was not seeking compensation (since the rooms are pre-booked via my program), Brian made it clear that there is nothing which could be done (and could have been done) and my best bet was to reach out to the Operations Manager via email so they could ensure it does not happen again. I was told I could not have been placed in another room since all of their rooms were booked out. I was offered an upgrade for my next stay (if it was available) however with the level of dismay I had in reaction to this manager's response I immediately declined and said it is not necessary. The culmination of events which took place that night and the apogee encompassing being offered an email contact (for the operations manager) who I was implored to contact will forever taint my consideration of this hotel for any future stays. I can confidently say that this is perhaps the most reprehensible customer service I have ever experienced.\n\nI would also like to mention the fact that the hot water was not working 2 weeks prior when I had class, and the issue was pervasive across all of their rooms. Again, I understand issues happen however the chocolate bar, bag of chips, and alcoholic drink which was on my hotel room study table was a borderline insult of a gesture with the experience I had this time around.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The decor was lovely, comfortable beds, everything was very clean and felt new (especially in comparison to a 1 night stay we had at the rather run-down Cambria hotel on our final night in NYC after some other travel in the US and Canada). We loved taking the Tramway to and from the Island - such a great way to arrive in the city, and very convenient to nearby subway stations. We also took the ferry to Pier 11 in downtown Manhattan one day - the ferry stop is just a few minutes walk from the hotel and it was a really wonderful trip. We took the F train a few times as well. There are a few eating places and small shops on the island and while we didn't eat in the hotel facilities, we bought a couple of takeaway coffees from the restaurant. We would definitely recommend travellers consider staying here, it's not inconvenient to get to\/from and was a lovely quiet space to retreat after being immersed in the hecticness of the city all day.

We requested compensation at checkout at which time the front desk host went to the managers office with our request. She returned and told us our stay would be discounted by 20%. We asked if this discount would be applied across the wedding block of rooms. She again checked with management and the response was No (why not?). She printed an invoice and stated that the manager had not yet applied the discount but they would email me an updated invoice once that was done. It\u2019s now over a week and I have neither received a corrected invoice nor corrections to the charges to my credit card. I have left detailed messages with hotel staff. Management has failed to return my call or take corrective action. In addition I had my family for brunch in the Panorama room it was quite literally the worst dining experience we have ever had. Food was delivered one plate at a time over an hour period. This was an embarrassment for my husband and I as we were hosting family. There were other wedding parties at the hotel. I will say that our family made the best of the situation for the sake of the bride and groom.

We originally booked through booking.com bed+breakfast but decided to add our daughters. Since the booking site experienced technical difficulties, I called the hotel from Israel, and canceled the original booking while making a new one for 4 people. At no point was I told the conditions would be different. When we got to the hotel, the front desk told us our reservation did not include breakfast, and even if it did through Booking.com, it would only be coffee and pastries. When we got to the room there were only 2 towels for a company of 4. I tried calling the front desk but they wouldn't pick up. I went down there in person to ask for extra towels.\nOur room had not been cleaned and after 2 days when I complained they told us we had to notify them that we wanted housekeeping 24 hours in advance and it is an extra charge. My husband called to say they left us with no toilet paper, tissues or fresh towels and they promised to bring some up, but never did. We had to ask from the room nearby. UTTERLY, COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!\nThere was no coffee machine in the room. I bought a mini kettle (they told us there would be coffee 24\/7 in the lobby but at 11 am said that's the latest there is any). When the cleaning lady came, she threw away the sugar and sweetener I bought for my coffee.\nWhen I went to complain at the front desk, the 1 person working was busy. After waiting for 20 minutes I asked to speak to the manager. She then said she would handle it, but after saying I had a few complaints she just ignored me completely. I ended up talking to the manager who was sick and that made me uncompfortable to disturb him. He offered no compensation, no apologies whatsoever except for not charging us for the housekeeping (which apparently they charge extra and is not included in the price).\nI have no idea why the hotel is so highly rated. It is one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever encountered  (and we travel several times a year). Our mood during our trip was extremely low due to the atrocities occurring in my country, and the staff surely did not help elevating it in any way by their attitude.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The day of arrival I stopped by the Hotel and dropped my bags.  They put the bags in an unlocked room with no tag designating ownership and have no checking process, this was surprising to me.  I checked with the front desk and asked about getting a room with a view of the city and they ensured me it was in my notes.  Upon returning to check in at 5:15 pm I was given room 914.  This wasn't a high floor and it had view of the adjacent office building.  I went to the front desk to see if there was a solution, without checking her computer or putting in the slightest effort she informed me that there was nothing else available and rooms choices aren't guaranteed.  I paid over $800 for the night for a room that had no view, the layout wasn't remotely what the pictures show and the furniture and decor was like a cheap college dorm.  I want to say that I have stayed at Graduate properties in multiple other cities and have always had an excellent experience.  This experience was beyond disappointing for the price that i paid and the absolute lack of desire to even attempt to accommodate my request.  I could have stayed many other very nice locations in the city for the same price that night.  This wasn't a Holiday weekend or nothing of note was going on in the city that weekend.  I was just a Saturday in October, where i spent $800 to look at an office building and not get told about any of the hotel amenities or be given access to the Panorama Room, which looks beautiful in pictures.

First, it's very quiet!  Even though the Queensborough bridge is right outside, we did not notice any traffic noise.  It is easily accessible by transit, either via the unique Roosevelt Island Tramway, or by the metro station a short walk away.\nThe disadvantage is that while you can walk around the island, there are only a few restaurants nearby.  To take advantage of most of what NY has to offer, you will have to take transit everywhere.  The ferry dock is also close by, providing the option of a river trip to get to Lower Manhattan.\nOf course, being a little more remote does result in lower prices!  The large room we had was one of the least expensive we could find for its size anywhere in NYC.  And to top it off, it had great views!  (but be aware the posted rate did not include the exorbitant \"resort fee\" that I believe is charged by most large hotels).  The room was modern, clean and comfortable.  There was a safe in the room, but it did lack a kettle.\nThe free telephone calls from our room came in handy when our flight was cancelled with short notice and we had to spend hours on the phone rescheduling!\nI would certainly consider staying here again on any return trip to NYC.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

You'd be better purchasing your breakfast at Starbucks a few blocks away.  You need reservations to go up to the rooftop bar when it is busy so be aware and no one under age.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23299040,"title":"Nice room but some communication issues ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-05-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"My daughter and I first learned about the beautiful views from the Panorama Room right after it opened from a person we met that lives on Roosevelt Island. They were right! Likely my favorite views of the city! So when my daughter graduated this month from Columbia, my husband and I decided to make a week's reservation to stay at the Graduate Hotel! \n\nWhen I made the reservation several months ago, we decided to get the \"Get Up + Go Package\" which included a continental breakfast from their Anything At All lobby restaurant. I mistakenly made the reservation for one person instead of two, so I made a reservation change online and also called the hotel to make sure they adjusted it. The person I spoke with ensured us that our reservation was changed to two and that the price would be the same (we were spending well over $2600 for our stay). \n\nUpon arrival, the person at the front desk said the reservation was only for one person and that only one of us could get the continental breakfast. So I explained what happened but she had no record of it. She said she would talk to the manager about it -- and later advised that the manager said we would have to pay extra for the continental breakfast. It all felt so silly - we are talking basically coffee (which is free for all anyway) and pastries, fruit, or granola. Besides, we had to miss breakfast a couple times during our stay because we had to leave for graduation events before they served it. They relented after all but we felt it was a poor way to start our stay. \n\nI think communication is a problem in general there because before we arrived I sent an inquiry to the Panorama Room asking about the Mother's Day brunch menu and they never responded. I tried calling a few times and could not get through. So although I made a reservation for brunch, I ended up canceling it. \n\nAs for the room, we very much liked it. We had a great view from the 17th floor, the bed was comfortable, the room was large, and we liked the Roosevelt era decor. So the rating is mainly for the that. \n\nYou can reach Roosevelt Island via the F train or the tram (which is fun for one trip over). Getting there can wear on you over a long time but it was an interesting place\/location to stay. ","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We are also disappointed in not having a kettle in the rooms for tea and coffee. The coffee\/tea in lobby wasn't there during the day (only morning) and wasn't of the quality that one would expect at this caliber of hotel (i.e. Lipton tea when it should be a good quality brand). This would greatly improve the experience for guests. Also, really disappointed in the \"facility fee\", this should be eliminated or added onto the price of the room. It is an additional fee that doesn't make sense and is a whopping $39\/night or you should pay it if you use the gym maybe?

My partner and I did a staycation for his birthday and of the hundreds of hotels in the city\/boroughs\/Jersey, I decided to go with the Graduate without having any information to go off of. I stayed in the Premiere King room, and it was better than anything I could have imagined. Being on the island itself makes you feel so close and yet comfortable removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. The panoramic views of the city and the bride from the room was STUNNING both during the day and night time. The hotel has such a unique vibe and aesthetic, it gives classy and quirky all in one. You somehow feel like a full grown adult while experiencing your inner child. The Panorama Room - their rooftop bar and lounge - was INCREDIBLE and the perfect birthday brunch spot. It was awesome that we didn't even have to go outside to get to brunch. The place itself is more than enough to keep you coming back, but the staff just added even more to the overall experience. Wendy greeted me with a genuine (because in the city you can always tell when people in the service industry are being ingenuine) smile and a warm welcome. Both her and Rebecca were so excited for me to celebrate my boyfriends birthday there, and they did everything in their power to make our stay perfect. They were so fun and friendly and I would come back again just to experience that level of welcoming-ness.\n\nI loved every part of staying at the Graduate hotel and I truly cannot wait for my next staycation there.

I just do not think there can be any excuse, for any hotel of this kind charging these rates in New York, not have daily house keeping.\nWe were informed at check in when we asked that there was no daily housekeeping\/cleaning of guest rooms. We were told housekeeping was provided for guests staying longer than 3 days, every 3rd day -  which doesn't really help if you're staying for anything less than that. To be fair, used towels were removed and replaced with fresh towels, and trash was emptied, when we called down to request this. But again, it's a real let-down not to have daily housekeeping for a hotel like this. It's a shame because we would happily stay here again apart from this; and if it not remedied, the next visit to New York won't be here.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The Graduate Roosevelt Hotel is located on the island of the same name and is the only 4 star hotel. Even though the location is far from Manhattan but very accessible via the subway or tram and the quality of the bedding in modern rooms, this stay was not at all up to our expectations and the hotel failed in the following areas:\n\n- Unprofessional, uncourteous and  rude interaction between the reception team and the guest. As an example, when checking out on the morning of August 28th, I was verbally abused by the person on duty at that time (a woman) because I could not check the bill. This attitude is not acceptable in this type of establishment. I seriously invite Mr Mohit Malhotra, GM  to investigate the problem with the employee in question. The lack of training of the staff who are in constant contact with the customers is undeniable. Is there a leader in this hotel? \n\n- The daily cleaning of the rooms is not automatic and no one informs you of this at check-in. I am amazed of  this choice made by the management. The worst thing is when you ask the reception in the morning to clean your room and they tell you: no problem, it will be done every day during your stay when it is not!\n\n- When you have chosen a breakfast included in the price of the room, this one is continental and is limited to 3 options. If you want a savoury breakfast, then you have to pay extra for the so-called American breakfast. The quality\/price ratio is poor. I invite you to choose a single room and pay for an\" \u00e0 la carte\" breakfast.\n\n- The Panorama bar. A security guard escorts you to the bar or selects the floor to access it. These agents are for the most part unpleasant, unpolite and disrespectful. At over 50, you are asked for an ID card as they probably think you are under 21...  The panorama bar is still a must with a great view on Manhattan. \n\nIn short, a very very mixed stay, too expensive for the service provided and a score that will be just as much: 2 out of 5 for the simple reason that you don't insult a customer who asks to check the bill before confirming that the card can be debited. For this reason alone, I would not recommend the establishment unless serious efforts are made and a staff training program is put in place.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

My overall stay was good (I even hesitate to say 'very good'), but several instances kept me from giving it the rave review I was partial to writing. First, and most importantly: employee training. It was clear from the chaos at the front desk during check-in and check-out times, from the inability of a hotel employee to find a table for one in a seemingly empty restaurant (and his aggravation to boot), from the inability of the hostess at the Panorama Room to lead a guest to the bar or the terrace because all the tables were booked how so many employees were unfamiliar with basic hospitality protocols and ill-equipped to handle essential parts of their job. Perhaps a traditional roll-out of services and amenities during the check-in process would have clarified to guests that they could use any elevator to access their floors, needed a separate card to enter the fitness center, could enjoy coffee and tea as part of their stay (?), rent bicycles (?), claim a wellness kit (?), and were subject to a facility fee that covered the latter three, as I learned when I checked the hotel\u2019s website after my stay. \n\nAnd then the rooms themselves \u2014 beautifully designed, with stunning views\u2014 could have used a little more attention to detail. How about a coffee pod machine for a morning pick-me up, or a piece of hotel paper and a pen that the guests could take home as a memento of their stay?  Small details like these\u2014in addition to making sure there\u2019s enough toilet paper and body wash\u2014 go a long way in crafting a unique experience for guests. \n\nJudging from the mountains of luggage behind the front desk, it\u2019s likely that my stay coincided with a particularly hectic weekend. The check-out process was no less chaotic, with guests filing in at once, unsure where to go, while a lone employee tried to move the line as quickly as possible. A speedy process that was efficient on the surface was anything but, as I never got a chance to review the room and restaurant charges and wrongly assumed I would receive an email receipt with the breakdown (still waiting). \n\nAll in all, I was ready to enjoy my stay and recommend the hotel to a friend or colleague. While I would still do the latter, such a recommendation would inevitably come with the aforementioned caveats\u2014caveats that could make others pause before they book their stay. The Graduate Hotel at Roosevelt Island has found its aesthetic: sleek, cool, slightly bookish. But it has yet to find its footing. I sincerely hope it invests in training their employees and staff so that they in turn can make the experience a memorable one for guests. They have all the potential to do so.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

After that I communicated with the Operations Manager and reiterated again and again that I had questions over this charge, as I have not spent extras during my stay, however the money was already taken from my bank account directly. Their team then checked and found that the charge was from a meal receipt at their restaurant. I again (the 3rd or 4th time now) told them I never dined at their restaurant - I had to prove this by telling them I was at one of their conference rooms, on another floor, attending a private dinner at the same time and what I wore that night, before they issued a refund (short of $6 probably due to transaction fees ) to me. \n\nThe hotel's handling of guests' privacy is very questionable - it turns out that someone puts my room number on the receipt after having dinner at the restaurant, and I have to bear the cost of the meal. The restaurant staff didn't even double check the name of the room occupant with the diner. I'm glad it wasn't a bill that would deplete my bank account. \n\nUntil now I have received no apology from the team nor the operations manager, nor tell me what actually happened\/ how they will improve. In my last communication with them I directly expressed my disappointment as they delivered an impression that I was the troublemaker but then they never replied afterwards.\n\nI really don't want to be hard on people but the service was disappointing and questionable. They really need to rethink about the security\/ privacy of guests.\n\nAlso there was a stench in my hotel room (I guess due to plumbing issues). \n\nNot recommended.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Calling the front desk means being on hold for 15min+.  Check in always seems to take twice as long as it should, primarily because they'll often have one person working the computer and two people behind the desk doing nothing.  The only reason I stay here is because my masters program has contracted with the hotel for student lodging, and because of that I get a slightly discounted rate.  Their regular rates plus fees etc is an absolutely ridiculous $400\/night as they consider themselves a \"luxury\" resort, but somehow forget to turn the rooms down 50% of the time.  \n\nIf you do get a room, make sure to get back at a decent hour, otherwise you'll be forced to wait for the elevators.  Of the 4 elevators, 1 is reserved exclusively for the use of the rooftop patrons.  1 will inevitably be blocked by the line to get to the roof (which you'll have to push and weave through) and then the last 2 are available to service the 16 floors of paying hotel guests.  \n\nDont waste your time going to the roof bar after 8pm.  While the views are great, and the bar is actually quite nice, the bartenders are far too busy flirting with girls to actually serve anyone besides said girls.  If you do happen to get some attention and place a drink order, prepare to watch as the bartenders quickly forget to serve you.  I paid $18 for a gin and tonic and watched for 45 min as my bartender took and fulfilled other orders.  On top of that the hotel has perpetually tried making it an exclusive scene and often requires reservations, or forces patrons to wait in line to be let in.  I've literally never seen the rooftop at more than 50% capacity.  The waiting, the exclusivity is all for show, and only to make it seem more appealing than it actually is.  \n\nThe rooms are quite decent, and depending on which floor youre on have great views.  However, DO NOT EVER STAY on floors 15 or 16.  They seemingly forgot to insulate the floors during construction and you 100% will hear if not feel the bass from the bars music until 1am.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I finally was able to flag down one of the bartenders to place an order . \n\nFood and cocktails were very good I order a simple cocktail with cucumber vodka mint and simple syrup because the person next to me ordered one it looked delicious they charged me $21.00 for a small 6oz glass seems a bit much! You can see the breakdown of the bill attached for two people it was over $300 months plus the $45 dollars for parking which they didn't even move or park the car the kept it right where we left it when we drove up to the valet.

The room was comfortable and clean with firm beds, plenty of pillows and fun decor. The decor throughout the hotel is pretty cool. \n\nIt was a big downer, though, to discover no coffee maker in the room. I specifically checked the website for this, and it was listed as available. Nope. To get coffee, you either have to wait till 8 when you can get one complimentary cup of what amounts to warm dishwater from the restaurant, or you have to head out to Starbucks or wherever. Also, the water bottles in the room were $5 each, which is insult to injury when there already is no coffee maker! The body wash dispenser in the shower was empty so I had to call for that. There was no list of numbers to dial to reach hotel services, though the retro phone was very cute -- I tried dialing Zero for the front desk, but was met with silence. I ended up using my mobile to call downstairs. They told me you need to dial Zero, but that clearly didn't work. \n\nThese seem like small things but they add up. The hotel is really nice, cool, hip, and comfortable. It wouldn't take that much to make it a top-notch experience. Especially when it comes to having coffee\/tea available in the room.

The views were amazing and access via the air tram or F line metro were really easy. \n\nRoom:\n\nAbsolutely fine. Shower was a little feeble, but beds were very comfortable. No tea or coffee and bottles of water in the room were $5!\n\nWas there for 4 nights and no maid service unless you asked which was unusual.\n\nFood:\n\nOnly had breakfast which was \u201cincluded\u201d. This was a selling point for me as it meant we could have breakfast and then head out for the day without worrying about immediately having to find something to eat.\n\nBut breakfast was a complete shambles. Anyone used to European buffet style breakfast will be disappointed. It was supposed to open at 8 but on our first day it was still not open until around 8:30.\n\nThe included breakfast consisted of a bowl of fruit and a pastry with juice or tea\/coffee.  First day we got 4 pastries to share between 3 and a bowl of fruit each. The second day this changed to only being able to have one or the other. And it was one pasty each. It also took 40 mins for our bowl of fruit and pastry to come on the second day. \n\nA lot of people were pretty unimpressed and we didn\u2019t bother for the rest of our trip.\n\nPanorama room bar:\n\nWould like to say this was brilliant but I wouldn\u2019t know. Under 21s weren\u2019t allowed up and the lift didn\u2019t allow you up there with your room key. Although that was not obvious.\n\nOne night (Thursday) we came home and dropped the kids off at the room so I could have a look at the bar. Went back down and asked to be allowed up (which required a hotel staff member to activate the lift). I was asked if I had a reservation and said I didn\u2019t but was a guest at the hotel. I was told I wouldn\u2019t be allowed up without a reservation even though I only wanted to go and see the view.  \n\nSome people complained that the higher floors could hear the music late into the night, but to be fair I was on 13, so 5 floors down, which was quiet.\n\nReception staff:\n\nVery pleasant. I was allowed an extra hour on checkout time which helped and check-in\/check-out was perfectly fine.\n\nOverall:\n\nI am glad we chose to stay on Roosevelt Island. It may not be so central but the hotel is really close to both the air tram (cable car) and the metro so access was very easy. Plus it was worth it for the views.\n\nIf the hotel sorted out the stupid issues it would be really good.

Booking.com did an awful job with my reservation that had be completely panicked but with the help of Omar, Cecilia and the wonderful Alex they assisted with giving me the same rooms at a lower price. When we arrived we were able to get our room (before check-in) and the lovely Yeshara was friendly and offered to help with any thing we may need during our stay. After our outing I returned back to the room to find a handwritten note with a small gift of chocolates & cashews. We continued our night in the Panaroma room which has an amazing view of the city and the Friday night music and scene was great. Overall experience was great. The only feedback would be for the restaurant with the inconsistency in service, coffee served with milk, spoon or refill and no condiments when food was served. I believe they were understaffed. At check-out Allie was also very friendly and professional made the process easy. Thank you for lovely weekend.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Great, quieter alternative to \"mainland\" Manhattan","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-09-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"While Roosevelt Island is a part of Manhattan it's a smaller island off of \"mainland\" Manhattan with Queens on the other side. You're a short tram ride away, which is a block from the hotel. You can also take the bus or subway but the tram is best. Plus, you get a killer view of the city as well as the ride being fun for kids and adults alike. I grew up in Queens and went to school at NYU\/Brooklyn Law School and I never rode the tram in my life. It was awesome.\n\nThe hotel is pretty cool. Very hip, clean, and modern. I'd stay here every time. The rooms are well-kept and well-designed. The beds are comfortable. The views are stellar. There's not much to do around the hotel but I think that's a feature because you get to take a respite from the bustle and craziness of the city. You can just chill and take a walk around the island on the boardwalk and enjoy the views. The rates seem reasonable for NYC and accessible for anyone wanting to stay at a nice hotel while still being pretty close to the action.\n\nThe hotel staff is overall pleasant but being a new hotel I think most of the staff are still getting used to the systems and that caused some hiccups upon checking in. Ultimately, our issues were resolved because the Director of Rooms was there and helped resolve our issues but something tells me that it's not sustainable if it's him having to fix everything that is room-related.\n\nAnother hiccup that occurred had to do with the elevator bouncer who was primarily checking IDs and vaccine cards for those going to the rooftop restaurant. My family had checked in earlier than me as I parked the car and I didn't know that you needed a keycard to access the elevator. I asked him how come the elevator wasn't responding when I pressed the floor my family was staying and he berated me in front of other guests for not knowing the process and was very rude. I had never experienced such hostility in a hotel\/restaurant in my life. Made for a very poor starting experience to our trip and put me in a very bad mood from the start of my family's much-needed vacation. Honestly, if I was his manager and saw that kind of behavior I'd fire him on the spot.\n\nThe last hiccup that occurred had to do with the restaurant kitchen staff not showing up for a breakfast one Sunday morning despite our making a reservation the day before. We were never informed that the restaurant was closed for that reason and were made to feel a bit ashamed for not knowing that the kitchen staff was not there. Like, how am I supposed to know the restaurant is closed because no one showed up to cook food? Do I work there? Did anyone tell me? Wait, I'm still the customer, right? Yeah, right.\n\nAnyway, overall, the hotel is great. The restaurant is good when it's open and the staff shows up. Two of the three hiccups have more to do with the restaurant staff and the remaining hiccup will likely get resolved in due time and it ultimately was resolved.

You wear it once and you never want to wear it again. The hotel is filled with kitschy instagramable ornaments of poor quality. We stayed on the 17th floor in the presidential suite with a sofa bed in our room. The quality of the sofa bed was terrible. A flimsy mattress bought from a cheap discount store providing you with no rest and a severe backache. No coffee machine or complimentary water in the room. No microwave, no dishes and no ice in the fridge or ice tray available. No thought was given to the comfort of the guests. \n\nThe bathroom was clean and the towels were plush. Unfortunately the water pressure in the shower was horrid. \n\nFor a hotel with over 200 rooms they had only 1 ice machine on the fifth floor. This machine never worked and was unable to dispense any ice. We approached the front desk about this several times but nothing was ever done. \n\nThe gym had no water bottles or fresh towels. The gym is built in a cramp space with one small window. \n\nLocated on the 18th floor is Panorama, the hotel\u2019s bar. Unfortunately the sound proofing between the 17th & 18th floor is very poor. We felt we were a part of the bar till about 2:30AM at night as we continued to hear music and thumping in our rooms. Sleeping seemed to be out of the question. Around 7:00 AM we awoke to the sound of furniture or other goods being moved around in bar. \n\nBreakfast was promised to us starting at 8:00 AM. Unfortunately when we approached the lobby restaurant at 8:30 AM the restaurant host told us they did not have staff and breakfast would not be served till 9:30 AM. When we finally sat down for breakfast at 9:30 AM the server had no idea what guests needed to be served. The server kept walking from the restaurant to the lobby to confirm with the front desk. As per the server \"The restaurant is independent and the hotel does not do a good job communicating the guests needs\". \n\nFor a property that tries to be hip\/cool there was no food available past 10:00 PM on a Saturday night. No vending machine and no lobby market. \n\nMy suggestion, step in to take a few photos in the lobby and take in the views of Manhattan from the 18th floor bar. Step straight out afterwards and find yourself a real hotel. The Graduate is nothing more than a flimsy Hollywood set.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The Hotel is ~200 feet from the Tram.  We were pleasantly greeted by the Receptionist who granted our desires for a upper floor room so that we could see the beautiful night view of Manhattan.  The Hotel has a technology theme going with wall-to-wall books and pictures documenting President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s impact on Roosevelt Island.  A walk on the streets was most informative on the history of Roosevelt Island and is definitely worthwhile.   \n\nOur room was on the smaller side but well-decorated with the technology theme.  The bedding was most comfortable, especially after a day of walking around sightseeing.  \n\nThe first-floor restaurant\/bar was a nice delight, after we were informed that the Panorama Bar on the 18th is open only 4 days a week, and the day of our visit, it was closed.  The dinner menu had a nice array of dishes complementing each other, all very reasonably priced.  The Heirloom Tomato Salad, Shells-on-Shells in broth, and Freshly-Made French Fries were flavorsome, as well as the wines.  Our Server, Marilyn\u2014\"you know like in Marilyn Monroe\"\u2014was energetic, conscientious in doing a good job, and accommodating our requests, like ketchup (inside joke).  Her recommendation of Oatmeal cookies for dessert was spot on.  Marilyn wanting to make our dining experience memorable was, and she definitely was!     \n\nThe next day, we rode the Tram back to home and reality\u2014secure in knowing that we could venture out to the Graduate Roosevelt Island Hotel for a quick R&R when we need to.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

He is also a former Ohio person  that gave us the best view of the Macy's fireworks and the most excellent views of downtown Manhattan and the East river. This is one of the nicest Hotels (and plenty of space in the junior suite) in the area as we have stayed in downtown with very small rooms. This Hotel is located on Roosevelt Island with aerial tram access to the subway system. We will be back.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Brand new hotel with an outstanding view of Manhattan. Stylish modern decor. Large rooms by NYC standards. Close walk to subway, ferry and tram. Even parking was very straightforward. The only complaint is that they have bathroom walls decorated with FDR portraits,  so you  kind of feel a lot of pressure while taking care of your private business in there with President closely watching you. :-)","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Roosevelt island is beautiful and it\u2019s very easy to get into the city via the Tram. We also took the ferry to LIC for dinner which was recommended by the hotel which was lovely. The rooftop bar was not open yet but looking forward to returning again for that!","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

You cannot beat this location, such a fun little island to stay on and Manhattan is easily accessible by the RI Tram\u2014 basically a gondola that glides along the top of the Queensboro bridge and brings you into Manhattan in the most magical way as you soar over the top of buildings and gently land down at 60th And 2nd! Very convenient and super fun! I cannot wait to stay here again. Literally cannot say enough good things about my experience, far exceeded my expectations. The staff is so friendly and helpful, just a real gem of a hotel!","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Just fantastic. Amazing location, with stunning NY City views, just a few blocks from subway and tram, easy parking. Room on 17th floor had sweeping NY City views, beautifully appointed, quiet. Friendly and helpful staff (fixed AC noise in minutes), tasty food in lobby restaurant. I live in NY City but this was a little getaway. Top notch for everything. Roosevelt park\/monument just a few blocks away is a must-see visit.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}
