We normally stay in Hilton properties with our family but the one in NYC was under construction this time. The Casablanca has so much more going for it, so this is where we will be staying in the future. \n\nThe first difference is the service culture displayed by the excellent staff. James at check-in, and John on the door and evenings were particularly pleasant. The ladies serving breakfast and housekeeping were top notch as well.\n\nThe second floor lounge was a stand out. We spent a lot of time here for a quick mid-day break or at the end of our days decompressing. They serve a very nice continental breakfast of hard-boiled eggs, pastries, bagels, toast, oatmeal, cereal and yogurt with juice, tea and several types of coffee. They keep the area open all day and have energy bars, chips, water, soda, tea, hot cocoa and coffee. There is a lot of cozy areas to eat and never was completely full.\n\nThe hotel is Moroccan themed but not overly so. The room was a nice size for our family of five as we had two full beds and a pull out sofa. The beds\/sheets were comfortable and everything was very clean. The sofa bed was not quite as comfortable but my teenager had no issues on it. There was a privacy door to separate the two rooms. The shower had good water pressure and we just cracked a window to get rid of the steam.\n\nThe location is really prime as it was only 1 block off of Times Square where you will find a lot of action, theatres and restaurants but also the hub for many subway lines. It is exciting and loud but surprisingly the hotel was very quiet only a few steps away. We treated it like an oasis to recharge with a midday power nap or a relaxing way to review a fun, busy day in NYC. \n\nThe Casablanca is moderately priced but everything in NYC is relatively expensive. Looking back we felt that it was one of the highlights of our trip, gave us the best service (compared to the airlines, restaurants, etc) and was perfect for our needs. Therefore it was a good value and we will be back.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff are so nice and friendly, and the accommodations are very nice. It is a small, older, boutique hotel, so of course, the rooms are on the smaller side, but they are efficient and very clean. The staff never hesitate to answer a question or help you out, and the second floor lounge is a great place to get some work done while your \"roommates\" are still sleeping, and there is a great coffee machine. One suggestion that I would make is to do a little more to ensure safety at the front door when the door-person is not present. It would be good to have key access only in the later evening hours, and key access to the elevator at all times. It is located in an extremely busy area of the city, and it would make it feel just a bit more safe if there were some safeguards to prevent people who shouldn't be in the hotel from entering. With that being said, there was only one time that no one was present when we entered. Despite the location in Times Square (which isn't our favorite area to stay), it is one of our favorite hotels in New York.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I did my research before we booked this hotel, and it exceeded all my highest expectations. We loved the cozy, comfortable atmosphere and the beautiful Moroccan inspired decor. Our Premium Queen room was more spacious than the usual NYC hotel room, and the elegant black and white tile bathroom was beautiful. The part we loved most, though, was Rick's Cafe on the 2nd floor. It's like a comfy living room, with lots of tables, couches and chairs, a fireplace and free snacks, water, coffee, sparkling water, soft drinks, etc. all day.  You can hang out with a group of friends and not worry about the noise bothering other guests. \nAlso, how many boutique hotels in NYC give you a lovely continental breakfast? We never imagined how many options there would be, and were very surprised to find anything we could possibly wish to eat. There were hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, (which they prepare for you), cereals, yogurt, sweet rolls, toast, bagels (which they happily toast for you), fresh fruit, three kinds of coffee, and more!  We will never think of staying anywhere else when we come to the city. We even met some nice people who have been coming there for over 16 years. That truly says something about a hotel. Everything in our room was immaculate, and the staff just couldn't do enough for us. I am going back there in March with some female relatives for a Girls Weekend theater trip, and I know my family members will be just thrilled with staying there!

With friendly staff, rooms larger than many in Manhattan, and an inviting lounge with a vintage vibe that offers a good continental breakfast until 10am, and snacks and (non-alcoholic) drinks all day, there's a lot to recommend this small jewel box hotel!  After a brisk day walking the city, sitting in the lounge by the fire with a cappucino or a sparkling water is a lovely respite.  \n\nRooms are attractive and nicely appointed.  They don't include refrigerators, which would be a nice perk, but I haven't found the absence a problem.  Most rooms don't offer much of a view, but they are scrupulously clean and astonishingly quiet for  Midtown, and those things matter far more to me!\n\nThe location is terrific - it feels like EVERYTHING is close. Times Square is a half-block away, Bryant Park is around the block, and the theatre district is just a few minutes walk.  Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station are a 10-minute walk, and there's a subway station a block away.  \n\nFor dining, the Casablanca adjoins Tony Di Napoli's family-style restaurant, which has great food and a lovely bar for an after-theatre drink.  And just past that is the Mermaid Oyster Bar, offering a lovely seafood menu.  And of course dozens of other options surround the immediate area.  ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We first saw the show, Harmony (created by Barry Manilow and Bruce Sussman), which was amazing and so heavy hitting to the current times we are living in.  Then the next night we saw, A Beautiful Noise (Neil Diamond story) and had another fun night that was uplifting with songs that you grew up with.  Our trip was based around these two shows so this hotel ended up being perfect.  Both theaters were within walking distance and literally three buildings down was Times Square.  We actually couldn't believe how quiet it was in our room at night time and how dark our room was so we were able to sleep peacefully.  Now if you like to sleep in, you might hear some of the people walking out of their rooms in the morning, but that is about it.  This is an older boutique hotel with some classic charm and a fabulous staff.  Their staff is very friendly, informative and just kind, which sometimes can be hard to find in NY.  The front desk staff are also the concierge so they are very informative and any of the doormen are willing to help you in any way they can.  On the second floor they have 24 hour coffee, bottle waters, chips and usually some granola bars of some sort.  This isn't fancy, but you won't find other hotels offering this stuff for free so it was great to grab a snack in the mornings before exploring all the nook and crannies that NYC has to offer.  Oh, also since it is the holidays, Bryant Park is right around the corner with all their holiday shops to do a little Christmas shopping.   Again, this is a great location and the place had character, would definitely stay here again.  ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Our week in New York was fun, but also calamitous: most notably, Tropical Storm Ophelia brought record-breaking amounts of rain to the city all week, and I woke up sick with two days left in our trip. Through all the ups and downs of our stay, the team at the Casablanca ensured that we were, above all else, comfortable. I will forever be grateful for their hospitality.\n\nOne of the reasons we chose to stay at the Casablanca was because of its location, and that paid off for us each day. We couldn't have chosen a better place to set up home base for this trip, chiefly because we planned for our honeymoon to be Broadway-heavy. We saw at least one show everyday, some of which we had tickets to before we got to New York, and some of which we got day-of tickets for at the TKTS booth in Times Square. This hotel is literally just steps away from Times Square. A couple blocks from the TKTS booth, and within easy walking distance of almost any Broadway show you could hope to see.\n\nTransit options are also very nearby with one large train (subway) station just one block over and another a block in the other direction, as well as numerous bus stops in the immediate vicinity.\n\nYou might think the hotel would be loud, being so close to Times Square, one of the noisiest and most chaotic places in the known world, but my experience was that our room was very quiet. We had no view to speak of; the one window served as the entry point for the air conditioning unit, and it let some natural light in from a small inner courtyard. This could certainly be a detriment to some, but not having a view was fine with us. We needed the room to stay cool, quiet, and comfy for us to be able to rest between excursions, and it was absolutely perfect for that.\n\nThere is a small breakfast spread in the lounge each morning, and I loved popping down to grab a banana, a hard-boiled egg, and a bagel -- the staff are happy to take it into the kitchen, toast it, and deliver it to you -- with some peanut butter. The same lounge remains open throughout the day with a small selection of snacks and drinks for guests to take as needed. We deeply appreciated being able to grab a cold Diet Coke out of the mini fridge after walking around town.\n\nEvery time we returned to the hotel from a trip out, the staff welcomed us back. When we left, they reminded us to take an umbrella; they had several umbrellas ready and waiting for guests to use throughout the rainy week.\n\nPerhaps my only complaint about our business with the Casablanca Hotel is that I booked directly through their website, months prior to our planned arrival, on a \"pay 50% now, pay 50% later\" kind of rate, but I was not charged at that time. The initial payment was not charged until about 6 weeks prior to the visit, and the second half was supposed to be charged 30 days out. With both payments so close together, and with no notice that the first half of the payment had not and would not be pulled until a much later time, I was caught off guard by the timing of the payments. The manager I spoke with said they changed their approach to charging guests because the pandemic had made cancellations so much more common, which I completely understand. I think this was simply a communication problem and could have been resolved by updating the language on their website about the likely timing of the charges.\n\nI am truly so grateful that the place we chose for our stay was as comfortable and kind as the Casablanca Hotel. I hope we can return one day in the future, but in the meantime, I look forward to recommending it to all my friends and family.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Entering the lobby, a sense of peace, tranquility and happiness just settles over me. The staff is friendly and accommodating, but not in an overbearing way. I think I have stayed in just about every room they have, and they are all comfortable.  Some are quite small, but it's New York - who's going to spend it sitting in a hotel room?! Plus, Rick's on the 2nd floor lets you spread out, kick back, and there's plenty of room. The location is simply splendid - I can walk to the Eastside, Westside, uptown, downtown...wherever! And if I don't want to walk, the Subway's nearby. The hotel is close to Broadway, Restaurant Row and all sorts of places that tourists and locals love. Even with all the hustle and bustle of Times Square, the Casablanca is quiet. As with everything else, particularly in NYC, things have changed a bit. No more piano music on Friday nights or happy hours, at least during my recent visit, but that's ok. Breakfast is good, snacks and beverages are available 24x7, Rick's is a great place to rest up and reflect on the day, or plan for the next day. I have stayed in plenty of other hotels in NYC, boutique and chain, but I keep coming back to the Casablanca. I almost didn't want to leave a review because it's a small place and when my secret's out I'd hate to NOT be able to get a room when I need one :-).  \n\nThe only \"bad\" I'd have to say is that cabs can be in short supply on its block on W43, especially in bad weather \/ rush hour \/ etc (it's New York!).

This hotel was fantastic. It's QUIET (these smaller rooms don't offer a view, which they state on their site, but unless a cop car was on alert, I didn't hear any outside noise in my entire stay), quaint, classy, convenient, and economical: You don't spend too long in spots you don't want to be, nor does it take longer than you'd like to get where you need to go. There's a simple but spacious cafe that takes up all but one computer room on the second floor to get all-day snacks and beverages, and it's only a few steps to get to the lobby, so it's great to either walk up quickly to get something or stop there for a coffee and finish going downstairs.\n\nI got a petite queen room, and for a bigger, taller guy like myself, I was more than impressed with how much room I had for the price regarding the bathroom, closet, doorway, and central space (though the space to sit on the toilet is extremely tight, so fair warning there.) While I didn't spend much daytime in the room, if I had experienced a day where I would have been too exhausted to do anything and just wanted to stay in, the room was nice enough to validate doing so. I can imagine a couple making a room like this also work for a short stay.\n\nThe concierges were all very cordial and helpful.

There is a linking door to Tony\u2019s Italian restaurant next door - I am not sure what the relationship is but we found this eatery very noisy and crowded and the food nothing special. But the hotel itself is a real gem and the staff first class. Brilliant!","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Neither of us had ever been to New York, and I found the Casablanca Hotel on Google Maps (searched for hotels close to Times Square with good ratings).  I wanted to stay at a more unique hotel vs a Marriot or major chain hotel.  \nOur room was ready for us when we arrived.   All of the staff were extremely helpful and polite.  Our room was immaculate.  We didn't have a huge room, but it didn't feel cramped.  We had a large closet, a dresser, bistro table and chairs, king size bed, and full bathroom.  The beds were nice and soft also.  \nThe cleaning staff straightened up the room daily, and made sure we had clean towels as well.  The hotel has a continental breakfast, which wasn't huge, but everything we had there was delicious.  There's a quaint outdoor sitting area we sat in each morning (a lot more seating was available inside).  As for the location of the hotel - it's perfect!  It's about 20 yards from Times Square.  It's central to most everything.  There's even a very good restaurant attached to the hotel, Tony's Di Napoli.  We had dinner there our first night in town - it was delicious!  Make sure to go there hungry, they have family style portions - so they're huge!   We absolutely loved our first trip to NYC, and we would absolutely plan to stay at the Casablanca Hotel if\/when we go back.  ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Every member of staff is always impeccably presented with an incredibly high attention to detail. A special mention to Luis on the door who helped me with me offensively heavy luggage & Cristian on the desk for greeting me with a smile every time I walked in but the biggest mention to Dimitri who is hands down the greatest asset to the hotel. Talk about cool, calm & collected, The way he he single handedly keeps the hotel running and personalizes himself with the guests is not something that can be taught. The Casablanca is very lucky to have someone of his caliber on their staff. \n\nDon\u2019t keep looking\u2026 Just book the hotel!","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

First off, the staff is unfailingly pleasant and polite and nothing is a problem.  Their suggestions were on point, their directions were accurate and saved us a lot of time, and it is such a joy to walk in and feel welcomed no matter the time of day.\n\nOne of the greatest advantages is the hotel is located 20 yards from underground parking, and the hotel subsidizes; which is fantastic.  When we turned down 43rd, during rush hour, we were sure we would have to go blocks to get a good location.  What a dream to turn in the parking lot, open the trunk, and 1 minute later be in the lobby.  This was particularly nice as our arrival date was the day the Canadian smoke was blanketing the city.\n\nThe rooms were comfortable, the water pressure strong, and the fridge cold.  One of the great features of the Casablanca is a second-floor lounge\/sitting room with a Continental breakfast but it is particularly nice, late at night, for free snacks and coffee.  \n\nThe hotel's location cannot be beaten as we were within hundreds of yards of all the theaters and walking distance from some of the best restaurants in Manhattan. Next door to the Casablanca is the Brooklyn Diner which is an old-school institution serving fabulous breakfasts and fare...we ate there every day.  \n\nIf you are a theater buff and do not want to spend $1000\/night on a hotel room, The Casablanca is a great option.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The lounge is also stocked with fruits, cliff bars and water. There are plenty of places to sit and tables and chairs as well. I cannot say enough about the Casablanca.

My wife and I stayed at Hotel Elysee many years ago, so we were familiar with the collection. More than a decade later, they still live up to the high ratings that each hotel maintains. \n\nMy kids loved the lounge (especially my daughter who loves cats and enjoyed the numerous cat statues throughout) including the games and piano. Breakfast was nice - it's continental but great for a light start to the day - and being able to grab a snack or drink throughout the day was great. \n\nThe staff were all extremely welcoming and helpful. At breakfast, the helped us navigate what options were safe for our son (dairy allergy) and offered to toast our bagels daily. Everyone at the front desk was very friendly. It rained several days we were there and, while we were prepared with our own umbrellas, front desk staff always offered one of theirs.\n\nWe stayed in the suite so we'd have a little more space and I was very glad we did. Having the extra room made it feel much more comfortable than a standard room in Manhattan. Location is also outstanding if you plan to spend a lot of time in and around Times Square.\n\nWe only had two very minor complaints:  1. The shower curtain was very short and difficult to keep in the tub so the floor got a bit wet during showers. 2. Being an older building, the heat is provided by radiator which made the room extremely warm at times. We simply opened the windows and had the fan\/AC run a bit to cool it down.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this place enough.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Unfortunately, the evening wine and cheese party is still a casualty of the lack of help they experienced during the pandemic. Everything else seemed to be just the way we remembered it. With everything they set out for breakfast (available up to 10 am), it makes a mid-day meal unnecessary. The only other thing that seemed changed was that all the other guests we ran into were American whereas we had always enjoyed speaking with the many foreign visitors that previously had populated the hotel.

Our only concern when first reserving was noise, but the hotel is unaccountably quiet. We stayed both times in a deluxe queen room, which has a comfortable bed but characteristically for New York is not large.

Everything was as I remembered pre-pandemic with the light continental breakfast available each morning, snacks offered all day, comfortable rooms and cleanliness throughout.  Its central location right off Times Square is within walking distance to  restaurants, theatres, shopping, Bryant Park with its ice rink and Christmas Market, Rockefeller Centre and Central Park as well as many other walkable sights.  The welcoming staff when you return to the hotel made the day complete.\n\nOur unplanned Christmas day in New York City was exhilarating with it being spent amongst 1,000's of visitors like ourselves enjoying the joy and wonderment of this exciting, beautiful city at this special time of the year.  Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Casablanca who contributed to making this a Christmas to remember.  Happy New Years to you all!!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They sent me letters and an email regarding extending our reservations until December 2021.  Well another variant popped up and I\u2019m on immunosuppressants. So my husband and daughter stayed just two night and then came back to our home in PA. We usually take Amtrak up. Now we have 2 more nights and the reservation manager and general manager let us take those two nights through March of 2023. Which was just used. The reason I am going in depth about customer service and payments that were paid in advance is because I have read a lot of reviews complaining about this very thing. The only thing that I can say negative, which is on me because I picked the dates that it wasn\u2019t available , is not getting the suite. Everyone from reservations to concierge was pleasant and had no problems about having to keep changing our dates.  The rooms are a little small but that\u2019s NYC for you. I expect that.

Bed and pillows were very comfortable; had a little trouble with the a\/c at first and got it resolved immediately.  I requested a tea maker and coffee maker for my room but never used it because it was so convenient to go to Rick's Cafe and have coffee\/tea\/water 24-7.  For my gluten free friends, during the day there were protein bars (not gluten free) but they had fruit and chips.  For breakfast they had hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt.  Also lots of (not gluten free) pastries - but they did have some gluten free bagels that they warmed in the microwave for me and I appreciated that.  One elevator was out of service, but it wasn't a problem - allowed us to talk to other guests a bit more!  I will definitely stay here again on my next visit.

It is all about location. After arriving at Penn Station, it is a short walk to the hotel.

The snack room and \"lite\" breakfast were excellent. All good quality food and lots of options. Coffee was delicious. The woman running this area was delightful and very kind.  The pillow are great. The shower was strong and hot. Lovely bathroom soaps, lotions, slippers and thick fabulous towels. Good size bathroom.  \n\nThe cons: The hotel has become a bit tired but they are woking to improve that. There is one scary elevator - it works and I didn't come to any hard or get stuck. The linens do need to be upgraded. During my first stay they were crisp and just lovely - they are now worn and tired. The only odd occurrence was we had been granted a 1230pm check out and at 12noon we gat a call sternly asking us to vacate the room. \n\nI would recommend a stay here, there are far more pros then cons and post Covid everyone is getting their sea legs back.

I should say that the staff were not the problem they offer lovely service with a couple of condescending reception exceptions. Basically this hotel needs a complete overhaul or should be shut. There are 2 elevators one which is out of order and the other was out of order on numerous occasions during our four day stay.\nThis led to people climbing old dark stairways exasperated. When THE elevator did work it was scary and definitely not for the faint hearted!  We had amazing weather for November and this meant that the air con was imperative however the mini suite had antiquated window units which were terribly noisy and brought food smells to the room.

We loved the location which was central to everything in Manhattan, and the staff were polite.  However, we were less than happy regarding the disarray of the room which several repairs should have been done for the price we paid.  We felt as if we were staying in a Super 8 Motel.  For one, the shower head must be broken because it fell every time we tried to adjust it.  We would tighten it as tight as it would go but within a minute it would fall again which was frustrating.  There are several repairs that should be done including replacing the bathroom door due to the bottom of the door being damaged.  The wall in the bathroom was damaged, discolored and cracked.  The gold light fixtures in the bathroom had rust spots all over them. The wallpaper was coming off the wall and damaged in several areas in the bedroom area.  The caulking repair done in the bathroom was not done properly and looked bad.  The comforter and sheets on the bed had holes in them.  The room was very bright at night when we turned out all the lights, so it made it difficult to sleep.  There was too much light coming in from the bedroom and bathroom windows even with the blind down in the bedroom.  There should have been a curtain to block the light in the bedroom.  Additionally, we were surprised to see that there was an air conditioning unit in our room since it is not shown in any of the pics of your rooms online.  Plus, the vent below the AC unit was damaged.  I have attached pictures of these issues.  Also, we felt also that this room could have been updated for the price we paid.  The d\u00e9cor in our room appeared to be from the 1990s over 30 years old. Lastly, the information we received after booking the room stated that the $25 per night resort fee included sodas.  However, there were no sodas ever offered, and I was told that you don\u2019t offer sodas any longer.  This was disappointing as I do not drink coffee in the morning.  My husband received a discount for booking multiple nights, so I we were given a subpar room because we received a discount. We did not complain because we were trying to enjoy ourselves and we did not have time to move to another hotel because all of the king rooms at the Casablanca were booked up for the entire 6 days.  We would not stay here again unless the rooms were in better condition because management or staff should have done a better job of repairing the things I mentioned before someone stayed.

Therefore I was curious to see what changes, if any, had been made hoping that the hotel still had the same amenities as pre-COVID. Sadly, it does not. I guess the good news is that at least the hotel is open and you cannot say that for every business. But while The Casablanca remains a charming, small, hotel with an ideal location and friendly employees, sadly it lacks many of the things that formerly made it one of the best. For example, Rick's Cafe on the second floor offers an ideal respite from the hustle bustle of the city and a great place to crash after a busy day. Its daily Continental Breakfast offering, however, has been scaled back to what is now described as \"light\" and its nightly wine and cheese reception with weekly piano entertainment  (a great time and place to socialize and make new friends) has been eliminated altogether. I am not sure how much of this is due to staffing, supply, sanitary, and budgetary issues, but the hotel is now charging a daily Resort Fee that one would assume would cover such \"extras\". Alas, it does not. While the hotel does not have an on-site workout space, it previously had a trade with a local, nearby health club where a guest could go at no extra charge. During my recent stay that amenity was not being offered. When I checked in, the person at the Front Desk knew nothing of the prior arrangement. It was only later in the day, when I spoke with someone else, that I learned the health club had closed and that, as a result, the hotel no longer offered this guest service  as a part of a stay. The hotel has nicely appointed rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms with daily housekeeping offered,  Something that, sadly, you no longer find at many other hotels.  Be sure to request an interior room as they are generally quieter.  All in all, I enjoyed my stay at The Casablanca, but the hotel ain't what it used to be. Then again, what is???","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

A happy staff like that doesn't happen unless folks at the top are doing the right things.\nRoom:  charming, warm, and larger than expected for NYC (I had a king\/accessible).\nRick's Cafe:  like my room, warm and inviting.  I was surprised at how it kicked each day off to a happy start.\n\nI think the short explanation is, you can make some magic happen in a 45-room hotel that you can't in a 245-room hotel.  Confession:  I'm \"frugal\" (that sounds so much better than cheap!) and the kind of traveler that would have stayed at the Westin to save $50 had this not been a special trip.  The stay at the Casablanca has changed how I'll hotel shop in the future.  This was part of our experience and not just a comfy bed and a clean room.  I'm looking forward to a return visit!","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The outdoor patio is nice for those using it, but it's disruptive of sleep for everyone whose room windows open onto it (I'd close it for that reason).

For many people this may not be an issue, but being from MN, we liked the room a little cooler at night.  Will definitely  come back!","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

This time there were too many changes due to covid that left us feeling heart broken we had returned to this hotel that has always provided us with such magical memories. We have their decoration on our Christmas tree, their mugs in our cupboard and we stayed here after being engaged at the Rockefeller Tree. I know others have similar feelings towards Casablanca\/Library Hotels and they need to make returning guests better aware what the current offering is. \n\nThe fab location and cosy, quiet rooms remain. The rates and fees stay the same price as pre-Covid but the daily breakfast offering, the nightly cheese and wine reception and the customer service is gone. \nThe Ricks Cafe experience that you were happily paying a premium for in the past has changed beyond comprehension. No one sits in this once social space that was the heart and soul of the hotel. With NYC being packed with tourists the week before Christmas this area sat quiet with no atmosphere, probably due to the fact the current drinks and packaged foods on offer are unappealing and the empty soda cans and plates that were used sit around for hours without being tidied away. The current offering goes no way to replacing what was provided previously for the same money being charged. I appreciate Covid could change the offering but no way should it have been allowed to decimate the experience like it has. If they want to charge the same price but with covid precautions could they not provide individual different breakfast items, small wine bottles or wine for taking to your room, cheese plates that have been made up or bought in or some sort of deal with the Brooklyn Diner or Tony\u2019s?\nAfter checking in we expressed these concerns to the manager John who seemed happy to accept the way things were now with the lesser experience and it simple seemed his returning customers should lessen their expectations that this Hotel once exceeded. It was explained we had received a quote from them direct 3 months earlier advising of a \u2018Daily Deluxe Continental Breakfast Buffet\u2019 and a Wine and Cheese Reception every night 5-8pm. This was still being advertised on their website. It seemed this was just unfortunate for the customer and they were in the process of trying to remove all mention that this ever existed. The current available packaged chips, dried fruits and access to a coffee machine that permanently said it needed maintenance was hardly the deluxe food offerings advertised. The minimum ever provided by a hotel should be tea and coffee but even this couldn\u2019t be done right as there was never any Creamer\/Milk for the drinks laid out. Staff at reception seem to think this wasn\u2019t needed and we did think that as we are from abroad that this was perhaps our issue but another guest who was American advised us when gathered round the paltry snack offerings that he wasn\u2019t happy as he was having to drink his coffee black and you really need Creamer provided, I also note the review below saying similar so I am glad it was not just us. The manager explained they couldn\u2019t have Creamer sitting out all day (although they did in the past) so seemingly didn\u2019t bother, but said they would now put out separate individual cartons of 50\/50 to be used, I never saw this happen in the 3 nights following we stayed. In the past something like this would have been dealt with so quickly but now with the reception\/concierge having to do hospitality tasks they just don\u2019t seem to happen. \nAfter making a lot of these points none that were particularly attempted to be understood or addressed the \u2018Resort\u2019 fees were removed from our bill on our request. This no way though made up for the change of experience and lack of service from the Casablanca. I would go as far to say the reception was particularly cold and unwelcoming after raising these points with them, the checkout was a sad quick scan of the computer and not much else said, it felt like the staff were aware we had complained to the manager and it all felt very unprofessional. Staffing numbers generally were low, in the past we are use to staff knowing your name, opening the front door for you and welcoming you back. This time you could come and go without seeing anyone and in effect you were paying for a small cosy room in a great location. Fine for the right money but for $350 + taxes and fees per night I could be staying in a similar location in a more modern room twice the size at Marriott Marquis if all I wanted was a room and a Times Square location. Library hotels need to get what they are offering sorted out or they will watch their hotel\u2019s high rankings continue to decline. Without the service and the previous hospitality offerings the Library Hotels are know for it makes you look at the rooms alone in more detail and at the Casablanca these can be small and start to look quite dated and would not fulfil the price or a returning customers expectations. I sadly cannot see us returning and we will need to begin researching a new hotel for our Christmas NYC visits. \nAnd as for the Casablanca Hotel\u2026 We will always have Paris\u2026","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is only the start for reasons to choose The Casablanca.  It is less than a minute walk from Times Square, and less than 10 minutes from Bryant Park and the library.\n\nBut it is the people who work there that make it the only hotel we will ever consider to stay in when we go to NYC, and it was serendipitous we choose it the first time.  We've never stayed in any hotel where the entire staff is so kind, pleasant, attentive and friendly.  It is not a large impersonal hotel like so many in the area.  The reception and lobby staff greet guests by name, like one would expect only at a small B&B.  Housekeeping is thorough and consistent; no surprises at all.  And as we found with this second visit after a few years away, there is very little turnover in the staff.  That itself is a very good indicator of a nice place to stay.  If the staff is pleased with their working conditions then they will pass that on to their guests, and we can see it and feel it.  It is very obvious they like their jobs.  And that reflects very well on management and supervision.\n\nWe very much enjoy going from the noise and lights of Times Square into what we feel is our home away from home.  It is quiet and relaxing inside.  Rick's Cafe is a perfect place to sit and plan a day or discuss a day gone by.  And since it is a smaller hotel one usually sees other guests a number of times in Rick's, and we've had some good discussions and laughs with many of them.  The friendly, pleasant atmosphere permeates the hotel.  And there are very nice snacks and a variety of drinks available all day.  A very nice, efficient young lady, Houda, was obviously very anxious to take special care of guests in Rick's.  And as we saw in other staff members, she is proud of her work and that can only benefit the guests.\n\nWe feel the highest compliment we can pay the management and staff is the fact that we will be back, even making up a reason to go to NYC, just to go back for another stay.  There are plenty of hotels to choose from and we will waste no time even considering the others.  It is enjoyable to stay, not just a place to stay.\n\nThank you, to Mr. Taboada and the entire staff at The Casablanca.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

They say that the cutbacks are due to Covid-19, but they could easily enough have provided some yogurt in individual containers, individually wrapped pastries , etc. Disappointing, to say the least. To make matters worse, the elevators were out of commission for almost our entire stay. We are both in our 70s and climbing up and down to the third floor three or four times a day was not our idea of a good time.

Excellent staff, clean, nicely appointed room\/bathroom, comfortable bed, and Rick's Cafe, which had snacks and refreshments available at all times.  We stayed in a Premium King and while not a huge room (but large by NYC standards), it was very comfortable for the two of us.  We were on the fifth floor just down the hall and around the corner from the elevator and it was very quiet.  There was ample closet space, a bistro table and chairs, large, comfortable bed, and the bathroom was bigger than I expected with a full tub\/shower combo with pretty tiling.  There was even a lighted makeup mirror in the room, which I greatly appreciated, since most hotel bathrooms have terrible lighting for applying makeup.  The channel selection on the tv wasn't extensive, but we weren't in the city to watch tv, so that didn't matter much to us.  Rick's Cafe was a treat--a very nice, comfortable space to hang out at any time of day,  The staff, particularly Jeffrey, were all very friendly, kind and helpful.  One minor inconvenience was that the room didn't have an adjustable thermostat.  The room was overly warm when we arrived, and although a staff member adjusted the valve on the radiator, it didn't help much and we had to leave the bathroom window open to cool the room down.  Otherwise, the accommodation was perfect in just about every way.  I would definitely return.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

It is kind of old-fashioned, in a nice way. The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. Every person who works there is so nice and helpful and pleasant.\n\nThe room was nice. A little small, maybe. But the furnishings were lovely, especially the spacious tiled bathroom. The room was also surprisingly quiet, especially given the location of the hotel. \n\nThe breakfast was great. The food was really good and there were a lot of choices. Away the room is set up, you end up talking to other guests (if you want to) and that is really fun. In the dining room, the staff was extremely helpful. For example, they went out back to find me a plain yogurt and then to heat up my oatmeal and bring it to me even though I think technically I was supposed to do it myself. They were just really nice.\n\nI had a little issue with the New York Sports Club \u2014access to it is one of the amenities that you get for your $25 resort fee \u2014and I thought I should let other guests know about it. And overly aggressive member, who was sharing the lane with me, kicked my foot so hard that he literally broke my toe. I had to go the clinic and an X -ray confirmed this. Although I told the manager, Michele, in a phone conversation and a letter and sent her pictures, she never returned my phone calls nor indicated that she had addressed the situation. So I\u2019m writing this in order to warn other people to be careful if they go to the health club. I do not think it is well-managed. And how it is managed stands in such stark contrast to the graciousness of the hotel that it is shocking. \n\nI do recommend that people stay at this lovely hotel. They could not of been nicer to me, getting me ice and so on and making sure that I was OK when I told them i was injured.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Unlike large chain hotels, this hotel chain is friendly and personable with the staff wanting to share places to see, visit and some tricks of the city. The hotel room we had was spacious and contained all that you would need on a 3\/4 day city break.The 5pm-7pm cheese and wine evening time was very welcome, after a day of walking the city, allowing you to relax and chill. The breakfast did not have a cooked option, but there was enough choice for many diets. The location was very good, just off Time Square. After reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor, we plugged for this hotel. But I would re-emphasise that you are staying in a city, with all the noises that a major city creates, police sirens, fire engines and honking of horns, even at 3am in the morning! The double glazed windows can only shut out so much noise! This is not a criticism, just something to be aware of when booking the hotel. The trade off is being able to walk pretty much everywhere in Mid-Town New York City! Being a special birthday for one of the party, the hotel provided a complimentary bottle of wine in the room, which was a lovely treat. I would thoroughly reccomend this hotel and go back again.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Bed was comfortable & Room was clean - but, it was located right on the street side of the hotel (43rd St.) - first 2 nights had quite a bit of noise (trucks & traffic from the street) but, we shrugged our shoulders and chalked this up to staying in the \"City that Never Sleeps\" -  the 3rd night, however, they were doing some type of street (or sidewalk) construction and there was a jack-hammer pounding & pounding & pounding until right around 2:00AM - theyre must not be any insulation in the walls because it sounded like the guy with the jack-hammer was standing right next to the bed. Getting ANY sleep at all was, quite honestly, an impossibility.  I spoke to a Manager in the morning after getting approx 4 to 4-1\/2 hrs of rest and expressed my disappointment. He told me that he \"had no control\" over what the city had going-on outside in the way of construction, etc.  I told him that I certainly DID understand this. However, when I booked this stay and pre-paid at the rate of a 5-star Hotel, I expected that (at a minimum) I would be able to get a decent night's sleep.  I suggested that they should either \"Comp\" the 3rd night or at least discount it by  50% because it is ridiculous to have a jack-hammer going until 2AM right outside the bedroom window.  He told me that he checked with the GM and they (in so many words) were \"sorry\" but simply \"unwilling\" to do anything to alleviate the problem.  This is NOT a large Hotel - the location is quite good - BUT at least 1\/3 (maybe even 1\/2) of the rooms are right on the 43rd Street side of the building and they do NOT appear to have taken any steps to try to Quiet the Noise - if you want to a Hotel where you can get a decent night's sleep.

The staff are friendly and attentive without being intrusive, they are extremely helpful nothing is too much trouble. The afternoon cheese and wine is definitely not to be missed, an excellent selection of good quality cheeses etc. and wines available at your leisure for 3 hours, we stayed in one evening, we were exhausted , and just enjoyed the relaxing lounge with cheese and wine. Our room was compact but very comfortable, and clean , plenty of room for clothes etc. with a good size bathroom and a great shower. Tony\u2019s restaurant is adjacent to the hotel, accessible by a door from reception, a great authentic New York restaurant and bar, the food and atmosphere was just incredible, you really need to try it at least once, you do need to book well in advance. The Casablanca is not the cheapest hotel in New York, but it\u2019s location makes up for this, we didn\u2019t have to have a cab to see all the sights, we only had one to go to the world observatory.

But it was a truly terrible experience and since then we've tried hard to solve the mystery of why there are so many great reviews of the place. The hotel is old, the lift rickety, the rooms tired, and the window attached air conditioning phenomenally loud. None of this is uncommon, I know, with the old generation of NY hotels - though not the new generation of NY hotels, many of which are near to this one. But what makes this experience unforgettable - in a bad way - is that they are still renting out rooms on the front of the hotel very close to construction work that carries on through the night. A good night's sleep just wasn't possible - at least for us. And the trouble with the rooms at the back is that they overlook a dark, dank and narrow inner courtyard. The only explanation we could come up with for the positive reviews is that the average age of the clientele while we were there must have been over 50, maybe over 60, and many in this age range clearly appreciate the friendliness of the staff and the convivial atmosphere of 'Rick's Bar' with the wine and cheese evenings. Unlike many NY hotels you don't feel anonymous here, and for many in this age group I guess that's important. But on it's own physical terms it's impossible to recommend this hotel. At least until it's refurbished and the construction stops. When we raised the problems with the hotel they did their best to deal with them and to try and make us happier, but ultimately they can't fix the fundamental issues - the construction noise and the tired nature of the hotel.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The location is great right by Times Square but this is also a bit of a drawback as the road outside is nearly always clogged with traffic making getting to and from a bit difficult.  It is also a narrow road so the front facing rooms are a bit gloomy due to being dwarfed by the surrounding buildings. The room itself, we had a mini suite, was spacious and comfortable.  I noted previous review concerns about the construction work but that only affected us for the first night.  There is also a white noise machine which worked well to drown out the traffic noise.  The included continentaly breakfast was good by US standards and the three hour wine and cheese + in the evening also good.  The problem for both was that there was just not quite enough table room so it always felt a little crowded.  The staff were excellent and went out of their way to anticipate and satisfy our needs.  There is also coffee and snacks available all day.

Sure, it smelled a little bit like hot dogs, probably due to our a\/c units picking up smells from the air shafts in back of the hotel, but that was an enormously tiny price to pay for the gorgeous accommodation, friendly staff, and can't-beat-it-with-a-stick location.\n\nThe intent of our trip was to see The Cursed Child, which was across the Square a, maybe, two minute walk.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

It was fantastic and included a free bottle of wine.  BUT it is at the front of the hotel just across the street from a large office building.  That building is having major refurbishment work being carried out ALL NIGHT.  I guess it is done ALL NIGHT so as not to disturb the office workers.  I cannot begin to describe how loud it was.  In a city hotel, you expect noise from traffic and sirens etc. but this was totally unacceptable.\n\nDue to the air conditioning unit being inserted into the window it sounded like the window had been left open. \n\nWe were there for 3 nights and did manage some sleep the first night due to the long international journey but neither of us had any sleep on night 2.  After complaining, we were moved to a room at the back of the hotel and it was perfectly quiet.\n\nAfter we had moved rooms, the manager called to apologise but they should have been honest about this when we arrived. They cannot help the noise across the street but this is a fairly expensive hotel and offering a free upgrade, knowing what we faced, was very disappointing.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

When we were planning our second trip, we knew there was no place better to stay, so we decided to book here again. This time we were meeting friends in the City, so we suggested they stay here too. The hotel is in a perfect location for getting to all the places you want to go when visiting Manhattan. There are multiple subway stations all within a block of the hotel which makes using public transportation a breeze. Times Square is a spectacle like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen, but the minute you walk in the hotel you\u2019d never know that chaos is a block away. Loved that the Police Station is right at the end of the block\u2014for safety as well as a landmark when navigating back to the hotel from Times Square. Rick\u2019s cafe on the second floor is a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere to recharge your battery after being out all day, or to kick off a day in the city.  My only negative comment would be about the construction going on across the street. The construction goes on all night long and is VERY loud\u2014jackhammer, trucks backing up, concrete being thrown into the back of a metal truck, etc.....The first night we were there our room had a window overlooking 43rd Ave, which is where the construction is. The hotel has no control over the construction, but we got no sleep the first night because of the all-night noise.  I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it. We went down first thing the next morning and asked to change rooms, which they graciously and apologetically did. The rest of our stay was perfect. While the hotel can\u2019t control the construction, they do know it is going on, and I feel those rooms overlooking 43rd should be discounted. We paid over $400 to be kept up all night our first night in town. There is no comparison of those rooms to an interior room.  We love the Casablanca and will stay here again when we come to NY for another visit!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

All this facts are really important but in order to have all the awards by trip advisor they have a long way to improve. Here are some points that I would like to share and you will decide.\n- The furniture and ornaments are dated, it feels like a Grandma\u2019s Bed and Breakfast\n- The building is really old and located in a really noisy street\n- They offer breakfast, but nothing more than coffee, and cheap pastries and bread, forget about protein boiled eggs is the only thing available, this breakfast is like what you can get in La Quinta Inn \n- There is not enough sitting at the breakfast area\n- They have a social Afternoon , a really nice idea but they serve $4 bottles of wine, cheap sparkling wine, cheese and fruit trays from the Supermarket \n- There is not a lot of good places to eat nearby \n- The customers are mostly older couples 55 and above \n- The A\/C is a wall unit , not central\nWould I return or recommend this Hotel, probably not, which is sad because they have a great friendly staff , and finding good human resource in this business is key for success.\nTo the administration I will ask them to make some simple improvements:\n- Offer better sitting at the breakfast area\n- invest in offering a better quality breakfast \n- Offer better quality wines , you can find decent wines for 10 - 15 dollars at Costco and a Prosecco for 10 - 15 also\n- KEEP YOUR GREAT AND FRIENDLY STAFF\nThese changes , without large investments will increase your clients satisfaction and the chance to bring a new type of guest .\n\n","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This is our second visit having been highly impressed during our stay last year. This year my husband upgraded to a suite - luxurious, spacious and peaceful - no noise from outside or within ( with the exception of the air conditioning). A lovely bottle of wine was left in the room on our arrival as my husband was celebrating his birthday - a nice touch. Special thanks to staff at reservations for responding so positively to specific requests. The staff at the Casablanca are absolutely amazing - so welcoming, courteous and helpful at every point of every day. Our stay was greatly enhanced by 1) 24\/7 availability of coffee\/ tea and snacks 2) 5-8pm cheese & wine and nibbles 3) the most wonderfully relaxed atmosphere at breakfast which offered a more than ample selection to choose from. The staff at breakfast and the evening cheese and wine must be commended for their attentiveness and thoughtfulness. A seven day stay in NYC is wonderful but exhausting. The Casablanca Hotel supports your efforts to maximise your involvement by offering an opportunity to rest, relax and recover - fresh to meet the challenges and enjoyment of the next new day.

On this front, the Casablanca delivers in spades.\n\nThe staff are really great and make this hotel a hidden oasis: they are so helpful and are genuinely happy to chat with you about what you've done during the day. I got wet through, when I went to Ellis Island, and it felt like I 'popped home' to get changed before having a late lunch. \n\n As many reviewers have said, the breakfast, the cheese and wine and the lounge are all great features and I really appeal\/ give a lovely sense of inclusion. I think that NY can be a tough city, if you stay in the wrong place, and I really enjoyed it here.\n\nWhilst I have given 5 stars (because it's great and I loved it), I would echo some of the previous comments about some of  the d\u00e9cor being a little tired (and bathroom, when I first arrived, did smell a bit of drains - it passed). This is all forgivable as it's an old building, with a certain style, and when you stay here you are not looking for a shiny chrome experience, you are looking (and will find) a very special boutique hotel. \n\nOverall it's quiet as a hotel and the beds etc are very comfortable. My air conditioning was also a bit too noisy (and that would be my one request next time), however, balance this with the homely welcoming feel and the excellent location. Would I stay here again?

We expected a certain level of noise being near Times Square  and we travel with ear plugs so we were fine. If you aren\u2019t expecting Times Square noise at night it may be worth asking for a room in a quieter spot in the hotel.\n\nThe toiletries provided are beautiful and everything is so tastefully presented. \n\nAll the staff were lovely from toasting bagels for us at breakfast to on our last day organising a car to take us to the airport for a set price including tolls and tips and we could pay by card. We believe it was excellent value as it took 90 minutes to JFK and we suspect a yellow cab would have been more expensive.\n\nThe lounge is really comfortable. Wine is provided every afternoon from 5pm but if there was a bar available even one you pay for, it would take the place up a notch even more.

We\u2019ve been to the Library Hotel \u2014 part of the Library Collection \u2014 which we very much liked, so decided to try another of the collection, the Casablanca, in part because it received even better reviews.  For the life of me, I don\u2019t understand how this could be so.\n\nLet me start with the positives:  1.  The staff was very nice and responded quickly to my requests for another towel and, in general very responsive to my needs.  2.  The bed was comfortable.  3. The bathroom seemed to have been recently renovated and, although small, was very adequate.\n\nThe negatives, however, left a far greater impression.  The \u201ctheme\u201d as the name of the hotel suggests was only vaguely apparent \u2014 some tiles in the bathroom, in the elevator and in the lobby along with some poor art work of Casa Blanca constituted the full extent of Morocco.  The elevator \u2014 only one was working \u2014 was extremely slow to arrive and was jerky in stopping, leaving me grateful I arrived.  The best way for me to describe the room Is \u201csorry\u201d!  It was dark with one small window in the corner that was mostly filled with an air conditioning unit and looked out onto a \u201ccourtyard\u201d but reminded my of a tenement building looking into another hotel room.  The room, although clean, seemed dark and dingy.  Everything was \u201cdecorated\u201d in shades of brown.  The air conditioner was extremely noisy and, although it cooled the room, it did not take the humidity out.  On another note, the continental breakfasts, which were included in the price, were extremely minimal and uninspired.\n\nI was extremely disappointed in this hotel.

As I mentioned in my Title, the Casablanca is a \"Best Kept Secret\".  We discovered this wonderful hotel during our research of places to stay for our trip to NYC.  Well, we were not even close to being disappointed!  The staff starting with the General Manager, John and the wonderful people working alongside him to include Brian, Christian, Tarek, JC, Stanley, Margaret to name a few wrote the book on customer service.  You feel like home while staying at this hotel.  What's more, the stay includes some outstanding amenities like an expanded continental breakfast in the morning and a beautiful wine and cheese happy hour in the evening from 5-8pm.  During the happy hour we had the pleasure of meeting some wonderful folks like Margaret who went above and beyond to make you feel like family.  She and the other young gals hosting the happy hour and breakfast in the morning take pride in their jobs and it definitely shows in their positive and caring attitudes towards all the guests enjoying this wonderful hotel. Of course, one of the best parts of staying at the Casablanca was the fact that you are only a few steps from Time Square and all the wonderful activities it has to share.  In closing, I just want to once again say how much we appreciated the great atmosphere provided by the Casablanca staff.  You all treated us like family and went out of your way to ensure our stay was memorable.  Thanks again for setting a high bar for the hospitality industry.  We will see you again on our return trip to the \"Big Apple.\"  Lee and Shelley","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If you want or need to be right in the thick of things in Times Square, yet have a peaceful place to relax and recharge, the boutique  Casablanca Hotel is it!  My deluxe Queen room was small but not cramped so I recommend the \"deluxe\" designation for any room you get.  I had one of the interior rooms with a view facing a wall and windows of other rooms to the side across the way.  That was okay since it's not like I spent a lot of time in the room staring out the window.  The a\/c is noisy but that didn't bother me since I didn't need it that much so I didn't have to blast the TV to hear over it.  But if I had to, I could have slept with it on all night b\/c I'm not a light sleeper.  The bathroom was smallish but I expected that. However, there should be a bar to hold on to as you get in and out of the tub\/shower and more \"non-skid\" protection in the bathtub.  I wear shower shoes because of foot issues so I was okay and held onto the sink getting in and out.  The elevators jerk a little when stopping at different floors but I got used to it since I arrived safely each time!\n\nThe hotel is expensive for the size of and the quality of decor and amenities  but New York (Manhattan in particular) is very expensive in general.  If you want Ritz-Carlton style, you will surely pay $1000 or more a night in this town.  Plus, at Times Square you're in tourist central of New York City.  I'm sure all those businesses have to pay high rent to be there so they have to charge you what they do.  I was happy with my room.\n\nThe nightly wine and cheese in Rick's Cafe was delightful and you can get coffee, little pastries, cookies and fruit from there all day.  Didn't get a chance to try the continental breakfast during my stay because my conference workshops at the Marquis Marriott 3 blocks away (too expensive for me!) started early and I would just eat fruit I'd taken from the Cafe the night before.  All of the staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Times Square was crazy crowded but as soon as you turn the corner onto 43rd Street and walk a few paces to Casablanca's entrance, it was like entering another world.  I loved it!  I would recommend this charming hotel to anyone who would enjoy the boutique experience over the big corporate hotel chains.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

If you are going to New York and would prefer to be somewhere quieter then I would suggest choosing a different location.\nThe room we had was cosy and clean and had excellent facilities that most hotels would not offer as standard. The bed was extremely comfortable. My only criticism about the room would be the air conditioning unit could only be used when the window was open. This did not affect us too much as there is also a ceiling fan which we used so we could not hear the street below by shutting the window. Our towels were replenished twice a day which was a really nice surprise and the lady who cleaned our room for us did an excellent job, the room was always spotless when we returned for the day. On arrival we were given a bottle of red wine and a bottle of prosecco from the hotel as a gift for being newlyweds which was not expected and really thoughtful. We also got two bottles of water in our room everyday. \nThe hotel offer cheese and wine everyday between 5 and 8pm in the lounge area which is free. We only managed to do this one day during our trip due to other plans. The wine was of good quality and it was a really nice spread of different cheeses and biscuits and fresh fruit and olives etc.  \nEverything is great about this hotel but its biggest asset is its staff. We were greeted with a very warm welcome on arrival by Chris who was staffing the front desk. During our visit we met several other members of staff who were also extremely friendly and always made the effort to greet us as we arrived at the hotel and chatted to us about our day. \nWe would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York, we had a wonderful stay.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Delightful staff will approach and offer you endless refills.\nRoom is turned down each evening and a card with weather forecast for following day is placed in room with a few chocolates - a lovely touch.\nUpon our (reluctant) return home we received a message from Casablanca Hotel saying, \"Welcome to the family - you are now part of it!\" \nThis brought a nostalgic tear to Marie's eye.\nYes... we shall return (home) to the enchanting Casablanca Hotel.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Coming in from Penn Station, take subway 1,2,3 uptown to next stop, look for 43 & Broadway exit, this will take you Times Square, across the street from Hotel. Bags held until our room was ready while we got drinks at Bryant Park outside bar- be sure to visit the Park- summer or winter, 2 blocks away. Wine & cheese buffet, breakfast buffet as advertised - very nice sit down at Ricks lounge area on second floor. Our Premium King room perfect size and large for NY. Bathroom was spacious. We were in front, early AM construction noises could be annoying, but we are used to getting up early. Noises do come thru window air conditioner- suggest rear rooms may be quieter. No views from window. Pull down room darkening shades a plus for Times Square lights. Super friendly service as all previous reviewers mentioned. We did order the room refrigerator. No ice machine but ice could be ordered. Also ice is always at the lounge area with cookies, espresso , ice water, newspapers. No shows for us this trip, be sure to go to TKTS for same day tickets. One subway ( #7) stop away from Hudson Yards where we went up the amazing Vessel. A few block walk to bus to Met Museum. For meals, same block we recommend Heartland brew pub- steaks, Brooklyn Diner. Tony's and Lobster & Burger also on same block. Casablanca reminded us of all the great things of a European river cruise, like a family B&B.

The Casablanca Hotel seemed to fit the bill and the reviews were fantastic so I booked it!\n\nFrom the minute I walked into the hotel, I was impressed. The staff couldn't have been more gracious and welcoming. In fact, not even 5 minutes after I checked in, there was a knock on my door from the Housekeeping Manager ensuring my room was to my liking and handing me some chocolates as well as a card with the next day's weather. It was a much appreciated little detail! The bellman brought my luggage up shortly after that and it was obvious that he didn't expect a tip (although I did try to give him one). \n\nThe hotel is one block away from the hustle and bustle of Time Square and the Theater District while still quiet and quaint. The rooms seem to be very sound-proof which I appreciated and they were well appointed.\n\nI also loved the cocktail hour with complementary wine, cheese, and fruit which could be enjoyed in your room or in the dining area adjacent to their library. \n\nOne thing to note - this is an older hotel so the elevators are slow and a little rickety. In addition, the room I stayed in had a window air conditioner which did not do much to take the humidity out of the room but did cool it down considerably. \n\nAll-in-all, I couldn't have loved this hotel more and just wish my stay could have been longer!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

This was our first time staying at the Casablanca and we both agreed, this is where we will stay for return visits.  The entire staff, no matter their position or responsibility, went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable.  When booking the room, we let them know we'd be in town for a birthday celebration and attending a Yankees game.  They so graciously had a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and red wine in our room, accompanied by happy birthday wishes!  We also requested a mini fridge for our room. It was installed and ready to go upon our arrival.  You know how some hotels have bottled water in your room for $5 or more a bottle?  Not here. Those were also complimentary and replenished each day, as well as chocolates left in our room each evening.  We weren't certain of the best way to get to Yankee stadium - they gave explicit instructions on the use of the subway, which Metro card to purchase, directions to the closest stop and the most direct route to and from the game (it couldn't have been easier).  The complimentary Continental breakfast each morning was delicious, including juices, cereal, yogurt, pastries and bagels, fresh fruit and eye-opening coffee (the \"breakfast ladies\" were so gracious and accommodating each morning).  Sadly, we were only able to enjoy a quick glass of wine one evening, but all the accoutrements looked so yummy, we'll be sure to make time for this next visit.   After reading other reviews, we were a bit leery of using the parking garage next door, but again, there were no issues and the hotel staff made sure we received the discount for hotel guests.  A special shout out to Victor (best doorman ever) - he made sure we had everything we needed, no request was too big or too small and his quick bite recommendations were spot on.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was traveling with my Aunt and wanted her to have a special first-time trip to NYC.  The Casablanca did not disappoint.  First, prior to even arriving at the hotel, Brian Castro provided a ton of information to help us plan for our trip.  He also allowed us to select from a variety of services, such as arranged transportation, refrigerator in the room, foam toppers and foam pillows for the bed, makeup mirror and so much more!  He knew that I wanted this to be a special trip....and when we opened the door to our suite, a bottle of wine and glasses treated us.  After we had unloaded our luggage, we went back to the desk and throughout our entire trip, had excellent assistance from Johan at the desk.  He helped us set up the Big Bus Tour, made recommendations on where to eat, showed us maps of how to get there and more.  He was truly exceptional as well!  It was a delight to see him at the front desk each of the five nights that we were there.  We took advantage of the morning breakfast, which was light, but everything was neatly arranged and served with such kindness.  We even used this second floor dining area to bring back food and sat at the tables available to have a nice lunch.  And our room, we had booked a suite room, which was nice to have the extra size.  We had one room with two double beds, another room like a living room and then the bathroom.  Was perfect to meet our needs.

We rang down to reception and asked if we could change rooms as we didn't fancy staying in this room for 5 nights, I  had emailed the hotel before we came and told them it was our 40th anniversary but reception said the e-mail wasn't passed on to them. The reception said that they would see what they could do and ring us back shortly. A few minutes later we got a call from Asim the front desk manager who apologised and said he would move us to a superior room for 4nights and we would move to another room the last night even though the hotel was fully booked. This room was much bigger and brighter, he also sent up a bottle of wine and champagne to celebrate our anniversary which was a lovely touch. On our second day Asim met us as we came into the reception area and introduced us to John the hotel manager who asked us if everything was okay and said he would send up an ice cream  cake which was beautiful \nOn our last day we changed rooms which was a few doors away and they only difference was it didn't have a street view \nWe had a great time in New York in the Casablanca hotel and would definitely go back, the hotel is close to Times square and all the attractions \nOur trip was made special by all the staff from Victor at the door to Ashley and the girls at breakfast to John the manager and especially Asim who made our stay so memorable ","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Casablanca is a beautifully stylish hotel with all the charms of the past. The hotel was spotlessly clean from the small reception area up to the comfortable and relaxing rooms.\nThe guys on the front desk were exceptionally friendly and helpful as was the doorman. Ricks Cafe on the second floor was conveniently positioned with a continental style breakfast available every morning, coffee tea and snacks throughout the day and wine cheese and snacks available in the evening, all complimentary.\nThe room on the 5th floor overlooking 93rd Street was spacious and clean with a good sized bathroom. Ironing facilities and a decent hair dryer which my wife tells me is essential on any trip, are available along with daily complimentary bottles of water and a safe deposit box.\nThe thing I like about this hotel was its proximity to the busy Times Square being only 50 yards away but turn into 93rd street and the hustle and bustle just disappears.\nTo eat - Tony\u2019s right next door is a busy reasonable priced Italian and HB Burgers just up the street is also reasonably priced by New York standards.\nIt was a bit noisy at night hence a 4 and not a 5 star review. This was due not to the hoards of people on Times Square but to the NYPD vehicles parked outside the hotel on 93rd. It did give a feeling of security but why do they have to switch on there siren for a short blast every time they move away! A bit annoying in the middle of the night but on day three we used a \u2018noise cancelling device\u2019 in the room which made an ocean wave sound!

We had high expectations due to the reviews and it didn\u2019t disappoint. For us, it had the ideal location - right next to the madness of Times Square and within minutes of a subway station. \nMaybe the hotel was quite low on numbers when we were there as we only ever came across a handful of other guests throughout our stay. We are early risers and the 7am start to breakfast suited us very well and we had no trouble with finding a table. We popped back to the hotel a few times on our days out and it was quite handy to pop into Rick\u2019s to get a tea\/coffee. The ladies serving in there were always friendly and we found the Continental breakfast varied enough for us, with the staff offering to toast bagels or bread, if required.\nThe hotel is a bit dark and dingy in places and our room on the 6th floor was particularly so - with no natural light as such. However, the hotel was amazingly quiet, particularly considering it\u2019s proximity to Times Square and as a light sleeper, I was grateful for this. Also, there was very little noise from doors closing and guests walking up and down the corridors.\nWe took advantage of the DVD library and although the majority of the films were fairly old, we chose three classics (in our opinion) set in New York. \nThe doormen were always courteous and were very helpful when it came to storing our bags on our final day. The hotel even allows you to use Rick\u2019s after you have checked out.\nTo us, this hotel has a family-run feel to it and we would have no problem in recommending this as a place to stay.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We arrived at 6 am from a red eye flight. Ground level entry is a small room with front desk, and the attendant said he would expedite turnover of our room for check-in. We were directed to the 2nd floor to hang out in the lounge (Rick's Cafe) which is open 24\/7. The lounge is moderately comfortable with water, coffee, cookies available at all times. Continental breakfast (pastries, bagels, cereal, fruit) started at 7 am. We continued to wait for our room hopefully; the staff was very attentive, and twice during the morning went down to the front desk to check on our room. At 2 pm our room still wasn't ready, and we gave up and headed out so as not to waste the whole day; this was the only disappointment of our stay, hard to believe housekeeping could not have our room ready sooner (to be fair, check-in is at 3, but given checkout is noon...). The hotel is literally steps from Times Square, perfect Midtown location. And Tony's di Napoli, which we always enjoy, is adjacent. After finally checking in late afternoon, our luggage was brought up promptly. We had a premium king room, which was fairly large (even by NY standards). The room faced a small interior space, so there was no view, but also no noise; due to the proximity of other rooms across, we kept the shade closed; as there is only one window, and with the interior room location, there was not much sunlight, so some may not like the dark atmosphere of the room. A dorm-style fridge was very convenient; complimentary bottled water was replenished every day. The small bathroom did not feel cramped. The shower head was nice, and there was instant hot water. We stayed 3 nights, mainly to see Broadway shows, and the staff was very pleasant throughout.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Unfortunately, my wonderful review did not go unnoticed, and others like it so much that they have raised their prices.  Still worth it though. \n\nMy wife asked during our stay, why is this a four star hotel?  It's not been recently renovated, and the rooms aren't that special?  My answer was that although it's not all new and shiny, everything worked, the beds were good, nothing is \"worn out\" but it's really the service.  From the door men to the concierge to the housekeeping and the young ladies that serve continental breakfast and pour the wine in the afternoon, everyone is nice, professional and extremely helpful. A five star hotel would be all that and maybe a bit more up-to-date, but you'll also pay twice the price.\n\nOn top of that, you are literally steps away from Times Square and a block or two from Hell's Kitchen.  The rooms are quiet - I never heard any neighbors, and they have improved the A\/C since last time so that they don't make a racket.  If I had to pick something to complain about, I'd mention the very small, very slow and probably very old elevators. \n\nOur first trip there was in a standard room, which is typically NYC small and cramped.  This time I splurged on a suite, and it (for me) was worth the extra money.  The bathroom was either extremely well maintained or recently redone.  The furniture, although not new, is all in excellent condition. The beds were neither extremely firm nor soft, but we both slept very well.  Far too often hotel beds are lumpy and worn out; this was not the case at the Casablanca.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We weren\u2019t worried because we have stayed here before.  We knew they would be kind and thoughtful and they didn\u2019t disappoint us.  We received a warm welcome from a couple of dapper chaps at reception and they assured us that even though the hotel was fully booked, they would endeavour to get us into the room as soon as possible.  In the meantime, they invited us to have breakfast upstairs in Rick\u2019s Cafe.  We gave Victor our luggage for safe-keeping and up the stairs we went, happy to read a complimentary New York Times and choose from a wonderful array of cereals, pastries, fruit, coffees and teas and juices.  Yum.  Oh, and hard-boiled eggs.  Top quality, everything fresh, and a lovely young woman toasting breads and bagels, keeping the counter and room  refreshed and tidy.  We were in a blissful state and it couldn\u2019t get better when it was announced to us that our room was available at 1015.\nRoom 410 is a good size, heavenly king mattress and lots of gorgeous bedding including several types of pillows from which to choose.  They make it clear that your wish is their command and they really mean it.  We met several members of housekeeping and maintenance  who were lovely as well and keep the rooms so clean and organized.\nThis hotel just makes us happy.  You know those little niggling things that occur in hotels such as a lack of organisation or cleanliness or thoughtfulness?  Well, relax when you enter this haven of hospitality.  The team are one step ahead of you.  They have anticipated your needs and are there to serve.  With sincerity and smiles.\nWhoever owns this hotel must have a policy of hiring only kind people and wanting the guests to be happy,  I don\u2019t think I have ever felt this way with any other hotel.  I love it here and am so grateful for their business acumen.  It doesn\u2019t feel like money is the most important thing; guests are. We know there are three other hotels owned by the same company and we are curious to try them.  Undoubtedly they are excellent as well but the Casablanca instils such loyalty in us that it is hard to book even at another Library Hotel.  (But next time we might try.

We used the hotel's outsourced limo service for airport pickup and return. The total cost (including tolls and tips) for both rides was $216. We had used a shuttle service on our previous NYC trips, but a cost comparison showed the shuttle would have cost just under $200, so the difference of less than $20 was well worth the personal and private service. We were delivered to the hotel before 9 a.m. and the staff went out of its way to find us a vacant room so that we could rest after a 10-hour flight. Shortly after entering our room, a maid delivered a welcome back gift of wine -- totally unexpected and appreciated. We noticed the radiator was not working, so I called the front desk and within minutes someone came to adjust it. He told us that if we wanted more heat, they would provide a space heater, which we later requested. Each day, the maid left us two bottles of water, chocolates and a note about tomorrow's weather report. The mattress was very comfortable and we had a choice of pillows. The free breakfast was basic -- breads, cold and hot cereal, pastries, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate. No waffles or omelets, but we were satisfied with the food and service. This is a small hotel, so the breakfast room was rarely crowded. If the tables were occupied, people were considerate and quickly left after finishing, and the staff quickly cleaned up. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of Time Square, theaters, shops, eateries, attractions, and a major subway stop. A police station is nearby, and police cars were usually parked within feet of the hotel's entrance, which made the Casablanca one of the safest spots in the neighborhood. Our room was small, but we appreciated the closet had many hangers and a safe. Bathroom towels were clean and in good shape. Water was hot and pressure was excellent. The facility is a quiet oasis in a high energy city, but the best part of the Casablanca is the people. Always friendly, always thoughtful, always looking out for your comfort. We will stay there again on our next visit.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}
