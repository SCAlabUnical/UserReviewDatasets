Guests can savor stunning city views, enhanced by floor to ceiling windows that let in so much natural light and actually open to let in fresh air! Despite its super central location, the hotel provides a tranquil retreat, with minimal noise coming into the room if the windows are closed, offering a serene escape from the bustling city. \n\nAesthetics is everything for me, and personally I found the red accents (trademark of the Virgin brand), quite appealing. The seasonal pre-selected music playlists on the TV were also quite a nice touch and very fitting to the New York City style. The extra seating space next to the bed along with a table was also appreciated, especially if you are working.\n\nAttention to detail is evident in thoughtful amenities like a wireless charger, and stylish clock that shows time on the ceiling.

Pet Owners Please Go Elsewhere","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2024-03-02","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Pet owners please read my review thoroughly. DON'T STAY HERE. The one star I give here other than the fact that I cannot give no star is for the nice service provided by one member of their concierge team. Other than that, by all means I would never return to this hotel and I would recommend others to do the same for your own sake.\n\nI booked my stay in early January and my stay was in mid-February. One of the reasons for booking here is that they do not charge any pet fees which is rare for 5-star hotels at such locations. However, I was told at check-in that I have to pay $100 for the pet fee because they instituted a new policy a week ago (in the end they \"waived\" that fee for me due to another abysmal problem which I will take about later). For starter, I cannot fathom how I am responsible for the policy they recently instituted given that I made my reservation way ahead in advance. In addition, I received no messages or tips from the hotel saying that they have this new policy and they now charge a pet fee. Even in that scenario, it would be prudent for them to express an apology for this change and offer refunds or other accommodations. However, they never did any of those. To me, this is blatant FRAUD.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the worst part of the stay. As I was saying, I was traveling with pets and they spent 99% of the time inside the hotel room (the other 1% of the time they walked around in corridors and the lobby). On the 2nd night of our stay late into the night, we discovered that one of our puppies had not only 1 but 2 giant ticks attached to her skin. For people who do not own pets, ticks may carry Lyme disease which is lethal to both canine and humans alike. We had to take her to a pet emergency at 2 am in the morning where we spent $250. Based on the description, it is not difficult to deduce that however unlikely, the room we stayed in contained ticks hidden somewhere. We then returned to their hotel, showed the front desk the ticks we retrieved from the vet, and demanded a room swap. The staff on duty was nice enough to offer us a different room and waive our pet fee. However, with incidents of such magnitude happening, I would expect, from 5-star hotels like themselves, calls or messages from hotel management. The only thing I received was my receipt of the stay.\n\nAgain, any of the problems I mentioned above would be no problem at all for a motel or perhaps even a 3-star hotel. But this is simply unacceptable for a 5-star hotel with their branding.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The spa looks fantastic though I didn't have time to get a massage.  My absolutely favorite was the lounge floor, where I had a lovely coffee and was able to see the views of the city.  The staff are unbelievable, truly the Valets, the welcome staff were all really helpful and friendly.  Jordan Palmer, the restaurant manager, was just such a great person to talk to and you can tell that everyone who works there really cares about the client experience.\n\nI would say this is a perfect NYC hotel for those wanting a fun experience and nice clean rooms.

Down the road there were much better cafes that cost a quarter of the price and much better food and quality \nWe were told we got 25 us$ per day for food or beverages including room service but not the mini bar which was fine. We were told this 3 times, by 3 different people on 3 different occasions as I had a few questions to ask so kept going back. When we came to check out I advised her that we used 2 of the 25us$ credits on two days. (1 each day which was allowed) The receptionist then told us that it was 25us$ for the whole stay. I said that\u2019s not what we have been told by 3 different members of staff and also it\u2019s on your T&c\u2019s which I showed her. I also was told when I questioned it that if it was per duration why was I told that the credit cannot be rolled over to the next day if not used??  If it\u2019s just 1 credit and I\u2019ve used the 1 credit why would you even say you can\u2019t roll it over. Then she replied yes you\u2019re right you can\u2019t roll over the credit if you don\u2019t use it. ???? What???? She just contradicted herself. Can\u2019t understand how a Virgin staff at a Virgin hotel doesn\u2019t know their own offers and terms. She said she would take this off. I asked her for the bill and she said she would email it to me. Which I found it odd as I normally sign to authorise for payments that will come out of my bank. Off to the airport we went home. Checked my emails and they haven\u2019t taken no credit off at all. The bill was 250 us$.  Just checked my bank statement and they have taken out \u00a3296. ????? We didn\u2019t touch the mini bar so not sure why we have been charged more than the bill they sent us. Which now reading reviews they\u2019ve overcharged a few people and never got a refund. This is fraud. No wonder they wait to email you a receipt after you leave. \n\nAlso we asked for a morning wake up call for our flight back. Never got that\n\nWe also lost one of our duty free bags. We may have left it in the taxi on the way in but I asked on 3 occasions if they could check their cctv to see if we did bring it into the hotel with us. Never got an answer even though I was promised I would get a response. This had my suspicions.  \nIn the first day our safe wouldn\u2019t work. We asked if they could come and fix it. I was told we have to wait for the engineer to come I said ok can you call him. He said he\u2019s on site but don\u2019t know where he is and don\u2019t know how long it will be until he comes ?!! I was told I would have to wait in my room until he came ???  As if. !!!!  \n\nThis is genuine feedback from a gold member of Virgin Atlantic with nearly 1 million points. If this is how you treat your customers you will sure loose customers. \n\nI have emailed the hotel directly and will take this further if my money isn\u2019t refunded.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They will promise credits to be used at the restaurants and then won't apply them at check-out. I had a FREE breakfast credit that turns out I couldn't redeem because I had EXTENDED my stay... not cut short my stay, but EXTENDED. And I understand it wasn't booked through the third party for the extension but come on. Don't punish me for giving you more business. It would've saved them a lot more money just to take off a $66 breakfast that i wouldn't have ordered (it was just scrambled eggs and potatoes) than it's going to cost in effects of a poor review...\n\nAlso, there was a $100 free credit to be used at their restaurant that was used during my initial booking through Chase, it was never applied and the lady at check-out insisted that it was applied. Her name is Juliana (Director of Experience). She lied to me and told me it was applied but it never was and I had to settle it over email with someone above her. Person on the email immediately apologized for the mistake. I don't know who made put her in charge of Experience but she is the only one who gave me a bad experience.\n\nNot only that but It's been over a week since I've stayed their and I still haven't received any of my deposits back.

Everything was fairly typical: they let us know of the amenities in the building including the gym, restaurant, and spa. They gave us a 50$ coupon for spa services, which I found a little silly. The spa charges 75$ to use the amenities, not including any treatments, but there are many opportunities in New York to enjoy a spa for better value. I felt the coupon was just intended to make you feel you were getting a good deal when in reality, I don\u2019t think it was.\n\nThe gym was standard. It has techno gym equipment which was really nice but for lifters like me, you know that 50 lbs dumbbells are not enough to replace a full gym experience. There were some machines, but were not thorough enough to replace a fitness enthusiast\u2019s routine. \n\nThe pool club was closed as it was winter.\n\nWhen we got to our room, there were a few cleanliness issues. The toilet appeared not to be cleaned well and there was trash in the bins. There were also leftover coffee pods in the coffee machine. Honestly, because we were just trying to have a more comfortable place for the night, we did not complain. I\u2019m sure if we had said something they would have been apologetic - but I would be surprised if that room had been inspected by a lead housekeeper.\n\nThe layout of the room was not my favorite. Over 60% of the room was a combination bathroom and dressing area, while the actual living (bed + sitting) room was less than 40% of the space. I might be picky but I did not like that there was no tile outside the shower so the  faux wooden floor would get wet after showering and we would mop up the water with a towel.\n\nThe bed was a king and was comfortable. I enjoyed the linens although they did have some scratchy tags facing the head of the bed. \n\nOur view from the room was amazing. Best view of the Empire State I\u2019ve ever seen. Only issue was that the curtains could not be opened so you could enjoy the view from any of the furniture, instead the curtains opened to an apartment building. When the curtains were opened only 60% of the glass was exposed. Still, the view was worth it from the corner of the room we could see it from.\n\nCheckout is super easy. No complaints. \n\nOverall, I think it was good for what we needed. I\u2019m sure the rate we paid was fairly low because it was a last minute booking but I would not pay much more than 150$ a night for this property. It seems to style itself as a mid range hotel with mid range amenities but felt more like staying in a newly built low range hotel.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I\u2019m sorry to report that this location is disappointing, to say the least. \n\nWe cancelled a Hilton Garden Inn to stay at the Virgin based on our previous experiences. We wish we hadn\u2019t. It cost considerably more and was a bit farther from our planned activities.  This would have been okay if the stay had been as expected.  Instead, it was nothing special and lacked the touches to which we\u2019ve become accustomed. \n\nThe lobby was very bare and lacked the cool vibe that we\u2019ve seen in others. The room itself was as expected. Small, but comfortable. The bed is always nice, so that was a positive. \n\nThe real problem was the maid service. The first full day, we walked in on the housekeeper after being gone touring for nine hours.  She quickly left without fully finishing. The second day, after being gone 7 hours, we returned to a room that hadn\u2019t been cleaned at all. Given that we were planning to chill for a couple hours before going back out, the room never was cleaned. We called and asked for fresh towels. \n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll mention is the daily happy hour. We were offered one drink.  At every other location we\u2019ve been to, the happy hour for the Know is drinks for an hour. That\u2019s part of why we switched.  Apparently, New York is different. The inconsistency is a problem. \n\nFor the money and what we\u2019d expected, we now wish we\u2019d stuck with our original reservation.

We decided to give a new place a try as we wanted to move away from Times Square. We were not disappointed in our choice of Virgin Hotels NYC.\n\nThe biggest reason we had such an amazing experience this year was the staff. Every single person we interacted with was friendly, attentive, and helpful. We had some fun conversations with several staff members and three in particular went out of their way to make sure our stay was great. Christopher Vega, and Darnell consistently made sure that everything was going well. As staff members working in the lobby they always said hello when we passed and chatted with us several times. Darnell was fun to bounce ideas off of for things to do \/ places to eat. They have a larger than life personality that we noticed the second we checked in and always made us smile.\n\nChristopher really went above and beyond for us on what was supposed to be our last day. We checked out seamlessly and went to Penn station to wait for our train. We had delays due to flooding on the tracks and were concerned we wouldn't get home. I went back to the hotel (which is super close to Penn) and talked to Christopher to see if they could squeeze us in for another night if we needed (aka hold a room). They chatted with their manager and were able to work something out for us. We decided to just go for it after all and stay an extra night since there was a lot of flooding in our town too. They got us right into a new room without having to wait until check in time and didn't charge us extra! We ended up having a great bonus night in the city - not a bad place to get \"stuck\"!\n\nWe really enjoyed the restaurant and ate there several times. Cool atmosphere and delicious food \/ cocktails. We are both gluten free due to Celiac and from the moment we first stepped in Jack went above and beyond to make sure our food wasn't going to make us sick. They checked in anytime they saw us there and even stepped in to help when we had an issue with a language barrier with one of the waiters. The waiter was still super friendly and attentive we just had a hard time explaining things to them. Gluten free can be very tricky!\n\nThe hotel itself was fun, funky, clean, and unique. We stayed in an Empire Chamber King our entire stay, including the bonus night and the views were nothing short of spectacular. Our rooms were clean, and spacious with comfortable beds. There was plenty of space in each closet for our suitcases and belongings. I loved the curtain over them to hide the stuff inside and keep the room feeling nice. Room service was FAST and reasonably priced. The minibar was very well stocked and also reasonably priced.\n\nHonestly we loved everything about Virgin NYC including the Nomad neighborhood.

Although the hotel is new and very clean, I did not like the way the rooms were arranged. The room is basically split down the middle, with a bedroom at one end, and closets, sink, separate shower, toilet, and a small makeup table on the other. There is a sliding door that can be left open or closed. The room lacked additional seating areas. You either sat on the bed or a small stool near the makeup table. The room is separated so that one person can get up and get dressed without disturbing the other person sleeping. But once you went into the other area, there was no place to sit and have coffee or just hang out. I felt this design made the room feel smaller. The other issue I had with the hotel is a missong wallet and lack of concern from the hotel staff. The night before  we were checking out, I realized my wallet was missing. It had all of my credit cards and drivers license in it. I had left it on the bed that morning while in a rush, but when we came back to the room, the bed had new sheets and the wallet was gone. I suspected it was rolled up in the sheets and tossed in the laundry area. I immediately called the front desk to explain the situation. I was told that someone would get right back with me. Several hours went by and 2 more calls to the front desk, but I never was able to speak with house keeping or security. The next morning I called the front desk 2 more times, until finally security came to our room at 11 am, after I complained that we had to leave for the airport at 12 and I did not have an ID to board the plane. Security was no help at all. He wrote down a few notes and said he was going to make some calls and get back with us ASAP. By 12 we went down to the lobby to get a car for the airport. The security guard was chatting with other guests and basically just hanging out in the lobby. We made eye contact and I was walking over to ask him about the status of my wallet, when he hurried away and went into a room for employees only. I did not expect the hotel to find my wallet, but I did expect them to at least try and locate it, or communicate with us better. There are many hotels in New York, and I just feel the Virgin is lacking in customer service, which is why we will choose a different one next time we visit the city.

But ours are different and I believe his to be too kind. We were very excited about our trip to NY. It\u2019s such a shame, the beginning  wasn\u2019t what we expected. Have stayed in many hotels all over the world, so The cons first. \nOn arrival there was lots of clicking on the computer. We were then given our room number. We had booked for the Chamber King empire room. Which in a email, we were told would be on level 22 and above. Our room was 12 something. We expressed our concerns, to be told we \u201cdefinitely had the room we paid for\u201d, and if we came back tomorrow they would move us and try and accommodate us with our requests for a higher level room. We were tired and just wanted to rest. We went to our room. My partner then found the email about our room type being above level 22. He popped back down. He spoke to Glen who was one of the supervisors, who told him, \u201cwe definitely wasn\u2019t in the room we paid for\u201d. Apparently the rooms had been over booked. We were taken to the bar and given complimentary cocktails while they sorted it. They did manage to sort it, so was someone else, then not in the room they paid for? It wasn\u2019t the start we wanted for our holiday. The views from our then room on 35, was exactly why we paid more. It was the views we wanted. The breakfast package is awful, don\u2019t bother. Only have choice of American or continental. Most mornings something was missing. On the menu it\u2019s priced as the highest, so unsure why you can\u2019t choose something else. We often had something else out and about, as it wasn\u2019t enough to start the day on. \nThe drinks in the Everdeen are over priced. A bottle of water will set you back $12!!  Lifts take getting used too. \nThe pros - \nFantastic central location. Rooms (when you get the right one) are spacious, clean with the most amazing view of the city and Empire State Building. Extra Coffee pods are available on request. Most of the staff are welcoming,  friendly and helpful. If they cannot do your request, they will certainly try to accommodate. \n\nOn the whole we had a good stay. However, we wouldn\u2019t rush back to a virgin hotel, due to check in, the breakfast package. Shame  really.\n\nAlso just to add, the delta flight was above the expectations and the food was very good. The virgin flights food, was below the standard we would have expected.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

To our shock, the hotel had shut down all dining and bar areas throughout the hotel on Friday night because they had rented out all of those areas to a third party, which was hosting a Halloween party that the attendees had to pay for online. Hotel guest did not have access to that devastatingly loud party even if they wanted to attend. This meant that at nearly 10:00 p.m. at night, we were forced to travel throughout the city to find some place to eat and have drinks. The Virgin Hotel failed to post, or announce, any prior warning to their hotel guests.\nOn Saturday, October 28, 2023, we had another show to attend that was starting at 7:30 p.m. Before coming to New York, we had made an early dinner reservation at a restaurant that was difficult to get a reservation for. My wife and I decided we would just have dinner room service to save us some time. Therefore, we canceled the dinner reservation with restaurant that we made several weeks before. I called in our in-room dinner order, which included wine. The hotel informed me that our order would arrive in about 45 minutes. When I called an hour later, the hotel staff told me that while they were aware of our dinner order, the order was never fulfilled. At no time did anyone at the hotel call to tell us that we would not be getting any of the food or drinks that we ordered. By that time, we had to make a mad dash to the Broadway show without any dinner.\nAdding insult to injury, the Halloween party that took place on Friday, and which caused all of the dining and bar areas to be shut off to hotel guests would be repeated on Saturday night, again with all of the dining and bar areas shut off for their hotel guests. \nWarning: There was absolutely no way to enjoy the hotel\u2019s dining facilities on any day during that weekend. Make sure before you make reservations with this hotel that you have a firm grasp on which hotel facilities guests will be able to use during your stay. This includes, Halloween, Easter, St. Patrick\u2019s Day, President\u2019s Day, and all other major and minor holidays.\nDining in Virgin Hotels may not be available to you as a hotel guest. Also, avoid in-room dining if you have other options.\n","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This wasn't disclosed on the website, at booking, on my reservation confirmation, or at check-in or check-out.  I contacted the property to inquire about what the fee covered and was told that it covers amenities such as laundry, wifi, the restaurant, pool, and bars.  This may be the most egregious destination fee\/resort fee I have ever seen.  A fee for the privilege of paying for laundry and to visit the restaurant?  Other hotels at least now provide things like bottled water, a restaurant discount, a free drink, coffee, etc. to soften the blow of the fee and make you think you are getting something in return.  Not so here.  Not even a bottle of water.  Deliberately concealing this fee has done nothing but ruin my impression of this hotel.  ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

We were looking forward to this stay so much and had the highest hopes with it being a Virgin hotel. We had an amazing Virgin flight out to NYC and couldn\u2019t wait to check in.\n \nWe arrived and went to check in. This was the start of the awful service. The stay was prepaid so we just had a surety to pay. We were told that we owed the full balance. We explained that it was paid and could prove it through Virgin holiday site and via the bank. We were continually told that we had to pay the balance and we were getting no where till someone else came over who was clearly a manager and straight away said that the balance was paid. We were offered no information on the hotel in fact there was no conversation at all. We paid the surety and put it down to a bad day.\n \nWe went to the room which was lovely. The view was amazing. The facilities exactly as we expected. We could not fault it in anyway.\n \nWe then received a message from the bank saying that Virgin hotels had tried to take a large amount of money and was it fraudulent transaction. We went back to reception to discuss this and were ultimately called liars and they had only taken the surety. The only thing the same person told us was to call the bank. I asked to use the phone as we had low battery. The phone was thrown across the desk at us.\nThe bank confirmed that they had only taken the surety \u2013 because they had blocked the other transaction. We could not even be bothered to speak to the member of staff again. We were determined not to let it ruin the stay.\n \nThe following morning we went for a look around the hotel and went to have a coffee on the roof top terrace. Again another gorgeous area. However the place was deserted when the staff member eventually served us and we just asked for a coffee he could not have been more disinterested. We then proceeded to pay an extortionate amount for the smallest, most rubbish coffee in NYC.\n \nWe went downstairs and new staff were on duty. There was a lady who was very helpful and advised us about \u2018The Know\u2019 and some other things. None of which had been mentioned the night before. Later that day we returned to go and get a drink from \u2018The Know\u2019 app. We went back to the roof top bar and asked about how to get our drink. We were told we had 8 mins to get out drinks, two menus thrown on a table and then left. We got someone\u2019s attention to order the drinks within the 8 mins, to be brought the most appalling cocktail I have ever seen and if I had been paying I would have refused. It simply cemented that we would spend no more money within the hotel.\n \nThe room and facilities are lovely. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The bedding, robes products etc and all fantastic. The room layout is great. The view is fab. The service awful. It could not be further away from the service that Virgin pride themselves on.

I enquired what this was and the lady serving me suggested that it is like a 'city tax' or such-like levied by hotels around the world. I did some research afterwards and it is nothing of the sort - it's just an additional charge going to the hotel. If they want to charge this, then they at least need to be honest about what it is. Moreover, it would also be good for them to offer something in return.  In particular, the hotel should offer guests departing on evening flights back to Europe the opportunity to have a shower and refresh before departing the city. This is currently not possible in this hotel which is disappointing. In addition, and a smaller point all things considered, I would encourage the hotel to include a small kettle in rooms so guests wanting a cup of tea can boil water.

It was a unanimous highlight of the weekend.\n\nOn our last night, we explored the Everdene, the nightclub on the 3rd floor, and were pleasantly surprised. The music was top40\/ R&B\/ throwbacks which was just the vibe we were looking for! The indoor\/outdoor options were fantastic with the dancefloor and balcony. The drinks were delicious and we were seamlessly able to charge everything to our room.

Beautifully set against the back drop of the Empire State Building. (See the photos!) The area was safe and good to walk around and lots of very nice restaurants and eateries nearby. \n\nThe hotel team were lovely and helpful and the whole place had a very \u2018cool\u2019 vibe without being intimidating. Very happy with the service. \n\nThe room felt relatively spacious for four of us considering this is NYC. The layout of the separate dressing areas, toilet closet and shower cubicle is a clever design. \n\nThe massive bonus for us travelling with kids in the heat of August was the rooftop swimming pool. Not a huge pool but perfect for a cooling dip after a day travelling the hot city. It did get busy with guests at times but we always managed to find a lounger. \n\nI\u2019ve read some reviews saying they had problems with the lifts \/ elevators. Wasn\u2019t an issue for us, in fact the lifts were incredibly efficient. Just tap your room card and it automatically calls a lift to one of their 30 or so floors. Never had to wait more than a few seconds. \n\nWe had a breakfast inclusive rate and the food in their restaurant Everdene was excellent. All the breakfast is a la carte and cooked to order\u2026. Pancakes, waffles, eggs you name it. Felt like a real luxury to have a proper sit down breakfast everyday rather than a buffet. \n\nThere was some confusion on how the breakfast rate worked and what was \/ wasn\u2019t included but this was quickly sorted by the reception team. \n\nSo overall a strong \u2018yes\u2019 recommendation from me for this hotel.

A charge not insignificant when booking multiple rooms and the UK bank approach is to deduct initially rather than pend payment  I was also informed there was an amenity charge of $35 per day per room to cover the gym and pool (whether used or not).  I cannot find this charge being identified in the charges to be paid.  Again an additional cost along with all the usual US taxes.  \n\nOverall, expensive given the unadvertised hidden charges.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Stayed here for 2 nights, although tried to book it for longer but it was unavailable. Came from another hotel chain to the Virgin for the last 2 days of our week long stay and it was a welcome change. The views from the twin chamber we were given on the 17th floor was stunning! The facilities were great, pool and roof top bar on the 4th floor with great views of the Empire State. Jessie was super friendly and really took the time out to show us around. Thank you for the most wonderful stay! Beds were super comfy, but the pillows could be much better. They are filled with hollow fibre, instead of down and had seen better days. Staff are wonderful. Didn't use the restaurant or bar but everything else was great and highly recommend if you're planning on visiting NYC. Close to all amenities, perfect walking distance to plenty of sites and restaurants. Around the corner from Madison Sq and plenty of subway stations to get you around the rest of NY.

A nice real human being at the Virgin call centre sorted us out and we flew Virgin (via Delta partner) to JFK and stayed a week at their new, New York hotel.\n\nIt had only been open a few months so there were some minor staff issues as everyone gets up to speed but special mention goes out to Jenny on reception who dealt with a couple of minor issues and a billing confusions expertly, professionally and with great warmth and character - what a difference it makes. \n\nThanks to her and her colleagues I\u2019d go back.\n\nRooms are clean, comfortable (the big, mirrored sliding-door between the bedroom and bathroom area means you can get organised without disturbing your still sleeping partner!) and the views are spectacular- you can almost reach out and touch the Empire State Building (not really but it\u2019s very close.) \n\nOnce you get the hang of using the lifts it\u2019s an easy experience navigating the hotel - the well equipped gym is brand new (July 2023) the Everdene restaurant inside-outside bar is nice. The outside pool area, although smallish is fine for recovering in after New York has had its way with you - lots of towels and a nice bar area. You\u2019re also surround by the skyscrapers which is a cool experience.\n\nIf you do the breakfast take the stone filter coffee rather than cappuccino etc as you get free refills (July 2023.)\n\nYou\u2019re based in an upcoming area so the surrounding streets aren\u2019t  super- posh (yet) but you\u2019re in walking distance of everywhere you want to go (go for a walk on the high line 10mins away - you won\u2019t regret it.)\n\nAll in all a good experience at the Virgin New York and I can be quite fussy\u2026.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were unable to get the water and ice machine down the hall to work until our last night but I assume that was user error and it's  a nice thing to offer guests so as to avoid all the single use plastic bottles.\n\nWe ordered room service and the food was good, albeit pricey, but what we expected for room service in NYC.\n\nThe two main selling points for this hotel are location (a 20 minute walk to basically everything) and the pool.

Like most families, we are a handful.  Deliveries from Costco so we can save on groceries to bring back to Montauk, where groceries cost 3-4 times the price.   Hand delivered microgreens from Union Square.  Fedex packages that we needed to be picked up.  As a former hotel owner (pre-Covid, thank god!), i was truly impressed.  1) It's not easy to open a new hotel as complex and large as Virgin Hotel NYC Flatiron.  2) It's not easy to get a large staff that's new to work together seamlessly.  Candice has done that.  Bravo.  Also, the pool club manager.  Wow.  We call him Rico Suave.  He took care to make sure that we entertained our 3 year and 1 year old daughters who LOVE him and the pool.  The breakfast was amazing and my wife and daughters were dancing while eating to the cool vibe and music.  Thanks also to Bethany Cohen, who made sure everything went smoothly.

Turns out there was a problem with access to the 24th floor so we were switched to  a room on the 23rd floor and given key cards. (The digital room key on the app was never updated.)\n\nThe room was clean (except for a few white stains on the seat next to the bed) and had a nice view of the Empire State Building. The mini-bar was not stocked with all the products listed on the card -- but it didn't matter because we would never pay $7 for a Coke or $8 for a bag of chips.\n\nOur room was quiet (we only heard a bit of noise from a neighbour) and we loved how the toilet and the shower were separate. (There is a rainfall shower as well as a handheld nozzle with \"gentle\" and \"who-needs-a-man\" settings!) Our room was refreshed on the two days that we requested service.\n\nWe were so comfortable in the room that we asked if we could extend our stay by two days, which they happily did \u2013 at the same daily rate.\n\nSome people posting reviews here have complained about the elevators but we found them easy to use and efficient. Others have noted the size of the pool but we thought it was sufficient for cooling off. \n\nWhat WAS striking was the lack of service on the 3rd and 4th floors.\n\nWe were ignored by the staff at the pool bar (our guess is that two average-looking men over 40 are not the hotel's desired demographic). We watched a server bring drinks and food to others on the pool deck but he never came near us. We got the message that we were not welcome and never went back to the pool.\n\nIt was the same attitude during the daily \"spirit hour\" on the outdoor terrace on the 3rd floor \u2013 we sat and enjoyed our cocktails but no one ever approached us to ask if we wanted another round or if we wanted to see a food menu.\n\nThe overall lack of service (and being made to feel unwelcome) meant that we chose not to eat any meals at the restaurant during our stay.\n\nSpeaking of lost revenue opportunities... we asked about purchasing Virgin Hotels baseball caps like the one we saw employees wearing and were told that the only merch available is the umbrella ($115).\n\nOverall, we'd recommend this hotel for its location, rooms and amenities. Hopefully its employees can lose a bit of the attitude and start providing service to all guests, not just the young, pretty ones.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I bet the higher management in the Virgin organization would not like to be associated with this type of quality of service.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s liking but worked for us. The view from the room was great with floor to ceiling windows. There isn\u2019t a kettle and only a coffee machine. The fridge is trendy but noisy. We unplugged it at night. The room lighting is a little confusing. Housekeeping was hit and miss. We took breakfast in the 3rd floor restaurant which was excellent.

You go to the elevator and you either first choose your floor and than hold the card at the card reader or you do it the other way around. Than its tells you which elevator to pick. One of the first things they explained to us. The welcoming was very friendly. Nearly everytime we entered the lobby we were greated with a \"Hi guys!\". The rooms are spacious, especially for New York with great interieur and design. Beds are comfortable, as are the pillows. I registered before at their customer program \"The Know\" and we got a free room upgrade plus a bag with some chips and water and a handwritten greeting card delivered a few minutes after check-in. We also spend one afternoon at the pool which is not the biggest but with a great view on the skyline. The following stuff was not perfect but is nothing for which I would deduct a star in this review because all the rest was so perfect.\n\nNot so good:\n1. The fridge is fairly loud. We used to unplug it during the night, and the drinking was still very cold in the morning.\n2. The mini bar is advertised as \"street priced\" but after asking for the price list I can say that's not correct. It's as expensive as in every other hotel\n3. On the last two days the floor in the room was not cleaned. On check-out they gave us a discount of 3 days amenity fee\n4. They have basically everyday some kind of event at the pool area, especially during pride month now. Sometimes it can be hard as customer to get a spot because of other people joining the event. But I understand that this is also because of the Virgin brand that they do there events.\n5. We had no slippers in the room but also didn't need them\n\nWhat I especially liked:\n1. With \"The know\" App I saw everyday an updated list with our fees and what we bought inside the hotel. Very transparent and easy to follow how your final price sums up. If there is a problem you can see it immediatelly and fix it, not just at the end.\n2. The wifi, especially the reconnecting of devices was perfect. No big hustle or anything once you initaly connected. Speed was very good.\n3. Windows to open and let fresh air in, even in the 34th floor. And to all which complain about noise from outside they should check if the windows are closed. When we came in the window was a little open for fresh air but after closing the noise level was good\n\nWe enjoyed our stay there very much and I can only recommend it","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They confirmed WiFi was free but this was an entertainment fee, this threw me a little but we were a little too tired after travelling from London so just agreed. We were shown to our room and sadly it was covered in hairs (both kinds). Not just a few but clumps near the bed, shower, toilet and the seat at the vanity table was riddled with them. I called three times to have our room cleaned because I didn\u2019t want my baby crawling around or any of us taking our shoes off. No one came. It was eventually cleaned three hours later!! We asked for a cot and it arrived with no bedding, when we came back from our evening out after asking twice there was still no bedding.\n\nThe pool was great, amazing views and the staff there very friendly, however, they served you a bottle of warm rose with no ice bucket, they had hardly any of the drinks on the menu available and the lifeguard spent the WHOLE time on his phone. The pool is open to the general public so lots of parties happen in the afternoon so it\u2019s unlikely you get a bed. It\u2019s a shame that this isn\u2019t a resident only hotel.\n\nRestaurant staff were very friendly and service was good.\n\nUpon checking out we settled our bill and four hours later we got charged $67 dollars for room charge, no authorisation, no follow up email\/confirmation and the only thing we had during our three nights there was a $8 dollar IPA. It has been over a week now and I still haven\u2019t received any confirmation of a refund for this charge.\n\nThis hotel could be a lot better but there is definitely a lack of communication between departments and I feel there is very little management\/overseeing of what is actually going on. \n\nI never like to write negative comments as I spent years in hospitality and things do go wrong but I feel there were so many and I\u2019m still chasing now for the overcharge.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I would expect a so called 5 star hotel to offer the kind of service that would go above and beyond - but this wasn't even an above and beyond request - this was just basic customer service. I will not return to Virgin, I will continue to book around the corner at The Langham moving forward because I would never want to have that kind of experience again. Additionally, my in room dining experience was subpar and the windows are so thin that the outside felt inside with how loud the surrounding area was.

The hotel is still new and fresh, so the facilities were overall modern and clean. \n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks great and upon walking into reception, it is a trendy and quirky ares with welcoming and friendly staff. There is a bag area if you arrive early or on check out day if you have day plans.\n\nWe paid for an Empire Room and as expected, had speculator views of The Empire State Building. It was almost definitely the best view I have had, staying in a city hotel. The bedroom is separated from the 'living' area and the shower and toilet are separate, which was great. The room came with an iron, air dryer, free safe, dressing gowns etc. so all the mod cons and luxuries were included, which also included luxury hair wash, condition and body wash.\n\nThe bed was large and super comfy and came with a large TV mounted on the wall in front. The window in the bedroom was unusual and opened as a square outwards about 10 inches, so you could get fresh air, even on the 26th floor, though as we found out the hard way, close it if it starts to rain, otherwise you'll flood the immediate area within the room. \n\nThe hotel has two rooftop bars, which were unfortunately closed and both booked out for 'private events' for the entire week we was there, which was highly disappointing for both to be utilised and paying guests ignored for the experience and privilege. Everdene bar and restaurant is on the 3rd floor and was lively and great, but service was pretty non-existent. \n\nThe only negatives: \n\nUpon entering the room on our arrival, we found a dirty pair of underwear, clearly from the previous guest and that the cleaner had missed. We told reception and it was removed by the cleaner whilst we was out and perhaps I was expecting too much, but for the high end hotel chain it is, I expected something to say sorry. \n\nThe room also has a lovely SMEG fridge inside, which whilst it looks lovely, my god does it make some loud noises during the night. It got to the point that we had to pull the plug out each night before bed.\n\nDespite these, the hotel was pretty amazing and is highly recommended. I would almost certainly stay again when in NYC.

We've walked by it and spend a lot of time in the area, so thought it would be fun to mix it up and stay at a nice new spot. \n\nWe arrived early on the day we were checking in to drop our bags off. To our surprise, the room was ready (~10AM) - everything went downhill from there. We asked where we could find some coffee in the hotel before we set out for the day. The lobby directed us to the third floor bar area. We later found out this is the only food\/drink area open in the whole hotel. The staff seemed very confused by our request but poured us two cups to go and we left. Then, the waiter chased us down and asked us to sign a bill for the coffee: $16 for two cups of sub-par hotel drip coffee!! If we had known, we certainly would've gone elsewhere (we assumed this would be free!).\n\nThe next morning, we returned to the restaurant for breakfast. The service was terrible and the food was McDonalds quality. Our breakfast sandwich was advertised to be served with \"aged cheddar cheese\"....it was sliced American cheese. Didn't even try to hide it. Our $16 \"fruit bowl\" was a small cup with small sliced fruit (not even fresh). The wait staff didn't know who was attending to which tables, and one of the servers spilled water all over me and didn't notice or apologize.\n\nWhen it was time to check out, we waited on line in the lobby for over thirty minutes. They were incredibly understaffed for a Sunday morning check out. The staff seemed oblivious to the 10-plus-person line. I booked my stay under a promotion and the discount wasn't applied. When I made my reservation, pool access was advertised. When we checked in, I found out the pool won't be open for another few days\/weeks.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving two stars vs one is because the bed is actually very comfortable.

We booked a sky chamber Empire view and the view from the room really was something special. \n\nCons\u2026.\nThe pool was closed. The soundproofing of the room was non-existent. Amazes me that a 5* hotel can be so noisy. The internal blinds are great at blocking out the light but they are on a loud pulley system and as soon as the people in the surrounding rooms open or close their blinds you\u2019re all wide awake. We were on the 25th floor and the street noise was just ridiculous. We were up at 4am on the first morning as there was a street cleaning machine working away below and we may as well have been right next to it. Music, traffic, sirens. Yes I expect NY to be noisy but equally I expect my 5* room to shield me from it just a bit. Add to that the beautiful but incredibly noisy Smeg fridge and there\u2019s no hope. We had to leave the fridge unplugged after the first night, and we couldn\u2019t use the air com for the same reason. It was pretty hot in there but it was just unusable due to the noise.\n\nThe coffee machine didn\u2019t work very well, it crushed both of the only two pods provided so bring plenty of your own pods, and buy milk, because you don\u2019t get that either. Also unusual not to be provided with any bottled water for the room. So bring that too!\n\nI emailed ahead and asked them if they could make a fuss of my son for his 13th birthday and they did send a piece of cake up but sadly fresh cream and four days early\u2026. They said they\u2019d get back to me with some restaurant details but never did. It\u2019s also pretty annoying that they give you access to a membership\/reward scheme (\u201cThe Know\u201d) which promises a free upgrade subject to availability and then you\u2019re told that you\u2019ve already paid for the room they would have upgraded you to\u2026. Would have been better not to mention it, surely?! \n\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really a 5*. I was happy with it, but only really because of the spectacular view. If you can cope with the noise then I\u2019d recommend an Empire room.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Probably worth a 4-5* rating if they had their act together.  \n\n2* because:  \n\n1.  Our room service order took close to 2hrs to arrive, and was cold and inedible, but no one picking up phones at room service or front desk, so we basically went to bed hungry and frustrated.  Granted, it was their opening night shebang, with Sir Richard presiding (see photos), but frankly that\u2019s no excuse since it wasn\u2019t unforeseen and they should\u2019ve planned better to ensure normal guests didn\u2019t have the experience we did;  \n\n2.  After checking out we received a $7.22 minibar charge afterwards, despite us consuming nothing from the minibar (who does that these days anyway, especially with tons of convenience stores steps away from the hotel where you can purchase the same things for a fraction?).  Again, this seemed to be a staffing \/ management issue since literally within minutes of us checking into our room there was a knock on the door from the \u201cminibar concierge\u201d wanting to check our minibar consumption.  Clearly confused since when I mentioned we\u2019d just checked in, he became flustered and scurried away.  Our bill was over $3K, so $7.22 is nothing but irritating to have to deal with.

The bar lacks soul and atmosphere, feels like you\u2019re sat in a corridor as if it was an after thought, skip it completely and sit on the roof deck which is pretty cool to be fair. \n\nThe lady\u2019s serving breakfast and on front desk do however deserve a shout out.

Say hello to Glen at the front desk-such a great brand ambassador. The hip no touch elevators, cool hallways and small but luxurious rooms will keep you happy. Delicious drinks and breakfast.

Room size is bigger than most in NYC. But surprisingly little storage in rooms for a promoted dressing room. \n\nHate to put this on blast, but the staff was wonderful except for one woman we talked to one the phone. We picked up the phone and pressed the \u201cYes\u201d button, but maybe we misinterpreted this. \n\nThe first night, after drinking the waters in the room, we called and asked for some water bottles, like some arrowhead whatever. First night they came no questions asked. Next night\u2026 woman on the phone says we should not have been given those waters, that they\u2019re for staff only, with a tone that made us feel as if we\u2019re stealing their only water rations. Ok we bought 5 $6 bottles on the TV (street prices mini bar?). Next day we asked for some water from housekeeping and I heard her get lit up about how this is ridiculous and we should not be attempting to steal the water and if we want them we know we have to buy them. Never been rejected water only for the option to be to buy $6 water. Mind you the water in the bathroom was cloudy, maybe new plumbing, aerator, I\u2019m sure it was fine, but very unappealing. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have written this if we were kindly directed to purchase them, but the tone, even overhearing her talk to housekeeping oof. Very uncomfy and unwelcoming. \n\nAnyways, beautiful hotel, but the water sitch left a poor taste in our mouth. Especially at a hotel that boasts a fun party vibe, didn\u2019t you expect us to be left a little dehydrated. ","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
