Upon check-in, we were warmly greeted by Jimm Kalinka at Guest Services. From that moment forward, Jimm made us feel as if we were the only guests at the hotel. My young daughters will never forget how special they were made to feel. It is very evident that Jimm, along with truly every other wonderful employee we had the pleasure of meeting during our stay (servers, housekeeping, room service, etc.) loves and takes pride in their job.\n\nI also would like to mention Medy at mail services who was such a delight when I had to handle a few business items during our stay.\n\nFinally, Mike, the amazing bell captain, learned it was one of our daughters birthdays. An incredibly kind gesture of treats and a birthday card for her ensued and we were all just so touched at such thoughtfulness.\n\nWe all know the choices are endless when it comes to hotel options in New York. I hope this review helps anyone considering The Towers to book with confidence. We sincerely look forward to our next visit, as soon as possible!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We made the arrangements through Amex and like we hoped, we received an upgrade (though I can't imagine going wrong with any of the rooms, as their smallest rooms are still big!), plus a credit for what would otherwise be a ridiculously expensive breakfast (I guess it comes with the territory).  The 'hotel within a hotel' concept suited us well, as the Towers has its own front desk staff (when we were there over a busy weekend, there were still always twice as many attendants in behind the desk than there were people to use them).  The views from our 46th story room were breathteaking, and the beds were ultra-comfortable.  Oh, I can't think of a better location for a hotel to serve as a home-base, whether to west or east, up or down.

First impressions were impressive as the room was huge and the layout worked perfectly for us.   We also had an amazing review and the room was nice and quiet.\n\nWe've travelled extensively using one travel agent and know that they always send us a welcome gift.  In addition, our travel agent was aware that it was my husband's birthday, so it was pretty much guaranteed that they would send us something.\n\nA few minutes after checking in, a staff member opened the room door with no notice to us.   This would happen THREE times during our stay of four days.  The staff member brought in a bucket with sparkling wine and a plate of chocolates and announced that this was compliments of the hotel.  We also received a card saying the same thing.\n\nI decided to wait until the next day (my husband's actual birthday) to see if we received anything from our travel agent and when we didn't, I send our travel agent an email to say thank you for the wine and chocolates.  I knew that even though the hotel said it was from them, I was pretty sure that it was from him, and our travel agent confirmed this.    A couple of hours later, we received an identical bottle of wine and chocolates, this time with a card from our travel agent and no apology from the hotel.\n\nWhat does it say about the hotel and the staff when they lied and cheated about the welcome gift?    In my opinion, this is a completely dishonourable way of doing business. If I didn't know my travel agent well, they would have gotten away with it and the rightful sender would never have received a thank you.\n\nI did mention this to the front desk when we were checking out and was told that someone would be in touch, but 3 days later, I still haven't hear anything.\n\nIn addition, for 3 days of our stay, one of the two passenger elevators was out of service so we had to use the freight elevator and the day we were checking, both passenger elevators were out of service.    I also noticed that we were rarely greeted by anyone at the front desk even when they weren't helping customers.

Our visit was for a meeting in Long Island but chose to stay at the Palace to attend Mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. The Palace was gorgeous!  It was tastefully and appropriately decorated for the holidays! We arrived from LAX to JFK on a red eye, rented a car and drove from JFK to the Manhattan.  It was well before our check-in but quickly found ourselves tired, cold and ready to hit the hay early.  Staff at the Palace greeted us warmly and gave us the utmost attention and refuge at the Towers within the Palace.  From the first stops with George at the drive-up, Rey in the Valet, Rebecca at the front desk, Henry at the bell desk, and concierge staff.  Everyone is well-experienced in hospitality and attentive. An early check-in was quickly arranged with an upgrade. Our initial room was upgraded to an exceptionally appointed room with delightful views of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and wonderful service by the housekeeping staff.  We spent the week without any questions or concerns about the City, with carefully described directions to our various stops, provided with taxis on call, reservations at Peter Lugars, and smiling faces at the breakfast cafe which even had The du Haman, the special tea from France\u2019s Le Palais du The. Thank you to Rebecca who welcomed us with open arms and saw us off with an appetite to return. Rebecca transformed the cold and wet big apple into a warm baked apple and made the comings and goings from the Palace like a second home. Come to the Palace to make the Big Apple seem like a cozy warm baked apple, we even met the General Manager of the Palace, Uwe Kunz, who gave that same hospitality vibe felt throughout.  Many many thanks!  We arrived tired and cold and left relaxed and warm with a desire to return.  We had such a wonderful experience, even our 19 year old attending UC Berkeley asked to return to the Palace!!  Highest Recommendation!","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel seemingly offers a quintessential, traditional NYC-hospitality experience, but I can assure you they fall short in all aspects. Our experience was extremely frustrating due to malfunctioning equipment in our room and the lack of communication and proactiveness of hotel employees. They disregarded our requests to not enter our room in our absence. Twice they didn't meet their own time estimate and once they couldn't provide one. \nThere are far better options in the city. Some rooms may have great views, but the rooms themselves are bad - closer to a motel than a five-star hotel. We stayed because of a complementary third night \u2014 I should have known better, I felt sorry all weekend I dragged my wife there. \n\nPros:\n- Elevated rooms - so nice views. However, ours was facing east, which is the side you want to avoid (nothing is interesting to look at).\n- the gym has all the equipment you need\n- Villard is a pleasant space and breakfast is really good (coffee and pastries, especially). It takes a while to be acknowledged and seated even when the room is half full (they appreciate it when you make reservations). Don\u2019t order cheese in your omelet; it will make it extremely bitter, and don\u2019t order the avocado toast as they used cheap sliced bread.\n- They honor the Amex platinum status seamlessly\n- I used Uber, and I noticed too late that their car service has one or more Mercedes Maybach.\n\nCons:\n- Our room wasn\u2019t ready when we arrived at 4:45pm. The front desk was unable to give us a timeline and simply invited us to sit in the lobby. They couldn\u2019t say for how long and invited us to check into another room for the time being. Then, 15 minutes later, the room was ready\u2014a weird, broken experience.\n- The hotel is outdated. Old tech in the room (DVD player but no Bluetooth speaker or smart TV). Aging, under-maintained interior decor. Lighting is inadequate. Malfunctioning sheers and shades. Loud A\/C. Slow elevators.\n- Unresponsive concierge via text. Don\u2019t read requests and don\u2019t communicate (management called and woke me up to warn me they needed to check a breaker in my room for a problem not in our room and then never showed up - I waited for them 2 hrs as I do not like to have surprise visits - I contacted them and they just told me the breaker wasn\u2019t in my room, after all, and they didn\u2019t want to call me and wake me up again).\n- When I called out malfunctions in our room, I specifically requested staff not to come to our in our absence. They ignored our request, which was extremely frustrating.\n- The lobby area is often crowded with guests standing and waiting with their luggage. It feels like a Hyatt Regency on the day of a large conference, but in a smaller lobby. \n- Some front desk and concierge staff are rude. Upon checking out, we were not asked how our stay was and were not greeted out. Surprising lack of manners. ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My family and I have been staying at this luxury hotel for almost 2 decades, and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s taken me this long to write the review that I should have written years ago.  We have stayed in a variety of their rooms in both the Palace and the Towers over the years\u2014 singles, doubles, kings, one and two bedroom suites, you name it, and every experience is better than the last.  From the warm and welcoming staff (who know us by name now and who have become like family to us), to the historic Villard Restaurant and perfect Pomme Palais coffee shop downstairs, the Lotte NY Palace has become our home away from home.  We live in Los Angeles and come to NY regularly and we wouldn\u2019t stay anywhere else.  There is a comfort level there that we haven\u2019t been able to duplicate and the hotel is also perfectly located to St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Central Park, and just a 20 minute walk to all of our favorite Broadway shows\/theaters (so no need to worry about getting a cab at rush hour)!  We have also celebrated numerous family occasions there over the years, from our daughter\u2019s NYU college graduation to birthdays, anniversaries, and weddings\u2014all such happy and cherished memories, thanks to this fabulous hotel.  But more than anything (including the beautifully appointed, ultra clean, and bright and comfortable rooms), it\u2019s the staff that keeps us coming back year after year\u2026the darling Isaac and Ray, our very favorite doormen; Jimm, Alfred, and the entire front desk staff--especially our beloved Ani, jack of all trades, who happily moves around from desk to desk, and welcomes us back literally with open arms every time we come; and the sweet and kind Miles Gomez, the front office manager who takes the best care of us and on our last visit so graciously upgraded us to the Penthouse Suite!  And the housekeeping and room service staff are all equally as kind and wonderful!

Although I would've given this hotel much higher rate if it was a 3-4 star hotel. However, this hotel is considered a true 5-star luxury hotel. \n\nMy rating category for luxury hotel  \n*Smooth check in\/ check out process\n*Customer Service\n*Quality of Rooms\n*Food\/ restaurant \n*Overall experience and attitude of staff and hotel. \n\nI recently had the opportunity to stay at The Lotte Hotel with high expectations, given its reputation as a five-star establishment. Unfortunately, my experience was far from the luxury and service I had anticipated. From the moment I walked, it was clear that this visit was going to be different.\n\n1) Check in process: Check in process was notably lacking in efficiency and hospitality. Long wait times and an indifferent attitude from staff left me wondering if I had walked into the wrong place. (There was one person working on the desk with numerous people waiting for a check- in.) Smooth Check- in is a fundamental part of positive hotel experience and it was disheartening to see it falter so early on. The staff rushed the check in and did not go over all the benefits of \u201cfine hotel\u201d instead gave me a card that had a list.\n2) When I inquired about room upgrade the answer by staff was \u201cwe are completely sold out of bigger rooms. We are extremely popular, and we \n are completely sold out to September.\u201d\nAlthough I understood that the room upgrade was only when available, I did not expect this type of response from a 5-star Hotel to their guest. \n3) My luggage was switched and was delivered to a different room. \n4) Requested a rollaway bed, fridge and some extra amenities since I did not get the upgrade. (This was requested around 3PM)\nWe left the hotel came back around 9PM expecting a full set up in the room. Unfortunately, nothing was set up upon our return. \n\n*View of the room was spectacular; however, rooms were outdated, and we were never provided with turndown service. \nManager did call us and apologized. She tried her best to improve the situation and surprised my kids the next day with some goodies, but unfortunately the next morning it just spiraled once again.\n\n5) We waited close to 30 minutes for breakfast next morning. (The staff during check in should\u2019ve told us to make reservation for the breakfast since our benefits included breakfast for two) Breakfast was rushed and waiters were overwhelmed. They had forgotten about our table, and I had to call a different waiter to make a simple drink order after being seated over 10 minutes. \n6) I tried to speak to the manager in person unfortunately I waited for the manager for 20 minutes and he never showed up.  At this point I felt unheard and undervalued as a guest, and just gave up trying to improve the situation and just walked away. \n\nThe hotel seemed way too busy and chaotic to be considered a 5-star hotel.  Although The Towers have a separate entrance, the chaotic and craziness of the hotel carries into the entrance. \nI believe that every guest deserves to feel valued and respected during their stay, regardless of the circumstances. Unfortunately, my experience at Lotte Hotel did not reflect these principles. \n\nIn conclusion, my stay at The Towers at Lotte Palace fell far short of the five-star experience I had hoped for. I cannot in good conscience recommend this hotel to others until the service and attention to detail improve significantly.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You can tell they love being there. \n\nThe rooms are spacious, especially for NYC, and if you can get a view of Fifth Avenue, you are in great shape. \n\nI always like staying on higher floors, for a more expansive view of the city - especially at night - but really, the hotel does not seem to have a bad view (or I have gotten lucky with my stays!). \n\nIf you need some extra help with what to do while you are in NYC, stop at the concierge desk - they spend so much time helping make sure you have options - and they can help you get reservations or pre-buy tickets. Ani is so sweet and kind. And always gives an extra smile to my son. Isabella and Kal are terrific too! They know the City inside and out and have never led me astray. And they take the time to make sure you know what you need to. If you need something - go see one of them!\n\nThe food is terrific at the hotel and there are options for even the pickiest of eaters. \n\nThe bell staff is super fast and helpful. \n\nYou are walking distance to Rockefeller Center - a huge plus at the holidays! - and always close to shopping and transportation. \n\nI cannot recommend this hotel enough.

Auch wenn Forbes dem Towers 5 Sterne zugesteht, von uns gibt es nur gute 4 Sterne. Das Hotel ist mehr Business- als Luxusherberge. Der letzte Schliff fehlt aus unserer Sicht. \n\nDie \u00f6ffentlichen Bereiche sind so, wie man es von den \u00e4lteren Hotels kennt und erwartet. Etwas dunkel gehalten, aber sehr gut gepflegt, ob Halle, Empfang oder Flure. Das Restaurant, der Goldroom ist extrem dunkel, was besonders beim Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck nicht so recht Wohlf\u00fchlatmosph\u00e4re aufkommen l\u00e4sst.\n\nDie Zimmer der einfachen Kategorie sind einfach mit wenig Mobiliar, aber zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig eingerichtet. Dazu wirken sie nicht mehr ganz so frisch. Die Suiten, wir erhielten ein Upgrade, sind dagegen nat\u00fcrlich besser und komfortabler - aber k\u00f6nnten auch eine Auffrischung und ein bisschen Deko gebrauchen. Die Bad war der 5 Sterne Kategorie entsprechend, mit abgetrennter Dusche, Badewanne und einem in den USA eher seltenen Bidet. \u00dcber die Badeartikel von Molton Brown haben uns nat\u00fcrlich \u00fcberzeugt. Hervorzuheben, der Blick auf Die Stadt vom Zimmer aus.\n\nDas im Goldroom Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck war in Ordnung, die daf\u00fcr aufgerufenen Preise, sofern das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck nicht inklusive ist, jedoch nicht. 2 Personen 150,- USD ist schon eine Hausnummer f\u00fcr nichts au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches. \n\nDer Service im Hotel hat uns nicht \u00fcberzeugt. Insgesamt hatten wir bei einem 5-Sterne-Rating mehr erwartet. Der Service ist nicht zu vergleichen mit dem Service, etwa im St. Regis, dem Peninsula oder dem Pierre. Hervorzuheben nur die Bell-Mannschaft und die Reinigungsfee unserer Etage.\n\nDas Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis stimmt in diesem Hotel aus unserer Sicht nicht. Mit rund 800,- Euro pro Nacht ist das zwar nicht teurer als andere Luxushotels in der Stadt, allerdings bietet es auch weniger. Wer pers\u00f6nlichen Service und Individualit\u00e4t sucht, ist hier falsch. Im Lotte z\u00e4hlt das Gesch\u00e4ft. Aus diesem Grund w\u00fcrden wir dem Haus auch nur 4 sehr gute geben. F\u00fcr den 5 Stern reicht es aus unserer Sicht nicht. Auf Grund seiner Lage w\u00fcrden wir das Hotel aber durchaus empfehlen.\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Lotte New York Palace was recommended by our daughter-in-law and her sister, they stayed in late November 2022. We also had explored through Amex Travel Fine Hotels & Resorts, which we have used many times over the years.\nThe Lotte New York Palace had many outstanding employees - which we would like to mention:\nBellman-George, he met us and handled our baggage - Maurice, Lobby Customer Service Agent who helped us and directed us with our inquiries and gave us a great place close by for lunch, Kadir, waiter at Villard who helped several mornings at breakfast, Jose' the Gold Room bartender and Nicola' -gold Room waiter - both helped us several nights in the Gold Room and made our stay very pleasant and comfortable - with their stories and caring attention. Two gentlemen not on staff but enriched our stay was the Gift Shop owner with his daily help and Kevin Draper who provided the Mansion Tour.  Housekeeping was very helpful, attentive, and always close by and helpful.  The concierges were helpful in arranging our airport transportation and the car services provided were excellent.  Our trip was to see our granddaughter sing at Carnegie Hall & visit a few museums, a jeweler we use, and St Patrick's Cathedral.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":4702789,"title":"4.5...wish we could give 1\/2 star increments...not quite a 5","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-03-02","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We really enjoyed our stay at the Lotte Towers overall, but it's not quite on par with other 5-star properties. Close, but there's a few things that keep it from that top category...I'll let you be the judge.\n\nFirst the \"pros,\" since there were many! The category of room that we booked \n(executive suite, king tower) was very large by any standard, and particularly so by NYC standards. The pictures of the suite posted by the hotel itself are true to life. The furnishings are a tiny bit dated, but of high quality, tasteful and cohesive. The views from the 44th floor are incredible.  Our suite looked directly at the cathedral and beyond. \n\nThere is generous closet space. The towels are thick, the bedding is comfortable, and the Molton Brown toiletries were generously supplied and replaced as needed (in addition to the usual, we were provided with an eye gel and a \"lip saver\" gel, plus shaving kit, dental kit, vanity kit, etc.)  Water bottles were in the room and freely given each day.  The temperature of the room could be adjusted, and better yet, the windows can crack open for those who love fresh air even in February. \n\nThe location is good depending on your plans, of course.  It's about a 15-20 minute walk through well populated areas to the Broadway shows, but a few blocks away (so, quieter) from the craziness of Times Square. \n\nNow for the \"cons.\" The room is not as modern or as thoughtful as a 5-star property should be.  There are no usb ports by the bed. The bathroom has a huge tub but a small shower (although, the shower is strong and satisfying.) Also - pet peeve here - the shower has no shaving perch for the ladies, and the only shelf is one of those tiny wire corner toiletry holders that's just big enough to hold the tiny toiletry bottles, but not your razor. The toilet is not in its own compartment, and is not even in a discrete corner of the bathroom - it's directly adjacent to one of the sinks.  What this means is that whoever is using that sink is practically sitting on the toilet itself. \n\nThere is an oddly empty-looking cabinet\/minibar in the room that might have been meant to hold a coffeemaker, but none was supplied. Possibly you could ask for one, but should you have to in a 5-star property? There was a refrigerator in a cabinet in the room, but it had a big sign on it warning you not to store anything of your own in it. The sign advised that you could request a separate refrigerator if you wanted one, but again, who wants to do that and have an ugly refrigerator sitting openly in your room? Not quite a 5-star experience.\n\nThe Lotte Tower elevators are very, very small and there aren't enough of them.  From the 44th floor, we often had to let some elevators go as they were too crowded. And, there was usually a wait, so you would need to build that time into your itinerary.\n\nWe booked this room using our Amex through the Fine Hotels program, which grants free daily breakfast as well as late (4pm) checkout. (The program also grants a free room upgrade when available...for those Amex users who care about this feature, we were not granted an upgrade, which is rare but it does happen...that said, we were very satisfied with our category of room and an upgrade wasn't a big deal in this circumstance.)  I mention the Amex FHR program because the free breakfast means you will want to eat breakfast on the property every day.  And, this is a problem at the Lotte Towers. The breakfast restaurant, Villard, is lovely but way too small for a hotel of this size.  On Sunday, we were turned away because we did not have a reservation (we wanted an unplanned Sunday morning...not advisable at this property with such a tiny restaurant.) We were able to use our FHR breakfast credit for room service instead, but the 45m delivery estimate turned into over an hour (probably an elevator\/wait problem!) which kept us in the hotel on Sunday longer than we had hoped.\n\nFinally, despite alerting the hotel that we would be using our late checkout benefit, the cleaning staff attempted to come into our room to clean no fewer than three times that last day. Each time, we explained we would not be checking out for a few more hours, but then it happened again and again. We ended up leaving for the airport an hour earlier than planned, deciding that the airport lounge would be more restful than the pushiness of the cleaning staff.\n\nThese \"cons\" would not keep me from staying at the Lotte Towers again...the space alone is magnificent and the views from this category of room are just wonderful and well worth some of the \"cons\" mentioned...but I would be comparing it price-wise to other properties in NYC. If breakfast on site, at leisure and without preplanning, is an important aspect of the trip, I definitely would not stay at the Lotte Towers. If a modern room (i.e., with updated amenities such as bedside usb, large shower and separate toilet compartment) is a priority, also pass on this property.  All that said, a solid 4.5 from me.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had an amazing visit with a staff that went above and beyond. We were upgraded to the Towers. My daughter was greeted with a light up frown to wear that she wore all over NYC. The concierge called and got a reservation at a booked restaurant. Staff always greeted with a smile. I learned on the last day of our stay that I would need to travel into NYC again the following day for doctors appointments. I explained to staff Linny this was occurring and she spoke with the hotel manager. Miles who was beyond accommodating by offering myself and my mother the same rate in the exact same room!!!!! We checked in early as my appointment was an early afternoon. We did not expect our room to be ready but Linny again at the desk had us go directly to our room so we could relax a Dec hours before. Our  level is high as I will have to undergo a major surgery and this was beyond comforting. Upon checkout we met at the desk with Jimm. Upon learning I will have to book 2 nights 3 days after this check out due to surgery Jimm went above and beyond contacting hotel manager Miles and others to ensure we were in the same quiet area of the hotel at a reduced rate. We spoke for a long while and he was kind and compassionate and even texted us after we left that it was all arranged. I cried as we were treated with duck kindness, compassion and respect our two stays in 4 days. I knew I wanted to stay at the palace again as the nights sleep I had their were the best I have had in almost a month since learning my diagnosis. I know when we check in this weekend I will immediately be at ease and comfortable and will hopefully be able to sleep before my procedure. This is all because of the amazing staff who went above and beyond! The room itself is gorgeous, beyond clean and the softest linens ever! Especially loved the full size bath sheet and pillows! The view above St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral brought me a sense of calm I haven\u2019t  felt in weeks. \n\nThank you, thank you, thank you to the amazing staff especially Jimm, Miles, Linny and Alexandra.

I had come for 3 straight years prior to the pandemic and looked forward to each visit knowing it was going to be a great visit!  I had so looked forward to celebrating a birthday milestone at Lotte Palace in 2020 but I was forced to cancel my reservations due to the pandemic. This year I was determined to make the trip and I am so glad I did. \n\nMy friends had made arrangements to stay at a different hotel, but once you have experienced Lotte Palace, you just can't settle for anything less. It's not just the building, it's the people who make the experience great. Lotte Palace truly has a great team!\n\nI can always depend on Clara Law to be there to greet me with a warm smile when I arrive! If I desire anything to make my visit special, I know I can reach out to Clara and she will either handle it or reach out to the right person to ensure it is handled! That is very reassuring. On each visit I always look for a different room view or experience. On this visit I had a view that far exceeded my expectations! I had the opportunity to experience the corner suite and I absolutely loved it! I so appreciate Clara and Miles Gomez for assisting me with my room selection. They are truly an asset to the team.\n\nI always try to remember the names of all the people who assisted me and did so with such a pleasant demeanor. I like to ensure they know that I see them and I appreciate them. Gladys was such a joy to see each day. And she ensured I had everything I needed for the room daily. I believe it was Xue who provided housekeeping service on Sunday and she too was extremely helpful and pleasant. Yohanna, Norma, Christian, Diego, Gregory, Louis, Samir, and Gary assisted me with printouts, restaurant recommendations and other needs from the front desk or luggage assistance.\n\nAnd all the gentlemen at Villard were very accommodating. (I hope they forgive me for not recalling their names). I must say however, I do look forward to Melissa's return!!!\n\nAs usual, I just left, but I am already looking forward to my next visit!!! I plan to return very soon to make up for lost time!!!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Room was spacious by NY standards (foyer with coat closet, living room with sofa, table\/chairs\/tv console, large bedroom, walk-in closet, large bathroom with dual sinks, shower, independent tub. Style is very traditional and not particularly new or luxe feeling but still quite nice and clean.  View was lovely (windows are wide but not tall).  My biggest issues are that the Towers elevators are small, slow and always involve waiting and that the service at check in was terrible. We waited for 45 minutes to check in (only 1 person on duty at 5:30pm), the concierge refused to help anyone waiting and just stood around rolling his eyes at frustrated guests, there were 2 families that had been waiting all day for their rooms (even after the 4pm check in time), one family had checked in only to find someone else in their assigned room.  The mood in the lobby for the towers was angry and unpleasant.  I have no idea what the regular part of the hotel is like, but they certainly have larger elevator banks and a lot more people on duty at check in.  The breakfast is lovely but pricey, even for NY. One day my breakfast took forever (the other people in our party were done when mine arrived) and then arrived burned to the point of being inedible and they consequently comp'd my meal (and replaced the burned breakfast). But at the price they charge, those kinds of things shouldn't happen in the first place.  Overall, this is not even close to being the creme de la creme of 5 star hotels in NY and definitely not the best we've stayed in (see my other reviews), but it has going for it a great location and spacious rooms.  It was awfully expensive for what it was and I am not likely to go back.  On a funny note, I stayed here the first time 20 years ago in the same room and the rate was 5 times was it was then.

We needed a suite to babysit our grandkids while my son and daughter-in-law had a holiday work event in town, and despite it being high season in December in New York City, Miles and Michael were able to come up with a Towers suite without a minimum stay as we were only there for Saturday night.  Early check-in has always been a priority for us as the baby needs her naps, fortunately, the guest at this suite the night before left early, so we were able to check in early which was a tremendous help.  In fact, Clara texted me at 7 am the day of arrival to let me the room was ready.  This is truly above and beyond her duties as her workday starts at 9 am!  When we arrived, Michael was expecting us and readily checked us in.  I had also arranged with Clara ahead of time for a refrigerator for the milk, a crib, a roll-away, coffee machine, and they were all delivered promptly.  She even gave us chocolates as a welcome gift.  I would like to give a special shout-out to Kan in Housekeeping, he brought the crib and roll-away and returned with sheets and extra slippers, bottled water, a cute Lotte bear for the kids, etc. and was most professional and courteous.  It was our first time to have the pleasure of meeting him, and I hope to see him again in future stays.  Clara took great care of us too while there, she gave me advice for a luncheon place that opened since our last visit, and brought paper plates, cups etc. on her own, which shows her level of attentiveness.\nThe courtyard is finally open with their iconic Christmas tree, and the holiday decorations throughout the hotel were festive and beautiful.  We even had pictures taken with the Rockettes at the hotel the morning we arrived.

The front desk said it was, BUT then they put the manager, Miles, on the phone to discuss approximate arrival time so he can have something special ready.\n\nI guess they knew we were traveling with kids because they had teddy bears and candy canes ready at checkin. My key card wasn\u2019t working on my door and after a couple tries to reset, Miles personally came up to diagnose the problem. He checked in on us several times during our stay and knew our party.\n\nThe service staff was also incredible from housekeeping to room service to the bellman to the other hosts. Very attentive and efficient - especially given the very busy time of year.\n\nThe hotel also had a special Santa letter program whereby if they kids dropped a letter into the lobby mailbox, and they received a special note and gift back from Santa. Special events were planned during our stay including a visit from the rockettes. Overall, the Towers was a big part of giving 5 young children a magical stay in the city. Location is also central for all the touristy destinations.\n\nAs a side note - I normally stay at the regular part of the palace for work, which is a different, more professional experience. Nonetheless, location is central, rooms are very large and beds are comfortable.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Prior to arriving I was given assistance booking cars, dinners, and a rooftop bar by one of the managers, Miles Gomez, and Ani, at the concierge desk. \n\nWe arrived Thursday, Sept 1st to the assistant manager, Mr. Miles Gomez, meeting us at the door and greeting me by name!  He brought us to check in where we were treated to a few fun gifts and then helped us to our Corner suite on the 47th floor.  \n\nThe room and the views were STUNNING!  The living room furniture looked fresh with a very large couch that also had 2 single pull out beds. The bathroom was very large with 2 sinks and a nice bag of individually boxed toiletries with a tub and separate shower.  The king bedroom is HUGE with a table & chairs as well as a dresser, large closet with 2 plush robes and slippers.  Every inch of the suite was spotless.  Our housekeeper made the suite look like we were just walking in every single day - and that was difficult with 5 ladies spread out in bathrooms\/bedrooms.\n\nThe living space also included a small kitchen area with a sink, wine cooler, and an amazing serving area where we were able to set up for a party.  We had wine\/alcohol delivered and the staff brought it to the room for us.  We used Charcuterie NYC for the board pictured here, and they delivered!  Highly recommend them.\n\nEvery time we walked into the lobby, the doormen sang happy birthday to me or yelled out there's the birthday girl.  Miles found us every day and asked how he could help or checked to see if we needed anything.   Every person on our trip said they have never been treated so well in a hotel.

We had a fantastic experience last November when our family gathered to celebrate my 70th birthday, and were looking forward to another celebration in style.  \n\nHowever, perhaps because of the ease of covid protocols in NYC, the hotel was at full capacity, and the early check-in that Clara had arranged for us did not happen.  In fact, we ultimately checked-in later than the regular check-in time.  We had needed the early check-in because our Acela train arrived in the morning, and we badly needed a room to rest after lunch.  Clara took great care of us during the two plus hours wait, by bringing us bottled water, making sure we had a comfortable space in the hotel lobby to rest, and kept us posted on progress.  Eventually she brought us the room keys and saw to it that our luggage was delivered promptly.  We had reserved a towers corner suite with pantry as before, and again it did not disappoint.    \n\nWe had also reserved another suite and a regular room in the palace side for our grown children who were arriving the next day.  Clara and Michael had worked hard before our arrival to upgrade these rooms to the towers side, with the promise of a connecting room to our towers corner suite.  However, even though I had intended for our very young grandchildren to come for the day and nap in the connecting room, again to our disappointment the early check-in did not come through.  Clara tried her best to rush things along, but apparently the previous guests did not check out at the appointed time and were nowhere to be found.  However, kudos to Clara and Miles who then upgraded the suite to another corner suite just like mine two floors down, which was available sooner.  Clara did the leg work and brought the keys to us.  My son and daughter-in-law were so impressed that they decided to stay in to enjoy the spacious and beautiful suite.  Eventually the rooms situation was ironed out, and we finally had the connecting room at 3:30 pm, which defeated the purpose of having booked this room.  If it were not for the collective effort of Clara, Michael and Miles, I would have canceled this room.  \n\nDespite the disastrous situation which was a major inconvenience to our family of ten, Clara made sure we had everything we needed.  The birthday cake I ordered through her was delicious and beautiful.  She brought us a bottle of wine and snack for afternoon tea, compliments of the hotel, and a teddy bear for the kids.   As always, she was a pleasure to work with, and attentive to our every need.  Thanks to Clara, Michael and Miles, we ended up having a wonderful birthday celebration.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Apartment rentals in NYC have been disappointing and we value having a kitchen - my search for top hotels with rooms that have kitchens yielded this hotel and one other and we went for this one because it is a suite.  First of all the reservationist was excellent, confirming details of the room and getting us a good rate.  She warned us that the suite kitchen might not be stocked on arrival due to Covid.  The hotel is in a great location at Madison and 50th with an entrance on 51st as well - walkable to Broadway and Central Park and many other great parts of the city - easy access to subway and buses.  On arrival, there was indeed confusion around stocking the kitchen with equipment, dishes, etc - it was bare and getting that sorted was a bit of a hassle.  Charlotte in customer experience was essential in turning the tide and by the next morning, we had met Samir, the Maitre d\u2019Etage and then later his colleague Maitre d\u2019Etage Ahmed.  They are both spectacular in terms of attention and follow-up - the kitchen has all we need - the suite is spacious with a beautiful view.  The hotel manager Martin did a great job in making up for the first day issues.  The hotel gym is excellent as is the bar. Service is great - the Maitre d\u2019Etage even received our grocery order and put the groceries away.  Highly recommend!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I arrived to the hotel at 8:30 am and was able to check into my room which was nice.  The room was large, even by New York standards.  I had a great view from the 53rd floor down on the cathedral.  I would say overall the room and bathroom are a little tired and run down.  I wasn\u2019t searching for things to be picky about but the paint you can tell is chipping a bit.  The bathroom needs a make over.  The room was very clean though and overall in good condition.  The room was $1000 a night so when you are paying that much you notice little things.  \n\nA couple downsides to my stay.  One of the two tower elevators was having mechanical issues while I was there so getting an elevator at times took a while.  Not a huge deal.  The most frustrating thing for me was after I get to the room, about 30 mins later the door to my room swings open and a maintenance worker walks right in.  He immediately sees me and stops, apologizing that he had no idea the room was occupied.  I say it\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry, I was fully dressed so no issues.  After he leaves, about 10 mins later, another maintenance worker does the same exact thing.  Waltzes right in using his master key.  Again, apologizes and leaves.  At this point I call downstairs and ask the front desk to handle this which I am told they will do.  Yet, 10 mins passes and a third maintenance worker again lets himself into my room while I am sitting there.  That\u2019s 3 maintenance men who walked into my room with their keys unannounced while I was inside.  I was pretty annoyed at this point because I had already called down.  So I called again.  The person I spoke to was apologetic and I explained that as a single female traveler, it\u2019s pretty alarming to have multiple men enter your room.  I was also about to leave for the day so I wanted to make sure my things were secure.  I went down to the lobby and the staff apologized and said they would speak to maintenance which was fine, but just confusing like why now 45 mins after the first person had entered was this conversion just happening with maintenance and not after the first call down? \n\nThat little experience tainted my stay for me so while others may have had great experiences I just feel like for $1000 I\u2019ll probably go elsewhere next time I\u2019m in New York.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

But all is not lost, as she immediately offered her help to make sure we would be well taken care of in her absence.  She called the day before our arrival to say she had arranged with Miles and Michael (a big thank you to them!) for a room upgrade with early check-in, which turned out to be tremendously helpful.  Sure enough, the next morning, Michael was expecting us and was there to greet us personally when we checked in.  He was friendly and efficient, and the entire process was fast and easy.  He had a beautiful and spotless room on a high floor with a spectacular view of St Patrick waiting for us.  I was not expecting that the amazing service the staff showed during our first day would preceed us this time, and I appreciate the time and effort they made to prepare for our arrival.

A wall of windows offered breathtaking views of the cathedral and the ice rink and the room was spotless.  A large living room with dining table and desk, mood lighting, remote control shades, nice artwork and attractive furnishings all added to the comfort.  The toiletries and towels were luxurious and the large closet and second bathroom was an added bonus.  We couldn\u2019t have been happier with the room for our several night stay.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of our experience didn\u2019t live up to the room.  From the start, we were met with construction scaffolding instead of the stunning Christmas tree and holiday festivities described. The bellman tried three times to lead us away from the Towers check-in where we waited 15 minutes to be assisted (with only one person in front of me), only to be told our room wasn\u2019t ready. My husband asked the female concierge to break a bill for gratuities for the bellmen and was rudely turned away.  They held our luggage, but when we returned later, one bag was missing. (It was found and brought to the room along with a bag containing a mini bottle of wine and candy.)   \n\nThere was no turn down service, (which was fine) but we returned late to discover there was no bedding on the sofa bed. We ordered room service breakfast, which took an hour and a half and was cold and had obviously been sitting for a while.  A waiter knocked to take away our dishes and cart as he said they were short, but we were allowed to keep our champagne and coffee since we hadn\u2019t finished them yet. We left for the day and did not receive housekeeping service - beds unmade, no clean towels, and breakfast dishes were still on the table when we returned that night - even though we had turned on our request for service light. When we asked for taxis at the door, we were told several times to walk to the intersection - the bellman said cabs don\u2019t like to turn down the side street due to bus lane restrictions. Towers personnel didn\u2019t even bother to look up from their computers to say hello as we passed by several times a day. When you\u2019re paying over $1000. per night for a room in a luxury hotel that boasts about unsurpassed service, these shortfalls felt unacceptable.  Perhaps it was because we had just come from the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, DC, where we experienced exceptional service and couldn\u2019t help but compare.\n\nWe were patient and didn\u2019t complain - writing it off to being short-staffed and Covid-related.  We still tipped generously, knowing this has been a rough couple of years for the service industry.  But I returned home to see stellar staff reviews from this same holiday period, so I\u2019m baffled as to our frustrating treatment. This was supposed to be a special Christmas\/Anniversary trip, but combined with our Broadway shows being cancelled due to the Covid surge, was disappointing all around. Again, great room and location, but doubt we would return due to the service.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I was very excited as the reviews are all stellar. I hate to say I was very disappointed. \n\nWhen I arrived I was disappointed to find the \u201cvalet\u201d was actually a public garage. I was late for a meeting and the hotel was no help. The line for the valet was out the door of the garage, spilling onto the street. I finally got the bellman to acknowledge me, and asked if I could run in, check in, and get back to my car to drive instead of walk the short distance because the valet was going to take far too long. The bellman rolled his eyes and told me \u201cyou have 5 minutes\u201d. I rushed inside to find a line, and only one employee at the front desk. Needless to say, I ran out of time, and had to leave the hotel before I was able to check in as I was going to miss my meeting. \n\nI returned hours later, and was able to check in. When I went up to my room, I found the  room to be extremely dated. The room service menu, and the hotel restaurant menu, offered no vegan or gluten free options. The cable for the TV was actually fed through a coax cable. There was no way to utilize any modern streaming services. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable, I could feel the springs, and I felt like I was laying on too of a large drum. The shower was very outdated, and there was mold on the ceiling of the shower stall. The whole room felt like I had stepped into a time warp and landed in 1980. \n\nThe whole experience was awful. I was in the city to celebrate my 40th birthday, and spend some time at my company\u2019s offices. The time in New York was wonderful, and the view from the room was fantastic, but the overall hotel experience was subpar at best.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We were helped by Jimm at check in, and he made sure that we had all of our questions answered and also gave us wonderful recommendations for new and fun things to do in the city. Having someone so nice and helpful definitely makes a huge difference in my mind.

Oh yes,  there was  a complete and readily available by txt \"valet\" who was a real person who responded promptly to your questions and needs.

First the good stuff- fab location,  short walk to most anywhere, great staff, friendly, quick, attentive.  Beautiful place, I mean WOW!  We staying in Executive suite (a king bedroom, a living room, HUGE bathroom with tub and marble shower, bidet, double sinks, premium Molton Brown toiletries. Two closets, safe, mini fridge. TVs in each room. Oh yeah, the view!  We were on 34th floor and the view was all of st Patrick\u2019s cathedral.  Just stunning!  Now the problems.  There is only one working elevator (max limit 4 people) for the towers.  Tons of elevators for The Palace guests.  So expect to wait\u2026a lot.  None of the bars or restaurants are reopened yet.  And my only other complaint is the front entrance, the one so heavily featured on Gossip Girl, is closed.  No idea why but disappointing, as everyone wants to see that area for a few selfies, maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s closed?  MLB teams stay here so keep your eyes open for sightings.  The Chamber Magic show, in the hotel is a must see.  Great show!  Overall I would recommend this hotel, but they really need to expedite the elevator situation.  Lots of guests were a bit ticked off.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

There was a large desk in the bedroom for a laptop, with plenty of plugs (although no USB plug outlets in the room), and a large TV in the bedroom easily viewed from bed and the work desk.  The lighting is coordinated and controlled across the suite, with settings from full on to full off, relaxed, and evening light and it works beautifully to create the mood.  The bed was comfy with high quality linens and pillows.  There were also plush robes available, large closets, and a large in-room safe.\n\nTwo bathrooms in the suite...one half bath for guests, and a very large and spacious master bath with toilet, bidet, deep bathtub (not very comfortable however if you're over 6 feet tall), and a large shower with wonderful pressure.  The towels were a little thin I thought, and could be refreshed.  Plenty of room for toiletries and two sinks and all done in black marble.  High quality Molton Brown spa products.\n\nThe room also included a full kitchen with refrigerator, range, sink and dishwasher although because of COVID there were no dishes or glassware to be found.\n\nThe suite was kept spotlessly clean, and there is a fine cafe on the premises for pastry and morning coffee.\n\nAll in all this was a terrific way to be in midtown Manhattan.

I normally don't write reviews but I felt the Lotte Towers was an exception.  I surprised my partner with a surprise trip to NY and proposal.  I wanted a hotel that was going to compliment our stay but also be memorable for the occasion.  After great search I came across the Towers at the Lotte, the hotel does not come up on every hotel search site but I am glad I came across it on Tripadvisor. The location is spot on, the hotel is beautiful & enchanting, the hospitality is warm & inviting and; the service is impeccable.  The hotel met my pre arrival requests without any hassle & issue and organised for a Nespresso coffee machine to be in our room when we arrived.  We stayed on the 47th floor looking over the cathedral and the spectacular NY skyline.  The inroom automation system was the best I have used and I compliment the hotel for keeping up with the times.  Special mention to their staff as they were all amazing but in particular Ani and Rene in concierge for their great knowledge of NY and giving us great advice which allowed us to see NY away from the crowds.  Jose at the front for his warm and kind hospitality every day we saw him and Rafik in the lobby lounge for being very accommodating and providing exceptional customer service. If you are travelling to NY and want to spoil yourself do yourself a favour and stay at the Towers at the Lotte.  ","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

When I was searching for a hotel\u00a0I wanted to stay in a good hotel in a good location but not in Times Square.\u00a0I was also travelling with someone who suffered with anxiety and I needed to make sure all our needs were catered for.\u00a0\n\nAfter searching for suitable hotels, I narrowed my selection down to a handful of hotels. I then read the reviews for each one. I wanted a hotel just outside Times Square so not to be on top of the noise and busy streets, but I still wanted to be quite central to everything.\u00a0\n\nThe hotel that had the best reviews was Lotte New York Palace Hotel. I don\u2019t think there was one bad review. I then contacted the hotel to explain my needs and was put in touch with Bella Estrella, The Hotel Guest Experience Coordinator.\u00a0I can\u2019t praise this woman enough. She assured me that our needs would be met and they were. We communicated regularly and my questions were answered promptly and reassuringly. Bella kept me up to date for when she was available and if she wasn\u2019t, she let me know who was this being Renee M Carbone, Executive Officer Manager, and Daniel on the front desk, who helped us with directions and subway.\u00a0\n\nOn arrival at the Hotel, we was greeted by friendly, approachable and professional staff and was shown to our room. Our room being in The Towers.\u00a0I don\u2019t know where to start with how amazing The Towers are. There is a separate entrance with its own front desk and concierge.\u00a0\n\nOur room was on the\u00a044th floor overlooking St\u00a0Patrick\u2019s Church and The Rockefeller Center where the world\u2019s most famous Christmas Tree is.\u00a0\n\nI liked the idea of the rooms having black out blinds, but I never used them, as I was 44 floors up, the noise of the busy streets below wasn\u2019t a concern and I couldn\u2019t stop admiring the view from the window. \u00a0I had a good nights sleep every night. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are spotlessly clean.\u00a0\n\nThe room has a door bell and a portable control panel which controls the lights, room temperature and window blinds. The bathroom has a large shower and a vanity area with complimentary Molton Brown products. \u00a0\n\nThe location of the hotel is excellent with not being in the middle of a very busy Times Square but still accessible to all other locations. On leaving the hotel within a couple of minutes you arrive at SAKS, Fifth Avenue, and the main entrance to St Patrick\u2019s Church. From Fifth Avenue, Central Park is a 5 minute walk, passing all the luxury shops, Trump Tower, Tiffanys and SJP. Also from Fifth Avenue, within minutes you arrive at The Rockefeller Center. The\u00a0Rockefeller Center has a lot to offer, not just the amazing Christmas Tree, but the NBC Studios, Top Of The Rock, Rainbow Rooms, Bar Sixty Five, Radio City Music Hall and the Rockettes, Ice Skating, access to the Subway and a wide selection of shops, dining areas and coffee shops.\u00a0\n\nThe Lotte Hotel offers a fabulous room service.

Coffee and tea refills take 45 mins to arrive; the right number of cups \/ towels \/ glasses is never provided despite our repeat reminder of there being 4 room guests; there is supposedly complimentary Mercedes or Mayback rides but funnily there are either no drivers after 8pm or worse, no service on a Tuesday (whatever that means, since nothing is mentioned in the guest services brochure). We told the housekeeping staff that we will be checking out at 1pm on our last day and they came around at 1:05pm and started complaining because we asked for 5 mins more to wheel our luggage out, literally chasing us to leave. The final shock was getting slapped with a bill of $120+ for coffee refills and teabags (2 coffee satchets and 4 teabags to be exact) over 4 days, although no pricing was ever provided, no bill was ever signed nor an itemized invoice ever provided, even at check-out. I didn't want to quibble over the cost or the charge, but rest assured that we will never stay again at this hotel.

The restaurants, museums, and Broadway, and of course quality family time, all of which were wonderful, may have been less memorable had it not been for the excellent accommodations and service at the Palace Towers.  After all, it's your home away from home for a few days.  Be that as it may, I want to single out two individuals, who by any measure would be an asset to any organization. At the front desk - Anna Marie.  Courteous, friendly, professional and full attention to the customer before her.  She was delightful despite being in the midst of a sea of humanity.  People everywhere.  House keeping - a Palace veteran, Afredita.\nSeldom, if ever, have we experienced the attention to detail and guest needs shown by Afredita.  Kudos to management for retaining staff who represent your brand at such a high level.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I arrived early morning and was warmly greeted and welcomed back by Ray who seems to never forget a name! I knew the room would likely not be ready due to my early morning arrival, but Papa was there to take care of the luggage and delivered it promptly. Melody and Jim worked to ensure we each had just the view we were wanting and Clara Law always takes care of every little detail that makes the stay so special! Each time I return I look for a different view or experience because I never want this trip to become routine. This time Clara showed me the corner suite - which I loved!  I have already booked the room for my next visit! There are many fabulous hotels in NYC, but it is the staff and level of service that make the difference here. Yohanna, Samir, Lorena, Ani - these are just a few of the names I recall and want to also recognize. No matter what I needed as I came by the desk, I was always made to feel that it was their pleasure to be of service. They represent your team so well!!!\n\nHousekeeping always does an outstanding job of working around my schedule.

Our trip was solely to enjoy some Christmas shopping and the atmosphere in NYC so the hotel was perfect for that.  Location is ideal to all the sights and shopping in Midtown.  Hotel was almost 5 stars.  The reason it wasn't?  Housekeeping was sloppy, little touches you expect in a 5 star hotel were just not quite there. I don't expect to get a letter under my door at 8:15 that housekeeping attempted to clean and if I want a clean, I have to call down...  at 4pm yes, but not at 8:15 in the morning! Sat in the lounge and watched a server see us sit down, but clearly we were not \"his\" table.  He let us wait 15 minutes before the proper server was able to attend to us.  That just isn't 5 star service.If you are paying over $1000 a night you expect everything to be \"just so\" We stayed at the Four Seasons in September and the Palace just didn't match Four Seasons service and attention to detail.  It was good - just not perfect.  Hotel rooms are quite tired - need a refresh for sure.  The decor was delightful, and the doormen were great as well.  ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On this visit, I was upgraded from a king room to a stunning and spacious king suite. Everything thing about this room was perfect! Housekeeping was excellent, as was room service, and bellman assistance. Complimentary daily shoe shine service, robes, slippers, and great bathroom products are also wonderful perks. During my stay, I needed some advice about things going on in the city.

The standout above all, and the person who made our trip superb was the concierge, Kal Naim. Kal made a daily effort to coordinate shows with nearby theaters and his recommendations were always spot-on. He made sure we knew how to get where we were going and when necessary secured transportation. Kal took a personal interest in seeing we thoroughly enjoyed NYC in the busy holiday season.\n\nThe only negative comment we have about the hotel is the Crestron electrical system. It failed to work a couple of times. On one instance we had to have the hotel electrician in our room at 1AM just so we could get the lights to turn off. On another instance, our room was not cleaned. When I questioned one of the maids, she said she could not enter the room because the Crestron \"Do not disturb\" light was on. She was correct, because the Crestron system had an indistinguishable button on the light switch that got turned on with the lights by mistake. \nWhen the system did work, it was not intuitive and not at all user friendly.

We also enjoyed breakfast in the Villard Room and the old world opulence of the lobby and public areas takes one back to another era. Location is excellent. Concierge and front desk staff on the Towers side are  efficient. As we saw the long check out lines for the main hotel we made a note to return to the Towers!!

The room amenities, including high speed internet, well stocked and maintained bar and water service as well as all of the services you would expect from an extremely high end hotel are here and meet the highest standards.  The Palace also has several beautifully appointed lounges, bars and restaurants that harken back to the tradition of lavish but classic styling that can only be found in the best New York City establishments.  The food, including room service, is excellent, at least as good as you would expect from any excellent New York restaurant.  But the real story behind my commitment to the Lotte Palace the only hotel  is the people who make everything perfect for every guest of the hotel.\nFrom the moment that you check in and meet with Susan or Roxanna at the front desk, it becomes immediately apparent that it is their mission to make sure that your experience at the hotel is as perfect as can be from your very first encounter.  Stepping over to the concierge desk, Diego and Ani ensure that you are confident that there is nothing that they cannot accomplish for you and that they make it their mission to make your stay, not only at the hotel, but in New York City and beyond, the best experience possible.  These are not just hollow platitudes.  It is obvious from the baristas at Pomme to the room service and housekeepers that the people that \"work\" at the Palace love what they do, and that comes through in their commitment to guests of the hotel.  This isn't conjecture; I had the opportunity to speak with many of the staff about their passion for the hotel and their positions, including a barista who did not want to move on to a potentially \"better\" job because she loves the people she works with and the guests that she encounters every day. Management and guest services must be at the top of their games because it shows with every encounter.\nIt is trite to say that if you do what you love, you will never work a day in your life.  I don't know how true that maxim is, but the commitment of the Palace employees to their daily routine makes for an unparalleled stay for the guests of the hotel.  It is hard to appreciate how much of a difference the consideration and kindness of the people around you while you are traveling makes to success and enjoyment of your day, until you experience it.  If you are going to stay in luxury, be sure it is elevated by the people who go the extra mile to make your visit that much better.  \nLastly, the location is hard to beat.  Perfect for getting to business meetings, blocks from Rockefeller Center and the best shopping steps away.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We have chosen the Towers over the years because it is a part of the American Express Platinum program and we receive amenities for staying (for example, early check-in, late check-out, spa credit, room upgrade, etc.). On this visit, in late October 2019, the hotel was visibly run-down. Our room had thin sheets and bedding, the carpeting was worn and even the bathrobes were frayed. The spa was CLOSED for renovation despite being given an Am Ex amenity for $100 for use in the spa. Many phone calls later and we were able to confirm a spa service to be given in a vacant guest room. It was awkward and not relaxing. Our toilet ran continuously the first night and engineering had to come to repair it the next day. One elevator did not work well and required hitting the button multiple times until it buzzed and then worked. The staff was not as professional and attentive as usual. Our room service breakfast of bagels and LOX was not cleared for an entire day. We returned to our room at 4 pm and the breakfast was still sitting on the table despite the room being made up by housekeeping. The entire room smelled like fish. This hotel did not feel like a \"Fine Hotel\"  that is a part of the Am Ex program. The nightly price to stay in the \"Towers\" did not feel like a worthwhile expense.

This was a special occasion trip to mark a 25th wedding anniversary, a 21st birthday and an 18th birthday. \n\nBooked directly with the hotel via their website.  \n\nShortly before the trip we received an introductory email from the guest services team introducing the hotel and its services.  We used them to book a private transfer both from and to JFK and also to book a number of restaurants for meals.  A particular mention has to go to Diego on the concierge team who provided a number of recommendations and then booked everything for us.\n\nOn arrival the check in was swift as the Towers check in is separate from the main Palace and we were taken to our room on the 50th floor.  On entering the room 5005 the view across the east of Manhattan was breath taking.  Room was fully equipped as you would expect for a 5 star hotel, clean and spacious.\n\nOn all but one morning we ate breakfast in the Villard Restaurant and the breakfasts were great.  One slight issue was the warmth of the food on one morning, which was due to the stone cold plates it was served on.  It is clear the restaurant is used for many early morning business meetings and the pace is fast with lots of energy.  The American breakfast option was good, but also tried the pancakes and the Eggs Benedict.\n\nWe only used the hotel as a base to get a good breakfast at the start of the day and then return in the evening.  We used the Gold bar once for a couple of cocktails and that we very relaxing.\n\nAll the restaurants Diego recommended were within walking distance and all were great.  Each with different character just as we had requested.\n\nThe hotel is located conveniently for the subway on 51st street\/Lexington and from there we could get anywhere we wanted to on our visit.\n\nValue wise, yes it was expensive, but this was a special trip and the hotel acknowledged this with an unexpected bottle of champagne and cake when we returned to our room one evening.  But overall, what really made it special was the staff.  Everyone was friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in what you had been doing or were going to do.  Even the porter who offered to take a photo of us outside with my daughters camera, only to find he had taken a cheeky selfie of himself as well when he handed the camera back.\n\nAll memories and you can\u2019t put a price on that.

We were in a Tower room which was pricey but worth it.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was wrong. Between construction noise, the worst \u2018suite\u2019 layout, and a terrible check out experience, I\u2019m disappointed. Read for more detail, but if you\u2019re looking for best in class experience, look elsewhere.\n\nMy family and I booked a suite at the Towers for my sister\u2019s wedding. It came with a big price tag, even with her room block rate, but I was willing to pay for convenience. \n\nWe arrived before check in time with a sleeping baby and a tired toddler. The first thing the desk person told me curtly was \u2018nothing\u2019s ready\u2019. Okay, I understand. My parents were already checked in, so we went up to let the kids nap in their room, but when we got up to the room, there was INSANELY LOUD construction, the baby woke up and toddler couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\nAn hour or so later, we were told our room was ready. When we went up to our room on a different floor, still with the construction noise, it was not at all what we booked. It had the silliest layout. I was told by the booking agent at the time of booking that I had an executive suite with two queen beds. I was told that it had a sliding door divider between the bedroom and a sitting area- as the \u2018executive\u2019 suites have on their website. I had a whole conversation with the booking agent going through the options of adjoining rooms or suites that would allow us to have a sitter in one room and sleeping toddlers in another. We even had a full discussion about how she didn\u2019t think that the crib wouldn\u2019t fit in the side with the beds, which I was fine with. \n\nInstead, we arrived to a long open room, with no divider and two queen beds at one end, which wouldn\u2019t work for the childcare I had set up. \n\nI ended up speaking to a manager who told me that he wouldn\u2019t really even consider the room we had a suite. Yeah, me neither!!! And I\u2019m playing a ridiculous amount for it- It was no where in the same neighborhood of niceness as my parent\u2019s room with the same rate. \n\nApparently, I booked a room class that doesn\u2019t exist. Or there are only two of them that fit that description at the hotel. The story kept changing. I\u2019m considering contesting a portion of the charge with my credit card- They should have this room type listed on their website - avoid the executive studio suites!!!\n\nThe manager told us that they had no other rooms that were either adjoining rooms or real suites. I would\u2019ve been fine with an executive suite with one king bed, because the divider is really what we needed, and it is hard to believe that those were checked in full, because I should've been among the first to check in.\n\nWe ended up putting a cot and a crib in the walk in closet. They gave us a hotel credit as an inconvenience fee, but I paid $$$$ for my kids to sleep in a closet.\n\nI asked to see if we could switch rooms the next day, but no one ever followed up with me. \n\nThen, on our final day, my sister hosted her day after brunch at the hotel. I asked for an extension on the room in the morning and they gave us until 1 which was great. At 1 we were all packed up, but my kids were still napping, and our car was arriving at 2, so I called the front desk to see if we could have a bit more time. An agent named Nancy said no, that she couldn't extend it any longer, and I kindly told her that I understood and we\u2019d leave the room. I wanted to be respectful, so didn\u2019t call up for a bellman- we just put the kids in the stroller and left.\n\nAs we were walking out, a housekeeping manager was coming to kick us out. It just seemed super off-putting for him to be hurrying us out when we had the room extended. I know everyone has a job to do, but I would\u2019ve much preferred a phone call than an in-person confrontation over literally 5 minutes, especially when I had just spoken with the desk staff. I actually don\u2019t mind being rushed, it was the way it was being done just rubbed us the wrong way.... We all know you still have hours before someone else is promised the availability of this room. \n\nAside from the room, over the course of the weekend, we really enjoyed the downstairs coffee shop as well as the food and service at the wedding events. The bellman, Raymond was kind to us and our kids. Room service is pretty slow and super overpriced, but it is NYC. One plus was that the view from the room was incredible. \n\nMy recommendation: stay at the Waldorf or the Four Seasons.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check in was ok, however our room we were staying was disappointing. The blinds in the room were broken and there was a large patch of water in the middle of the floor. House-keeping dealt with the matter the following day, as this could not be dealt with on the day we checked in. Initial impressions were disappointing, as having stayed at other 5 star hotels, I was expecting more from an established hotel. In addition to this, I would say at times customer service at the reception desk was lacking. Breakfast at Villard Restaurant was lovely. Staff were very attentive and engaging, service was very good. We were located on the 53rd floor which had a good view, however I would have preferred a view over seeing the Cathedral, which is located on the other side of the 53rd floor. Location is good, but initial check-in could have been better. Check-out was no better as we were charged twice for our 4 night stay. ","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I have stayed in many fabulous hotels in New York and stupidly decided to try something different for this trip.\n\nWe booked a 'luxury double towers room'. This room promised a 'deep soaking bath' which was one of the main reasons we had booked it. \n\nWhen we arrived to the room it had a shower, no bath. The bathroom was really dirty and also dirt in the grout etc. The TV didn't work, the bedside lamp wouldn't turn off. When we looked behind the TV to try and work out what was wrong there was so much dust that i started choking. We rang reception re the bath issue and they advised there were no rooms that evening with baths, we didn't feel like we could be bothered moving the next day so accepted a credit for food and beverages. Later on we discovered that the power sockets beside the bed didn't work. The toilet wouldn't flush properly, we had to open the cistern to flush it during the night. Around the TV area was the most dirty, ring stains from glasses and other stains. Luckily we had some anti bacterial wipes with us and had to give the place a good clean. I sent an email early evening saying how dissatisfied we were and that we were going to bed early due to jet lag. Then we discovered that the beds had stained linen although were quite comfortable.\n\nMy mum had to go down in the morning to complain as my email had not been answered, although she spoke to a very helpful man who promised to have our room changed later that day(most of the staff are very pleasant) . \n\nWhen we returned that afternoon we were allocated a new room four floors higher. It does have a bath. Unfortunately it is not what is promised ie \"deep soaking\", it could perhaps be described as deep soaking if you were about two foot in height.\n\nThe beds in this room are dreadful, the mattresses are sagging so much that they are really hard to lie on. Absolutely awful! There was a pubic hair on the window sill. And a thick layer of dust. The glass table is covered in stains. Also there are stains all over the TV unit (which we have cleaned ourselves with wipes) strange stains on the bedside table. I could go on and on. We didn't bother to complain as this is meant to be an enjoyable trip, and no one actually called us to check that our room change was ok. \n\nIn summary, this hotel is old and dated. The decor in the bedrooms and the design of the bathrooms is very 80s. The cushions in the room are revolting. The toilet is so low on the floor that it is really hard to use. \n\nMaybe some of the rooms are better than this, but 4410 and 4810 are just tired and dirty. I cannot understand other reviews that are remarking on the great standards of cleanliness . Very strange indeed. I feel totally cheated :(\n\nFor \u00a3495 a night I expected much more. I've paid less in other five stars in this city and had an absolutely fabulous luxury experience. I would avoid this hotel at all costs. I can't actually believe they have five stars.

I was able to find a Summer promotion, ( prepay for discount) which afforded me the room with 2 queen beds on the highest floor in The Towers.  The room was huge ( for NYC standards).  My view was amazing.  I faced the river and it was just breathtaking on the high floor.  It started off all right.  At check in , The Towers has a separate area and separate check in desk ; where they offered me champagne and bottle water upon arrival.  The front desk employees were very friendly and handed me a tote as a gift as part of my check in promotion.  Not every day in nyc do you get gifts and champagne upon check in!!! \n\nConciege was very helpful with restaurants, and the doorman was always able to find me a taxi Quickly. Although the location is centrally located , that we walked ever where. The beds were very comfortable.  We actually slept so late being on the high floor. We never heard the crazy traffic.  The location is really good too. It\u2019s one block from 5th avenue with all the fancy shops ( and next to Saks ).  It\u2019s actually easy to walk everywhere!!! Close to Central Park, Rockefeller center , and theatre district.  It\u2019s really good central located.  \n\nSo , heads up though. The brunch on the 2nd floor restaurant is ridiculous expensive.  Just be ready if you eat at hotel !!! I would say skip the Restuarsnt and go enjoy local bagel place! Starbucks is across the street .  \n\n ","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They were genuine.... We stayed in the \u201cTowers\u201d and they have a dedicated check-in and concierge.  Champagne complimentary between 4 and 6...  Whether this is relevant or not, we checked in with American Express Centurion.  The reason I mention this is as such. We are entitled to an upgrade, if available.  I\u2019ve made it my practice over the years never to ask because it has never panned out...... Here\u2019s the game changer...... Enter \u201cYohenny Vasquez\u201d..... (Tower Guest Service Agent). I can\u2019t say enough about her!!!  She presented herself in a professional, yet personal manner.  She not only made us feel that we mattered and appreciated our choice in accommodations, she offered us an upgrade.  Worth noting, we arrived on a Friday....what are the chances.  We did arrive before check in and obviously they stored out luggage and true to her word, she texted us to let us know when our room was ready....... Or shall I say, \u201cOUR SUITE\u201d.  I can\u2019t say enough about my experience at the Lotte New York Palace.  I will say this..... Location was the drive for our choice in accommodations, the staff will be my choice moving forward.

She advised me to ask for her once we got to the hotel and I have to say that she not only took exceptional care of us, but she made sure we stayed in a room that far exceeded our every expectation and provided customer service that was off that charts and so rare to find.

The rooms are well appointed and spacious, but the bathrooms are not what I'd expect from a 5-star at this level (the Langham, for example, blows this hotel away). The staff are very nice, but I found both room service and housekeeping bordering on incompetent. I ordered two fresh juices one morning, and after being told they were \"coming right up in 15-20 minutes\", waited almost 2 hours and had to call back twice. Housekeeping took a bathrobe I wanted refreshed and never replaced it, and took the large bathmat on the second day of my stay and never replaced that either. Room service selection was limited and not well executed. The actual staff you pass and interact with in the hotel were lovely though; very friendly and helpful when asked, so I am not sure where the disconnect is between attitude and execution, but at $900\/night, there's no second chance for slip ups at this level of hotel.

And I mean that in the nicest way. From our reception by the doorman, to our reception inside when we went to the main desk and were told we were \u201cspecial\u201d and would need to check in at the separate and oh-so-beautiful reception area for The Towers and were escorted there, everything about the Palace is first class.  Once inside the reception area for The Towers, we knew we were in capable hands. We were warmly received. The reception area for The Towers  is complete with leopard settees, a scented candle-to-die-for, and elegant glasses of sparkling wine. Wow. \n\nThanks to my SIL and her husband  (a lovely man, may he rest in peace) who have been staying at The Towers a decade or more for their annual trips to see theatre in Manhattan, I was introduced to Jimm Kalinka (mentioned in other TA reviews) who secured me an upgrade to a corner suite (sweet!) for Handsome Companion\u2019s birthday. It was a spectacular corner suite on the 42nd floor, complete with a kitchen, a bath and a half, two closets, a dining table, a large living room and a magnificent bedroom.  The  smile on H.C.\u2019s face as he walked into the sweet suite made it all worthwhile.  He sat in the corner of the huge sectional in the living room, just taking it all in. Eventually, we both realized that the view from the expansive  windows of our corner suite was of the building where we first met decades ago (a story for another day). His smile never faded the whole time we were there.\n\nNow, the Palace Hotel, which comprises everything beneath the  41st floor, is probably best known for the magnificent building and central courtyard which faces Madison Avenue and the back of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.  The building is actually six former private brownstones around a central courtyard, once  a carriage entrance, modeled on the Palazzo Della Cancelleria in Rome, and designed by McKim, Mead  & White.   It was built in 1882 for Henry Villard, a railroad financier, for whom the high-ceilinged restaurant in the hotel was named.  Suffice it to say, this history is beautifully reflected inside the hotel.\n\nOur room was magnificently appointed with plush towels, bathrobes, Molton Brown toiletries, and even umbrellas.  About five p.m., as we were just getting up from our nap, the phone rang. The Towers staff was sending up \u201ca little something\u201d for us. A few minutes later, we received a fancy, miniature chocolate mousse cake in honor of H.C.\u2019s birthday. It came with plates, forks, knives and cloth napkins.  The timing of this delivery was so thoughtful. By bringing it before we left for our evening, we were able to pass on sweets after our dinner knowing we had a fabulous dessert waiting for us when we got back from our evening out.  And that is exactly what we did.  The cake was divine.\n\nSunday morning, we woke up around 7 a.m. All was quiet. In fact, we had heard no noise all night.  Apparently, no traffic noise is \u201cpermitted\u201d around The Palace; as it should be. Because it was a cold, rainy and miserable morning, we opted to work out at the hotel gym. Though it will soon all be renovated, the gym is spacious and more than adequate. And how nice to work out overlooking St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.   The gym staff was oh-so-solicitous and lovely.\n\nThere was nothing about The Towers that we did not like.  Now, having stayed here, how will we ever want to stay anywhere else when we stay in NYC?","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I've stayed before, in the days when a stay at The Towers also included access to an elaborate lounge, but sadly this is long gone.\ncheck in etc is still taking place in a separate reception area. I had booked a one-bedroom suite, but we got an upgrade to a corner suite with a fabulous view.\nThe look is still very classic - I prefer more modern\/edgy, but the classic feel definitely has its charm and the suite was very spacious. A very large living room with a sofa bed for our daughter, a large bedroom with a king size bed, a bathroom with tub and shower, two walk-in closets, a kitchen area, a powder room and a hallway big enough to host an event. Good bed (sofa bed not so comfy), lovely bath products. Location is great for Central Park, 5th avenue shopping and of course St Patricks, which is just across the street from the main entrance.\n\nSo why not 5 stars? There were some minor kinks, so I would rate it 3,5, but because of the upgrade I've thrown in the last half star for good measure.\n\nThe kitchen area - it is always nice to be able to cook something or keep something in a fridge. This kitchen had lots of cupboards, but absolutely nothing in them. Only a wine fridge and an oven. No regular fridge, no glasses, cups, plates, utensils - not even a kettle to make a simple cup of tea. I don't really get why you'd use the space for a kitchen if you can't use it. One more really annoying thing: there's an air vent in the kitchen that is very loud and can't be switched off. No problem if you are closing all the doors to the bedroom, but since it is an open kitchen and since our daughter had the sofa bed it was really annoying. I asked in reception if anything could be done, but sadly not. \nWe tried both mornings to get tables for breakfast, but the restaurant was fully booked. Not the hotel's fault - it was Easter weekend and everyone wants an Easter brunch - but when I called the designated Towers concierge he just said \"sorry, it is fully booked\" and hung up. No suggestions whatsoever to where we could go instead. Luckily, I work in food and wine and have a big interest in this and always have a long, obsessively researched list of places to go, so we went and had a delicious Easter brunch at Beekman Towers. \nChecking out was swift, but not every service is offered in the Towers reception - you check out, but if you want boarding passes printed or your luggage stored you have to do this at the main reception, so not quite sure why Palace Hotel keeps having a separate reception when they are not able to fulfil your needs at said reception.\nMarjorie (not sure I got the right name) in Towers reception was so sweet and friendly so I would like to mention her. Thanks - also for the upgrade.\nWe really enjoyed our stay at the Towers - there's something special about staying on a high floor (we were on the 47th) and having that classic Midtown experience, but I am not sure that we'll stay again. It seems as if the hotel prides itself of some idea of old charm and luxury, but there are so many luxurious hotel experiences to be had in New York City, and to be honest, some do it way better than the Palace.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived early and our room, as we expected, was not ready. Jim checked us in and told us he would call when the room was ready.  I had to ask about our room upgrade that we were to have upon availability as we had booked with a Virtuoso adviser.  We left our luggage and went to lunch.  When we returned, my husband went to ask for a time estimate on the room and reported to me that Jim somewhat rudely told him \"I said I'd call when it is ready\".  We went out for a while and then decided to wait in the Tower check in area around 3:30.  None of the staff said a word to us or offered us a beverage.  At about 4, I went up to Jim and asked him if our room was ready.  He looked at me blankly and then asked \"Are you from out there?\" pointing to the main lobby.  No, you checked us in and said you would call.  He found the key at the desk and said the room had been ready for hours.  I asked why I wasn't called.  He said he didn't know what had happened but I was called. He then went on to say there was a computer issue and the main hotel guests were unable to be assigned rooms; he thought we were staying in the regular area and just came into the Tower's area to sit. When we got into the room, Jim called.  He stated his colleague had called us and left a message stating the room was ready. (I think he needs some remedial CS training.)  I then realized my apple watch was still set to airplane mode, which is why I didn't receive any notification.  My bad.  However, what upset me was his response to my husband (when the room was probably ready based on the timing of the phone call), and how we were ignored for 30 minutes because the staff thought we were in the main hotel.  No matter what part of the hotel someone is using, a true 5-star hotel would at least acknowledge them.  Shameful.  \n\nThe only other con was upon checkout.  Multiple incorrect charges and missing credits, although the woman at the desk remedied everything very quickly.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had stayed at the other part of the hotel- the Lotte Palace for about a week  and we thought that was great that 6 months later we made another trip to New York.  Starting with the reservations- the staff were just lovely. I actually didn't know about the Towers but Roxanne who helped us with our reservation told us about it. She was wonderful in following up with us and helping us get our reservation sorted out.  We felt so welcome during check in and the room was breath taking.  We have considered staying at other well known top hotels in the city but I think the location here is second to none. You will never get bored of the view from the room. You can ask for a mini fridge or even a microwave to be brought to the room at no extra cost.  They weren't in the best of condition but they worked.   Housekeeping was wonderful and friendly.   The day we checked out, since our flight was a few hours later, they told us we could freshen up in the health club\/gym.  I was so impressed at how friendly the staff there were. I mean if you think about it, we had actually checked out and no longer guests there but they were still so nice to us.  If I had to pick out the negatives -I do feel that  they could provide a coffee maker as part of the room facilities instead of us having to pay extra for it.  I've stayed in cheaper hotels with coffee makers in the room for no extra cost and daily replenishment.  Also, there is a car available (unto a limited distance) for guests to use on a first come first serve basis.  It was never available when we asked about it.  It would be helpful if there was a more systematic way to ensure guests can use this.  We also had problems with the wifi- they did try to sort it out though. Also there was one or two staff members who I feel were a bit unfriendly in contrast the overall welcoming attitude of the rest of the employees (not outwardly rude) and I hope I won't have to encounter them on our next visit. \nBut this won't deter us from coming back. I think staying here is one of the reasons we try to plan holidays to the US.  We feel visiting New York won't be as memorable if we stayed anywhere else and we've been recommending the Towers to all our friends who are planning to travel to New York.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Generally, I write on here to complain about poor service or a property that isn't well taken care of. This is the first hotel room in years where everything actually works (lightbulbs, tv, fixtures, etc). The room is fully stocked with enough tissue boxes, water bottles, a razor kit, slippers, among others. I thought these kind of pre-thought amenities were long gone in U.S hotels! Many fine hotels have stopped giving these amenities all together and I strongly believe that small touches make all the difference. Secondly, I want to mention that you can tell people enjoy working here and have worked here for years. This is a sign of a place that is well-managed and employees are proud to work. I want to give a special shout out to Clara who served us in the lobby and even visited us in our room with a gift. She is so amiable, personal, and helpful - the Lotte is really lucky to have her. She really exemplifies a kind of service that feels luxurious without the stuffy\/robotic feel that many 5 star properties lack.

We had a gorgeous corner suite with windows along two sides and a lovely view. After two nights, things changed. At 11:00pm, we heard loud music which we thought was a noisy neighbor on our floor. Upon calling the front desk, we were informed that the music was coming from the Penthouse one floor above and was a \"private event\" that would be ending at 1:00am. At 1:30 we could still hear and feel the music, and were then told it would be over at 2:00. Four more phone calls and the music finally ended at 3:20am. We were appalled that this event was obviously scheduled and allowed, and located where and when other guests would be disturbed. Four hours of noise and we could do nothing about it. The hotel did cut one night's stay in half as an attempt to make it up to us.

It was a weekend to remember, and we are often in New York. Will definitely be coming back to The Towers! Our favorite!","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms and service had degraded. You can see it by the bedroom sheets, for instance. Eight months ago, there was a cover for the duvet. Now it\u2019s just sheets and a kind of dirty duvet. Even the sheets used to be softer\/nicer. The pillows have that weird smell of \u201cevery man in the world slept here and sweated\u201d, most of the housekeepers complain they are alone in the floor, they\u2019re nervous, the towels feel like sandpaper and it seems that nobody in that department cares anymore. I used to call housekeeping in the afternoon, considering that the hotel has 24 hours housekeeping. The housekeepers always complained a lot when they got to the room, saying they were alone on the floor. One day, one of them even yelled at my teenage sons saying she couldn\u2019t do the work in their presence. The Wi-Fi seems to be the worst in the world. This time, my phone kept sending messages for me that iCloud couldn\u2019t be reached. I called the hotel support and after a bunch of weird tests using Chrome, the attendant said the problem was iCloud. I was very worried, thinking I was hacked! I went to the Starbucks across the street and realized there was nothing wrong with my phone. It pains me to say this, because I like the people that work there very much. And I used to love this hotel. Hope they can sort those things out.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had spectacular views of St. Patrick's cathedral, the Rockefeller center and Midtown. The room was elegantly appointed, with a large corner suite connected to a 2 queen bed room. The final price was lower than comparable hotels, especially considering the sheer size of the rooms, which is rare to find in other high-end Manhattan hotels. Bathrooms and toiletries were at a luxury level. Minor improvements could be made on the TV sets (remote controls not working very well) and the lack of a coffee machine, ice machine on the floor. However, we had a kitchenette with minibar, microwave oven and wine cellar. Room service was excellent, Tower concierge and reception polite but not exceptional. \nThe Villard restaurant is very expensive and food is good (not great), but the place is so beautiful that it is worth at least one visit. \nThe main entrance and the staircases are just as well beautiful and remind you of the old times.\nOverall a great stay, would definitely consider staying there again.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}
