There is a nice and spacious gym that includes equipment, running equipment, and free weights, which allows for a reasonable workout.\nThe internet is fast and high quality and of course, included in the room price.\nThe breakfast is rich enough and includes everything you need.\nA coffee machine does not come as standard in the room.\nYes, they provide a coffee machine for those who request it - but many do not even know that it is possible to request one.\nSo whoever reads my response here please know that you can ask for a coffee machine and you will get it with great service from a very nice staff member.\n\nThings to improve: \nThey should add bathrobes in the bathroom,\n A magnifying mirror for shaving is a must! , because the lighting is not good enough in the bathroom when you are shaving, \nA coffee machine should come as standard in the room.\nTo walk downtown, you must pass through Times Square, which for some people the experience might be very claustrophobic, following the unbelievably crowdedness when you try to pass through\n\nThe price was very high but reflects the holiday season in New York.\nI will return to this hotel if the prices are reasonable.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

All big sights are in walking distance and the subway 1 is super close for everything further away. The hotel itself is average. The rooms are spacious, but worn. The cleaning stuff does a great job. But that does not help a laid through bed, a worn carpet, a douche that needs decalcifying and a stained daybed.\n\nAlthough the room being spacious there is little room to store you clothes when staying for more than a couple of days. So we lived with an open suitcase on the daybed for a week. \nThere is also no supply of drinking water available free of charge. So you either pay at the bar or go to Walgreens next door to purchase water. With that high location fee, a bottle of water a day should be included.\n\nBreakfast is at 30USD + Tax + Tip. It looked nice, but you can get a lot cheaper options around the hotel. \n\nThe lobby\/bar are is super loud, like a bar\/night club. If you like this, you will love it. But after a long day sightseeing that was too much for us.\n\nThe terrace has a terrific view.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-12-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My partner & I arrived very early to the hotel, so the bottom floor staff offered to hold our bags for us while we ventured the city. When we were ready to relax our feet, we retrieved our bags again (with the ticket they gave us to confirm our things), and we took an elevator that went up to the main lobby. There was a small fee to pay to enter our hotel room before check-in time, so that's important to note in case you're traveling on a tight budget.\n\nWe were given a room on the 24th floor, with a nice wide bed that was comfortable to sleep in. Our room appeared to be the most distant from the others, and the walls were so thick I barely heard anyone the entire time I was staying there. I theorized that this had something to do with what my partner told the hotel beforehand. He specified to them that we were coming here to celebrate our anniversary, so just in case this was intentional, then I did notice and appreciated the effort put into giving us as much privacy as possible.\n\nThe room came with the essentials, including a TV, mini-fridge & safe. There was no microwave, but it didn't bother me since we mostly went outside to eat. There is also a bar in the lobby area to grab some food until the late evening.\n\nWe ordered here a couple of times, mostly for room service, and everything was fresh and super yummy. I particularly loved the crispy potatoes that came with my spinach omelet for breakfast.\n\nThis hotel is conveniently placed just a couple of blocks away from Times Square. So, you can live out a night of glitz & glam, then return to your hotel where it's much less condensed.\n\nYou can find many things to do in the city, but if you're still questioning what to explore first, the lobby carries a bunch of pamphlets for attractions you can visit. Personally, we stopped by Bryant Park for the Christmas season and drank the incredible Italian hot chocolate from Max Brenner, as well as tried bao & truffle fries while we watched people ice skating. We also saw the broadway musical, Hadestown, and we stopped by the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA).\n\nI recommend this hotel for anybody, including people whose first language isn't English. I came across many Spanish speaking visitors, and I saw a French-speaking employee helping out a customer. This can be a comfortable stay for people of all backgrounds, and it is also family friendly. While there is a bar right by check-in, they ensure you are 21+ to drink (I know for a fact, because they needed to see my ID. I took it as a compliment).\n\nI would say the biggest issues that could come from staying here would be that it is a popular destination, especially with their NYE packages, so be prepared for huge crowds storming the lobby for the holidays. However, that is a small concern versus the many praises I give to this establishment. I would definitely come again!","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We enjoyed one meal at the hotel one night, which was lovely, food was great.\n\nOne thing we were wary about while staying at this hotel was the noise (even brought earplugs) and to our surprise, of a night getting into bed, you couldn't hear a thing and we didn't even have to pull out ear plugs once.\n\nThe only downside to the location of the room was the smell, if the windows were open in the room at any point during our stay, the smell of the food stands on the street (burning smell\/smoke) and the hotel kitchen would make its way into our room and would linger for a few hours.\n\nGreat location in terms of the subway and walking distance to all of the top attractions. \n\nIt can be quite expensive to stay here however, I would 100% recommend it and would even return to the hotel again if we come back to New York.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were travelling with our 9yo and had effectively been made homeless in NYC. I had received a text message that morning saying how excited they were to welcome us to the hotel and therefore had suspected nothing was wrong.

Why they didn\u2019t try to contact me via phone or text message I don\u2019t know as I would have been able to respond to that. I was expecting to pay at the hotel on arrival as per my confirmation email, not to be billed earlier in the day and then have our room sold on without properly trying to contact us to resolve the issue. The manager of the hotel did nothing to help us find alternative accommodation as he was too busy dealing with his other customers and it wasn\u2019t his problem.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":23155544,"title":"A real mixed bag","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I will start with the biggest problem.  We have booked two times square view rooms  and at the booking we selected and requested interconnecting rooms, in writing.  Then, I called them and explained why we needed interconnecting rooms (disabled guests).  Then, three weeks before our stay, I was in the area and I walked in in person and asked them again to ensure the rooms were going to be interconnected, I had even offered to pay extra to guaratee that they were.  They said they cannot guaranteed but see no reson why they wouldn't be able to accommodate.  Guess what, when we checked in, the rooms weren't even on the same floor, let alone interconnected.  And here's my problem, just exactly WHAT could I have done to get interconnected rooms? I booked the correct rooms, I wrote, I called, I turned up in person, I offered money - why in the world could they not try to accommodate?  How difficult is it to look at a reservation, and block the two rooms so that nobody books over them?  And when I queried this, the answer was a bog standard \"computer says no\", instead of proactively trying to find a solution.  \n\nAfter a lot of back and forth (and me being in near tears), they managed to find a solution where they would move one of us after 1 night, so the majority of our stay would be in interconnected rooms, that did end up happening, but by this time our vacation was off to a very bad start.   And what absolutely baffled me, was the absolute contempt with which they treated their customers.  For instance, one of the staff told us that when we were moving rooms, we could leave our bag in the old room and they will transfer them (which was nice) - then , another staff member scoffed us at that, as if indicating that we had been too lazy to move them ourselves (!).  And when they did move us in the end, they acted like they were doing us the biggest favour - when in fact we booked, requested and GOT PROMISED the correct rooms and it was their mistake that we had to move.  I seriously never felt like an appreciated guest here.  I promise I wasn't being a karen, but now in hindsight I kind of wish I had asked for the manager to give this feedback in person. \n\nAnd it didn't get much better.  One evening went down to the bar, we needed two seats but an area was roped off, so I asked a waiter to find us somewhere to be - the answer was \"we are full\" and he walked away.  I didnt want to give up, I walked over to the bar, asked a woman if the seat next to her was taken, she said no, I took the seat, asked another elsewhere, same thing, puled the two seats next to eachother, and voila, we sorted our problem within 57 seconds - this is what the staff member should have done, find a solution for the customer, make them feel welcome.  Same \"I don't care\" attitude as with the rooms.  \n\nBreakfast was in the restaurant which is lovely with the views but the food itself is so so, it's your bog standard breakfast stuff with very little variety.   Most mornings everything was fine but one of the last mornings we ran into the same \"I dont care about you\" attitude by the hostess who refused to find a solution for us where we turned up 4 people - another colleague of hers (maybe the manager) had to step in and sort things out, which he kindly did.   \n\nAt the check out, the guy was perfectly lovely but not a single word about \"how was your stay\" or \"was everything all right\", stuff that hotels normally ask you at checkout.  Nothing. Checking out?  Here's the bill - bye. Staff need to lose the arrogant attitude.\n\nI will finish on the positives.  The rooms were  clean, adequately sized and the bed was clean and comfortable, we slept well here.  The views were great.  There was one guy at the restaurant who was always lovely, polite and smiley (wore glasses - I think he was a manager).  The location is perfect and the general atmosphere\/clietele\/vibe was nice.  Nice touch on the games in the lounge, entertaining for the kids.  Speaking of kids, my son got a toy new york taxi at check in, that was also a nice touch.  \n\nOverall, a mixed bag. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Even if you don't have this view from your room there is a great terrace that looks onto Times Square but be aware that this can get busy.\nHotel was good - rooms roughly equivalent to a nice Premier Inn in the UK.

Room was a good size - no bath, just a shower but not a problem for us. Had to request coffee maker in room but this was provided very quickly. \nBreakfast (paid for as part of the room) was good but some things ran out - if you arrived after 8am then forget about getting any of the yummy doughnuts! Not really what you would expect from a hotel - never replaced even after requesting. \nHotel bar was very expensive - $18 for a whisky and coke, $8 for a beer but there was a coupon for $10 off your bar bill per night (one per couple). Didn't order food as we were out most evenings but it was expensive and saw lots of guests bringing in their own food from outside.\nReception staff were very helpful; bar staff varied from helpful to downright rude which again was disappointing for what you were paying for the hotel. \nOverall the hotel was in an excellent position for Times Square, the metro and central park whilst the hotel itself was average - nothing bad (apart from the odd member of staff) just be aware that in New York its expensive so you need to be paying a lot more if you want luxury.

We had a city view King room on the 30th floor and room was spacious and tidy, absolutely lovely. The view was great, we had a partial view of Times Square as well which was very special. The bed and bedding were great. Bathroom could do with updating, was a bit old fashioned and the combination of bath\/shower is outdated, would have preferred a walk-in shower. \n\nWe felt a bit harassed by the maid on our floor. I'm sure she was just eager to get her job done, but to ask us every time we left the room how long we would be gone for and did we need a turn down despite of us having the \"privacy\" sign up, felt a bit over the top. Also, the ice maker on our floor did not work. \n\nM Social is a large hotel in a very popular location and we could definitely feel it in the level of service. Everyone was perfectly friendly but service felt superficial and impersonal. The \"rooftop\" bar is not exactly rooftop but on the 4th floor but with beautiful views over Times Square. It does get busy so be prepared for a fight over the best tables on the terrace (not sure if they do reservations outside) but the views are worth it. \n\nThe elevators were a joke. Especially in the morning, it could easily take you 15 mins to get down to the lobby as only two of the four elevators were working and trying to get in from 30th floor, the elevator was always already full. Also one of the (two) elevators to street level was almost always out of service. With that volume of customers, this was a huge inconvenience.  \n\nSaying all this, the location of the hotel is brilliant. All Broadway theatres and shops are walking distance and still the room felt peaceful and \"out of the way\". The bar is great and the feel of the hotel is very modern, clean and tidy.

We have not stayed at this hotel. \n\nBeware using the mymillenium app - location services must have recognised that I was booking from Australia and so price on the app was quoted at AUD$661.49. Once I completed the booking, the next screen showed the price as USD$661.49 - which converts to approx $1,016.00! The app continues to quote in AUD. I provided screen sorts via an email to the M Social Hotel Times Square to enquire as to whether the AUD price would be honored. The response I received severely lacked any customer service and I was told the AUD price would not be honored - no further explanation or advice. In response to a follow up email, the hotel suggested I call and speak with a manager. I phoned reservations and they explained they couldn\u2019t help but suggested I call the hotel front desk. I did this and requested to speak to a manager however this was ignored and I was advised that nothing could be done.

The front desk staff & room service were very attentive to our needs. We enjoy the extra security of always having the doorman there to greet us and the extra elevator to get up to the main level. I had read reviews saying that the elevators were slow, but we did not have any trouble whatsoever throughout our six night stay. The doormen also stored our bags on the last day so we could roam around a bit more before our flight home and arranged a taxi to the airport for us. Though we did not spend any time in the main floor lounge\/recreation area, we noticed a lot of families and people in general relaxing & having fun at all times of day and night. It had a really pleasant vibe. The little store on site was also convenient. We liked the location of the hotel very much-we were doing a lot of things around the theater district-but it was just enough removed from the Times Square chaos. We also liked that there were drugstores, coffee shops, bagel places, restaurants, and several subway stations all with an easy walking distance. \n\nIf I had to nitpick, I would say that some of the electrical outlets in the room didn\u2019t work all the time, and it would be nice to have some USB ports in the room.

The room was comfortable, stylish and for Times Square larger than average.  The location of the hotel can\u2019t be beat, very close to many restaurants and the theater district (Gershwin Theater in particular). \n\nCheck-in is at 4 PM (very late by most standards) and I arrived super-early at 10 AM.  I figured no room would be available, and it wasn\u2019t\u2026. There was the ability to check your bags downstairs and I did just that while waiting for a room to open up.  Fast forward to Noon, and I checked again, with the helpful staff member telling me yes they now had a room available\u2026. I was happy to hear it until I was informed it would be an additional $75 for early check-in.  I took it, but didn\u2019t like it as if the room was available it cost the hotel next to nothing to allow me to check-in early.  At $300 a night one would think they would just let you check-in, not get a free $75 off of the customer just because they can.  That said, while annoyed, I agreed to it, so won\u2019t hold the hotel responsible.\n\nNo, the 3 star rating has to do with the absolutely horrific customer service I received by the sole person at the registration\/checkout terminal this morning as I was checking out of the hotel around 6:45 AM.  The man was oddly wearing what looked like a jean jacket or vest\u2026. Something I would not have expected the hotel staff to be wearing (and indeed no one else was dressed like that the entire time of my stay save this \u201cgentleman.\u201d). Odd dress aside, he greeted me nonchalantly, only asking directly \u201cchecking out?\u201d  No inquiry was made as to how my stay was, or even a good morning for that matter\u2026. He then asked for my room number and after looking up my bill, he printed out my room charges\u2026. I asked if I could quickly look them over and he appeared really put-out by that request, though did not stop me.  I saw everything looked in order save one minor item that I politely pointed out\u2026. I mentioned the \u201cDestination Fee\u201d (like a daily resort fee without any of the benefits of a resort) included a $10 bar\/restaurant credit *daily*.  I used the bar\/restaurant Beast & Butterflies 2 times on separate days, and was only credited one $10 charge.  I inquired why I didn\u2019t receive the second $10 credit\u2026. This is where things went south.  He put on the most condescending, insulting look on his face (obviously intentional) and informed me with great glee that I did not order a drink on the second bill.  I mentioned I didn\u2019t because the drinks were included with my meal and I didn\u2019t need a separate drink when they were included in the cost of the second meal.  He just grinned with that same face and said \u201cno one has ever said that one before.\u201d  Needless to say I told him, then let me be the first!  Of course he didn\u2019t care and just shined the same condescending cynical smile and said nothing else.  No credit given, no apathy, no care at all for the customer.  He turned over a $10 charge a great stay into one I am writing this review (4 stars for the hotel and zero stars for his unprofessional behavior - which I will average to a 3, but will never return or recommend the M Social due to it).\n\nThe bottom line is even if the policy was as he said, he could have handled the situation any number of different ways, all would have better than how he *did* handle it.  For example, he could have apologized, but informed me the policy was you had to order a drink in order to get the credit, but as a one time courtesy, he would credit me the $10 since he could see how I might have misunderstood\u2026.

De pluspunten van dit hotel zijn de ligging en de goede concierge-service;dit werkt via whatsapp. De minpunten zijn er echter teveel. Sobere kamer, veel te kleine badkamer zonder toebehoren zoals bodylotion, douchekapje enz. Geen badjas, geen slippers, geen pen en papier, geen standaard koffie of thee apparatuur, minibar niet gevuld. Ontvangst op de begane grond door ongeinteresseerde portiers, met de lift paar verdiepingen hoger voor receptie. Inchecken kan pas vanaf 16.00 uur, eerder kan wel maar kost $100. Ontbijtruimte heeft veel te weinig capaciteit waardoor lange wachtrijen ontstaan. De hotelgasten zijn voornamelijk jong volwassenen, al dan niet gesponsord door papa en mama. Getuigt ook de voetbaltafel en Playstation in de gezamelijke ruimte en de zichzelf aanstellende influencers die zich voor hun mobiel hysterisch vermaken in hun eentje zolang de camera loopt. De vier liften waarvan er een de hele week kapot was zijn een ramp. Duurt soms vijf minuten voor er een komt. Maar het grootste minpunt van dit hotel zijn de (voornamelijk vrouwelijke) medewerkers van de receptie, de bar en bij het ontbijt. Met de attitude en arrogante uitstraling die zij hebben geven ze je een niet welkom gevoel en heb je constant het gevoel dat je op je donder krijgt. Klantvriendelijkheid een dikke onvoldoende. En dat voor bijna $ 500 per nacht excl. ontbijt. Dat ontbijt is overigens karig. Helemaal voor de prijs van $ 27. Tijdens ons verblijf bleek er midden in de nacht een brandalarm op de 11e etage. Je zit stijf in je bed als door de speaker ineens een brandweercommandant roept kalm te blijven en te wachten op verdere instructies. Na een kwartier blijkt het loos alarm. Je zou van een viersterrenhotel verwachten dat zij eea terug koppelen de dag erna naar hun gasten middels een briefje, appje of beter nog een gratis drankje voor het ongemak. We hebben echter niets vernomen vanuit het hotel. Gemiste kans in mijn ogen. Conclusie: te duur voor hetgeen zij te bieden hebben. Niet geschikt voor mensen die Europese viersterren gewend zijn.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Everywhere was so easy to get too from this hotel. The rooftop bar also had a fantastic view of Times Square, however the drinks were extremely expensive.  We chose not to have breakfast as at $30 each was for a hotel of this standard very pricey and with so many wonderful diners nearby it was an easy decision. The room was very very basic, no coffee or water provided.  The bathroom a very dull, brown colour which showed up all the stains the cleaners missed. This Hotel was the standard of a Travel Lodge and the price of The Hilton ( if you're from the UK you will understand!) Two of the 4 elevators were broken down for 3 days meaning wait times were ridiculous. 2 mornings we ended up walking down the stairs as 3 times it stopped on our floor and was packed with people. And then this ridiculous \",resort fee\" what on earth is that for?? We weren't offered any discount on that when they couldn't provide 4 elevators.

In your absence be prepared to lock your things in the suitcases. Always keep your purchases under lock and key. Even when you go out for sometime make sure donot leave any of your stuffs in the room open.\nAnd on repeated requests also the hotel does not take responsibility for that. They donot bother for your safety.\nThe day we arrived from Orlando it was 2:30 PM. We had booked for two rooms but they said only one is ready. The other will be ready at 4 :30 PM. So we could use the bathroom and go out for sightseeing. As soon as we opened the hand held shower water started gushing out from both the showers overhead aswell. We tried all settings but in vain.  After repeated reminders they sent a plumber who took an hour to repair it with washers and bolts. He wetted the whole of bathroom and outside carpets. He was wearing shoes through out. Nobody bothered to come and cleanup the mess! He also told us not to turn the tap the other side since the problem could happen again but the next day when we came back after a tired hectic day the housekeeping staff had turned it the other side and it had to be done all again!\nThe Air Con was way so cold that it left us shivering. The heat mode does not work. Again a Technican came with all the pliers and drivers and ladder. Took another hour. And guess what next day when we went and came back again the same things had to be repeated with AC and the Bath area shower also since the house keeping staff changed it back!!\nVery poor guest service. My daughters stationary stuff worth 100 $ were burgled right under my nose. We had purchased it from Michaels and opened it that night on our mattress. Next day went out and came back in the evening just to find our things had gone out of our sight.\nNever go here guys. A simple and best advice you will get better hotels.

Overall, this is a lovely hotel. The hotel boasted cleanliness, modern rooms and trendy decor. The lobby was very spacious, trendy and overall had great entertainment. The patio (terrace actually) was also nice and offered views of Times Square. \nHowever, there was one aspect of my stay that left me feeling disappointed - the lack of the promised city view.\nLet's start with the positives. The hotel's cleanliness was impeccable. From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was greeted by a spotless and well-maintained environment. The modern rooms were another highlight of my experience. The decor was stylish and contemporary, and the amenities provided were top-notch. The room itself was spacious (for NYC), well-deisgned, and equipped with everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The attention to detail in terms of room features and furnishings was commendable, and I truly enjoyed the modern and sleek ambiance.\n\nHowever, the disappointment came when I discovered that my reserved \"city view\" room did not live up to expectations. Instead of the promised city view of NYC, the window overlooked an air conditioning unit and a clutter of other equipment. I had specifically chosen the city view room to soak in the vibrant energy of NYC, but sadly, that is not what I received.\nWhile this disappointment dampened my enthusiasm, it did not overshadow the hotel's other positive attributes. The cleanliness, modernity, and location were still instrumental in creating a pleasant stay. Nonetheless, I hope the hotel management takes note of this discrepancy in room allocation, as a false promise of a city view can lead to unmet expectations and disappointment for future guests.\nOverall, my experience at this hotel was enjoyable and I would still recommend this hotel to others, but with the caveat that they confirm the room's view in advance to avoid any letdowns.\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23155544,"title":"Geen 4 sterren niveau waardig!","lang":"nl","publishedDate":"2023-05-15","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"We hadden dit hotel geboekt op basis van de 4 sterren en op basis van de reviews. Omdat we rond 13.00 uur aankwamen en je eigenlijk pas om 16.00 uur kunt inchecken hebben we gevraagd of het mogelijk was om eerder in te checken. Dit bleek mogelijk te zijn, maar daar moesten we 100 USD extra voor betalen. We hebben dat niet gedaan omdat het ons vreemd lijkt dat als je inderdaad al kamers klaar hebt dat je daar dan extra voor moet betalen als je eerder wil inchecken. Dus de koffers achter gelaten en om 16.00 uur ingecheckt, waarbij het zoals verwacht aardig druk was en we dus lang moesten wachten. Uiteindelijk bleek er om 16.00 uur maar 1 van de 2 kamers klaar te zijn wat op zich vreemd is omdat je standaard om 11.00 uur moet uitchecken. Na veel overleg en op en neerlopen naar waarschijnlijk een leidinggevende kregen we te horen dat het nog even zou duren voor de 2e kamer klaar zou zijn. Als troost kregen we 2 drankjes aangeboden en geen 4 ondanks dat we met zijn 4-en waren. De reden hiervoor was dat die ene kamer al klaar was en dat 1 van de 2 stellen gewoon naar de kamer kon gaan. Dat we met 2 stellen waren en dus op elkaar wilden wachten maakte hen blijkbaar niets uit. Daarom 2 drankjes van het hotel gekregen en 2 zelf betaald, zodat we op elkaar konden wachten voor we naar de hotelkamers gingen. In de hotelkamer aangekomen bleek dit enigszins tegen te vallen. De geboekte kamers kostten 500 USD per nqcht maar zijn zo basic als mogelijk. Een bed, een lege minibar, een bakje met onbeduidende vlekken erin en bedenkelijke vloerbedekking. Helaas geen slippertjes waarmee je kon voorkomen dat je met blote voeten op de vloerbedekking moest lopen. Geen warmwater koker of dergelijke, maar alleen 2 glazen die je uiteindelijk beter kon gebruiken om je tandenborstel in te zetten in de badkamer omdat deze daar niet aanwezig waren. Verder bleek de houder van de handdouche helemaal los te zitten en sloot de glazendeur van de douche niet goed met alle gevolgen van dien. Wat ook misleidend is zijn de foto\u2019s op bijvoorbeeld Booking.com. De zeepjes en shampoo\u2019s die je op de foto van de badkamers ziet staan zijn er helemaal niet. De ruimte aan 1 zijde van het bed is slechts 30 cm wat het lastig maakt om in en uit bed te komen. Om het maar niet te hebben over de entree van het hotel.\nJe komt op straatniveau binnen in een niet  erg welkome entree waar je te horen krijgt dat de receptie op de 1e verdieping is waar je met de lift naar toe moet. Dit laten ze op de foto\u2019s niet zien omdat het niet 4-sterren waardig is. Kortom op de ligging na, die prima is lijkt het in niets op een 4 sterren hotel.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I want to give a big shoutout to my cleaning lady - Luiza - who made and cleaned my room everyday without fail. She was attentive to detail and ensured that the room was always clean, and the beds always made. Whenever I\u2019d meet her in the hallway, she was always smiling and very personable. For the next time I\u2019m back in NYC, I would personally request to stay on the 14th floor again - all because of Luiza. The hotel would do very well to keep and reward her as a valued staff.\n\nIn addition, I want to give a big shoutout to Alvin Wright working at the front desk. He usually does the morning shifts until 3PM daily, and he\u2019s been an absolute pleasure to liaise with. He\u2019s always helpful, willing to go the extra mile, and handles all types of questions in a positive manner. His attitude and mannerism is what all front desk staff should aspire towards. Because of my lengthy stay, I\u2019d naturally have a couple of situations to deal with, and I only wanted to speak with Alvin because I knew I could get an effective and decisive resolution. The hotel would do very well to keep and reward him as a valued staff.\n\nIt\u2019d be much appreciated that the General Manager receives and reads this, and cascades the feedback to the wider team.

Not actually a restaurant so you can bring your food out there from other places and just sit and look up over timessquare. We did not take advantage of the breakfast because it was $30 per person. But there is a mini fridge in the room so we just filled it with yogurts and fruits from a local bodega. We were able to do all of our sightseeing by foot from the MSocial for our short trip: Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Empire State building, and, of course Phantom of the opera which was the main reason we came to the city, we also enjoyed Madame Tussaud\u2019s wax Museum, which is nearby the hotel.

Keeping it from 5 stars for me:  the elevators were too slow, we always waited quite a while to get an elevator, sometimes fairly large groups would be waiting for an elevator and the waits detracted from our hotel experience.  Another item was they should get rid of dining service at the three small tables and two sofas and leave those open for general lobby seating and hanging out. Too many  times we wanted to just chill in the lobby with our coffee and couldn't sit because they were for dining customers.

We were on the 31st floor and personally I feel like we had the best room in the hotel (1305).\nFrom check-in to check-out, every encounter we had with a member of staff was 10\/10. Every question or query we had was answered with such kindness and politeness.\nWe only had breakfast in the hotel once and although expensive, it was very good with a very good selection on offer.\nThe feel and d\u00e9cor of the hotel was great. A very relaxed, modern feel which was perfect after long days wondering around the city.\nThe room was cleaned\/serviced every single day to a very high standard. We even had a pizza delivery one evening which the porters were more than happy to assist with.\nBefore going there were a few reviews we read about the inconvenience of the hotel having two lifts, one from street level to the lobby, and then another from the lobby to the rooms. This was the case, however no way near as much of an inconvenience as some reviews suggest.\nUpon check-out there was a very streamlined process in place when it came to leaving your luggage if you had a later flight. All free of charge and they even ask if you want a taxi reserved for when you collect your luggage to take you to the airport. I would recommend this as they flag a yellow taxi which has a fixed price of $70 from Manhattan-JFK. Pre-booked vehicles were in excess of $100.\nI would highly recommend this hotel.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-02-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"This was our first trip to New York so I searched for hotels that were central and we hit the jackpot with this hotel! \n\nWhen we first arrived we went upstairs for check in and I think it\u2019s the fastest we\u2019ve ever checked in to a hotel. They took my credit card for the hotel tax which we were aware of as this is common in New York and gave us our hotel room and that was pretty much it. I had seen on some reviews for other hotels that money had been removed from their cards and not been put back on for security deposits etc but I never had any trouble and the payment I was told came off after we got home. \n\nOn the first night we went for a quick walk and we found ourselves on Time Square in a couple of minutes and we were a 5-10 min walk from the big attractions like Rockefeller, Empire State etc. \n\nOur room was lovely and clean and much bigger than I expected for New York. We had a couple of issues including not having a lot of storage even though the room was huge. We like to unpack but really struggled to find space to put away our clothes. Getting ready was sometimes a struggle as there was only small lights so the rooms were very dark. The room was very cold and we couldn\u2019t work out the heating so having a shower was awful because it was freezing when getting out. The shower also leaked really bad onto the tiles throughout the bathroom which made it slippy and dangerous and we booked this room last minute and it turned out to be a disabled room so it\u2019s lucky me and my mum are both steady on our feet. We were hardly in our room so non of these issues it were a major and we were just happy that the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. \n\nThe lobby was beautiful and chilled if you wanted to relax after a full on day. We didn\u2019t make it out onto the rooftop bar but the views were amazing and we did go for tea in the restaurant one night and were given a table with the best view to Times Square. I would recommend the restaurant if your knackered one day and don\u2019t want to go back out walking. My only complaint with the restaurant was the large amount of tip they put on the bill that we had to pay and being from the UK we weren\u2019t sure what the rules were and we were chased out of the restaurant saying we hadn\u2019t paid enough which was quite embarrassing. I did apologise and pay up but like I said we thought the tips were optional and had already paid quite a large tip so just be careful and check the bill before leaving. The hotel is also next door to Gallaghers steak house which is amazing and I would definitely recommend if your happy to pay a little bit more. \n\nOverall this hotel was perfect for what we wanted and my mum was so obsessed with the views of Times Square from our hotel room that she said she needs to go back. We will definitely be coming back to New York and if it\u2019s in our price range we will definitely be coming back to this hotel. ","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The resort fee is quite high at $40 per day, which I\u2019m not sure exactly what it\u2019s for, but a bit of a rip off all the same.

This one looked good online, but was a bit disappointed upon arrival. A bit of a dingy entrance where you have to take an elevator to get to hotel lobby, which isn't bad but elevators are slow and were down a handful of times during my stay. So if you just want to run downstairs quickly to grab some McDonalds, it just adds one extra step. I didn't find anyone overly friendly staff-wise. One server at the Restaurant was even quite rude and kept rushing me. They also didn't have any clean tables and the floor was a mess, and it's carpet! \n\n I felt for the front desk staff, as many people will complain about this - the \"Destination Fee\" they charge daily (30$ approx?) is a joke. Total joke. You get one beverage for $10 (keeping in mind they've inflated drink prices, so a cocktail is $18 approx), and then one comp bike pass, comp long-distance calls (whoopie) and comp high-speed internet and gym access (what hotel DOESN'T have that anymore???) and 25% off hop on hop off tour, which is also a joke when there's a guy on every corner offering you a deal. Then I paid $8 for a coffee. 8$ plus tip for $10. And you still have to charge it and let them know upon check-out that you had a non-alcoholic beverage or they won't take off the $10! Food is way overpriced for the taste. The windows are somewhat soundproof but the adjacent doors between the rooms are not, so beware of that. And regular hotel elevators are a bit quirky. \nOn a good note though, the rooms were decent, and a Times Square view on the 30th floor is awesome and worth it. Beds were amazing, super comfy beds and sheets and pillows. Shower is cool too. And you cannot beat the location if you want it all - theatre district, restaurants, shopping, Times Square, etc. Blackout curtains are awesome, I slept in every day! \nI think if I ran this hotel, I'd up the perks for the Destination Fee, (or just get rid of it!) and definitely make free coffee, FREE, or at least in room.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Then every time you arrive or leave the hotel you need to do the same, so two elevators to get to and from your room. As you can imagine, it's a pain and can cause delays and queuing. \n\nThe walls are thin. One night the people next door were having party, somebody else called security which sorted it. You can pretty much hear conversations the walls are so thin. One night the couple next door were having a 'good time', that would have been awkward with kids in the room!\n\nThe room was clean and dark and the bathroom was nice. AC worked well.

After jewelry came up missing on the 6th or 7th day of our stay, I called for the security to come up. After 45 minutes, no one showed up. So, I called to request security and the police this time. At this point security came up and told me that they were the ones who had gone in my room and that it was a fire alarm went off after we left (only in our room!) No one had told us anything when we came back , there was no note on the door, nor any messages left on our phones. Nothing was said until we called down to complain!! OMG! SMH! When I asked for the police, can you believe they werecalled, but not for me?! They were called on me!!!

WOW!! We had been there for about 6 or 7 days of a 12 night stay.

They lied and said its for a smoking fee, but we don't smoke and it was never mentioned until I got the partial refund a month later.

GREAT location, we could walk almost anywhere in the city! \n-The lobby was absolute beautiful, it was a scene out of a Christmas movie. \n-SOME of the staff was very accommodating and courteous, others not so much. \n-Beautiful views from the rooftop terrace of Times Square, this will be where you can get the best pics. \n\nNow the CONS: \n-I can't really count the price we paid as a con because everything in NYC was overpriced for the week of NYE, but for what we got, it DEFINITELY was overpriced for the quality of room we got. \n-We booked a room for a \"partial ball view\", when I checked it, I was advised by the front desk agent and manager, Vita that that room did not exist. I showed them my receipt which showed the type of room and I also tried booking that same room online  right in front of them and it showed it was available. She told me she didn't know why it was saying that but that room was not available and did not exist. And since it was the day after Christmas, all rooms were full that had a Times Square view, so they said they could move us the next day to a \"Full Times Square View\". For that night they put us in a \"city view\" which is just looking at some buildings, not much of a view. The next day we were moved to a \"full Times Square View\" room which was really only half a view since there are buildings in the way so just know its no a full Times Square View it is obstructed.\n-When you visit a hotel in the winter in NYC, call ahead to see if their hotel rooms are individually able to heat\/cool or if it is controlled by hotel. We did not call ahead and this hotel was in Heat Mode therefore you could not use the AC in your own room. Our room did not go above 79-82 degrees the whole time we were there until the last night when they were finally able to turn the AC back on, I am sure because plenty of people were complaining. I asked for a fan for the room, and of course they said they do not allow fans in the rooms and they did not have any. Not sure how much of that I believe that they don't have a fan in the building. So clearly,  we were not able to sleep even after opening the window, which was their solution for us. \nTheres so much more, but theres limited space here. Good luck:)","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We just had coffee in the mornings and if you want to have a kettle or anything in the room and just ask and they will accommodate this for you. The room is very clean, very spacious and the bed was super comfy. We want one back at home! \n\nThe only thing I would say is to go to reception you have to go up 5 floors in the lift and then you check into reception and then obviously depending on what room you\u2019re going to depends how far you would go up in the lift, so we were on the 28th floor and I found myself feeling dizzy most of the time with all the motion of the lifts and obviously being so high up. Next time we won\u2019t stay so high up but it was worth it for the views. \n\nCouldn\u2019t fault this hotel, very trendy, very clean and a location to die for. When you first arrive downstairs, they will tell you that you need to go up to the 5th floor to check in, and the guys downstairs and the reception on the 5th floor were absolutely amazing and couldn\u2019t do enough for us.

The rooms are rather pricy but that\u2019s normal in NY, especially if you have a room overlooking Times Square. The staff is (mostly) friendly and courteous. There is a 10$ voucher that you can use every day in the bar. They hotel has room service which is not a given in NY after the COVID related down scaling of services in hotels due to lack of guests and staff. The food is OK, though the quality and quantity varies from day to day. Be careful with your laundry service. I overlooked that the day I was handing in my laundry was a holiday and I was charged a hefty $140 for a few underwear, T Shirts and socks due to an additional holiday\/Sunday fee. However, after raising the matter with the hotel manager - who handled the matter in a very friendly and professional manner unlike the operator I spoke to first - a discount was added to my bill that compensated for the additional holiday laundry fee. Since it was me that had overlooked the holiday, this was a nice and welcome gesture that I much appreciated. Overall, the hotel can be recommended though the rooms are a little too small for the price. They are, however, modern, clean and comfortable.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Positive : good location, rooms ok. But ...\n\n1) At check-in both rooms were reserved to my wife's credit card based on prices including taxes received at booking time. But it turned out a lot of extra charges came on top of it which lead that my wife's credit card limit was reached far more quicker than we thought so she could not use her credit card anymore during the week. The next day we asked to change this reservation for 1 room from her credit card to my credit card to release part of the reservation on her credit card so she could use again for payments. This was done but the receptionist clearly expressed she did not like that request. And then a few days later it turned out the room was reserved twice both to my and my wife's credit card. It was a mistake that had an important impact on our stay in NY.\n\n2) After check-in and settled in the rooms we wanted to enjoy the rooftop bar with spectacular view. This was one of the reasons we choose this hotel. We wanted to order drinks at the bar to take outside but the bar tender refused to serve us as we were not planning to sit at the bar. We were told to go outside and wait for a waitress to serve us. Clearly this was going to take a lot of time as she was alone so my wife tried again to be served at the bar but was completely ignored by the bar tender. We decided to go elsewhere and never used the bar and rooftop bar again because of this bad service. I mentioned this to the staff at the reception without any further follow-up done.\n\n3) After we checked out, we left our luggage downstairs with the bellboy as we had still some time before needing to leave to the airport. The bellboy was very rude when answering my questions like if our luggage was being kept safe or when we wanted to take something out of that luggage later in the day.\n\nI will not recommend this hotel to anyone planning to stay in NY mainly because of the bad service we received. And with a next trip to NY, I will definitely choose another hotel.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Hotel was located right on the edge of times square, 2 mins walk from centre of TS, with McDonald's and corner store with food, drink and pharmaceutical supplies directly below. \n\nThe lobby being a few floors up from street level has a fantastic lounging space with a bar and dining area. A few games and TVs are about to help keep you entertained. The roof top bar and terrace, which is actually about 5 floors up from ground level (same floor as main lobby) rather than the top of the building, has fantastic views of times square and the street below, with a good selection of drinks on offer.\n\nRoom was very nice and spacious, very clean and nice and quiet at night. We had a room facing the Hudson River 20 floors up, so that probably helped it being a bit quieter than facing times square, but we didn't notice any outside noise. \n\nOnly feedback I'd give is to provide bottled water and a kettle with tea \/ coffee making facilities in the room, as there was none. Other than that though, everything else was top notch. We had some friends come back to our hotel one evening and said it was way better than where they were staying.

But first, the people who work here are lovely and helpful, and no issues there.\n\nThe lobby is fine, music is too loud to actually hear the soft-spoken staff. Elevator buttons only sometimes work, so you're just as likely to sail past your floor as stop on it. Rooms are big for NY standards, but the highlights stop there. The brown bathroom shows off all the grime and grossness that had obviously not been cleaned. The towels, toilet paper, and bedding all seem to be designed for exfoliating for as rough as they are. The duvet is so light I thought they'd forgotten to include one (I asked for another, and they brought me a dirty blanket). The lighting is awful -- like they have to pay a wattage tax. The bed is very firm and the pillows are an odd assortment. There is certainly nothing plush about this space. There's also no hand soap, which is odd (especially given these covid times), no room service (or no menu\/anything indicating they have it), no information about other hotel amenities like a gym, few outlets, and --in my room -- holes in the wall where I guess the TV was previously?

I was taking a shower, sat on the shower seat (part of why I booked the room for those with disabilities) and it broke right from the wall. The legs shot up, gouged into my back, my hand hit the metal pole trying to brace the fall and I twisted my knee. My back is killing me, arm is hurt and as soon as I arrive home Ive already made an appointment with my doctor. The staff came to help after I called, with bags of ice to aid with the pain and swelling and reported the incident. After speaking to the manager, she said she was sorry and took me to another room. The new room bathroom seat IS ALSO BROKEN. This time I checked the bolts and they were broken off, after I was already assured the new room was safe. Absolutely unbelievable. After doing research it\u2019s clear to me they are out of compliance with ADA for the safety of these bathrooms. The manager I spoke with today did not care at all. When I asked how they are going to make this right and ensure this does not happen to others, she said they would cover my incidentals and my breakfast. It was almost laughable. I stood in front of her speechless, they clearly do not care about the health and safety of their customers. A free breakfast? Are you serious? Her body language said it all, she didn\u2019t not give a single care in the world. This is not how you treat your customers. I am sitting in my hotel room still in pain, and will soon find out the extent of my injuries when I come back to Canada. I can\u2019t believe how little compassion this manager had for my situation, I was so angry but I kept it all inside of me to keep respectful but I need to tell the world.

The \"rooftop bar\" is really an outdoor deck on the second floor. If I'd known this, I would not have booked this hotel. \n\nOther disappointments include: having to call room service for a bar of soap (at least it came immediately), having to call room service for a coffee maker (this would be a basic offering in a true 4 star, no?), having to receive a dirty coffee maker (seriously??) and a bathroom that while not filthy was definitely not clean. There was nothing about the decor or room that was 4-star, so honestly I feel it's mis-represented as a 4 star establishment. \n\nThere is a bar and lounge (with tired, stained furniture) in the lobby. It had a live DJ, was very social with a lot of different people (families with young kids, 20 somethings, boomers and everything in between), but it wasn't clear whether the people were hotel guests so it made one feel like you are just hanging out in a Dave & Busters on your way upstairs. \n\nThe folks are the front desk were very friendly (as were all the staff) but obviously over worked. At check out, I told them about the soap and coffee and the guy took a day's resort fee off of my bill. However, I haven't had a chance to review the bill in detail yet.

I paid for a Times Square Premier Room. There was nothing premier about it. The carpets are worn, the bathroom was tiny and needed a good clean. There were no tea\/coffee making facilities. It did not feel like a four star hotel - more like a tired travelodge.\n\nOn the plus side the view from the room was fabulous.\n\nThe lobby and bar area were quite frantic - I\u2019m not sure what market the hotel is aiming at - is it families, couples or young people?\n\nThe biggest problem was the noise at night from other rooms. We called security on the last night at midnight and they came and asked the occupants to keep the noise down - whilst the noise was lowered the selfish occupant thought it appropriate to crank up the music again at 2am. Whilst I appreciate this is not the hotel\u2019s fault it did mean that we had very little sleep during our 3 night stay.\n\nLocation wise it is well situated but since NYC has legalised cannabis everywhere around the hotel were weed shops and people off their faces on drugs. Times Square is returning to its bad days and therefore the hotel\u2019s location is probably now a minus rather than a plus point.\n\nSo I would not recommend this hotel and will not be returning.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not only that, she told us to have a seat in the lobby & gave our 2 sons a toy yellow taxi each to play with while we waited. Such a nice touch & they were thrilled with their gift. \nSo Stella sorted our room and because of the \u201cinconvenience\u201d (10 minute wait) also upgraded our room from the 12th floor to the 29th. Already, we felt like our business was wanted in the hotel & we couldn\u2019t have felt more welcome. \nWe got to our room & oh my God- the view overlooking Times Square was unbelievable. \nRooms were extremely clean & a good size for Manhattan. \nThe next morning we had breakfast in the hotel. One of our sons is autistic with a very limited diet. \nWe explained this to the staff & they had no problem whatsoever with him having his own breakfast cereal we had brought with us- in fact, they even gave us hot milk every morning for it. After the 1st day we didn\u2019t even have to ask for it. \nThe Breakfast buffet was delicious with so much choice & really set us up for the day. It was great value as well. \nCarlos was our waiter every day for our breakfast & what a nice guy he was. Even when they were busy he & all the other wait staff were so friendly and welcoming. \nThe lobby had such a cool child friendly zone. Games console with gaming chairs, foosball table and other games. My sons loved it. Really chilled out vibe & felt safe to let the kids play away. \nIt also has such a cool rooftop terrace which I\u2019m sure would be amazing to sit out on in warmer months. \nI would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to any type of traveler, family, couples, friends, business etc. \nThank you to the M Social, in particular Stella & Carlos for making our first family trip to NYC an unforgettable experience.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hugh thank you for all of that.  Our booked room was nice, had a good view of Time Square that we wanted.  Bed was nice, room had good amount of space, the bathroom had a big shower but rest of bathroom was small.  The housekeeping was very good too.  The only issues we that you had to use 2 different elevators to get to ground level, which there was usually a line from lobby to ground.  The other issue was the bar.  For some reason the outside was closed (maybe too cold or windy, but could never find out why), they were pricey drinks, either didn't know how to make various drinks or didn't have the ingredients to do so, and I'm not talking about very new or very obscure drinks (I was ordering painkillers, zombies, tropical stuff), and once I found a drink they could do, it wasn't exactly right ( never seen a green rum punch) it tasted ok but wasn't really what I wanted, esp for the price.
