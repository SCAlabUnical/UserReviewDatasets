We arrived and the lobby bar was the one that was open so we went there first. The atmosphere was lovely, bright and buzzing without being overwhelming or too loud, the staff friendly and helpful, and drinks were fab - my parter said his G&T was one of the best he ever had, and bring British, he's had his fair share. I had two of their specialities which were both delicious. Being a bit of a hotel fanatic, I asked if we could have a show round, and the hotel manager, Pere, was kind enough to show us around. The rooms are lush - they look well kept, with big cosy beds and wonderful bathroom amenities, and as a massive bonus, the rooms are quite large for NYC! Would love to stay here at my next visit to the city. After being shown around we popped in to the lounge for another round of drinks and had a wonderful time there too. The atmosphere in here was great too, more dimmed lights, candles and private. We sat at the bar and it was a joy to sit here and watch the bar manager perform his craft - and the cocktails were perfection! We had a brilliant time at The Smyth Tribeca, Pere and his team looked after us so well and we felt incredibly welcome. The hotel also smells fantastic, and they even sell their signature scent in candles and a room spray - I treated myself to a candle which I love lighting here at home.

However, when I checked in there was none of the usual greeting of \"how was your trip\",  just the desk receptionist complaining to me about the guest who had been on the phone! And very hurried in his service as a large group came in behind me. \n\nThe room itself was fine, larger than standard NY hotel rooms, but with very basic decor, which was considerably different from my first stay where the room had a wow factor.  \n\nOverall the hotel location is good for accessing the financial district. There is a gym in the building which is also sufficient. The reception area is very chic, but perhaps out of sync with some of the rooms which require refurbishment. \n\nI held a team dinner in the restaurant, which has lovely decor and ambiance. Although the food was underwhelming, which was a surprise given it was restaurant week in New York. A colleague had duck which was not to his liking and another colleague and I had seafood pasta which was overly rich to the extent it was hard to digest. The service was quite peculiar, including a waiter pouring water into a colleague's tequila. Fortunately, this was replaced, and placed in a different type of glass to the water glass (which seemed like an obvious thing to do in the first place). \n\nMy major disappointment with the hotel began at checkout. I had used the minibar and wanted to place those costs on my personal card vs corporate card. I listed the items that I had consumed for my entire stay and was told they would appear as a separate bill beneath the room bill. Unlike normal procedures at hotels, I was not shown what was listed on the screen - nor given a printout - I was told it would be emailed. I checked that the hotel had my correct email address, and given there was a queue and yet again the reception desk seemed hurried, I accepted that it would be emailed immediately for my review. Also given I had explicitly listed my minibar items with reception, I had assumed there would be no issues. \n\nI did not receive the bill via email and due to a hectic work schedule only realized this once I needed to do my expenses several weeks later. Once I was sent the invoice, I realized that there were minibar expenses included in the invoice for the room and the amount I had paid on my card was just deducted from this part of the room invoice. An additional invoice for the mini bar was then listed below, which had been charged to my corporate card and was for a significant amount of money. I do not believe this to be correct given I had noted and explicitly listed what I had consumed for my entire stay at checkout.  In addition, I had also been charged for \"donations\" which I had not approved. \n\nOn raising these issues with the hotel, the response fell very short of acceptable service. No apology or explanation for charging the donation fee without permission (the invoice was reissued with it removed on my request, although I have yet to confirm it has been refunded). No explanation as to why the reception desk did not show me the minibar charges at checkout. No apology for not sending the invoice. No explanation why additional minibar charges were made to my corporate card - and no note to state they were going to be made in advance -  or any clear proof they were in fact correct, just refusal to refund them!\n\nI do hope the hotel takes this feedback seriously as it was amongst my favorite New York hotels, although unfortunately given this experience I will not be returning to assess whether any actions have been made to improve. In the first instance, showing the guest charges to be made when they checkout is important and getting explicit approval for items like donations is a must.  If additional charges are being made to a guest's card, then advising that via email is needed. Ensuring an invoice is actually provided should also be a priority. And responding to guest requests with a helpful tone would also improve the experience.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We can give you a glass of champagne each instead.\" I completely understood we weren't entitled to anything at all, so I said \"Okay thank you.\" But I still don't understand why Person2 was so exasperated, as I knew the comp was limited to $75. Even if it went above $75, they could have charged the extra to my room. Instead the group of us had to stand awkwardly at the front desk while this strange exchange happened...  \n\n2. Dirty Room: The trash from the previous guest was not emptied, and was filled over the brim. The corner of the closet door was broken off, and there was a strange brown streak on the wall of the bathroom. \n\n3. Malfunctioning Bedroom door: We stayed in a suite where there was a bedroom door. When my husband shut the door to the bedroom from the outside, we were locked out of the bedroom. We went to the front desk and they called the hotel \"engineer\" (similar to a super?) to fix it. He did a great job, and we were thankful. \n\n4. $1100+ bill from the Hotel (!!): After we checked out, I was extremely dissatisfied and confused to receive a bill for $1100+. I called the Hotel and thankfully Person1 answered. He apologized for all of the inconveniences I experienced, and corrected the mistaken charges to $300+ (which was accurate for parking and hotel fees). He even took off one of the fees because of the trash that was not emptied from the previous guest. I was extremely grateful for the ease of this conversation.\n\n5. The $65 straw that broke the camel's back: 2+ weeks later, I received yet another charge on my card for $65 from the hotel. My stay was already over 3 weeks ago. This is why I am writing this review, this is completely unacceptable and borderline-fraudulent behavior from whoever is approving and executing these charges at the hotel. No matter how convenient and great the location, how great SOME of the staff are, I will never stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I normally just send the staff a review so they can make adjustments for the next customers. However, when I checked on this morning the gentlemen at the front counter was so nonchalant about my experience and couldn\u2019t have cared less. The following was my feedback to them when I received an automated message about my stay: \n\nHi thank you for checking in. Quite honestly other than the friendliness of the gentlemen who brought us to our room and some of the front desk staff, this has been a disappointment. I would rate our experience a 2\/5. \n\nHere is why we have had a poor experience:\n\n1. The couch bed mattress should be thrown away. The hard wire springs are so prominent it visibly protrudes from the mattress and if you simply place your hand on top of it, you can feel it. No one should pay to sleep on it.\n\n2. I called the front desk last night to tell them about the mattress and asked that someone bring up more comforters so I could create a makeshift mattress so that I would not be in pain in the morning. The housekeeper brought me fleece blankets.\n\n3. I called the front desk again and told them I wasn't cold but needed a thicker comforter because the mattress was bad. The same man brought me a bunch of sheets, a thin comforter and then told me he was on his way home when I called.\n\n4. No one apologized for the condition of the bed or offered to change our room. \n\n5. Today we put a \"quiet please\" sign on our door because we did not want service since we are here for such a short stay. We just walked back into the room to find that it happened anyway and my mother was very upset that someone touched her personal items.\n\n6. Though we got housekeeping we did not want, the hand soap in the restroom is empty. \n\n7. The place was only prepared for 2 people and not three. There are only two glasses, two robes and the couch bed was made after we arrived and it looked like someone threw the blankets on it with two different sized pillows \n\nThis is way too expensive of a hotel for any of the above to happen. I wanted to pay for a higher quality hotel so that we could get a higher quality experience. Instead I've slept  poorly, and I am frustrated and tired. \n\nI book this trip as a Christmas present for my mother and needless to say it has been a major let down","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Despite the post-lockdown era \"empty\" vibes of New York's once bustling office districts, The Smyth feels like an approachably luxurious oasis that is still walkable to everything of interest downtown (including the still bustling Tribeca) and steps away from multiple transit hubs to take you anywhere further afield. The room was huge by New York standards and well-appointed with a comfortable bed and a large tv with built-in streaming capabilities. I was even able to catch a view of One World Trade Center from the window. The bathroom was bright and also generously-sized. Toiletries were large re-usable bottles, but of high quality nonetheless. The room was spotless. Probably the only thing really missing was robes, which are usually a standard at hotels at this price point, but not a huge deal. Overall this is one of the best rooms I've stayed at in New York and definitely is a cut above several I've stayed in that were twice the price and half the size. While I didn't have too many interactions with staff beyond a quick check-in, everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall a great stay and a great property, I look forward to returning and recommending to others.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

However, I had such an unimpressive experience, particularly for the money paid.\n\nI arrived after a long drive just after midnight.  I didn't receive much help with my bags or my bike, which I learned they cannot store and it needed to stay in the room with me.  Managing it in the elevator wasn't too fun.  \nParking my car was chaotic - the lot is 24 hours but it does close the gates, it felt like a riddle trying to find the place, stand outside the closed gate in the cold calling them, and finally dropping my car.\n\nBack in the room, it wasn't cleaned.  There was a damp washcloth on the nightstand and a bottle cap with the glasses.  They have limited amenities for food and I went to bed hungry (it was that or eat gummy bears).\n\nI will say - the beds are heavenly. But there is no view from the third floor other than construction and street noise. There's also limited attraction to the room, it looks sterile and has an odd amount of closet space.\n\nI cancelled my second night and went to a different hotel that was rated higher and cost slightly less, I enjoyed that stay much more.  Plus parking there was $35 a night, at the Smyth its $60.\n\nThis place is waaaay too much money for what it offers - they should be charging half of what they are for what they offer.

The 1st thing I noticed is that It was difficult to find the hotel as the hotel's front doors were closed and no one was there to open them. I had to open two dark and big doors by myself while I was handling my luggage. \n2. The carpet outside of the room was very dirty: the 1st time I see this in a hotel.\n3. The toilet's room smells so bad, it may be a plumbing problem.\n4. There is no tea or coffee bag nor machine in the room.\n5. The bedding sets were wet and do not seem to be clean as they are smelly.\n6. Also, I had the breakfast included. They told me that they serve brunch for breakfast during the weekends. But they only served me: tea, orange juice, small slices of fruits, one pastry and one small piece of bread. You have to pay for other things.\n7. Also, I called them and ordered dinner. They told me that the fries cost 9$ but I paid 11$.\nI ordered pasta and fries, the total without (taxes, tips, ...) cost me 37$.\nThey charge you the amount they want for tips, and I also paid additional fees, the total amount I paid for, all the fees included, was 51.61$. And the fries were not fresh unfortunately and therefore not good, the oil they used to cook the fries seems to be old.\n8. the room is not very well maintained.\n9. the shower is not convenient for everyone at least not for me.\n10. And finally the bad is not comfortable at all, I didn't sleep well last night. I am really having a bad experience here that I can't wait to go back home and sleep in my place.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was thrilled with my choice of AKA Tribeca, mainly due to the location which in my opinion is the best to stay in New York.  Tribeca is such a great area for eating, drinking,and also for many sights including the 911 Memorial,  just perfect for us as not quite so crazy as uptown!  The staff both on reception and on the door were so helpful with providing information and the free drinks and snacks available were much appreciated.  We loved the rooftop terrace with amazing views which we used quite a few times. The rooms are spacious and clean, lovely to come back to after a hard days' pavement pounding.   The only gripe was that on returning to the hotel in the evenings after 1030 we were unable to purchase any drinks in the bar despite being residents. We would love to return to New York and would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There are no charging stations beside the bed when should be on both sides.  I carry an extension cord while traveling and accessing the single outlet beside the bed involved some gymnastics and moving of furniture.  But then I have my own charging station.  The bathrooms have barn-door sliding doors which do not reduce noise and the shower juts into the bedroom with frosted glass revealing the person in shower.  The rooms are fairly quiet.  The beds are very low--a warning to the over 70 set.  The doormen\/bellmen and front desk are very friendly and helpful.  Hotel undergoing renovation during my stay and lobby unavailable.  W. Broadway, in front of hotel, has been under construction repeatedly and I found both left lanes blocked and Uber had to dump me on other side of street.  Best to call front desk and ask what current situation is to know how to direct driver.  I use this hotel solely for its location two blocks from family.  AS noted in other reviews, no complimentary coffee in room OR in lobby.  Also the elevator area is poorly lit (on lobby level), particularly difficult when walking in from bright sun to dim space and trying to find correct end of keycard to insert in elevator.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Stayed in Room 410.  The hotel is right on top of the subway.  At the fourth story level, that wasn't a problem, but the buses etc. were loud but not enough to prevent sleep.  I will bring earplugs next time.  This is a 12 story hotel -- so some guests who are sensitive will want to stay in upper floors.\n\nNow the good.  The breakfast place -- the Little Park is phenomenal.  I had bruleed grapefruit for the first time in my life.  Wow!  I am ready to buy a brulee heat gun!  I also had the smoked salmon.  Really delicious and seasoning was unusually good.  Bam.  \n\nThe room was great too.  Bed was a little soft but just fine.  The bathroom was really over the top in finishes.  You don't see tubs in new hotels much anymore.  And despite the hotel being about 9 years old or so, everything looked brand new.\n\nOverall, easy five stars.  Little Park Restaurant is six stars for breakfast.  I have not mentioned the staff.  Extremely friendly.  This is like a cozy neighborhood joint.  Really well done.  Will stay here again.

I can\u2019t wait to see them!The team was enormously helpful and responsive to our needs and tried their very best to make everything as stress free as possible. They cleaned up after we left for the wedding so that the room would be ready for the afterparty. The standard rooms are also lovely, clean and large.

After having many great experiences staying in various hotels in Tribeca over the years, it was exciting to try a new place. \nHotel Smyth is very close to my son's new apartment and came highly recommended by my daughter in law's family that travels to NYC from Cleveland. \n\nI booked with the hotel directly, speaking with Jean Carlo Ventura. He could not have been more accommodating, patient with my various requests and questions, in one word, excellent and efficient representation of the hotel. \nOn arrival, the next afternoon I was greeted by bellman who came outside to the car to see if I needed help. I arrived around 5 PM and was pleased to meet Jean Carlo at the front desk. He checked me in without delay.  \n\nThe room was everything I requested. High floor, King size bed. Modern, spacious, bright and clean with wall of windows overlooking the street below. At the last minute my husband could not make the trip, so I was traveling solo. At first look I liked the comfortably sized spacious room. The bathroom was modern and spotless, nice toiletries. Bathrobe, slippers, minibar. High quality linens. \nOn the desk in the room was a kind and welcoming note from Jean Carlo, beautifully arranged plate with fruit and large bottle of sparkling water. And within minutes a follow up phone call inquiry if everything was satisfactory. So all in all, an excellent and flawless start.  \nI am a frequent traveler in the US and abroad and this kind of wonderful service we usually get in 5 star hotels and pricey resorts, where we often are repeat guests. \nI did not quite expect it this time, especially just booking an overnight stay. It was certainly very much appreciated. \n\nI left the hotel room just minutes after my arrival. When I returned, quite late at night, the room was freezing. (65 degrees). I tried to adjust the thermostat, the bathroom was freezing too. So taking a shower was out of a question. I was hoping that the room will warm up during the night. I woke up early shivering cold! The front desk tried to help, sending staff up repeatedly, checked the windows, yes they were closed, adjusting the thermostat ... it just would not work. Followed up with several trips with portable heaters, first one, then second one later for the freezing bathroom. The heat from the heaters was cancelled out by the cold air coming from the ceiling above. \nWith all the hope for a peaceful start to the day gone, I was forced to get out of bed where I was trying to stay warm, to open the door numerous times to staff who genuinely tried to be helpful. (Thank you,Sandy). \nYes, it probably would have been better to move to another room, and it was offered. But it was highly inconvenient, especially because all I wanted was a quick hot shower and early check out, to move on with my busy day, spending time with my family. The one and only reason traveling into the city. I never thought it would take so much time without resolution. It was miserable and huge waste of my limited time that day.  \n\nWhen I finally realized that all this effort was an exercise in futility, taking much longer than expected, I gave up and checked out. After speaking with the assistant Manager Diana Tzanis at the check out, she offered 15% adjustment to the one night hotel rate. As she put it ...\" for the inconvenience!\" \nYes, I absolutely agreed with her that it was a huge inconvenience, more than inconvenience really, especially if one only comes to the hotel to just overnight. To be able to take a hot shower and get a good night sleep in a reasonably warm room and bathroom should be the minimum. \nThe 15% discount was a \"token\" that did not make me feel any better at that moment. More like adding an insult to the injury ! Any 5 star hotel would have comped the night. Without a doubt!  \nAbout a week later I received an email from Ms.Tzanis, once again apologizing for the unfortunate situation, offering a discounted rate for a future stay.  \n\nAm I going to book our next stay in Tribeca in hotel Smyth?  Absolutely! \n\nBecause this year the winter was unusually brutal, there were heating problems everywhere and I believe in second chances:) \nWe will come back with high hopes for a much more comfortable stay! \n \nI took a car service from NJ, so I did not need parking. There are several parking garages nearby, should you arrive by car. Hotel's valet parking is most likely also  available.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

However, upon arrival we found that we had arrived on a day of transition from Thompson ownership to a new ownership group.  Perhaps this transition had to do with a very mediocre stay that would not lead me back to this property. Regarding the stay itself, we began by arriving in Newark and being taken by car to the hotel.  During the transit I contacted the hotel to request early check-in, which was denied as they \"had no rooms available\".   Upon arrival, I again requested early check-in (it was right around 12N at the time) and advised that we could not have room until after 4 PM.  I explained to the desk clerk that I understood but we had theatre tickets and needed to change prior to leaving the hotel right around that time.  He advised that they would text us if a room became available.  We set off to have some lunch and walk a bit.  Around 2:30 PM we returned and I again inquired, to which I was again told \"no\".  My wife was a bit frustrated and a very nice bellman noticed and suggested that he could take us to the gym where there was a sizable bathroom that we could use to change.  This was the first effort anyone made to assist us and the theme continued throughout the stay.  Upon return late that evening we were given room keys and our bags were delivered to the room, where a new bellman told me of his challenging day due to the ownership change.  This was the first we had heard of this and perhaps had someone mentioned it earlier we would have been more understanding, although the lack of interest in helping was still a bit disappointing. Our room was ok, but definitely needed some upgrading with damage to cabinets and stains on the chairs.  Pillows were dreadfully flat and uncomfortable as well. But, we made it through the night and checked out in the morning.  Still no mention of the change in ownership and still a rather stoic desk crew.  Again, the bellman from the prior day was there to \"save the day\" as he helped with our bags and organized a car back to the airport.  In summation, outside of a very nice and helpful bellman, not much else I can say positive about our stay at Smyth Hotel.  This will not be a return property for us in NYC.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Great location in TriBeCa and an unbelievable staff.  Very helpful and friendly.  Room is nice, akin to a W in style, but not fabulous - except when considering the price!  Great value, much better than The Beekman for example.  Excellent fitness facility that isn't mentioned on the website.  Only negative to the room is that there is not a makeup mirror, which frustrated my wife.  Only other minor complaint is that there isn't a complementary coffee\/tea service in the morning, meaning you have to spend $23 for a small pot of coffee and a pot of tea.  Again, not terrible given the room prices ($188\/night) for a King Superior, which is an interior room that is extremely quiet.

The price we paid was moderate ($250ish with taxes) and the reviews were very good.  Our experience may have somehow been unusual but I can't imagine how?\n\nMy review is intended to reflect the expectation that this was a 5 star \"upscale\" hotel.\n\nWhen we first arrived, we were a bit lost as the GPS had us going to an address on the street around the corner. I called the hotel to ask where I was going wrong and the clerk was not helpful.  She couldn't give me specific instructions even though I was literally 2 blocks away.\n\nWe pulled in front and there were no spaces in the drop off area.  My wife ran in to ask what we should do and was told to just wait in the car and someone would be out.  So we waited for around 5 minutes.  The same desk clerk came out and vaguely said to pull the car forward and just leave it there.  There was no doorman or valet.  It was strange for an upscale hotel.\n\nThe room was very small, even for NYC (#414).  It was unremarkable but clean.  There were several things that we really didn't like.  The bathroom is extremely awkward.  The shower wall is around 3 feet from the side of the bed and is frosted glass so basically you can see the person showering, especially if they are close to the wall.  Depending on who you are with this could be totally inappropriate. \n\nThere is also no real bathroom door.  There is a sliding barn style door that does not seal in the opening meaning you can very easily hear the person in the bathroom doing whatever it is they are doing.  I'm not exaggerating.  You can hear in the bathroom as if there was no wall or door.  In a super small room, it is very awkward.\n\nThe heating system would not work and kept making a grinding noise.  I had it set to cool and on auto.  I went over to fiddle with the controls and see if I could figure something out.  I put the fan on low and it made a humming electrical noise.  I put it on medium and it did not work at all.  I had to put it on high for it to work but then it was on high all night.\n\nA few more strange things...  The lamp next to one side of the bed was unplugged and the cord wrapped up.  There were no easily accessible plugs around the beds for phone charging.  No coffee maker.  The heating light in the bathroom had a timer on the wall but did not work.\n\nI've probably stayed in 15 NYC hotels.  I'm definitely not the most critical person and definitely don't often stay at the fanciest hotels, anywhere I go.  Just for context, this is not an upscale hotel and there are many better options at a lower cost around the city.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is our go to hotel in NY.  Things are a bit quirky over the holidays perhaps.  Most uncomfortable was the way the thermostat in the room seems to not affect the temperature in the room.  We stayed five nights and over the six days we went from chilly and unable to warm room to two days of constant proper temperature to last day of chilly, uncomfortably chilly.  when we first complained, the desk promised to have engineering take a look and when we returned the room was a comfortable temperature.  We did not touch the thermostat for three days but on the third day returned to find room again getting colder and colder even though the thermostat was still set the same, endured two nights like that.  Attempted to talk to engineer but got nowhere.  Except it seemed as if he could control temperature of whole building from basement--very strange.  I had an extended  discussion with front desk, but they seemed to not have a clue.  We checked out as planned and then returned for one night to room on same floor.  Found the thermostat in that room set to A\/C; room chilly so we put to Auto\/Auto and eventually room warmed.  IF the thermostat is only a supplement to the main heating, guests need to be advised.  This was a strange problem, but we were gone for most of every day and returned to sleep and were not interested in calling and having someone come to room after we had retired.  We requested extra pillows at beginning of stay only to have one disappear after room cleaning two days later.  On second check in we requested an extra luggage rack which never arrived.  Since our experience with Smyth is that all requests are promptly we suspect it was holiday season which caused some of the \"misses\".   The rooms are very comfortable and amazingly little street noise.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Within minutes the response was 'yes, no problem.'  When I arrived hours later, two copies were waiting for me in my room. \n\nThere are two bars which are both great if you need to schedule meetings. It's a super easy location for anyone to get to.

We picked this hotel for this precise reason. Overall, I think the hotel was good, but there were a few things that could have been better. The staff was  mediocre with the exception of the front desk personnel on our last day (when checking out). We arrived on Friday evening at ten o'clock--very tired from our drive and couldn't wait to lay down for a bit, however, the valet was slow, needles to say he was in front of the entrance for awhile and it wasn't until we approached him that he came out to help.  Upon checking in, we were greeted by someone who was not the friendliest but also not the most rude, simply put he was just doing his job and we were just other customers.\n\nIn any case, the room was good, clean and provided comfort and it was a good home away from home. I think one of the biggest problems with the room was the AC, It was too loud and I didn't serve its purpose--did not provide ventilation\/cool air. Another thing I did not particularly like was the fact that the room only had one robe and even though I placed it on the floor when I was done, the cleaning lady put it back on the hook instead of replacing it with a clean one. On our second day, the hot water was shut off due to emergency repairs on the road. This was out of their control and I understand this, however, their repose when called was \" oh sorry, emergency repair we just put a note under your door...\". I think almost all interactions I had with the staff were not impressive. In addition to the hotel staff, the restaurant staff was by far the worse. Our waiter took our order, gave us coffee, brought the food out and disappeared. He didnt even ask if we wanted a drink--which we did and did not once ask how the food came out.   I get it, its job and with so much incoming visitors in the city, its easy disconnect from the customers,  but at the end of the day it is important to make people staying there feel comfortable so they can choose to come back. Great customer service goes a long way and could have made our stay a lot better and would have truly made us come back. With this being said, one of the things that made this hotel stand out from the rest was the complementary chocolate and water. It was a nice touch to come back to this after a long day in the city. It is small gestures like this that truly go along way.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms at Smyth are enormous by NYC standards and very clean, chic and modern. Here is my issue and this is really me being tough on them because it is a luxury hotel and thus the standard must be higher: 1. the people at the front desk are cold and unfriendly. Typically at a nice hotel you get a smile, some travel tips, maybe a cold drink. Our front desk folks barely looked up at us. 2. they don't have a coffee machine in the room and don't offer any kind of complimentary coffee service. I think they told me a pot of coffee would be like 20 bucks. Thank goodness this was not a work trip or I think I would be furious! We were annoyed but were heading to a nice brunch so we skipped the coffee at the hotel. One really positive thing was my friend left a nice pair of diamond earrings in the room and when she called they still had them and held them at the front desk for her. All in all this was a fine stay, amazing location, and huge rooms. I preferred the staff at the Soho Grand though - which is nearby and typically a little more reasonable price wise (plus they greet you with champagne!).

We checked in at 3:00 and went for a quick walk. Got back to the room at 4:30 and someone was in our room because the shades were closed (we left them open) and there was water and chocolates. Why come at 4:30 and do a half assed turn down service. Then at 8:30 this morning house keeping knocked on the door and did not say anything. They knocked a second time (still saying nothing) and opened the door while I was in bed. Who cleans a room at 8:30am and who doesn't announce themselves before entering a hotel room!!?!

The hotel lacks a personal touch, no decorations whatsoever in the rooms (in artsy tribeca!), very minimalistic, but if you're into it... what i found strange was the darkness (probably an attempt at creating a \"cozy\" atmosphere), you basically have to feel your way from the elevator to your room where you'll struggle to find the slot for your room key. Staff is nice but not in a remarkable way. Didn't try the restaurant, famed for farm-to-table-meals but the menu was pretty basic and very expensive (just the way I like it. Not.) There are plenty of alternatives around the hotel, from low-key diners and delis to more upscale dining options.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is a great charming individual boutique hotel perfectly located to explore TriBeCa and lower Manhattan. It's own restaurant Little Park is very good (we've had dinner there before and had breakfast there on this trip) and the hotel is an easy walk to many great classic neighborhood places both new and old like Locanda Verde, Bouley, The Odeon and even simple but delicious falafel joints like Nish Nosh. Plus you're never far from a watering hole to find a strong drink and there's plenty of shopping nearby from the massive Century 21 to many high end little boutiques. And if you want to see some of NY's cultural tourist spots it is very close the 9\/11 memorial, Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall, the Financial District and even Chinatown and the Highline Park. \n\nThe hotel itself was very nice. We had a surprisingly large corner room w\/ sound proof windows and a nice new modern and large spa bathroom. It was a great little oasis for downtown Manhattan. And we received nothing but friendly and professional service from all the staff we encountered. It was definitely the type of place you look forward to returning to as soon as you leave.

It was supposed to be a Delta flight at 7:30, but I digress, sort of\u2026\n\nLet me start by saying that my last stay at a Thompson hotel was outstanding. So my expectations were high for The Smyth. We booked a King Deluxe for the weekend but the night before we arrived we upgraded to a King Suite paying full price. We arrived at 3 and were greeted very graciously by the doorman as well as the front desk team. Our room wasn\u2019t quite ready and they offered us to revert back to a King Deluxe, which was ready. I wish we had taken them up on the offer.\n\nWe waited on the King Suite and after about 20 minutes we were given room 203, a very nice room in and of itself. But, it was also on the floor the Tribeca Film Festival was using as their press floor, two doors down from their press roundtable rooms. Sounds exciting but not really \u2014 with no offense to the Tribeca Film Festival personnel who were extremely nice, but who also questioned why the hotel would put guests on that floor given the activity all weekend. Again, Tribeca Film Festival folks - thanks for all your graciousness! You were great. \n\nThe room was well appointed, spacious and comfortable. It was also very clean, until you looked out the two windows, which were also on the same level of the roof to a connected building. It seemed that this was the ashtray\/garbage collection area given all the cigarette butts and trash that collected there, as pictured in my review. It was also surrounded by walls and windows of the connected buildings. \n\nThe weekend went on, we kept the curtains drawn and the sounds of the comings and goings of people and gear in the press rooms were relegated to the back of our minds. \n\nSunday, it was time to go. Our flight was at 7:30 p.m at LGA so at 5:20, we walked out to grab an Uber. However, the doorman at the hotel said that they could arrange an SUV for $55 and that they would be here in 10 minutes. 10 turned into 15, 15 into 20, 20 into 25. A different car pulls up than expected and doesn\u2019t want to honor the $55. We talk for a few minutes and can\u2019t come to an agreement so I decided to go back to Uber. It is now 6 p.m, 40 minutes past when we wanted to leave. Our Uber arrives and on the way I call the Assistant Front Desk Manager who earlier had sent me an email letting me know that a survey was coming. I let her know there was a good chance we were going to miss our flight because of the car issue and that a detailed review would be coming, but it wouldn\u2019t be good. Long story short, she said she was sorry that it all happened - the busyness of the floor, the dirtiness of the area outside our window, the mistake made with the car -  and that she was willing to give us a free night on our next trip. On our next trip. \n\nSo, we missed our flight, it cost me $800 to get on another carrier and I was offered a free night\u2019s stay on the next trip. But the issues didn\u2019t happen on my next trip, it happened on this trip. Decidedly, there won\u2019t be a next trip to the Smyth. It will probably be the Conrad, the Roxy or any other brand that finds value in their current customers, not the next time they come around.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My room was super spacious, well appointed and felt more like a small apartment than a typical NY hotel room. It was modern, decorated with a mid-century modern vibe, very quiet and super clean. I had floor to ceiling windows (with black out shades) and the king sized bed was super comfortable. I slept very soundly. \nMy bathroom was well stocked with great lighting, space for my things, a plush robe, soft towels and lovely water pressure that came from a rain shower.  \n\nRoom service was on time and the waiter who brought my food was super friendly. My breakfast and coffee were delicious! I visited the lovely Little Park restaurant the last morning for breakfast. I had an egg white\/broccoli frittata, gluten free toast with fresh marmalade and butter, a lovely green side salad and crisp bacon. \n\nThe location of the hotel is terrific and convenient.

I recently spent a week there and couldn't ask for a better spot.  Access to the subway is right outside the front doors and the variety of restaurants, bars and things to see and do (neighbours the new World Trade Centre and the WTC Memorial) made it the perfect spot.  The room was clean and the service fantastic, always checking in to make sure everything was as needed.  The hotel is also very quiet.  The noise of the city never interrupted sleep and the size of each floor is moderate so you are not disturbed by other guests.\n\nNow this is where the hotel set itself apart.  THE STAFF.  All of the staff was fantastic at recommending travel routes, places to dine and the regular fair but this staff went above and beyond in a way I'm not used to when travelling (and I travel a fair bit for work).  They knew me by name.  They knew my dog by name.  In fact, they are a dog friendly hotel and even provided a food bowl and water dish for him in my room.  The staff then went the extra mile to walk my dog for me when I would be away from the hotel for long hours.  Free of charge, simply as being great, accommodating staff.  As I said everyone in the hotel was pleasant and helpful but I have to give a special nod by name to Eddie, Dana and Sandy who regularly interacted with myself and my dog to make our stay the best it could possibly be.\n\nI will definitely be back and I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting New York for the first time or travelling for work on a regular basis.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We arrived early at 1200. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the bell man , Sandy. He directed us to Anta at reception. Being it was so early for check in we had intended just to leave our bag and go for a walk. Anta checked and informed us we could check in right away. She even gave us a choice of rooms. WE could be upgraded to a king deluxe or take a smaller room with a full balcony. We opted for the balcony. Sandy offered us water and accompanied us to our room where  he showed us around and then onto the balcony. It was a good choice as it seemed we could touch the WTC. It had 2 chairs and a table for relaxing. The views could not be beat. Sandy was very friendly and knowledgeable.  He gave us advice on where to eat and what to see. He even provided complimentary wine in the afternoon to enjoy on the balcony. The next day Anta was kind enough to let us have a later check out. \n  We are native New Yorkers and have stayed at many hotels uptown. I have to say that Sandy and Anta are probably the most pleasant hotel employees I've dealt with . Good job.  The Smyth is ideal for exploring Tribeca. Multiple dining choices within walking distance and things to see. Our room was small, Anta warned us, but the balcony made up for it. It was fine for the two of us for one night.

The room was great comfortable bed, bathroom was great, and the view was good which is not always possible in the city.

The hotel is within walking distance to ground zero and many subway stations. \nI caution parties traveling with family or friends as Bathroom privacy may be an issue with the room we stayed in.  The door on the bathroom is a barn style pocket door that gaps so you can easy see and hear everything in the bathroom.  In addition, the shower is shaded glass that is visible from the room. You can clearly spot an image male or female in the shower.  I bring this up as it could be a very uncomfortable situation for some guest traveling together.  \nI should also mention as part of the mini bar you can choose from two sex boxes complete with condoms, whips and bondage items.  There was a cheesy factor to this room  leaving me to question if this hotel is catering to a couple seeking a one night stand?

I actually arrived for a business trip at a boutique hotel down the street... only to be given a TINY room just over the lobby, where they were hosting a loud restaurant re-opening party... plus the windows were so close to street level and the room so small, I could literally see the meals that folks were eating across the street from the SHOWER. \n\nEnter Smyth to the rescue -- completely stressed about my huge presentation in the morning (and after that hotel refused to move me to a more private room), I called The Smyth and they seriously saved my life! Not only did they accommodate me right away, I arrived and they gave me a BEAUTIFUL SUITE for the cost of a basic room, simply because they felt so bad about my situation. I was able to work in total privacy (with room to walk around and practice my presentation!), order late-night room service from the delicious restaurant downstairs, and get a great night of sleep. The next day I booked two more nights to give them the rest of my business and again was offered a beautiful king suite at the cost of a basic room. This is the kind of hospitality that makes me a customer for life, which I now definitely am!!\n\nAside from the amazing customer service and kindness of literally every hotel staff I came into contact with -- from the doormen and front desk staff to the room service deliverers -- the hotel is gorgeous and outrageously comfortable. The furnishing is modern and warm, the beds are luxurious, rooms impeccably clean. It's on the same corner as one of the Chambers subway stops, and I also got taxis easily. As a single woman traveling alone, I felt safe and completely taken care of through my entire experience. \n\nTHANK YOU, Smyth! You seriously have my business for life, and will become my company's recommended spot for all future Manhattan travel!!","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We pulled up  on a busy Saturday afternoon and were warmly greeted by Patrick, who made valeting the car and getting our bags a pleasure. Patrick escorted us in and stayed with us until we were given our room keys. He offered tips as to transportation uptown that evening and even suggested a \"happening\" bar near the theater where our show was playing. When we checked in, we were given a room on the 4th floor. As we rarely stay in NYC, we wanted a higher floor with a view which the front desk staff accommodated immediately, moving us to the 7th flr above the adjoining rooftops. The room was spacious and well appointed with all sorts of cool extras like a Harry's razor and \"adult\" pleasure pkg for purchase which we didn't buy but had a good laugh about even as it set the right mood for the evening. The A\/C wasn't working correctly and Tim, the maintenance man on duty, showed up w\/in minutes of being notified with a smile on his face and fixed it quickly (it just needed to be reset.) We had a delicious late night snack in the sophisticated lounge off the lobby and a fabulous brunch at The Little Park Restaurant attached to the hotel. Make a reservation because it draws a good crowd starting at 11am. Gianni and Aissa happily gave us a late checkout and gave us some good tips on visiting the memorial museum. The only criticism of the hotel is that all the seating is low so if you have bad knees, beware! Otherwise, it was a romantic, sophisticated wonderful place to spend a spring weekend in downtown NYC with a particularly pleasant and caring staff.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My wife did suggest our bedroom was obviously designed by a talented chap with chaps primarily in mind - having no decent dressing table nor convenient mirror for make-up purposes. Apart from this minor irritation, the average sized bedroom proved comfortable, with a lovely, snuggly bed; contemporary style bathroom with a wet-room\/shower (though no bath); sufficient storage (just); and super fast, reliable & free WiFi\/Internet. Though other bedrooms seemed to have Nespresso coffee making facilities, we had no in-room tea\/coffee provided. However, the helpful front-desk, sensitive to the obvious needs of a couple of Brits abroad, provided us a kettle ensuring we'd always benefit from the all-important early morning cuppa without depending on room-service. This was much appreciated.\n\nWe genuinely found all the hotel staff to be professional, efficient, and having a relaxed, informal style seemingly in keeping with general ambiance of this chilled and trendy Smyth Hotel. \n\nAlthough the area (Tribeca) is primarily residential and relatively quiet (for Manhattan), it\u2019s an ideal base to explore from and the hotel even benefits from being conveniently only 20m from Chambers Street metro station. There are decent local deli\u2019s (do check out Zuckers Bagels) and a good choice of quality restaurants in the vicinity. A restaurant I\u2019m very happy to recommend is the Smyth hotels very own - Little Park \u2013 do make sure you reserve a table as it\u2019s a very popular eatery and understandably so given the quality of its simple menu and relatively reasonable (for Manhattan) prices.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Before I checked in I was sent an email detailing all the facilities I would encounter when I arrived. The one that had appealed to me most when I booked was \"a complimentary town car service within a 10 block radius\", ideal for my meetings, dinners etc. What a great service! Imagine how disappointed I was on arrival when I asked for the aforementioned town car, to be told it didn't exist! Never had done. There is no town car. The email was totally dishonest!\n\nSo next - the service. Awful from start to finish. I won't bore you here with all the details, but the following situation summed it up for me. I received an automated email the day I checked out to ask for my feedback. I responded honestly. Within 24 hours I had an email from the assistant manager to ask about my experience, so that they know how to improve and hoping that I would give them another chance. I replied the same day, and took the time to send thorough and constructive feedback.\n\nOne month on, and not a single word in response. No 'thanks for taking the time to respond', no 'crikey! Sorry we lied, better get that sorted out', no 'sorry our front of house staff treated you with total disrespect'. Nope, nothing at all. If that's the way the assistant manager behaves, I guess there is no hope for the rest of the staff.\n\nTop tip though - if you do choose to stay here, I suggest you arrive late at night and negotiate the price. On my arrival, having paid full whack up front for my (very basic) room, I had a front row seat to a man waltzing in and negotiating, in front of me (I was totally ignored whilst this discussion was going on) for the Smyth Suite (apparently $3,000 per night), for $515!!

A relatively low rise building area, you can see sky and cool old school buildings, while out of nowhere rises the Freedom Tower. You get views of the building from many angles. The hotel itself is understated and comfy, with a very attentive staff who appreciates you as a guest. Small enough for them to know your name, and you see the same faces many times even on a short visit. The library bar and Little Park restaurants are top notch for food, conversation and cocktails - and with a subway stop literally outside the hotel front door - you can get everywhere.

It has a nice look, a nice sense of style in both the public spaces and the rooms. They very kindly upgraded me to a King Suite, which I enjoyed of course. I ordered room service for dinner, and it was a nice meal. Not amazing, but pretty good. The bathroom looked nice, but the handle for the cold water on the sink was loose, and the sink was very slow to drain. The water pressure in the shower was quite low, which made for a longer, much less enjoyable shower. The room was pretty quiet until I heard a dog barking somewhere on the floor above me. It wasn't crazy loud, just annoying. I put in my earplugs and that solved the problem. The next morning I ordered room service for breakfast, but the meal did not measure up to the dinner I'd had the night before. The waffles seemed like they were pre-made and came with a crazy amount of whipped cream on top, which the menu hadn't mentioned. I removed as much of it as I could. They just didn't taste great, and I usually find room service waffles to be quite tasty. The chicken sausage was okay for the first few bites, but after it had cooled a bit it tasted kind of gross to me. The waiters were all very nice. Like most hotels, they hand you the room service check to sign. There's a place for a tip, but I noticed a large service charge on the bill already and asked the waiter if that charge was in fact the tip. They said that it was. It annoyed me that the check just said \"Tip\" and not \"Additional Tip\". I gave them a little extra anyway. My favorite situation is when a hotel (like The Mercer) includes a nice tip on the bill, and the waiter just leaves it on the table without asking you to sign it. But that's extremely rare. I was hoping that I'd found a reasonably priced, comfortable, stylish boutique hotel in a cool neighborhood that I'd want to stay at again, but that was not the case. Look, it's not a bad place, and it's not a bad price, but given the hotel selection that Manhattan has to offer, I'll try something else next time.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

While the staff and especially the door men are most helpful we could not help but be disappointed in our stay this time at the Smyth. Perhaps it is time to move on to a chain that is a bit more appreciative to return guests.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Leading up to our trip we had read many stellar reviews and this hotel lived up to our expectations and beyond! Upon arrival we were warmly greeted getting out of our cab by the doorman who took our luggage and led us to the front desk where we were graciously treated by two lovely young ladies. We arrived before check in but luckily they had a room ready for us. We had a superior king room on the third floor. As soon as we opened the door, the room had a great vibe. A modern room with beautiful linens on the bed, a wonderfully designed bathroom with all the little amenities we could hope for. Our street view was awesome, we could see One World Trade Center which was a nice surprise. As far as location goes The Smyth Thompson was perfectly located for us. We absolutely loved being in TriBeCa as it has cool, calm and safe feel to the community. On top of that the subway is literally steps from the front door of the hotel which made getting around Manhattan a breeze. The evening bar\/lounge was a warm and cozy place to come back to after a long day of touring around the city for a cocktail and some munchies. The staff in every area of this hotel was friendly, warm and professional. We can't say enough good things about this hotel.

Tom at the front desk was especially accommodating--giving me several maps (because I kept misplacing them) and offering me recompense when our TV was not working properly.

However, I am compelled to rave about this hotel because it so far exceeded my expectations.  We have stayed in numerous NYC hotels on overnights in the city and I am always underwhelmed.  At the rudeness, the blandness, the lack of real service or anything resembling what you find in great hotels in other cities in the world.  The Smyth, however, has you at hello.  The rooms are just fine (clean and a nice size, with modern design and comfortable beds), but it is the service from the staff that takes it to the next level.  Sandy welcomed us, and ushered us in, working to alter our reservation so that we were in a room next to our children.  Then he brought them extra peppermint candy when they inhaled the first round.  Patrick ran into traffic to get us taxis and just generally made sure we got our car, our luggage and all of our things together (there were a lot of things).  They were friendly and worked to make sure all of our needs were attended to, without being over the top.  The rest of the front desk staff were equally helpful and friendly.  The food from room service was very good, and room service was quick to fix a mistake they made on our order.  The only service lapse I will note is in the bar, where the server had to be chased down multiple times before our whole party (we were three) could order their drinks, and she seemed less than thrilled to actually take drink and food orders.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My only complaints were the bathroom set up was a little odd - no fan to get rid of steam from the shower, plus there wasn't a latching door to the main room (just a slider) and therefore made the whole room seem very \"wet\". We called down to try to get the dehumidifier fixed, but nothing changed. Not a huge deal, but as a result it wasn't a great sleep. \n\nIn short: PROS - fantastic location downtown, trendy\/urban feel, great staff\nCONS - Room felt sticky the whole weekend, not a lot of knowledge about the surrounding area.\n\nWould recommend highly if we had a different room I think","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

For this amount of money I think the room is fairly small even by NYC standards and definitely for the class of hotel that it is advertised to be. This is especially true when compared to the Refinery hotel that I had stayed in earlier in my trip. The rooms are nicely decorated though and have all the expected amenities and the ever important power outlets by the bed. For me the biggest issues with the room were the very small window which faced an internal courtyard and the lack of cellular reception. The free internet worked well however. The staff were very helpful with suggestions and journey planning and sorted out some billing issues satisfactorily. Be careful with the terms of any inclusive breakfast in the hotel restaurant as this may cause confusion. The food at the restaurant was very nice though. I would consider staying here again but it would be very price and room dependent. I would not recommend booking the superior queen room type as I don't believe this can meet the expectations of a 5 star hotel guest.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel was misleading in many ways, detailed here:\n- Location: Despite being advertised as a \"Tribeca\" hotel, it is clearly south of Chambers Street and technically in the Financial District.  A good example of misleading branding; we were 2 miles further south of where we intended to be.\n- Service: The hotel was two hours late to check us in, had us wait in the lobby (which is tiny and cramped) for a long time to get keys, and \"valet\" parking takes 30 minutes to retrieve your car, which they don't tell you in advance (thanks, I was late to a meeting).  All very underwhelming.\n- Quality: For a $550\/night hotel, a very disappointing room and lobby experience.  No breakfast or restaurant, the room itself had thin windows (great road noise) and no door for the toilet (so odd).  The bed was sufficiently comfortable, but that's about the only good thing here. Wi-fi does not work. \n\nOverall, a disappointing experience and I certainly will not return.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Deluxe rooms are spacious great see through bathroom with walk in shower. Theres even a car service that doesn't seem to get used often and the restaurant on site is very good.  The location is excellent with subways 1,2,3 outside and ACE just up the road.  You can dine out in this area for a year and not go to the same place twice.  If the rate is right stay here it's great and I can't think of anything negative  They used to charge for wifi but got  smart and built it into the room rate.  I would only stay here in NYC if I had a choice  but not for $500 a night. - that's just too much to put your head on a pillow...anywhere","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The front desk is small and can only check in 2 guests at a time.  The staff gets a bit overwhelmed and don't always have the ability to respond to requests.

Totally loved our first stay in Tribeca. Totally loved The Smyth Hotel (which is actually pronounced Smith -- it has some odd marketing hook that it's located at the intersection of two roads that form a Y, hence the name.) What everyone says about the staff is true. No attitude. Very helpful. Nice people that make your stay enjoyable. The location on West Broadway is ideal -- easy walking to the restaurants. If you want a sushi experience that is amazing, try Nobu Next Door, but take your platinum Visa (delicious food, but holy cow, that's some bill!) The lobby of the hotel is really nice too. Comfortable couches and tables to have a glass of wine or browse their extensive selection of art books. We didn't splurge on the room, and took only the basic size. But we got a lucky bonus: Outdoor space. A little terrace with a couple of chairs. Fabulous. If you want this, you need the 9th floor. The room itself was pretty small, but the terrace really made up for it. The bathroom was large by comparison and had a huge shower. Had breakfast in the restaurant on the last day -- not bad. Overall -- we'd stay here again without a moment's hesitation.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are well appointed and the beds are comfortable. My only issue with the room was the poor and uneven bathroom lighting - as a female, that makes makeup application a little tricky. But honestly, what stands out above all to me is the wonderful hotel staff. They were friendly and helpful throughout our stay, and made efforts to be of assistance beyond anything that is expected.

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":1371825,"title":"The small annoyances\/issues add up...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-05-25","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"My wife and I just got home from an overnight in NYC to celebrate our 20th anniversary.  We used to live there for about a decade, and love the culture and food scene. \n\nI had picked the Smyth from a few swankier\/boutiquey options and was really looking forward to our stay.\n\nThings started out well enough, with Anta (front desk) giving us an upgrade to a King Deluxe instead of the King Superior we had booked directly from the hotel website.  TK(sp?) the doorman\/bellhop was nice and friendly as well.\n\nSo when we get to the room, everything is pretty much in order.  It's on the West Broadway side of things, so there are nice, open views...you can even see Freedom Tower if you stand in the right place. There was some wear and tear on things (did someone try to light the TV on fire at some point?)...like evidence of water damage in a corner near the ceiling (window), etc.\n\nBut where things really started to go south was when I went to use the bathroom...I noticed a stain (propriety prevents me from mentioning what kind) on the seat.  Sort as if someone had wiped sloppily, if you get my drift.  Further inspection revealed dried urine near the hinge...it was as if the cleaning person had cleaned the toilet with the seat up, so that the dried urine and other stains were not visible.  I quickly tidied things up so my wife wouldn't notice. A clean bathroom is truly a necessity at really any level of hotel, so it was surprising to get one that wasn't.\n\nAnother annoyance: the hotel advertises complimentary bottled water with evening turndown service.  Upon returning to the hotel after dinner, our bed was neither turned down nor was their any complimentary water...only two bottles labeled for sale ($6 each).  I also noted that the air in the room was kind of muggy, as if the AC could not dehumidify things.  This persisted the entire night.\n\nThe next morning, we were unceremoniously woken up at 6 AM by our neighbors, who sounded like they had younger kids in the room with them.  While I understand the hotel can't really control things like this, I think they CAN control the soundproofing.  I didn't call the front desk to report it, and looking back I probably should have.  The noise went on for about 30 minutes.  I have kids of my own, so I know what it's like, but when one is trying to enjoy a getaway for a wedding anniversary, it's not that pleasant to be woken up by the sounds of kids.\n\nBreakfast at Little Park, the Andrew Carmellini restaurant attached to the hotel was great.   Nice room, friendly and attentive staff, great food, reasonable cost, and perfect portions.  After breakfast checked out and checked our bag...which we told the front desk we'd pick up when we came back to get our car (which we had valeted for the night).  We were going to the new Whitney on the West Side...highly recommended, btw.  But buy your tickets in advance or face a long line.  One more word of advice might be to start on the 5th floor and work your way up.  We had tickets for the 10:30 entry and the density of people who went straight to the 8th floor was unappealing.  Happy to report that things thinned out as we made our way through lower floors. If you like art\/architecture, definitely pay the new Whitney a visit.\n\nAfter lunch and some shopping in Chelsea, we went back to the hotel to get our bag and our car.  I gave the doorman\/bellhop our claim stubs and he guided us into the elegantly appointed lounge area to wait. \n\nIn that same lounge area (which is fairly large) a woman appeared to be sleeping on one of the sofas.  Shoes off (at least) and feet up, with a pillow over her legs like a blanket.  I mentioned this to the doorman, and he said \"Oh, she's not sleeping.\" as if that made things any better.  Here's my beef with this: A HOTEL LOBBY IS NOT YOUR LIVING ROOM...and seeing someone treat it that way truly impacts the ambiance of the hotel.\n\nIf you're thinking \"Well, what did you expect them to do, you intolerant jerk?\", allow me to relay a story from my teen years.  Once, my parents had booked a few rooms at the Waldorf Astoria...I think they had some out of town guests that we were entertaining. We had arrived early, and our rooms were not yet ready.  So we waited in the lobby.  I guess I had fallen sleep (shoes on and not on a couch, mind you)...because the next thing I knew, I was being awoken by a lobby attendant who merely had to say \"I'm sorry, there's no sleeping in the lobby, sir.\" for me to sit up straighter and NOT fall asleep again for the rest of our time in the lobby. Yet the Smyth's hotel staff walked by several times and never asked this woman to put her shoes on and please refrain from lying down.\n\nMy final take on the Smyth is that it could be a nice place to stay in NYC, but that their attention to detail has to get turned up a bit. We've stayed at the James, the Americano, the Soho Grand, the Andaz (multiple times, and yes, I know, it's part of Hyatt) and the Roger Williams over the years...and NEVER run into the sorts of things we experienced at the Smyth.  It's too bad really.  Hoping our stay was an anomaly.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This newly renovated property has the most comfortable appearance and accomodations.

Any hotel can embody these elements but the staff is what sets it apart from others. Along with the homey feel, the staff is the most relaxed. Tom greeted me upon arrival. I was walking from the subway by the restaurant and he left the door to ask me if he could help me find what I was looking for. The entrance was hidden a little but thinking about the neighborhood, the doors tie into the residential appearance. Walking in, Sandy was holding a door for me and he welcomed me with a smile that I will never forget. Monique checked me in and was most informative. She also enlisted the help of Franck and Enoch for recommendations for things I wanted to do. Since it was two guys and two girls talking we did come to a standstill but the conversation was awesome. Not your typical checkin: what's you last name ID and credit card but just conversation. I was really intrigued by how pleasant everyone was and on my way back in I ran into Lisa and Anta at night. Those two are funny! We laughed for what felt like hours. Settling in a room that is bigger than most NYC hotels was the icing on the cake but I really loved the staff.

The staff made it easy and highly enjoyable from check in to check out. GREAT hospitality! The location was great as well. The hotel is very clean and elegant. My room was very spacious and the beds were amazing! I traveled with a friend so we were ecstatic about the size of the bathroom and the fact that there was a very large mirror with great lighting outside of it. It made it very easy for two girls to get ready everyday! We stayed for 4 nights and housekeeping was magnificent in helping us keep our room in order and made it a pleasure to come back to after long days. The front office employees are a great team and nothing short of amazing. Each and every one of them were very nice and personable. We had the chance to chat with Enoch, the assistant manager who was lovely and Blaise and Sandy, well, we just adored them. They were the first faces we seen when walking in each day. Both gentlemen were very helpful in answering any questions, giving directions, restaurant suggestion, getting us cabs and assisting with our luggage and they were even a pleasure to just chat and laugh with on our way in or out. Seeing Lisa when dragging ourselves in after a very long night was a pleasure as well. The staff alone is our main reason for wanting to return. We can not wait to visit the city again and will definitely be staying at the very impressive and upscale Smyth hotel so they should be expecting to see the two Cali girls who over packed and still forgot everything again!

They made such good impressions that I could not forget their names or faces. As I entered the room, I was taken by the rose left on my bed. Usually this is a gesture from your significant other but I soon learned that the hotel actually went ahead and did this, how thoughtful. Nice quiet room, very spacious compared to most NYC hotels. I did leave a note that I was also celebrating a 15 year anniversary with my husband on my reservation and just before night's end I was given a complementary bottle of Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries by Christina the AGM of the restaurant Little Park.

My husband had easy walking access to the PATH to New Jersey where his training was held, and I had fantastic and immediate access to 3 major subway lines.

What really sets the Smyth apart, however, is its amazing service. I've stayed in many hotels, but I have never had such wonderful, personalized service. It seemed like the staff really wanted to be there, were happy to help and excited to share information about New York. It made a family Christmas in the Big Apple a totally wonderful experience. I highly recommend it, particularly if you're looking for a great neighbourhood that's a bit more relaxed than the craziness of Time Square etc.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

No snobbish attitude here, really a genuine smile all the time.\n2. View. Book a Studio King junior suite, we had a 270 degree view from the Freedom Tower to the Empire State building. High windows.

I wanted to enjoy a sophisticated NY experience without the headaches of typical touristy midtown during New years. The location was incredible for this - I feel its a hidden gem, even though it's on W Broadway. Doesn't look like a hotel - which makes it more appealing being so understated. The staff is incredible, very personal and friendly. We lost one of our room keys and they replaced it in seconds. They also knew the dogs names within the first hour we were there! The lobby and common areas - Little Park and the Evening bar are so cool, you feel like you are in a friend's lovely home. Love the fireplace on a cold night! Got a coffee and croissant to go New Years day - fast and delicious!\nThe room was great - medium sized for NY (king superior), the bathroom decadent. Beware the shower wall facing the sleeping area is frosted, so privacy is in question, but for couples this is fine.\nI have been in this area before and knew this was the place to be for our getaway, easy access from the Hudson, the street parking on holidays is plentiful and free, and you are walking distance to Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy, and Wall Street. We went to Capital Grille on Wall Street which was a 10 minute walk, and downtown is getting more built up so the nightlight is decent - and obviously great within Tribeca.\nLots to eat nearby for something fast - Pizza, Starbucks etc. Also the train is just outside the door, yet weirdly not noisy.\nThe hotel is very pet friendly which I really appreciated. There is a house car which apparently runs only before 6pm, which we never made use of, so I can't comment on that. ATT nay gets 2 bars. I had trouble getting on complimentary wifi, but my friend didn't.\nOverall a lovely experience and would go back in a heartbeat!","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

In fact the level of service was so high - everyone enthusiastic, polite and attentive - that that alone is enough to make us want to visit again asap.

The room was quite large, especially compared to other hotels in the city and had an outstanding view. The bathroom had a very upscale look and a huge open shower, which was one of my favorite parts of the room. \n\nI would definitely recommend spending some time in their new bar and lounge area. The bartender made us some great mixed drinks and we spent some time next to one of the fireplaces. It is the perfect place to have a couple drinks before dinner or going out. \n\nThe awesome service began when I first called up to make the reservation. I spoke with Daniel who was extremely helpful. He told me all about the renovated bar and everything else the place had to offer. I was unfamiliar with Tribeca, so I asked if he had any dinner recommendations. It was obvious that he is familiar with the area, as he made sure that I had a few options to choose from and even offered to make a reservation for me. I knew immediately that I made the correct decision to stay there. When I checked in, I was helped by Franck at the front desk, who further enhanced my experience at the Smyth. He answered all my questions and made certain to accommodate me with everything I needed. \n\nThis hotel is undoubtably worth a stay and made my night in the city one to remember.
