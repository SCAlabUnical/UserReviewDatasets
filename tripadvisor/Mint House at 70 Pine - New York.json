Loved the stylish decor, 2 big tables and good lighting. Malik at the front desk helped with restaurant and movie theater recommendations, very thoughtful! The full supermarket in the basement helped us save money by getting snacks and breakfast and the excellent Black Fox coffee shop in the lobby of this amazing Art Deco building helped start each day right. There is a subway stop (2\/3 red line) 10 steps from the coffee shop (literally across the street) and it was an easy walk to the 9\/11 museum, Battery Park, Wall Street and Trinity Church (site of Hamilton's grave), Little Italy, Chinatown and the Brooklyn Bridge. We also used the Shop Your Stay service which had reasonable prices and no service fee, highly recommend. We felt safe walking around FiDi day and night.

But it was real and it is a remarkable property. I would highlight, that this is in a building that has limited branding on the front, so you do have to be aware of the street. It isn't hard to find, but better branding would help!\n\nAside from that, the experience from the beginning is just amazing, reception are extremely welcoming and informative, the access is security controlled by lift PIN access, as are the apartments. The unit we had has 2 bathrooms, both large size with bath\/shower, a great kitchen area with huge fridge\/freezer and large cooker, microwave and a fancy kettle, toaster was also available. It also has a coffee making kit, for real coffee, which I tried and found a little convoluted, but thats because I am lazy and just want my brew! Others will love it!\n\nThe living area is huge, has large TV, telephone (cordless) and a really fancy record player, which we dare not touch in case we broke it! There is also a decanter and crystal glass set if staying and hosting which I thought was really impressive!\n\nThe bedroom is really roomy has a huge amount of space and also has the usual safe, along with iron and board, then a hairdryer in the bathroom. The lighting throughout is mi8nimal but good! There are mirrors everywhere!\n\nI just found this whole suite remarkable, the attention to detail, with being near to wall street was typical financial disttrrict style and I imagine a fair few finance brokers have occupied and influenced the property, but for someone like me, this was such an opulent experience which is quite apt for New York\n\nSome will not be happy about the location, because you are away from Times Square and if you are not prepared to use the subway or hop on\/off buses then you will pay a fortune in uber charges, but for us, we were happy to use subway\/buses and just as exception use Uber.\n\nI am already thinking of a second stay in NY, because one stay does not cover everything!

However, my experience turned out to be a mixed bag.\n\nLet's start with the downsides: The absence of room service was a major disappointment.\n\nThe hotel's advertised bowling alley, unfortunately, wasn't operational. This was disheartening, as I was looking forward to enjoying this unique amenity.\n\nAnother aspect that didn't meet expectations was the responsiveness of the receptionist. I found myself needing towels and had to call multiple times before they were delivered. This lack of promptness did detract from the overall convenience of the stay.\n\nDespite these setbacks, there were some positive aspects. The room itself was impressively clean and surprisingly spacious. The attention to cleanliness added a layer of comfort and made the space enjoyable to be in.\n\nOn reflection, I can't help but feel that the hotel's marketing might have been a tad deceiving. While the room's cleanliness and spaciousness were definite pluses, the absence of room service, the non-functioning bowling alley, and the delays in towel delivery left me somewhat underwhelmed.\n\nIn the end, it's important to weigh the pros and cons. While the room's cleanliness and size were highlights, the issues I encountered were enough to temper my overall experience. For the price I paid and the expectations I had, I can't help but feel that the reality fell a bit short of the luxury I was hoping for.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our studio was effectively a small condo with kitchenette, a functional table and desk \/ office, a couch and adjacent sleeping area. Bathroom was sizable with thoughtful amenities (black make up towel, Malin + Goetz toiletries, fluffy bath towels). Plenty of drawer and closet space, ample hangers, etc. Much larger than a similarly priced hotel room in the city. Much more comfortable.\n\n-It hit the high points in terms of strong and reliable wifi (yes), excellent water pressure (yes) and quiet and reliable air conditioning (mostly yes for quiet but blessedly cool during a hot spell). \n\n-Minimal ambient noise. Our room faced a courtyard away from the street and was effectively silent; hall noise was minimal and doors don\u2019t slam.\n\n-Easy check in \/ out. The front desk was pleasant and responsive; entry is keyless and the same code is used for the elevator and room. No keys to misplace = a welcome touch.\n\n-Location. While not centrally located\nto the entirety of Manhattan, Mint House is directly across the street from the 2,3 trains, an easy walk to other lines and to most of downtown. Trains had us in Brooklyn in 10-15 minutes.\n\nTiny things that could be done better:\n\n-No outlets or USB access anywhere near the bed. This was a real bummer as we use our phones as clocks and alarms. Was told by the front desk that the second floor is \u201cnew\u201d and the rooms had been completed without outlets adjacent to the beds; I believe the higher floors may have that available. Definitely a creature comfort that was greatly missed\n\n-Housekeeping was knocking on doors around 3\/4 in the afternoon, a time when many - including us - are returning to their rooms after a day out \/ to refresh before dinner. As such, we passed on fresh towels and etc during our stay. This would have been a welcome service earlier in the day.\n\nFor the most part though, it\u2019s a real bargain in terms of space and amenities both in and out of room (bowling alley and theater in the basement are both available to reserve with advance notice) and a lovely alternative to airbnbs or traditional hotels.

The property doesn't have cards to gain access but a code which seems annoying, especially when you are rushing to add your code before the elevator starts, but after a couple of run thrus its nice to not have to worry about grabbing it before you leave. This location has a grocery in the basement of the main building, which is great as most places close early in the area.

Great layout, it comes with a simple pantry and coffee and tea are provided. \n3. Nice shower, bathtub and amenities. \n4. Close to the subway (only 2 mins walk). \n\nNow the not so good part: \n1. I don\u2019t know about the other rooms but our bed was creaky. Basically if anyone moves even a little on the bed, it\u2019ll make a loud creaking sound, which can be quite annoying. \n2. The garbage truck collection noise is also very loud at around 2 am. I am quite a heavy sleeper and don\u2019t normally wake up easily but I got startled by it every night. Then again this is New York so I doubt that it\u2019s possible to find someplace really quiet. \n3. The girl at the front desk \/ reception is not friendly or helpful at all. Not even a single smile, and when we asked questions, she didn\u2019t seem interested in helping and has a permanent annoyed face. Is that just how New York hospitality works?

Staff isn't the greatest at restocking supplies though the people downstairs were always helpful in providing more if asked. Beds are made and towels are restocked everyday but rooms are only cleaned once a week from what we experienced. Building has some fun amenities like bowling etc that needs to be reserved - if one has the time and interest.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The disappointment began at check in. At first we were told that our room wasn\u2019t ready. Not a problem, we\u2019d grab a bottle of water or coffee in reception while we waited. But no, there were no cups for the coffee machine \u2026oh, and no water either. We stood there in disbelief \u2013 there was no one else in reception and the staff were not willing to help or even call housekeeping? They\u2019re located above a supermarket, so why couldn\u2019t they replenish the water, at least for the guests that were due to check in? Reception staff said there\u2019d been a wedding the day before and they\u2019d emptied out the fridge and used all the coffee cups. Surprised at their nonchalance, we were quickly relieved to hear that they had found a room for us. We were in a King room and was quite dark, but given the location of the property this wasn\u2019t a surprise to us. We quickly unpacked and started making coffee. But\u2026 there was no creamer, and no milk, in the room. We tried contacting reception via the app and number provided, but nothing. Also\u2026 there was no safe. What hotel room in this day and age doesn\u2019t have a safe?! We went to reception to ask for some milk or creamers, we were told they only had milk, but as there were no cups, we couldn\u2019t take any (!) We also asked about a safe and were told that the rooms on the second floor were new and didn\u2019t all have safes in yet! Needless to say, we were already regretting our booking. Then one of the reception staff (I can\u2019t remember his name) offered to get us some milk, and put it in our room. He was trying to be helpful, so we thought maybe they\u2019re just having a bad day. The trouble didn\u2019t end there, however\u2026 when we returned to our room later that evening, we began to be aware of a loud humming noise. We contacted reception and this time they did answer the phone, and promptly sent up a technician. He couldn\u2019t locate the source. Reception then agreed to move us, so at 10.30pm we moved to a new room - a smaller Queen sized room. It was located near the lifts, but thankfully was a lot quieter. We were offered breakfast vouchers as compensation. At checkout, the reception staff were apologetic, even saying \u2018you\u2019ve not had the best stay, have you?\u2019 But since then we\u2019ve heard nothing from the management. There were other issues, but this is not a hotel we can recommend! Our stay was beyond disappointing!","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Not resembling a hotel room in any way.  \nGreat kitchen with great coffee making facilities (and really good  coffee from the always justifiably busy Black Fox company coffee in the lobby of the building - give them a try) \nA very big if a little outdated gym at the basement, a large self service  laundry room, and a  free printer to use. Also a great supermarket\/food market in the same building (City Acres Market). \nHowever:\nThe water pressure is terrible and water heat change from one second to the other making shower not such a great experience. They had water works for 4 hours each morning while i was there (so no water) and only notified me about that after check in (Would have expected this to be announced as soon as they knew about it letting me decide if that would influence my choice to stay there). \nMy room was on the 1st floor. The sound proofing of the windows is not good. This is new york but it\u2019s not a specifically lively place during the night and still there was constant central heating or similar noise coming from street level all night. Also at around 0400-0500 each day garbage truck would noisily wake me up. \nThe apartment is very dark and obviously have no views  - a small window on the first floor in a New York street doesn\u2019t let much light in. \n\nFor the price they charge I would expect a better product. I think if you need to be in Newyork for an extended period of time for work and can afford this its a great choice. Also for a family needing  lots of space. As for me, I would  probably not stay there next time I\u2019m in town.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

It was time to revise my travel arrangements I was now going to the minus 10 degrees of Poughkeepsie NY. \n\nThe apartment is really easy to access using public transport and is within 5 mins walking distance from Wall St Station (take the 2 or 3 lines for the closest exits) Broad St & Fulton St Station are also within 10 mins walk. Getting around the city was super easy from this location and the World Trade Centre site with the Oculus site very impressively housing Transport, Shopping & Restaurants along with Broadway and the Brooklyn Bridge are all within a short walk away. \n\nThis is a place to stay in NYC if you want to be close to the centre of activities but off the beaten track without the immediate hustle and bustle of this great city. There is a fantastic gym with a grimy feel that makes you want to train just that little bit harder, this is not a gym for the light weights.

The staff were great, the room nicely appointed, and the wifi worked seamlessly. Lots of food options nearby.  Downsides, it is a little shy on natural lighting but plenty of lighting options in the room.  The rooms are on the lower floors and the building is between two others, so not a lot can be done. Didn't bother me, but others did note it. There seemed to be a lot of work being done on the building across the street and I did notice some noise. It was only during typical work hours and I was on the 6th floor, so again not an issue for me but for a light or late sleeper on the lower floors it might be. All and all I would stay here again in a heartbeat!","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Much bigger than a typical hotel room. Comes with standard kitchen stuff such as utensils, cookware, and plates (no rice cooker though sadly). Internet was pretty fast and stable all throughout the building (except elevators). One con is the lack of sunlight due to the surrounding buildings and Mint House only occupying floor 2-6 of 70 pine. This was further compounded by the somewhat lacking lighting inside the rooms.\n\nExcellent location for the 2\/3\/4\/5 trains (which go uptown or to Brooklyn easily). Good selection of food within a 5 min walk (my favorites for everyday were Dig and Blue Park Kitchen). The attached grocery store was convenient for small\/rushed purchases but grossly overpriced for consistent shopping.\n\nThe 24\/7 front desk was awesome. They did a great job with packages and guiding food delivery people upstairs. The complimentary monthly cleanings were well done (remember to ask for them if you are staying for a while).

Picked Mint House because of the reviews and the much greater space than usual for a NY hotel. \nLocation is fine for anything downtown, it was a few minute walk to WTC. Not perhaps the best location for good eateries but that's just the area, you do have the Seaport and Stone Street just a short walk away for that. \nRoom\/suite is excellent. Plenty enough space that you felt quite happy hanging out there which isn't the case for many NYC hotel rooms which you often just want to sleep at. Place was clean, well appointed, good simple decor. I didn't use the kitchen much during the week but if I were staying longer it would have been plenty enough to cook in, fully equipped and actually a pretty decent size. Bathroom was bright, plenty of hot water, enough towels etc. Just soap, shampoo and conditioner provided here, so take anything else you need with you. Someone came in and made the bed daily, cleaned up the bathroom and put out fresh towels. Wasn't there long enough for a linen change, could have asked if I wanted one mid-week. \nReception was super helpful (once you found it), everyone was friendly and helpful. \nRooms are on low floors so you do hear NYC noise overnight, wasn't a problem, that's just living in the city. \nOverall a great stay.

I wouldn't mind staying again if it weren't for one thing - the hotel is way downtown, and most of what we want to do in NYC is in midtown, leading to excess commute times for every trip.  \n\nThe building itself is art deco and has a coffee shop, restaurant, and other amenities on-site. It is situated between two small streets downtown near Wall Street and the World Trade Center. While its a perfectly safe area, the streets are small, dirty, clogged and smelly in that New York way.  \n\nThe lobby for the hotel is in what feels like the back corner of the lobby of the building, with a separate bank of hotel elevators. The front desk staff was pleasant and efficient the entire time.  The rooms appear to be remodeled apartments, as they have a huge square footage. Understand that this company thrives on upselling you on early check-ins, late check-outs, and selling you the things furnishing your room.\n\nAfter checking in, our front door opened into a large, albeit windowless dining room, with a large closet, through the dining room was the small bathroom, wide galley kitchen, leading into the living space with couch, chair, tv, and record player with half a dozen assorted records, which in turn leads into the bedroom area with large bed and a fairly small single window.  The room was plenty big and comfortable (except the low hanging floor lamp in the living room that I hit my head on all of the times.  \n\nThe kitchen came fully stocked with what you need, including great instructions and equipment for your morning cup of pour over coffee or tea.  It also had full-size appliances and an offer that the hotel would get you any food you want delivered without additional costs.  \n\nThe room was quiet and dark enough, the bed comfy, the tv options adequate.

The room was quiet, and I only heard other guests on a couple of occasions. I stayed in the studio deluxe; the set up was a little funky but ideal for my situation (you can see photos that will help you better understand the setup on Expedia). The hotel arranged transportation to\/from the airport which was convenient even if it was slightly more expensive than Uber. My top rating is based on the price for the size of the accommodations and the quality of the staff. As an aside, the sandwiches at Pisillo Italian Panini on 97 Nassau Street are amazing and it is a very short walk from the hotel.

I live in Brooklyn, so this was a staycation but I felt like i was in Amsterdam or some other European city living in a fab apartment. First of all the rooms are HUGE -mine was 700 sq ft and I could feel all 700 of those sq ft. You can't even compare Mint House rooms to other New York hotel rooms, which are notoriously tiny. There's just no comparison. Even if we go outside New York, I have stayed at tons of hotels all over the world, and honestly this is larger than many suites I have stayed in. The layout is clean and uncluttered, the kitchen and bathroom were spotless and the towels were so soft. And the price point? Ridiculously affordable for what you get. The walk-in closet in my room was the size of a regular hotel room - and I am only exaggerating a little it! Overall, it just felt luxurious.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":8501479,"title":"Excellent experience, thanks in huge part to Claritza!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-02-25","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"First off, a big shout out to Claritza, who saved us from what could have been a reeeeally unhappy Valentines Day weekend. I'd booked this hotel for a one-night staycation through Agora - but turns out, Agora is no longer connected with this hotel and basically took my money but made no booking with the hotel, despite confirming it with me! Yikes! This is obviously the worst news to get when you're trying to check in at front desk, and the person there patiently goes through all their records and finally breaks the news to you of what must have happened. The fact that my money had already been taken by Agora was a separate issue (I was able to take this up with Agora subsequently and get my money back, and if not I'd have taken it up with the credit card company) but knowing that my credit card company would reimburse me for what turned out to be this bogus charge, my immediate concern was, were we going to be able to stay? And were we going to have to pay same-day, off-the-street prices for a junior suite on Valentines Weekend? (It would have been almost double the cost of the reservation I'd made weeks prior.) Luckily, no. Claritza carefully and patiently made sure she found a room equivalent to the one I'd booked, and ensured we were given the same price as the one I'd booked online through a third party. Obviously she (and the hotel) did not HAVE to honor this booking in any way. It was just great, great customer service to do so. What I appreciated most was that throughout the whole process Claritza never once made us feel like this was our fault, that we were taking up too much time, or that we'd been somehow irresponsible in making the original booking or were somehow trying to game the system - all of which are attitudes I'm familiar with getting from all sorts of customer service interactions and sadly, I'm sure you are too! On the contrary, she seemed so relieved and genuinely happy for us when she was able to make everything work - and was so reassuring throughout what was obviously an unexpectedly long and complicated process. I commented to my girlfriend later that it makes you realise that customer service really is an art form. What could have been a terrible start to our staycation actually turned into a great one, because we had such a positive interaction and it felt like we'd been given a gift. \nAside from that: yep, nice room, nice hotel. Elegant design with nice quirks. Record player for room use, along with a few \"NYC native\" LPs, was a very cute touch. Well furnished kitchen (although was missing any dish soap to run the dishwasher; I hope the staff didn't mind taking care of this part as we were unable to!). Overall a chic layout that the photos do justice to. It's in a densely high-rise part of the city so you're nlooking out on other windows, although they're not right on top of you - we kept the gauze privacy curtains down throughout, but it was still quite a bright space. Loved the little cocktail-shaker table, and the wine decanter which we were happy to have a chance to make use of. Beautifully quiet, felt like the walls were very thick. VERY comfortable king-size bed, nice robes provided. My only critique, which may sound a bit trivial, is that contrary to the photos of this particular room size, there was only ONE sitting chair. This seemed a bit silly, given that the room is obviously for at least 2 people. To be clear, there were also two dining chairs, but these were not the sort of comfy chairs you might sit in to read a book or watch TV, and they were also a very different height to the one sitting chair, so it felt a bit comical to pull it over to sit next to the other one. It's a minor design flaw, but if Mint actually reads these reviews, I'd certainly recommend adding a second chair to improve future folks' stays! (I guess it wouldn't matter if you were using the room just as a base while you explored the city, but I'm hazarding a guess that for the foreseeable covid-y future, everyone is coming here to curl up and be cozy for a spell, when the 4 walls of their own apartment are driving them mad). On that note, I should also mention that the stay felt very covid-safe. Staff and other customers very punctilious about mask usage, santiiser available everywhere, and a disposable santisation kit in the bathroom too. The room was also in a very clean and tidy state immediately upon arrival, the whole thing was very confidence inspiring.","travelDate":"2021-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Although the location of the front desk was a bit strange, the host working was very friendly and personable. He interacted well with the customers and was polite and accommodating. The check in process was well informed and very helpful, although some of the rules and regulations were not included in the booking process. It should be mentioned that there is an expected quiet time, although there wasn\u2019t any issues, it would be nice to have expected that before arrival. After checking in, I was surprised to find some not so appealing art work that filled the hotel, halls and the room. Although the portraits were colorful and fun I did not find it very comforting to have large faces all over the room, across from the bed and next to the kitchen table, essentially just \u201cstaring\u201d. I found it pretty odd. Also, the room was extremely spacious, but was confused as to why the layout placed the couch near the front door separate from the kitchen and everything else. The couch did not end up being used since it was so far away. Loved the kitchen and bathroom. Overall, the room was well worth the price and I can say that my guests and were satisfied. 4\/5 stars, glad the Mint House could provide a location for me to send off my going away get together.","travelDate":"2021-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Le camere vengono riassettate tutti i giorni e a fondo 1 volta alla settimana. Ovvero il cambio lenzuola \u00e8 settimanale ma all'interno degli armadi sono riposti set di asciugamani per coloro che usano cambiare asciugamani tutti i giorni. Al piano rialzato, dove c'\u00e8 la reception c'\u00e8 un coffee shop che serve anche colazioni e snack. All'angolo della via la cosa pi\u00f9 preziosa, un fantastico supermarket fornito di tutto, inclusa una serie infinita di piatti pronti, sushi, pizza nel caso si voglia mangiare in camera ma senza cucinare. All'angolo opposto un negozio di alcolici dove acquistare ottimo vino. Non manca nulla, neppure la palestra, con accesso dedicato agli ospiti e lavatrici e asciugatrici al piano 6. Volendo trovare un piccolo difetto posso dire che le camere sono abbastanza buie, in parte perch\u00e9 come tutti sappiamo a causa dei palazzi molto alti a Manatthan gli appartamenti non prendono molta luce, in parte perch\u00e9 forse \u00e8 un po' carente l'illuminazione all'interno della camera, soprattutto nella zona tv\/letto, ma direi che si pu\u00f2 ampiamente sorvolare. Credo che la prossima volta torner\u00f2 qua continuando a scegliere questa soluzione a quella dell'hotel classico. La metro \u00e8 a 2 minuti, comodissimo. Un ringraziamento particolare va a Robert che \u00e8 stato sempre presente, disponibile e gentilissimo. Su di lui potete contare. Grazie. ","travelDate":"2020-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Aside from the little bumps I mentioned earlier, our stay was perfect.  So wonderful to have space in a Manhattan hotel room! While the street noise is quite loud during the day\/early evening, nights are not bad at all. Plus the hotel provides both earplugs and a white noise machine for us light sleepers. And I did not hear any noise from other suites whether adjacent or above\/below. Fantastic for an older building!\nThe bed is incredibly comfortable with high quality linens and side tables\/shelves that provide both an outlet and usb ports.  \nThe bathroom is lovely and functional with large built in cabinets behind the mirrors, which helps make up for the lack of counter space. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash by Malin & Goetz smells great and feels luxurious. \nWe had the 1 bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms, which was a nice feature when my daughter and I were both getting ready at the same time. \nThere's a small dining set as you walk into the suite, but it's not super convenient and doesn't have a window, so we just didn't use it and thus was wasted space. \nThe record player was perfect for us as we are vinyl junkies. And the selection of music upon arrival was perfect to get us started. \nOther wonderful details:\n-bar cart with beautiful accessories including a wine opener, pourer, stopper, etc. \n-coffee table had a lift up top so you could eat while watching tv if u choose\n-Fello Stagg electric kettle pour-over coffee system with Sey coffee - I had never used this system before and I was blown away! Incredible - so incredible that I purchased one as soon as I got home! \n-lots of teas provided as well\n- a couple of throw blankets and poufs, which made the suite very comfortable and cozy for a night of movie watching\n-upon arrival the suite had 2 cartons of water and some chocolate-covered almonds waiting for us\nThere's a great market right downstairs in the same building to grab items to stock the kitchen and the hotel will actually do it for you if you'd like without any extra fees!\nAnd there's a fabulous restaurant as well by the  Michelin-starred chef behind Nomad. Amazing food and drinks. \nEasy walk to various subway lines. It took us about 15-20 minutes to get to midtown. So we found the location to be perfect. \nAs you can tell, we loved the place! I make frequent visits to NYC and plan on making the Lyric at 70 Pine my home away from home. \n","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

To start, it's extremely hard to find out how to get into the building, especially lugging a 50 lb suitcase, carry-on, and purse after flying cross country all night.  No bellman in sight to assist. Only a doorman to indifferently point to the other side of the building. Staff at check-in were very nice and informative. No lobby space to really hang out in. (Or for UberEats to find - it took him 25 minutes searching the building! Lol)\nWhen I say hotel, I mean apartment! Beautiful, clean minimalist rooms. I've never seen hotel rooms quite like this in Manhattan. Note: in this particular suite (1bd\/2 ba.), there are only 2 small windows so the rooms are a bit dark. Had I known, I would have definitely inquired whether the larger suite had bigger\/more windows and booked that. (I don't care about a view - this is Manhattan- but natural light is important to me for stays of this length)\nAnd be warned - street noise is LOUD! It literally sounds like the windows are wide open. I know that's par for the course in NYC, but I'm on the 5th floor and this is probably the worst I've heard it in my 20 years of visiting NYC.  Thankfully, the hotel provides earplugs! \nThere were several things missing from my room upon check in (like the promised coffee! Lol) that required me to have to contact the front desk. The staff responded and made sure I eventually received those items. But it made me feel like an a**hole and embarrassed that I had to keep calling down for things that should've been in my suite.\nI will update my review at the end of my stay to include a review of the bed, whetger the earplugs work, etc. Hopefully, no more glitches!","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The foyer has been restored to one of the most stunning Art Deco designs that I have seen. The elevators are fast and reliable. Also, if you like great coffee, there is a fantastic cafe just off the foyer called the Black Fox with coffee which matches a Melbourne cafe experience.

We were here for 4 nights and wanted to be here for the Xmas lights. There's only one word to describe this hotel AMAZING it's beyond anything we expected. The rooms are so spacious it was like our very own apartment, we could have lived there. The staff are fantastic sorry we only got the name of Robert but he was brilliant and really funny, but all the staff we met were really helpful and couldn't do enough for you. It's close to the subway,although we only used it a couple of times as we both like walking and wanted to see as much as we could in the short time we were there. It's close to Brooklyn bridge, the staton island ferry, wall street, 911 memorial and stones street which had lovely bars and restraunts all was within easy walking distance. There's a food market practically next door where you can get more or less anything,one night we were tired after a full day's walking round we called and got a hot chicken, baguette and rice and a few beers (you need photo id to purchase alcohol) and took it up to the room, we had a lovely dining table to eat at and a big comfy setee to chill and watch telly,there was even a record player with a selection of records to listen to. The bed was huge and so comfy, we had 2 bathrooms and a walk in closet with a safe and plenty of drawer and hanging space. We had a full kitchen with an island and even a dish washer, we didn't want to leave. I would definitely stay here again, so much nicer than being on Times square, we loved it and the surrounding area it was perfect in every way.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There are so many positives about staying here. It starts at check in, everyone was so professional, informative and helpful. They great you with a smile and explain in detail everything you need to know about the facilities as well as getting settled in to your room. Once you open the door and enter your HUGE apartment style room you\u2019ll know you made the right choice for accommodations. The rooms are the closest thing to feeling like being at home I\u2019ve ever experienced. Clean, spacious and comfortable. The kitchens are fully stocked with everything you need. They have goodies, coffee, tea, water and snacks waiting for you free of additional charges. There is an abundant amount of closet space in each unit, including multiple dressers for all of your personal items. We personally loved the white noise machine for drowning out the very little city noise when trying to sleep. Speaking of sleep, the beds are some of the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever slept in. Every night of sleep was the best night of sleep in my life. The location of the hotel is perfect In my opinion. Just far enough away from downtown to feel like you\u2019re able to wind down from the fast pace of the city. There is a subway stop directly across the street, so you can literally jump on one train and be at any of the numerous popular city spots in a matter of 5-20 minutes. There is a grocery store on site and numerous food options within a minute or less walk. The 9\/11 memorial and many other popular attractions are within a half mile or 10 minute walk away. Also, if you pack lite or are there for a extended amount of time, it\u2019s very nice to be able to do laundry on facility. Again, there\u2019s a million things that can be said for this place. Not one being negative in my opinion. We enjoyed our stay very much and 100% will be staying at the Lyric every time we visit New York! ","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel was very quiet, which is a real plus in a place like New York. I have often stayed in Manhattan and even in 4 star hotels found the street noise very annoying at night. The staff was friendly and helpful. I fractured a tooth during my stay.  The staff referred me to a dentist a block away who saw me right away.  The dentist patched up the crack which allowed me to finish my trip and get home for a permanent treatment.  Boxed water is free.  There is a market in the basement with a few vendors and a big selection of food items.  The building has a high end restaurant, a great coffee shop and a healthy fast casual restaurant.  Up the street is a deli that opens early for breakfast.  There is a subway stop across the street and other lines are nearby.

The location is definitely just what we wanted (a subway station is almost directly opposite) and the historic nature of the building was outstanding.  The refurbished room we were checked into, also met all of our expectations regarding style and size.  It was an apartment style large room with a full kitchen (including a dishwasher), excellent storage and a bathroom that had a shower above a bath tub.  The extra high shower head was certainly appreciated by my partner who is very tall.  We stayed for over 6 nights, so the ability to unpack and place items in the storage behind the bathroom mirror was great.  \n\nThe bed was nice and large and very comfortable.  The service on check-in was friendly and helpful and we got great support from the front desk when we had to use the laundry next door due to renovations on level 6.  Housekeeping was very good too.  They tidied our room each day and cleared out the dishwasher every time we used it, which was really nice.  Other conveniences in the room included a safe for our valuables and a SMART TV.   \n\nThe only two issues that were not great were the awful internet connectivity and the horrendously noisy rubbish trucks that came overnight (usually around 3am and then again around 5am).  Our room was facing Cedar Street and this may not be a problem for those whose rooms face Pine street, but trust me, despite double glazing, the noise in the street overnight to remove all the waste left for collection was awful. It was so loud that on two nights it woke us up and we were not able to get to sleep again as the trucks cleared the almost 15 waste bins and piles of waste bags.    \n\nAs we were on holiday, the internet connectivity was not such a big deal, but our devices kept dropping out of the wireless connection - so we were not able to do much.  It was probably the worst internet connection I have had in a long while.  \n\n","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Lyric is ideal because it's really quiet yet the Wall Street subway is right there and you can be in Times Square in no time at all via an express train. Plus you can walk to so many places of interest from the hotel. The TKTS South Street theatre ticket booth is literally 5 minutes' walk away. There's also a pretty good deli\/grocery store underneath the hotel. We had relatively little interaction with the friendly staff but that's a good indicator of a successful stay I'd say. \n\nI highly recommend Lyric and hope to return.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Lyric gave you a good service. Staff were nice and helpful. The hotel was situated in downtown which gave us a quiet timr at night and during weekends. \n\nWe stayed in one bedroom with 2 bathrooms type. The room was big (100m2). Full kitchen and well-equipped, although we rarely used the kitchen. Comfortable sofa at the living room. One office. Very comfortable and big sized bed. However, there was no separation between a bathtub and a shower. We had to stand in a bathtub for showering.\n\nThe other thing that could be the inferior part was the front which had no space to park the car, even for temporary parking. You had to hurry getting off the car, or else the car behind you had to wait.\n\nAnyway, we both felt comfortable staying here. Next visit in NYC, Lyric will be one of our choices.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Add on to that, after flying in from California for a work trip, that I was already nervous for, my luggage got lost.  From the moment I walked into the hotel I was impressed - the architecture is lovely and the \"room\" I was in was actually a 2 bedroom suite with a full kitchen, sizable living room, and a washer dryer! As nice as the accommodations are, every staff member I interacted with was exceptional.  Before even checking in, Rob found a store nearby and made sure I was able to make it there and get clothes for my business meeting before the store closed at 11 pm. When I called for my customary 2 wake up calls, another Robert offered me a knock on the door - a first for me- not to mention the extra laundry soap, water, and umbrella loan. My luggage drama extended over much of my stay and JP was patient with my repeated calls and called as soon as my bag arrived.  He and Gio made sure that I had the latest checkout they could manage, gave me dinner recommendations, tips for the airport, and more.  The staff here is truly exceptional - the best service I have ever had at a hotel - the staff here made me feel welcomed and taken care of - without any phoniness or pretense.  I will be requesting this hotel for all of my NYC visits to come.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"NONE"}

It was a last-minute arrangement because our Airbnb host cancelled our reservation. \n\nThe hotel is a great find, and actually a very good option if you're staying in Manhattan. It is very roomy compared to other hotels in Manhattan. It is very close to attractions and historical spots (Broadway Street is 2 short blocks down, World Trade Center, Westfield Mall, Trinity Church), touristy food joints (Shake Shack, Luke's Lobster, Insomnia Cookies, Artichoke Bastille Pizza, Vanessa's Dumplings). It is right across the Wall Street Station too, which makes it easy to move around Manhattan. We walked from the hotel to the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge and was there in 5 minutes, easy walking. On weekends when the Wall Street Station is closed, you can move around via the Fulton Street Station which is a few minutes away, too. There is a coffee place at the ground floor of the building called Black Fox. Good croissants. City Acres is just around the corner. \n\nWe stayed in a studio which means a small walk-in closet, living area, full kitchen (with everything you need, including an oven and a dishwasher), and a small foyer. It is a comfortable space for a family of 3. It is spanking clean, one thing we love about it. They provide L'Occitane toiletries too, including a good number of towels. Big bed with ample number of pillows as well. The room is cleaned everyday. There is an on-site laundry facility with about 6 pairs of washer dryer which was very convenient for us. There was a gym too, but we never used it. Check-in and out was quick. We registered to the Guestbook (theguestbook.com) which gave us rebates. I would recommend this. \n\nI have no qualms staying again at Q&A in case I go back to Manhattan.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The same manager who was on duty on the two occasions we came to the desk to work out the issue was well aware of it and hardly managed a 'sorry'.  In short, we used one card to guarantee the booking on the net but presented a different card at check in and made it clear that that was going to be the payment card (it being a USD card instead of a GBP card) BUT that we would be splitting payment at check at with the other couple at check out so that card would not pay the full account.  They still charged the wrong card and cost us quite a bit in fees and lost exchange.  Without wasting your time reading the full story, just take our advice to watch them like a hawk to avoid incorrect and repeat payments at all sorts of unexpected times!  This isn't the 'norm' where they charge you upon check out.  All very poor and disappointing. \n\nAnyway, moving onto the reasons why you should stay at Q&A!!  \n\nWe had a two bed apartment for four people and we had PLENTY of room - it is a huge space!  Having a washing machine is great, although I gather that is only a feature of the two-beds.  The gym is also great - really a high quality facility though don't get up too early on a Sunday as they don't open!!! We just absolutely LOVED the building and all original features - an art deco masterpiece of a foyer!  The Black Fox coffee shop is excellent and as coffee fanatics we breathed a sigh of relief to have exceptional coffee close at hand. The City Acres market on site is also very high quality.  Make sure to venture downstairs and not just think it is the 'convenience' section upstairs.  The bed is so comfy and although we hardly slept as we had extremely long days and nights exploring, the hours of sleep were very good in that bed!  Cuddly bath robes and also great bathroom products replaced regularly enough.\n \nThe comments on things that could be improved are:  There needs to be more dining chairs!  Why are there only two chairs in an apartment for four people?!  Weird.  We couldn't have a sit down dinner properly and we had to perch on a desk chair and a bar stool!  There is not near enough light in the bedrooms.  There is no 'built in'\/fixed lighting in the ceilings and you only have bedside lights.  The bedside fittings are extremely temperamental and we had to ask for one to be fixed (although that was done promptly - thank you).  Coasters and placemats would be good inclusions in the kitchenwares and also a clothes airer as not everyone likes to use clothes dryers. \n\nThe location is great for proximity to Wall Street and Broad Street subway stations if you are happy being based in the FiDi --- and why not, some great dining options down there.\n  \nI would definitely return but would just need 100% assurance (is that possible even?!) they would not be so out of control and cavalier with the credit card charging like we experienced this time.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was given what appeared clearly to be the studio. When I queried it on checkin, I was told it was the executive studio. I still question this and was disappointed ad I had specifically selected the executive studio for the extra privacy the floor plan offered. The suite was very clean and the kitchen stocked with the basics. Know this is not a hotel and items used are not replenished, e.g. single use coffee pack used and not restocked in 5 days. Had to go buy both coffee and filters from the pricey store in the basement. The suite has limited natural light and looks out on an office building. At night it was noisy due to garbage collection and night construction. Oddly Pine Street was always wet as it has a pipe draining water down it all the time. It is across from the 1\/2 subway station Wall Street but know this entrance is locked evenings and weekends. During the day you access it through a designated \"public space\" where there were homeless asking gor money. We ended up walking to Wall Street to access the other line. Location is not ideal as it is the last subway stop before being technically in Brooklyn. Calling it located in Manhatten isnt really accurate. Although clean and spacious, I would not stay here again due to location and night noise. Of course NYC can be noisy but generally one accepts this to get location. This hotel has offers a very large clean space. Unless you are staying a long time, the full kitchen isnt  useful. Hopefully the shop downstairs will become more affordable: fruit was less expensive at a market on Fifth Avenue by Central Park.

There is a nice coffee shop in the building, so we could get coffee (and go back to the room) without having to wear our coats. Free fast internet. \n\nCONs? For two of the three nights, garbage trucks worked from 2-3am, waking us both up. Even my spouse who isn't very noise sensitive was awoken by this. Worse, when I mentioned this at check-out (without a request for anything because we already paid for the room on hotels.com), the very terse response was \"this is NYC and we don't have control over the trash.\" I don't know if very fake sympathy would have been worse, but surely management could train its employees with a more palatable script. \n\nI struggled about 2 versus 3 stars, but if 2 is below average and 3 is average, I'd say we've been to NYC over the years to know when customer service is subpar.

Major pros: 1. the rooms are big, even enormous by NYC standards, some of the premium rooms are like good size apartments.  2. Kitchens are great, fully equipped, perfect for longer stays with massive fridge, proper cooker, toaster etc. 3. Staff professional and obliging (and don't expect any tip, seems odd in NYC but it's because there are no doormen or porters, it's all done by the desk staff). 4. Location, though slightly dry, has stunning multiple subway connections (if u can find the entrances), is right by Wall St and near WTC and Liberty boats.  5.  Gym is great. 6. 70 Pine is a cool historic building with great detailing in lobbies. Cons. 1.  All rooms are on low floors with low level street views at best, no sunlight. 2.  Arrival\/departure with baggage is awkward, there's a guy to operate the revolving door (use entrance opposite Deutsche Bank) or use the step-free door, but you need to take your own bags through lobby to reception; and for departure there are no yellows in Pine, you need Uber or hotel car, and they may have difficulty stoping in such a narrow street. 3.  Decor is rather sombre. 4. The coffee bar in the building is not linked to the hotel, perhaps that doesn't matter, there are many other places nearby.  5. Cleaning is restricted unless you pay extra. Hint: if you want food to use in the wonderful kitchen, go to Jubilee market two blocks north on John\/Gold, far better than the place in the building.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The apartment was clean and has all the amenities we wanted - king size bed with comfortable bedding, full kitchen with microwave and stove\/oven, big fridge, cutlery, crockery, air conditioning\/heating, self-service laundry - you name it and they have it!

The City Acres market conveniently located on the first floor allowed us to either get fresh produce to cook on our own or buy prepared food when we're feeling lazy. The subway is just across the road or around the corner depending on the time of day (or night!) you wanted to wander around NYC. if you like to stay close and just take a walk, there are a lot of dining and shopping options near Broadway. If you like to drink great coffee (Melbournian-owned), then head to the Black Fox at the building entrance.

Q&A didn't disappoint. By all standards is at least four stars. While price wise is similar with other four stars hotels, you have the benefit of modern large rooms, double the size of regular hotel rooms and on top a full kitchen with Bloomberg appliances. Situated in the Financial District, just behind Deutsche Bank is within two minutes walking  to subway 2&3 and 15 min to Battery Park (for the ferries) or 9-11 Memorial. Quite far from Times Square or Central Park (4 miles), you need to use transit. The subway system is very easy to use and it gets you everywhere really fast. I saw people with large suitcases going to and from the airports. Don't rent a car, you will regret it. Parking is insanely expensive in Manhattan but most of the time you will be stuck in traffic.That brings me to the only complaint about Q&A, there is no parking or at least a temporary parking to allow you to check-in.Pine Street is a very narrow, one lane street and it was a nightmare to check-in without blocking the traffic. I recommend this hotel for longer stays  (3 days or more) to take full advantage of the kitchen. Not too many groceries stores in the neighborhood, a Whole Foods is about 20 min by foot, but if you use transit you can go to the suburbs and buy food. The hotel is only six stories high and if you're looking for rooms with a view, this is not the place for you.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Apartment looked just as in travellers pictures on tripadvisor. It was quite dark all the time even though the weather was sunny. There is very sparse interior lighting and it made for a quite somber atmosphere. We didn't spend any time in the reading nook for this reason, even though the chair was comfortable. Furniture wise the apartment is baby proof. The baby bed is quite small, has metal bars and wheels. No bedding is included, probably for safety reasons. The sofas had a leather 'look' but felt very plastic and were not comfortable to sit on.\nLoved having a seperate bedroom.\nNo noise from other rooms.\nAt times, it was difficult to find items because of the darkness in the rooms (even with all lights turned on).\nCame home one day after day of shopping, to find our front door unlocked and ajar. Called front desk who suggested we had left it open when we left. She came up with wine and chocolates afterwards, but not further actions were taken.\nCleaning only done once a week. When we arrived, there were several stray hairs in the bathtubs and on the beds and smudges on the sink and walls.\nLounge area: self service area with some vending machines and free tea in the morning. No comfortable sitting, generally not an area where you would go to relax. \nOverall: liked the sized of the appartement, the quality of the kitchen and the location.\nDid not enjoy coming home to an open front door, friendliness of the staff and standard of housekeeping.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed at the Q&A for a few days in late May and I can honestly say that the excellent reviews are accurate and well-deserved. From the moment we first reached out to the hotel to make our reservation (one person in our party is staying for over two months, so we needed a bit of guidance) it was clear that Q & A takes customer service seriously. Julianne, our initial point of contact, was helpful, knowledgeable \u2013 and genuinely warm and welcoming! The rooms (apartments) she found for us were perfect! The front desk staff is also very helpful, friendly and accommodating. \n\nThe building is located in a nice and very convenient part of the Financial District and it houses a full-service market and gym. I purchased a few items from the market for breakfast and because the apartment includes a kitchen was able to save money (and calories) by eating exactly what (and when) I wanted. The business center, which was located very close to my apartment, put out coffee and tea each morning and I took advantage of that as well. I also took advantage of having a gym in the basement. The equipment, which was varied, seemed to be new and well-maintained. \n\nMy husband and I lived in a studio in NYC in late 1980s and I can tell you that the Q &A apartment that I stayed in was easily double the size. I didn't even know you could find a hotel with rooms as big as the one I stayed in while at Q&A. The space was truly amazing. I could hear a bit of noise from the street but nothing unexpected \u2013 it's NYC. Given the size of the apartment, I do have to add that the bathroom felt a bit small. There were two medicine cabinets (but one sink), which made finding a place for my stuff a bit easier. Storage in the rest of the apartment was plentiful. I had my choice of two huge closets, which again, blew my mind.  We will definitely stay at Q&A for future trips to NYC.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Not only was the kitchen fully equipped, but the hotel also graciously and promptly provided me with additional appliances and whatnot such as a blender and extra pots and pans when I requested them. \n\nWe hit a glitch on the day of my arrival, however, since someone had dumped some hideously potent deodorant down into the air-conditioning (apparently to cover up an odor - smoking perhaps?) and made the room uninhabitable, so we had to move to another smaller room for the night. Then we had to move into another unit the next day, but it was only available after 3:00, which made me waste a whole day in New York. Laurie was the manager who kindly arranged for those moves and who apologized profusely for the inconvenience. The next day, General Manager Derek sent me a message apologizing also, and he gave me credit for two nights, which was a welcome solution that allayed my annoyance and has kept me a loyal guest of the hotel.\n\nAs usual, I took full advantage of the gym downstairs, which was always pretty uncrowded and therefore pleasant. I learned too late (a day before I left) that there is an additional sub-floor that offers a bowling alley, golf simulator games, a ping pong room, and more, but that hotel guests needed to pay $30 per day for all-day use of these facilities. In my opinion, that is a bargain for being able to spend a whole day exercising and spending time there.\n\n An added bonus to this trip was the City Acres Market that had opened in the basement of the building: the market is simply huge (2 floors) and has everything but everything! This made grocery shopping super convenient, and when I wasn't in the mood to cook, the market had all sorts of deli specialty corners to make life even easier. \n\nMarshall was a familiar face I was happy to see again at reception. As always, he was helpful, hospitable, and competent. Alex was a new addition to the staff, and he always had a smile and a warm greeting to make my stay a little more welcome. JP and Michelle were also always graciously willing to help out with any issues that came up. In addition to the room and facilities at Q and A, the friendly staff make this hotel one of the best I have stayed at.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I loved my stay, will definitely return, and highly recommend.\n\nThe hotel itself is on the first six floors of the beautifully restored Cities Services Building, now a residential building.  Reception is easy to find, sign posted and located in an office area in a corner of the ground floor. \n\nI booked an Executive Studio Apartment (Holland Residence) and was amazed at how large, modern and tasteful the room was.  Whilst I'd seen the online photos, it exceeded my expectations. The room was apartment style with a large open living plan for the bed, couch, dining and full kitchen.  There was a separate study area.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  I loved the walk-in wardrobe (indeed, I dream of having a walk-in wardrobe just like this one).  There was an in-room safe, iron and ironing board.  There were two separate air conditioning units - one in the bedroom and one in the study, allowing me to turn off the one near the bed and still keep the room cool during the night from the unit in the study.  The full kitchen had a good selection of utensils (but no cooking supplies such as oil, salt, pepper provided). I made use of the stove top, oven, fridge and dishwasher and all worked well.\n\nThe bathroom was clean.  I loved the fluffy thick towels and L'Occitane products.  The large owl in the bathroom is a little odd and a dust magnet - it didn't bother me but freaked out my friend who was convinced there was hidden camera (even though I assured her I'd already checked) and climbed up on the toilet to cover it with a towel.\n\nMy room was on the Sixth Floor and overlooked offices.  I didn't notice the night time truck noise others mention, but am use to living in the city.\n\nI was impressed with the laundry room that was on each floor.  It was spotless and contained 6 washers and 6 dryers.  It was $2.75 for a wash or dry which could be paid by credit card.  I did multiple loads - great machines and very quick and convenient.\n\nA friend stayed over for a night and I was able to obtain a very comfortable rollaway to put in the study space for that night for $50.\n\nThe location near Wall Street is fantastic.  There is a quality grocery market around the corner with fresh produce, good supermarket selection, and excellent prepared meals.  The red line is just steps up the road and the green line is a couple of blocks away.\n\nI stayed for 6 nights and the apartment felt like home.  My only con was housekeeping only do a \"refresh\" every day (replace towels if requested, take out trash, and make the bed), with a full clean and sheet change every 7 nights. I'm fine with the concept, but wish there had been a broom or handheld vacuum so I could keep the wooden floors clean during my stay.  I only requested the refresh twice - the first time was as expected, the second time I returned to the hotel around 5pm and housekeeping didn't come by until around 5.30pm by which time I was on a work conference call and had to decline service. As I didn't request a refresh each day, I took my kitchen trash out daily and it would have been helpful if the hotel provided extra trash liners for the kitchen bin.\n\nDuring my six night stay my hotel rate averaged $352, fluctuation between a low of $234 to a high of $471 - the space is well worth the average rate.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We get to IconParking on S William St., The manager explains to us 1: they have never been affiliated with the hotel (not true) 2 :they could not give us a discount because the sticker was different.  We were puzzled and called QA while at IconParking, QA also confirmed they \"NEVER\" were affiliated with IconParking which is simply not valid, we have evidence of payment.  At this point i am beyond late for work and livid, the manager at IconParking then explains to us the new stamp says IParking* a very minute difference. QA then calls the manager at IconParking and relayed to him they did INDEED have an IconParking stamp, the manager then suggested we go back to QA to further sort this out and he could see what he could do for us.  Again, at this point we were fuming because of the lack of care and communication.  We get to QA the manager is already available to speak to us( which I appreciate), she then tells us that QA ended their affiliation with IconParking over a year ago.  1: that was the complete opposite of what we were told over the phone.  I would not have any problem with this (because I understand things change) except for the fact that i stayed at QA THIS February and received a stamp for IconParking, and received a discount at the same parking lot with zero problems.  I then asked, if the partnership ended over a year prior, why did we get a stamp for them this past February ?.  The manager simply said that they were still using the stamps for IconParking at that point and ( EVEN THOUGH THE PARTNERSHIP HAD ENDED) had just recently gotten rid of all the stamps..... Granted she did take the time to look for any stamps but I think the response was negligent and lacked tact .  She then apologized with no further assistance.  I at this point I was hoping there would be a further explanation rather than \" We still used the stamp after we ended the partnership\". This is confusing to customers and completely deterred my plans for work Friday morning.  Luckily, the manager at IconParking gave us a break and we received the discount anyway for our troubles ( so the 2 plus hour wait was not all for naught).  Again, this is not about the discount it is about the principle of the issue, I just think in this particular instance QA responded poorly with a sub-par explanation.  The parking situation should have been made more clear.  I love QA but this experience left a bitter taste in my mouth.  I have been coming here for years and I was just very very disappointed in how we were handled. I hope that this is the first and last time this incident occurs.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location was great - very easy walk to many attractions, shops, restaurants. I loved the high ceilings and spaciousness of the rooms. Having a fully outfitted kitchen was very nice and I used it often rather than eating out all the time. The City Acres Market just around the corner was very convenient to pick up grocery items (*tip - exit the market through the back door and you are in the basement of the building, just ride the elevator up to the main lobby and then walk to the hotel bank of elevators). The safe in the closet was spacious and held my laptop and other items with room to spare. I very much enjoyed having the Bose Bluetooth speaker in the room so I could stream music from my phone. I never heard any noise from my neighbors, just \"city noise\" from the street. \n\nHonestly the only thing that kept me from giving this property an excellent rating are a few items... first, and most important, were the staff.  It was really hit 'n miss with the staff.  Some were super helpful, pleasant and responsive, and others seemed like you had just really imposed on them for the simplest request and were very abrasive.  I found I had to call or email two or three times just to get the item I had requested, or issue addressed. (there is a feature in the Q&A app to submit requests, but I don't think it works, or the requests do not get passed along). Second, a few things that could have made the room better: a soap dish in the shower or someplace other than the corner of the tub to put things like soap, shampoo, razors, etc.  A full length mirror some place in the room. A better sofa, I found myself sitting on the ottoman if I wanted to watch TV as the sofa was very uncomfortable, and the TV wouldn't really turn so you could watch it from the bed. Finally, the laundry room - while the room itself was clean, the washers and dryers needed some attention, they were caked with \"gunk\" and needed a good cleaning.  Also $2.75 to wash and $2.75 to dry?!?!  Maybe I just haven't visited a public laundromat in awhile, but that seemed a little expensive to me.\n\nAll in all and great stay and I would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend to others, especially for long term stays.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I like the FIDI district and felt safe here as a woman alone. I liked the room size, cleanliness, bed comfort, amenities and kitchen. I would easily stay here again so the following 2 comments are my only negative experiences.\nI was offered an upgrade but did not realize that with the larger size suite would also come being on the side of the room over the parking area for the garbage truck that would come and go all nite, compressing garbage. At 2 Am I requested another room and moved in the middle of the nite. Management wrote me a note and gave me candy for my trouble. I would suggest that a better option might be asking if you are heavy or light sleeper before the room upgrade offered and asking if the size of the room was more important than the noise factor. Since when I was checking in I reminded the clerk that I asked for a quiet room and he assured me that this was indeed a very quiet room, I was unhappy.\nMy second issure came the day I checked out. I was n the lobby with my suitcases and the clerk refused to call me a taxi. She stated that she could not order  a taxi ahead of time...but I was there at the time I needed one. She told me to go to Water St and hail one. I did so but thought it was ridiculous that a 70 year old woman was told to haul her own suitcases to Water st to hail a cab. Never stayed anywhere, even a restaurant that would not call me a cab. Please train your desk staff not to lie about the quiet of the room and to call a cab on the spot when a guest is waiting. Other than that I can live with it.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Hotel blocks are from the sixth floor and below, which means natural light is at a premium; at that level, other buildings such as 80 Pine jut into the sky. You do get the opportunity to watch people in other office buildings, though. :) \n\nI've stayed here more than a few times, occupying two bedroom units all the way down to the entry level studios. D\u00e9cor is consistent, though larger rooms offer greater amenities, such as a washer\/dryer combo. Bathrooms are uniform: tub, toilet, sink, surrounded by subway tile. Some variation in the kitchen layouts, but essentially the same representation across all the lines I've inhabited. Beds are comfortable, sheets are tight. HVAC can be a little challenging; a two bedroom unit was hard to keep warm in the middle of February. Artwork is interesting, promoting a sense of invention and innovation. Plenty of towels, a great counterpoint to Q&A's closest competitor, StayAKA Wall Street--they keep their towels under armed guard, apparently.\n\nFinding your room can be a bit of challenge. 70 Pine was built in the early 1930s, and has all the art deco charm of that period. But it also means narrow, twisting hallways with lots of turns; getting lost is easy, but you'll find your way eventually.\n\nOne demerit: if you stay in your room even a few minutes past 11, the front desk calls relentlessly to see when you're leaving. This happens even if you arrange for late check out. It's a nuisance and not a problem, but it can be annoying.\n\nThis is a tight area of Manhattan, and the streets are narrow and most are one lane. Traffic is a problem, and because of this, noise is constant. This part of NYC still shuts down after 11pm though, so sleep shouldn't be a problem. \n\nOverall, Q&A offers a great experience, and depending on the day you book (weekends are cheapest), you can get substantial value for your money.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Since there were three of us, we had an extra bed in the little \"office\" area.  The extra bed was an air mattress, but it was pretty comfortable. The only issue was that at first, it was not covered with a fitted cotton bed sheet, but there were blankets, so I thought at first it was really supposed to be that way. A few nights later, a fitted sheet was placed on it, so I guess housekeeping forgot.  Our apartment was clean, and it was very spacious.

The WTC Memorial is walking distance, and so is Battery Park.  There are several shops and restaurants around the hotel, though many of them are closed during the weekends.

I signed up for the friends with benefits rewards at the hotel I was a little disappointed about not getting the free upgrade based on availability but it's understandable the hotel seems to come across a lot of guests which is obvious. I have read recent reviews about people being forced out of the hotel at 11am. I have to say my experience was not this. I simply\nemailed the front desk in which Diane lee honored my request to check out at 1pm. \n\nAxel Fischer, general manager is a very kind gentlemen answering my email about a concern with my bill statement he was extremely professional and timely he handled my situation with kindness and respect. It is very hard to find a manager these days who is able to take the time to listen to a concern and to accommodate that person without any negativity. I believe this manager is running an extremely organized and professional environment and I can tell that the management at this hotel prides themselves on trying to accommodate every guest in the most fair way possible. I also feel they keep this establishment in great conditions and makes sure the staff is also on board. \n\nThe rooms are EXACTLY how they appear in the photo I purchased the executive suite and it was the exact replica of the websites photo. The rooms are extremely spacious and I mean it is more than enough room it's exactly like an apartment and the rooms are very neatly organized with massive closet space and plenty of plush towels. \n\nAlso would like to mention the bathroom a past review said there wasn't enough space for toiletries to be placed in the bathroom however my boyfriend and I noticed towards the last day of our stay that the huge mirrors open up into spacious cabinets for you to load any toiletries so if you're in the bathroom please check out the mirrors and you'll find a wonderful surprise. \n\nThe only\nDownside to bathroom is the shower drain I believe because this is an older building the drains are slow or clogged. It could have been our room but I'm praying next stay we get a great shower that drains. \n\nHotel to me was very quiet I keep reading comments about loud noises there is however the occasional garbage trucks but it's a very quick drive by and I live in upstate ny where it's very quiet and I still hear garbage trucks on garbage day don't think this is something we can ever really get away from. \n\nThe beds were very comfortable with huge soft pillows and enough blankets to keep warm. I also am in love with the smart tv's I think this is by far the best idea to have a smart tv in a hotel room and that many other hotels should adopt this idea. Basic cable just Isnt enough these days so kudos Q and A for this. \n\nAll in all\nStay was very pleasant and relaxing and we are planning to stay again next month the friends with benefits rewards is the best way to go they give you discounts on your bday month and also a free gift.

On the contrary, instead of issuing me the refund the night manager said would be issued, the general manager began trying to negotiate how much would be refunded.

We booked a double deluxe room (least expensive standard room) and were given a huge studio with a king-sized bed, walk-in closet, large bathroom, full kitchen (including dishwasher) and foyer. The spaciousness of the room was remarkable. The location, next to the Wall Street subway station and a block and a half from the New York Stock Exchange, is convenient for quickly getting to other parts of the city but also a little odd. If you are looking to walk out of your hotel into a lively New York street scene, this is not the place. The combination of narrow streets and tall buildings in and around Wall Street creates a dark, closed-in effect that is not appealing. On the other hand, the Freedom Tower, 9\/11 Memorial, Battery Park and the Staten Island Ferry are all within easy walking distance. The hotel itself appears to occupy the bottom floors of an Art Deco office building that has been converted to residences. The entrance and lobby areas look like an office building, not a hotel. Overall, the Q&A wins on value and spaciousness but the location is not ideal.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My repeated returns to Q & A testify to my satisfaction with the hotel, its employees, and its surroundings. \n\nBecause I was a returning guest, I got the \"friends with benefits\" upgrade to a larger room, which was pretty fantastic 1-room bedroom with 2 full baths. We were on the 6th floor, away from the elevator, so the room was quiet (I had a noisy room in front of the elevator last time I stayed). The service, as always, was fast and efficient: I got the extra set of pots and pans that let me cook to my heart's content in the spacious, fully equipped kitchen, and any clogging in the bathrooms was taken care of right away. The fitness center is usually uncrowded, and the laundry room always had available machines to use. The grocery store that was supposed to have opened in May had not opened during my stay, but I'm looking forward to the convenience of shopping in the same building during my next stay.\n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, and I would like to send an especial thanks to Marshall and Juan for making my stay pleasant. They are one important additional reason I return to this hotel regularly.\n\nFor those who haven't stayed at Q & A, it's located literally across from Wall Street Station, so you can't ask for a more convenient location in terms of transportation. And because it's right smack in the middle of the Financial District, there are simply loads of restaurants (including the famed Delmonico's) and shops (TJ Maxx down the street and Century 21 a few blocks over) in the area, all walking distance. \n\nLet my numerous stays at Q & A speak for themselves...I would not have returned so often and so regularly if it had disappointed me, but each time I stay there, I am very happy!","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I landed a special promo deal; but even at the normal rates, this Hotel delivers what the majority of Manhattan Hotel rooms (in this price range and above) don't even come close to. You walk into a wide, open entry that allows you to enter the room without banging luggage into walls or bumping into a closet door, etc... The bathroom is roomy with plenty of space to move around and beautiful large mirrored vanities that will hold ALL of your toiletries (and your families) without having to set them on a counter or other inconvenient places. The towels and linens are sumptuous and thirsty (you don't feel like you're trying to dry off with cheap, thin dish cloths)There is a separate Walk-in Closet that is to DIE FOR. Spacious, with shelving, alcoves, multiple closet bars for hanging everything. And, of course an ironing board, iron and safe for your valuables. The bed and bedding are incredibly comfortable and extremely CLEAN! Lighting around the room is well appointed, easy to operate and extremely attractive. My FAVORITE thing about the entire room was the KITCHEN! Full stove and stovetop, dishwasher, frig & freezer...ALL aesthetically built in with lots of counter space and beautiful dishes, stemware, flatware and cookware. You could throw a dinner party and prepare everything right in your room. The staff was incredibly professional and attentive to my every need (from front desk to housekeeping); and the building the hotel is in is beautiful and clean with wonderful doormen. There is a cafe in the lobby and a full-service Market just around the corner. Access to the Uptown or Brooklyn Express trains is right out the hotel door across the street; and on weekends, it's a short walk to the local. You are literally in the Wall Street District with excellent shopping, restaurants and historic sites (including One World Trade Center). This is NOT the hotel where the kids can swim in the pool or the adults can hang out all night in the Hot Tub. It's a nice, quiet, well-appointed Home-Away-From-Home where a single, couple or even family can be comfortable and enjoy being together in their room without feeling on top of each other.

Unfortunately the hotel could not guarantee an extra bed  prior to arrival and if not available on arrival  the only other  options that I could see available  were that my daughter either slept in the king size bed with my husband and I or on the settee, which in my opinion was not big enough  or comfortable enough for anyone older than ten.\nWe actually took  a blow up mattress and pump with us in case there was no extra bed!!\n I found it difficult to understand that you can rent a room out and charge for three people and not provide guaranteed sleeping arrangements for three people.\n\n After much worry and  concern prior to arrival because of the bed situation I was relieved to find that one had been provided.......sigh of relief......begin holiday! \n\nFor the record the apartments are massively spacious, have plenty of storage and are very homely........ although the lighting is quite dim especially in the kitchen area. We also had a couple of small  issues with the room but they were all dealt with super quick.\nThey also have one and two bedrooms available if you want to splash out a bit more  and your budget favors it!!.\n\nAll the staff that I spoke to were very pleasant and very helpful.\n\n As mentioned in previous reviews there is a subway opposite that will take you up town to Times Square and there are also other subways near by that will take you to other areas and attractions in the city as it is quite a distance to walk there\n.I preferred the lower end of Manhattan where the Q & A is situated as it is quieter and a little more spacious than up around Times Square.\n\nThere are lots of places to eat around this area and Battery park, Staten Island ferry, Freedom Tower,Brooklyn Bridge,and Wall Street are all within easy walking distance.......so is a huge Century 21 department store if you like your bargain shopping.\n\nOver all as I said earlier I would revisit this hotel even though I would again have to keep my fingers crossed that there would be a spare bed available on arrival!","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

A huge room complete with fully fitted kitchen, and an excellent bathroom suite. The staff where always polite and if they said they would do something they did it. Location was great too.

Very spacious and great kitchen facilities. We made ourselves breakfast each morning but as an Aussie I had to get coffees from the Black Fox cafe in the lobby each morning. A really good brew for the US who seem to still rate Starbucks- go figure \ud83d\ude04.\n\nOn the downside we had to remind them to make our bed on a couple of days and even the weekly change of linen didn't happen automatically. And the AC is a big unit behind the bed which can be noisy for light sleepers. \n\nA good surprise was being able to call Australia free from the phone in the room (my old mum doesn't do What's app or Viber!). A great location too. The subway across the road is closed on weekends but a short walk up to Broadway gets you to Wall Street or Fulton Street stations.\n\nClose proximity to a quieter TKTS booth, Seaport cafes and Stone Street (stumbled upon Otto my great surprise) is a positive. Personally I would rather this area than Uptown which is only 20 minutes by subway anyway.\n\nWill definitely stay at QandA next time we're in New York.\n","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Q&A is a rare gem which boasts the historical and architectural finesse of the 70 Pine Street building along with the modern confort of its extremely spacious apartments. Couldn't recommend more.

Having done a lot of searching for accommodation for the trip I was really worried about the amount of space you usually get for the amount of money paid in Manhattan but as soon as I found Q&A it was a done deal.\n\nThe location was absolutely perfect for us right in the middle of Wall St (and of course plenty of Irish pubs - make sure to take a trip to Ryan Maguire's if your in the area) and exactly opposite a subway station which only took 20-25mins to get to Times Square area. Plenty of eateries and Irish pubs within walking distance to enjoy!\n\nThe hotel room itself was outstanding - loads of space (walk-in closet and kitchenette), gleaming bathroom, very comfortable bed and great decor - we couldn't fault it. It was by far worth paying a little extra for how comfortable it was.\n\nThe building itself is also really impressive - art deco style with a wonderful little coffee shop\/cafe on the ground floor for coffee\/breakfast in the morning.\n\nStaff were really friendly and helpful - loads of information to hand about food\/travel and things to do\n\nOverall would absolutely stay again when we next visit!","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. I suggest to sign up for their rewards program,\nThey upgrade your room for no extra charge if available, AND you get a late checkout! I've stayed in many hotels in the city and this is by far my favorite experience. The financial district is close enough to the clubs and party scene but it's far enough that the streets around are calm and quiet and not in the midst of the commotion. Also the staff is incredibly kind and goes above and beyond to meet requests and make sure you're happy. LOVE YOU Q AND A! ","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were surprised the one bedroom unit was huge and all kitchen stuffs in full equipped.  The staffs are so friendly, especially Chanelle.\nWe had a wonderful stayed in New York for Q&A, we will definitely back next time in New York again.  But I want to suggest the hotel should have a valet parking for the clients especially the family with young kids like me.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}
