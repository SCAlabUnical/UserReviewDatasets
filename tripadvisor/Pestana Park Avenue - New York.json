Also there's several coat hangers for storing clothes behind the mirror and door. There's a small sink in the main room area next to the door to the shower room. Shower was large and great water pressure with toiletries provided.\nThere's a mini bar \/ fridge in the room. We purchased drinks outside and used it to store them and the large bottle of water provided for each stay.

The staff are so friendly and courteous, and the location can't be beat. It's only a few minutes' walk away from Grand Central Terminal, Bryant Park, NYPL, and 5th Avenue. \n\nWe initially booked a cozy\/cabin room on their website, which was a bunk bed situation. For two adults, it felt cramped, and we asked if we could upgrade to a larger room. Keener was receptive to our request and managed to get us a free upgrade to a classic room, which felt more spacious and had room to sit (much needed after a ton of walking!) The staff also were accommodating of our request to hold our luggage after check-out so we could explore the area.\n\nBoth rooms were clean and modern. The shower and sink were top-notch, with great water pressure. My main gripe was that most of the hooks in the rooms did not have stoppers at the ends, since the design was just a cylinder... so heavy coats and bags could slide right off. We managed to make do by rotating the standing mirror around, as there were metal bars on the back that could be popped out and used in lieu of hooks.\n\nWe loved the option of free breakfast -- it seems like earlier in the morning, they have croissants (pretty good, with a nice crunch to them), and then they swap in for bagels later. They also provide filtered water and cups in the breakfast area.\n\nOverall, a lovely experience! Next time, I will book the classic or superior room :)","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room was not serviced over the weekend which was not ideal but I asked for some clean towels and they were sent straight up to our room.

Alt var rent og ryddig, veldig hjelpsomme og hyggelige ansatte. Kunne spise frokost hver morgen nede ved resepsjonen, det ble lagt ut rundstykker, som man selv kunne sm\u00f8re p\u00e5 med syltet\u00f8y. Kaffemaskin og drikke var ogs\u00e5 tilgjengelig der nede. 5 min til Grand Sentral, hvor man kunne finne subway og busser. 10 min \u00e5 g\u00e5 til Times Square. En hyggelig park, Bryant Park l\u00e5 5 min fra hotellet. Vi bodde 1 uke p\u00e5 hotellet, og det var et perfekt opphold, kommer vi noen gang tilbake til New York, s\u00e5 kommer vi til \u00e5 bo p\u00e5 Pestana Park Avenue.\nTusen takk for oss!\n\nVennlig hilsen Wenche og Tommy :)","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

One word of caution for those staying longer than a couple of nights that are bringing a number of clothes to hang, there really is only minimal hanging space, so pack accordingly.\n\nThe bathroom was also compact, but modern and super clean with plenty of clean towels and a special mention for the supremely comfortable bed too and the ice cold air con, which definitely came in handy as the temps went over 90F, while we were there.\n\nA really nice touch and a great benefit if you\u2019re rushing out the door, first thing in the morning is the complimentary breakfast bagels and croissant available in the rear of the ground floor, past Reception. These are accompanied by all the usual associated cream cheese, jelly and butter available in an ice cold fridge, together with an excellent coffee machine, ice machine and microwave, so you can even warm up food you\u2019ve brought back to the hotel.\n\nThere\u2019s also ice cold lemon water provided too.\n\nI\u2019ve left the best to last though, which is the incredible friendliness and helpfulness of the team at The Pestana. Led by the lovely Lilly, her team looked after us admirably and Lilly herself was quick to resolve an issue on check-in, even though she was not actually working that day, which immediately showed the team\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction. \nSpecial shout out to Victor, Amelia and Juan ( I hope that\u2019s the right spelling!) for being so friendly, funny and helpful and especially to Lilly for all the help she gave us even before check-in, the great conversations, the room upgrade and the lovely gift for my upcoming birthday.\n\nIn summary, it\u2019s a great place to come and explore Midtown and beyond from if you\u2019re in the City for a few days, where you\u2019ll definitely get looked after in exemplary fashion by Lilly and her team, who are a supremely fun bunch.\n\nCan\u2019t rate them highly enough and can\u2019t wait to catch up with them, next time we\u2019re back in Manhattan.

The location is great, convenient to the subway and a reasonable walk from Penn Station. The thing I appreciated most is that the rooms are new, with clean wood-look floors instead of iffy-looking carpet. It was a welcome contrast to the many old, funny-smelling hotels around Manhattan that haven't been updated in ages. The bathroom is a riff on a European design, with a handheld wand as well as the showerhead and only a small curb to delineate the shower. The rooms are spartan but thoughtfully laid out and the Nespresso machine was welcome touch in the morning. The hotel actually has a normal nightly maid service, which has been depressingly rare since covid and they replaced my dirty coffee cup, added Nespresso pods, made the bed, and put out a fresh bath mat. HVAC is good, with the ability to run the fan so the room doesn't get stuffy. I didn't opt for a room with a view so mine looked out onto an office building, but there were sheer privacy curtains and nobody there in the evening so it wasn't a problem. The only major annoyance was that the refrigerator was set up as a mini-bar and wasn't cold. I have food sensitivities and count on having a fridge so that was a problem. The \"classic\" room I chose also turned out to be very poorly lit in the evening, making it hard to consolidate my notes. Don't plan on doing anything that requires more than a bedside reading lamp after dark. I couldn't see my knitting and I had to stand by the sink under the only decent light in the room to even do my nails. The lobby does offer better-lit seating, plus water and coffee available 24 hours if you don't mind the lack of privacy. There also isn't a closet, and my business clothes barely fit on the provided hangers and pegs. I'd probably stay here again because I liked the modern aesthetic and the cleanness but I'd bring a folding LED light and wrinkle-free clothes.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

He made it work so my mom and I got a larger room with a balcony & view!! Brandon was so kind, went above & beyond and made sure we had everything all set for a great stay. A couple other notes, I love that they have an indoor and outdoor area to hang out if you're waiting for a flight, Uber etc. They also store your luggage, have a refillable water machine (this is huge for me) and the rooms are so quiet. Having stayed at quite a few NYC hotels, I was shocked at how quiet my room was both times.

It was pupose built (not a conversion).  \n\nPlus my room on the 12th fl in the back was one of the quietest rooms I've ever had in NYC. Negative being on the back I faced another buidling which was perhaps 15-20' away (I swear I could read the computer in the office across the way!) It was also very dark (can't imagine the lower floors); so dark that I could almost not see the sky at all to know whether the sun was out or it was cloudy.  Positive. This room had outlets and USB ports galore more than enough for two people. Negative. I was in the Classic room and It would have been difficult to imagine two people comfortably in this room (can't imagine the cozy room!).  In addition there was no desk but a small coachlike bench with a laptop table. clever use of space but that worked for one; can't imagine what would happen if there were two.  Storage. There were two drawers under the bed and enough room to fit my suitcase underneath too. Negative there was no closet just some pegs on the wall which you could put hangers on; this worked Ok for one in the summer but can't imagine two in the winter! \n\nThe room design was attractive and the bed was very comfortable. The shower and toilet were in a separate room but the sink was in the bedroom. There was barely enough room for one person's toiletries certainly not for two (sense a theme?).  \n\nAs I said so much to like about the hotel but on almost every point for each postive there was a limiting negative.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

I was upgraded to a city view (which I could care less about - All I wanted was a quiet room).  This was my 1st night alone in 2 years since having a baby (moms out there who get their 1st night alone only want a good night sleep)..\nA good night sleep was impossible as I heard my next door neighbors conversation starting when I arrived back at the room - until 10:30pm - and then again when they returned and their door closed and they were chit chatting until 1am.  So a good night sleep was not an option.  Now, the shower - I love a good hot shower.  Unfortunately when someone flushed a toilet, the water pressure was non existent and it went from cold to piping hot.  Why is there no garbage pail or tissues in the room?  If you\u2019re visiting and not worried about a good night sleep and don\u2019t need space (I wouldn\u2019t recco for a couple with plans to stay more than 2 nights as there is no closet) - then this is a clean and centralized choice.  Otherwise, I\u2019d find someone else to stay.  P.s. I called downstairs 3 times to get a room change (or to see if I can get a quieter room) as I realized my night was doomed by the room next door by 9pm.  No one answered.  I also waited to be ask how my stay was during checkout  - he just tapped on the keyboard and said I\u2019m all set.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

I was coming into the city early around 10:30 am and I call the property to see if early check in would be available a nice gentleman told me that he could not guarantee early check in but that bag drop off would be available so I could enjoy the city without my bags.  We got to the hotel around 11am and was greeted by Sarafina she made the process super simple and was very nice. She was able to check us right in by allowing us an upgrade so it was nice to freshen up before going out for the day.  I knew instantly at that point the stay was going to be top notch.  The lobby is very modern and clean.  The entire check in process took less than 5 mins.  There is a $50 security deposit charge for each night you stay.  That was refunded to me within 2 days after check out.  The room is a good size for a NYC hotel.  The view was nice as well and equipped with full length mirrors, steamers, and refrigerator.  The bed was very comfortable sheets too.  I got the best sleep I had in quite some time.  It was nice there was an adjustable central air conditioning unit within the room since the windows barely crack open.  The shower was also very nice and clean.  We checked out with Marilyn and she was a true joy as well.  She was able to help me locate water and get us a bag for extra belongings we had acquired. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.  You are in walking distance of 5th avenue.  5 min walk to empire state building, 10 min walk to Times Square.  Very safe neighborhood.

At the time of booking, there were no reviews since it hadn't opened yet, but we decided to stay here thinking it was brand new so there shouldn't be any problems. However, our room had no hot water at all, water pressure was minimal, and I was very disappointed in how uninterested hotel staff were to help us resolve this.\n\nUpon reporting the shower situation during the first night, staff promptly came up to look at it that night, and said they will get maintenance to fix it the next day. They were fully booked so they couldn't switch us to another room. We had no choice but to take a freezing-cold shower - totally unacceptable when staying at a hotel.\n\nAfter returning from a long day touring the city the next day, we found that we still had no hot water. Staff said maintenance already looked at it, and said they'll call maintenance to investigate again, but they are offsite and unavailable until the next day. When asked about switching to another room, they once again said they were completely full and this was the last room remaining.\n\nFed up, I called the online travel agency we booked the stay through to explain the situation and see if they could help correct this. After they directly contacted the hotel to confirm the issue, staff suddenly were much more helpful and a new room of the same base tier was magically available for us. It shouldn't have taken a call to our travel agency to get our issue fixed, but I regret not calling the first night to avoid taking a freezing cold shower.\n\nAvoid this hotel if you can - they have their share of quality issues in their brand-new hotel. When lining up to check-out, I've overhead another couple complaining to the front desk about a non-functioning toilet, and they were given the same spiel about how they were fully booked.\n\nPros:\n- great convenient location; walking distance from Grand Central station.\n- they allowed us to drop off our bags early in the morning before check-in.\n\nCons:\n- as mentioned above, no hot water in first room and was very frustrating to get staff to either fix or move us to another room.\n- water pressure in shower was low (in both rooms).\n- wifi was painfully slow.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}
