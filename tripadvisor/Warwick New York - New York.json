Besides the wonderful location ( my wife was attending a conference across the street) and old style glitz, the best thing about this hotel was the staff.  From the doormen to the front desk to the bar staff to the housekeeper, everyone I encountered working at the Warwick was polished, professional and helpful.  The staff was really top notch, noticed the little things and made our stay pleasant and productive.  The room was spacious and well appointed, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was perfect.  Unlike some other reviewers, I had no issue with the speed of the elevators.  However, I did feel that the furniture in Randolph's lounge was worn and had seen better days. \nThe only drawback, which kept this hotel from being rated a 5, were some of the billing practices.  The hotel charges a \"resort\" fee that essentially supports your use of basic wifi, a fitness area, and the bottled water and coffee in your room.  That's fine, but it's best to know that since on travel websites the only thing you see is the basic room rate - which appears much less than surrounding hotels.  What is somewhat irksome is that after paying the fee, and the Manhattan prices for food and beverages, you get subjected to a $2 per bag (cash only) charge if you want to check your bags.  This included a $2 charge that the kind of arrogant baggage handler demanded for the barely filled tote bag of conference papers my wife received, draped over the handle of her carry-on bag.  Two bucks is couch change but that last little charge felt chintzy given the \"resort\" fee we'd already paid for two nights.  It's too bad because it sort of soured the rest of the great stay.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My room was large & looked onto 6th Avenue, for people watching. After a day out on my Birthday I returned to find a plate of ( delicious ) cookies & a hand written Birthday card from the Management. All staff were lovely & the service throughout, excellent. Concierge even got me front row Balcony seats for a show, later in the week.

It wasn\u2019t the obvious nominal attraction, or seeing Warwick written all over the place in that decorous Art Deco font.\nRather it is what Dennis Denuto would call \u201cthe vibe\u201d, or \u2013 if you will pardon my French \u2013 the je ne sais quoi.\n\nThere are newer hotels in Mid-Town Manhattan, like the anodyne Hilton across the road, and more famous ones, like the Plaza, around which Neil Simon sweetly, or suitely, fashioned his series of one act plays.\nBut there\u2019s just that something about The Warwick that took us there the first time, and back twice since, the latest in September for a fortnight: The chance to stay where the young Elvis stayed, and where the Beatles did their press conference in 1965.\n\nCary Grant lived there permanently for more than a decade. And of course, there is Marion Davies. In a different time of American exceptionalism, when the Manhattan skyscrapers raced each other heavenward, Randolph Hearst, literally a paper millionaire, had built all 30 storeys of the Warwick Hotel so that his paramour had somewhere to live. Davies was an exotic dancer who performed at the Ziegfield Follies just up 54th Street. When this story was related to Phil, my life-time bestie who came to stay for a couple of days, he replied in his best Berambing: \u201cShe must have been a good root!\u201d\nBlack and white photos of Davies in varying stages of dress and undress are all over the hotel. On the second floor, there are also photos, fully clothed, of the other rich and famous who have stayed there since 1926.  The photo of Elvis arriving at the building with his collar turned to the cold and damp is highly evocative; the young, handsome rock and roller from the days before Tom Parker ruined him. So, rock and roll, movie stars, brownstone architecture, The Warwick bespeaks much of New York, and America\u2019s history, the two more often than not inter-twined even before Donald Trump so egregiously did so.\n\nBeing of a certain age, something another Warwick has come to understand, The Warwick Hotel has its idiosyncrasies, not the least the plumbing. The hot water seemed to come from lower Manhattan, and via snail mail, and you had to just wait for the right moment to switch the Heath Robinson piping from the bath to the shower head so as not to be drenched before you got into the shower. And then there are the lifts, which at times can feel like they\u2019re coming from the Lower East Side and which also hark back to the days of snail mail, literally. Once upon a time, if you were Marion Davies, Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn \u2013 another name with which to conjure given Tiffany\u2019s is just along the way - and you wanted to post a letter, you dropped it down a shaft adjacent to the lift-well from where the concierge would take it to the post office. \n\nThis stay, we got the king room with a balcony, the balcony we had seen from the floor above when we stayed in the Follie Suite and where, it being the middle of winter then, the guests simply left their wine and champers outside so that it was nicely chilled. The rooms are of a spaciousness that not even well-known New York crook Donald J Trump would feel a need to exaggerate.  \nYou could host a dinner party in the Follie Suite, and our room this time had a walk-in wardrobe, coffee table, two lounge chairs, and the little table and chairs out on the balcony, from where you could sip something chilled and watch the sun set down along 54th Street. And the balcony was also big enough to string up a line for our washing after we visited the laundromat in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nYou see a different sort of Manhattan and Manhattanite in the laundromats. I was going to say in the raw, but no one took off all their clothes to be washed, just those in the jumble of bags which they had humped down to Ninth Avenue, right next to the restaurant that had been closed down BY ORDER OF THE NEW YORK HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Probably the original Hell\u2019s Kitchen.  You needed 32 quarters to make each washing machine work, and when the quarters got stuck, you got a drama queen performance from the attendant as he tried to free them with an array of kitchen utensils, mumbling away to himself about stupid old people.\n\nAnd speaking of Ninth Avenue, and the removal of clothes, a bit further down, in Chelsea, we went to Bathtub Gin, a faux speakeasy behind the nondescript coffee shop. You kind of officially needed a password to get into Bathtub Gin, but the security chap more than generously provided one. It was Burlesque Night, featuring the modern Marion Davies \u2013 Miss Poison Ivory and Miss Peekaboo Point, with whom one of us formed a very close attachment. Well, the fine print did say, don\u2019t touch the dancers, but they may touch you, and we had asked for a table close to the Bathtub in the centre of the stage.\n\nPerhaps Randolph and Marion had formed their attachment the same way.  And speaking again of Randolph, the bar bearing, as distinct from baring, his name downstairs at The Warwick, where Ermeel holds sway \u2013 is a must. Even before you take a seat in the plush leather, Ermeel has the two glasses of Californian chardonnay and Pretzels on the table. And once comfortable, you might bump into a Tony winning impresario called Murray Rosenthal who will tell you that Neil Simon\u2019s last play was sh*t, and so too, was Plaza Suite, and that he would happily read one of your plays but be prepared for it too to be called sh*t. Then follows a dissertation on how to write a good play \u2013 Exposition, Conflict, Resolution. Hitherto, I had been relying heavily on Neil Simon\u2019s three R\u2019s of playwrighting, Revision, Revision, and Revision.  Mr Rosenthal has now a play re-written using both his and Neil Simon\u2019s methodologies, and if the verdict is \u201csh*t\u201d well I am in some pretty good company.\n\nThe Warwick also has a restaurant, Murals, where the food was over-priced and way under the standard of the other restaurants along 54th and 55th Street.  Bice Cucina remains a favourite, but Il Gattopardo, which had been closed because of Covid 19 on our other visits, was easily the best of the little gaggle of dining options. We did both lunch and dinner there, and it\u2019s a mere minute walk away, past Sir Paul Macartney\u2019s house, Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s old shoe shop and where the Mr Lehman had built a mansion before his bank went bust.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing with The Warwick, it\u2019s central to everything - Central Park, Strawberry Fields, MoMA, The Museum of Natural History, Radio City, the Broadway theatres, the horse on Seventh Avenue (Simon and Garfunkel joke which got a fair airing when Phil was in town), the New York Public Library, Bryant Park \u2013 idiosyncratically adding its own vibe to theirs.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There was a dispute with the manager by email regarding how much we paid as a no show (when it wasn't our fault) but we came to a compromise and its sorted now.\n\nThe hotel is in a central location and easy to walk to 5th Avenue, Central Park and other mid town areas.  The room was clean, cool in the heat and quite comfortable.  I am a light sleeper and able to sleep ok despite the noise outside.  Shower was good too and we got enough towels.  Didn't use the restaurant but used Randolph Bar which was pretty cool with comfy sofas etc.  Drinks were ok too.  Glad we went for a room with a separate seating area -  Rooms in NYC hotels are normally quite small so good to have the extra space.  Join the loyalty program and book early enough, the prices are cheaper.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As others have said, the location is excellent with a short walk to the F train, 6th Ave. buses, Central Park, restaurants, cafes, museums (right behind MOMA), and Starbucks (but what hotel isn't near a Starbucks!). I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews as our room was beautifully appointed, spacious, clean, and quiet. The housekeeping was excellent and all the staff very friendly. Even though the hotel was busy, I did not find the elevators slow  to arrive as some have said and although they are a bit small as you might expect in a historic hotel, they move very quickly.

As we said when we checked out our stay was perfect. Firstly, the hotel is in a prime location, subway stop right on the doorstep and the E train (brings you to the air train is a 4 min walk away). The staff were a credit to the hotel, so friendly and a lovely welcome (especially the happy doorman). Our room was big with a huge king size bed and extremely clean. Housekeeping were also extremely friendly, big smiley face each morning. Randolph\u2019s bar was a lovely pit stop to finish our evenings off, drinks were pricey but what you would expect for a hotel. We had all the amenities like free wifi. They also very kindly gave us a complimentary late check out until 1pm which we were so grateful for as it meant we didn\u2019t need to rush. We read about long wait times for the elevators but didn\u2019t find this an issue at all, it\u2019s a big hotel with a lot of floors so found it normal wait times. The only tiny downside is just that it is an old hotel but if you know to expect that then the hotel will not disappoint in the slightest.

Classic NY hotel, and a landmark in its own right. The hotel has a great midtown location, easily accessible by subway or cab. \n\nHotel furnishings are all classic with an early 20th century vibe. Unfortunately, a lot of that history carries over to make the hotel feel its age. Holes from fixtures previously hung on the wall remain. Elevators can be slow, especially during busy times of the day. I don't recommend ingesting the brown hot water from the tap (see photo). The gym lacked cleaning wipes during my entire stay. One of the three treadmills was missing its safety key, making it inoperable. \n\nThe room itself was relatively quiet, with street noise (on the 6th Ave side) audible but not obtrusive. Mine was spacious (especially by NYC standards). Bed and pillows were comfortable. Aside from the brown hot water, the bathroom is typical NYC-tight. \n\nStaff do not seem particularly eager to make your stay awesome. \n\nI'll will stay here when work compels it, but it will not likely be my first choice for a midtown stay.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room (by NYC standards) was large (~350 ft2), with high ceilings, lovely marble bath, real furniture made of actual wood, a king-sized bed that was actually a king, not a queen, lovely heavy drapes.  So okay, the view out the window was an air shaft.  So what?  Who stays in their hotel room in New York?  We never had a problem waiting for an elevator.  Super convenient location.  Superbly quiet.  And for this silent film buff, a happy surprise -- photos of Marion Davies in our room (and throughout the hotel).  Turns out the hotel was built by her paramour, William Randolph Hearst, and she had a suite in one of the towers.  Pros: many; cons: none.

Every time I got an answer straight back.  Excellent customer service which made my expectations very high, but The Warwick certainly lived up to these and more! \n\nI had a query regarding concerns over having paid extra for a city view.  Other reviewers had complained that they did not receive this.  We got an amazing suite, and the view was amazing!  Our room was 1507.\n\nWhen we arrived the door man was so helpful with our bags and guided us to reception.  I totally forgot to have change for a tip and for this we apologise.  We gave him a larger tip when leaving.  Check in was quick and smooth.  Our room was spotless and one pleasant surprise after another.  While we booked a premier suite, we were not expecting it to be as amazing or as large as it was.  Yes, we could complain about no mini bar or the odd bit of chipped paint, but we didn\u2019t need a mini bar and it\u2019s a frequently used hotel room so wear and tear is to be expected!  We had a more than sufficient mini fridge.  A kettle is available upon request and each room as a coffee machine.  Some may describe the rooms as old fashioned and dated.  I would describe them, as the hotel itself, as historic and classic.  Please never modernise!\n\nOther useful things to note about the room was it had a walk-in wardrobe, iron and ironing board, a hairdryer, and several sockets.  I have seen a few reviews regarding lack of sockets. In our room we had a pull-out drawer in the desk with a multi socket with 4 or 5 sockets. \n\nWhen we headed out to explore, we could not believe how convenient the location was.  Central Park was less than 5 minutes away for example.  A lot of tourist attractions are close by as is the subway.  Taxis are also easy to get from the front door.\n\nOur room was cleaned every day.  We stayed there for seven nights.  We always left the room clean and tidy in case it couldn\u2019t be cleaned.  However, each day when we retuned it was cleaned and fresh.  This was greatly appreciated.\n\nWe did not eat in the hotel only because of the nature of our trip being so busy.  Bar a few pre booked meals out we ate on the go or got takeaway on the way back.  There are some excellent street vendors nearby and we did get breakfast from them a few times.  Excellent value for money and convenient.  We used Randolphs only once, again just because of our busy days and we do wish we had been able to use it more.  Such a lovely atmosphere and excellent service.  Maybe next time! \n\nThere is a small supermarket (Ernest Klein) a few doors away which was so convenient.  Prices were not too bad although a lot of items had no price.  Hotel guests get a 10% discount when they present a room key.\n\nOne of the historic aspects of the hotel was the number of high-profile celebrities who stayed there in the past including The Beatles and Elvis.  There are photos displayed throughout the hotel.\n\nThere is probably a lot more I could say but our trip was excellent form start to finish and The Warwick contributed greatly to this.  Even after we returned we had an issue with our credit card.  the hotel had reserved the payment but we used a different card to pay.  Although they removed the reservation it stayed on our account.  The hotel provided evidence to forward to our bank so they would rewove it.\n\nI cannot wait to visit The Warwick again!\n\nThank You!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Some of our windows did face the building and other rooms, but we hardly noticed when we had such a good view of the streets. The only minor complaint is that the room wasn't stocked with anything: there was no water available and the mini-fridge was completely empty. We didn't request anything, but I would have expected the option for free and\/or paid items like sodas, alcohol, and snacks.

We chose the hotel after comparing price and reviews of the hotels in the area we wanted to stay.  I am a compulsive planner and continue to read the reviews of the hotel prior to my stay to ensure there are no surprises when I arrive.  There was a review where someone complained about the daily service charge, which I expected because most hotels do that nowadays.  The manager responded to the review and said the hotel waives the charge if you join the loyalty program (for free).  I immediately signed up for the Journeys reward program and also saw that members receive the best rate available.  I did a mock booking and discovered a rate way better than we had originally received.  I cancelled the original reservation and did a new one through the rewards program.  All-in-all, we paid about $200 less for our 2-night reservation due to the rewards program.  \n\nWe arrived at the hotel after flying across the country on a red-eye.  Adam greeted us at the car and helped bring our luggage inside.  It was too early to check in so we left our luggage with bell services.  Adam them gave us the lay of the land and helped us know the easiest way to get to all the major landmarks.  Adam is an excellent ambassador for the hotel.  The next night he told us which pizza was the best in town (Angelo\u2019s), and he was right!  \n\nThe elevators in the hotel were tiny, but fast.  If they appear too full, just wait for the next one which would show up fast.  Ladies, watch your step into the elevator if you are wearing heals.  There is a good-sized gap between the floor and the elevator.  \n\nWe did not eat on-site, but did enjoy drinks at the bar after a long-day of sightseeing in lower Manhattan.  Diana the bartender was sweet and we had fun conversations with her and other patrons.  The drinks were great.\n\nWe stayed in a king-bed city-view room on the 20th floor.  The room was decent sized, and my biggest complaint was lack of a mirror inside the room.  The only mirror was located above the sink in the tiny, but functional bathroom.  We didn\u2019t mind the size of the bathroom as it helped prepare us for our cruise cabin.  The water pressure wasn\u2019t the greatest, but as a woman with long, thick hair, I was happy that the water quality helped easily rinse the shampoo and conditioner from my hair.  The provided toiletries were wonderful and I never needed to pull out the toiletries that I packed.  \n\nThe walls of the room were pretty thin and we could easily hear people in the hall and the adjoining room.  The doors are very loud and can be annoying if you are a light sleeper.\n\nAll-in-all, I strongly recommend this hotel.  It is good quality for the price which is much less than the other hotels in the area.  We will stay here again if we are ever come back to the area.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

We went to the front desk thinking there was a mistake but they insisted they gave us a room with a street view.  I'm attaching a pic of the floor diagram and it is obvious that two rooms, the ones ending in 10 and 14, do not have a street view.  To charge the same as the other rooms that actually do have a street view is absurd.

Other than that, there\u2019s not a lot to praise. My room was a suite and was pretty dated but clean. When traveling I make a point of arising early and doing everything I can to make sure I\u2019m tired when I retire. Even so, the nice-sized bed still reminded me that it has two foundations under it. I could feel that seam all night. The temperature controls did a good job maintaining temps in my room. The noise outside (6th floor) from construction, garbage pickup, and other city noise was significant. I would recommend that if noise bothers you at night to get a room away from 6th Ave. \n\nMy only interaction with staff was at the front desk. Check in, once to replace a room key and once to ask about getting access to the gym. Each time I had to wait several minutes (even after ringing the bell) for someone to notice there was a guest requiring assistance at the front desk. \n\nThe gym is a disappointment in just about all respects. Three treadmills, two ellipticals (the gazelle type) a stationary bike and a recumbent bike for cardio, and a limited number of dumbbells and a machine for strength. Two of the three treadmills did not work during my visit. Both cycles were also in bad need of service. I usually fill my water bottle in the gym. No luck here. No water fountain, cooler or other water source unless you fill up from the tap in the gym\u2019s bathroom. No bottles of water available to guests, either. \n\nI visit NYC with some frequency and will probably find another classic NY hotel for my next stay.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was so charmingly decorated and located within walking distance to so much It made you feel like you stepped in the time of elegance. That is where it stopped. \nAs elegant as a hotel this was, I had high expectations. First, the bathroom\u2026 it was ok but the toiletries were a mix match of brands. One brand for the hair care products, another for the soap and another for the lotion. It was like someone went to a hotel surplus store and purchased whatever was available. Minor. \nThe bathroom light were so dim. It was worthless trying to get ready in there. Oh wait! There was a lighted magnifying mirror which was also useless since it placed ABOVE my head. I am 5\u20196\u201d, lol!\nFor me, the icing on the cake, was the lack of basic conveniences such as bottled water. On our first full long day, I showered and got ready for the night. I went to get water from the mini-bar (as advertised on their website). There were no drinks and it was shut off! I called downstairs and inquired about vending machines and was told there none. I had to go to the bar to get a drink. I was exhausted and in my pajamas that was a no go! \n\nThe next day (Sunday) we had been out all day and it was snowing pretty heavy. I told my to go get a water before heading back to the hotel but he insisted he would grab some at the bar. We entered the hotel wet and cold only to see the bar is closed on Sunday, wtf! I asked the desk if they are able to find some bottled water and it was suggested I go to the Halaal Guys ( in the f*%#<g snowstorm) \nHow difficult would it be to provide water bottles for your guests! \nOn our last night, Monday, we headed back early and my husband suggested we get drinks at the bar. He said the drink menu looked good. So with our bottled water in hand, \ud83d\ude44, we ended our trip early to only find out the restaurant and bar are closed on Mondays as well. What a joke! \n******The other major issue was something bothersome. On Sunday, when it was snowing bad, I purchased a plastic Macys bag to carry my designer purse to keep from getting wet. We had bought $$$ jewelry and small souvenirs which I had placed in the bag. I had decided to wear most the jewelry but left a ring in the box. I had also put some cookies wrapped in a napkin and an empty bag. \nThe next morning, I realized the bag was gone. I did flip out about the ring and realized I had it in my purse but the jewelry boxes, receipts, small souvenirs and everything else where gone. I am 99% sure they were thrown away but it was gut wrenching to think my jewelry was so close to being thrown out.  \nYes, they did ask security to look into but it was not going to solve anything. \nAnd my white comforter had pink stains.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

What a great mid-town location! Check in was smooth. We asked to check in early (1:00) and room 510 was ready. The room was pretty spacious, very clean, and in good repair. The daily maid service was very good. Calling it a city view was a huge stretch, though. When we first got there I called and asked for towels and asked for a very dim bulb in the bathroom to be replaced. Both were done promptly. I liked the very firm bed, wifey not so much. The little coffee maker was fine. There were enough drawers and closet space to store all our stuff. It\u2019s an older property, so there weren\u2019t a lot of electrical outlets, but the desk had 3 extra plugs for our phones, etc. The light level from the lamps was low and there was no bright reading lamp. The light level in the bathroom was also low, so it was hard to put on makeup, shave, etc. The bathroom looked good, the shower worked well, and there was a nice magnifying mirror, but there weren\u2019t any shelves or storage space. Well, okay, the floor. And no night light. We found out they don\u2019t do wake up calls. I\u2019ve never stayed in any other hotel that doesn\u2019t offer that service. There was construction nearby and we could hear hammering and banging starting about 9:00 pm until about 1:00 am. Not the fault of the hotel, but if you\u2019re a light sleeper it could be bothersome. Check out was smooth and quick. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll stay here again, there are a lot of other hotels in the area. ","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Suites with no natural light and other issues.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-11-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We booked a one-bedroom suite via our UK travel agent for 6 nights at the Warwick for my 60th birthday. We had informed the hotel of the special occasion and asked for the suite to be far away from elevators and a high floor.\nWe love classic hotels\u2026we\u2019re Brits and have plenty here so I had high expectations of this 4* hotel. We have travelled extensively around the world and have stayed in many great hotels and never had any issues before.\n\nWe have tried to be fair with this review as we\u2019ve never written a negative one before but we hope this benefits both the management and prospective guests. \n\nFirstly, the good points:\n\nAn excellent location, an old classic hotel, general areas are clean, well decorated, and cared for. Desk staff and one person, in particular, were polite and courteous throughout our stay. \nDoormen, lovely and helpful. Restaurant staff, friendly and professional, thank you all.\n\nSo here is our complaint. \n\nFirstly the location: 3 doors away from the lift and on the 9th floor (request had been ignored). From stepping into our suite at 4pm we noticed how dark the room was, but we put it down to the time of day. I went to the window in the lounge and bedroom and saw to my horror that both faced a brick wall........ the reason for no light! I would have expected this on basic price room but certainly not a suite.\n\nSadly, the room also looked tired, we noticed a badly stained arm chair and marks on the sofa, the voile drapes at the window were badly hung. The bathroom soap dish was at an angle, the magnifying mirror was loose and swivelled around, the toilet actually looked dirty but we realised it was actually worn at the bottom. Cracked bathroom sink.\nWe can\u2019t remember having stayed in any hotel the past few years that still had a shower curtain but this was also stained. I must be fair and say the room was spotlessly clean, but it was totally unloved. So many little issues that built up that could have easily been fixed before arrival.\n\nWe went downstairs within 15 minutes and told the reception desk that we were very disappointed with the room and asked if we could move. Unfortunately, there were none available, so he suggested speaking to the manager the following morning. This we did but we were unable to see him as he was busy with another guest. We couldn\u2019t wait as we had a walking trip booked so asked if he could contact us.\n\nThe following morning (my actual birthday) we went to the front desk and asked to see the manager as we hadn\u2019t had any contact. A man came to the desk to see us (no introductions but we assumed the manager) and straight away he was strangely very defensive in his manner, not what we were expecting. He asked us why we had chosen to complain 2 days after arriving! We explained (politely) in detail that we had tried twice to see him. We asked if he had seen the suite and would he come and view the room. He said he had no need to as he trusted his housekeepers. We found his attitude to us quite unbelievable. He kept repeating \u201cbut this was the room you booked and this is what you have been given\u201d, we couldn\u2019t understand his reluctance to see visit our room.\nTo be honest, he was quite right as we hadn\u2019t read the small print on the room (which we later saw on the hotel website in fine print) but we certainly hadn\u2019t expected a suite with no light and all the other issues inside.\nIt was so dark that the only way of checking the weather was via the live webcams in Times Square!  Again, we were told there was nothing suitable to move us to. He said he\u2019d remove the tourist tax of $30 dollars per night from our room though our UK agent said it was within our rights to refuse to pay this as we hadn\u2019t used the facilities. \n\nTo end, we later found out on checkout that the man we spoke to hadn\u2019t been the main manager, but we have chosen not to name him here. The main reason for our 3 stars is purely down to his attitude and how he approached our issues. \nAn apology for our the room issues and maybe even a slice of cake and a card would have been a nice gesture under the circumstances. \n\nTo all prospective guests please read the small print about your room\/ suite and understand that \u201cinterior view\u201d means you are facing a brick wall with no natural light. At least then you know what to expect and will have a realistic expectation of your suite.\n\nTo the hotel management (not housekeeping), please go and check the finer details of each room regularly or random checks to see if you would be happy staying in it yourself. \n\nWe paid a lot extra for a suite for a special occasion and sadly we were left very disappointed.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":112064,"title":"A Haven In The Storm","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-09-11","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"I\u2019m writing to recap my recent experiences at the Warwick New York during the weekend of Hurricane Henri.  I had traveled from Boston to attend an outdoor concert in Central Park on a Saturday evening, and needed to find accommodations when Amtrak canceled all travel along my route home in anticipation of the arrival of the storm.  As a Warwick Journeys member I checked for availability directly with the hotel and found an interior room at a favorable rate was available to meet my need to extend my time in the city.  My Saturday stay was just around the corner at the sleek newish Shoreham and I had the option to cancel my Warwick reservation up until check in time as a Journeys member. I inquired with the Shoreham\u2019s desk agent about extending my check out and was informed that an additional two hours would be available for a charge of fifty dollars. \n\nAfter being rained out of the Saturday night concert and thoroughly soaked  I was craving some creature comforts and so I strolled around the corner and stopped by The Warwick to inquire about the availability of early check in on my Sunday evening reservation. \n\nThe experience could not have been more satisfying. The front desk manager offered an eleven a.m. check in perfect for taking shelter from the soaking rains and approaching hurricane. I was listened to attentively, and had such a positive feeling that my comfort mattered to this gentleman that I inquired about availability for upgrading to a standard terrace room. The desk manager explained that there was availability for this option if I was willing to check in later. I made the necessary arrangements and returned  to store my bag til check in. \n\nAt check in the kind gentleman I had spoken with that morning remembered me, and told the agent assisting me to give me a particular room on the 23rd floor.  It turned out to be a beautiful junior suite with a gorgeous balcony for watching the storm. \n\nThe ambiance at the Warwick is elegant and understated. I had loved the Art Deco decor during a stay back in April and this substantial upgrade in accommodation provided even more to love.   Mirrored coffee table and a comfy sofa , enormous closet space  and thoughtful touches like a small table in the suites foyer for keys, purse and phone while removing wet clothes.    The suite was a fabulous haven in the storm and represented a generous upgrade from the standard terrace room I\u2019d purchased.   \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed riding out the worst of the storm in complete comfort because The Warwick\u2019s desk manager had listened to my experience and used his discretion to provide what I needed most under difficult circumstances.  I have to wonder about some recent reviews of the Warwick NYC on this site. In my experience there are two sides to every story and interaction with hotel desk agents is no exception.  In my experience,  staff at The Warwick NYC provide service on par with the legendary luxury hotels of the world. Their service is characterized by what I consider to be a mark distinction in the industry, they listen attentively and provide guests with the sense that their comfort is important.  Perhaps it\u2019s a case of catching more flies with honey than vinegar, as my mother always said.  As a teacher and frequent traveler I know that people will always remember how you treated them. Those in the hospitality industry are no exception and I am pleased to report that simply communicating what I needed in accommodation resulted in the staff at the Warwick doing everything in their power to provide me with an exceptional stay.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

Those seeking chic, sleek, minimalist, cookie-cutter, contemporary design should look elsewhere.  The Warwick is steeped in fascinating history and has continued with the tradition of focused, warm hospitality.   It is important that anyone booking here join the Warwick Journeys Loyalty Program.  It's quick, easy and free to join online.  One of the best (of many) advantages of this program is that members receive the lowest rate option (better than AAA, AARP and pay in advance) and the daily, mandatory $33 facilities fee is waived.   This is a significant savings and unavailable if booking through 3rd party sites.  The doormen and chandelier and flower bedecked lobby  offer a warm welcome upon each entry.   The front  desk staff is cheerful and helpful.   My most recent experience offered an unexpected upgrade to a city view room.    Guest rooms are spacious with traditional, classy decor that could  rival some  rooms at the nearby grande dame  hotels, but at a fraction of the cost. The marble bathrooms are compact, but well thought out and stocked and with ample shelf space for toiletries.  Shower water pressure was excellent.  Robes and coffee makers can be delivered to rooms upon request.   Covid still creates many service challenges at hotels and guests should be aware of this.   At this time,  limited staffing means that guest rooms are serviced every 3rd day here.   The midtown location is excellent and within easy walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, theatres, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue shopping and multiple subway lines.  For a taste of past elegance at a reasonable price, The Warwick is the place to be.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

You can walk everywhere! At check-in, I was informed that due to Covid, they do not service the rooms until the third day, but if I needed anything prior to that, let them know.  I had no issues with that policy.  The room is very large(I had a double) plenty of space and the closet is HUGE.  There was a coffee maker and a mini bar(I didn't use either)  In the closet is an iron and ironing board and the blow dryer.  The bathroom was fine as well, I had 2 of each size towel which was fine for me.  I always had hot water.  Shower pressure was great and I even took a bath one night to rest my aching feet. There is a small shelf that runs above the sink to place all of your toiletries and make-up on.  I booked thru travelocity and paid in full prior but was informed there is a resort fee that would be collected at the hotel upon check-out.  There are 3 elevators, and yes we did squeeze more than 2 people in(we all wore masks). The room was soundproof.  I was right by the elevator and did not hear anything unless someone was standing right outside my door.  Slept wonderful!  I did not find the wait excessive and nothing to complain about.

It\u2019s an older hotel with an elegant touch.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The safe was locked before hand and we could not open it so had to wait for someone to come and fix it. Only had two bath towels so we had to call to get hand towels and wash clothes. When they finally brought them over a hour and a half later they only brought hand towels so had to call once again for wash clothes!! My husband had to go down to the front desk and they gave him 2 and would bring more later and they never did. We went to front desk the next day and got 4  at 2:15 pm and said they would bring more later. We had no stocked coffee station so had to call for that. Hotel, elevator and rooms are very hot and thermostat set at 64 but temperature in room is 75. Gosh, all this in the first 2 1\/2 hrs since check in. Our second room is better we only had to call for wash clothes \ud83d\ude33 Air conditioning is broken and they are going to send up a \u201cengineer\u201d we will see how long it takes.

Overall it was a good experience and I would stay here again for the price I paid.\n\nPro:  Wonderful Location near Time Square, Central Park, and subway access. Parking is available across the street (book parking package).    Hotel was friendly and clean. \n\nCons: Hot Water, 1st time we took a shower no issues with Hot water.  After that we had to wait about 15 minutes for hot water.   Also, for being a 5 star hotel they do not give you any wash clothes, no coffee for coffee pot.  It has a mini fridge in the room but it didn't work.  \n\nNeutral:  I've seen a lot of review talking about the elevator being slow.  It's a very old hotel with 3 small elevators.   We did not have any issues with it being slow, just need a little patients.  (During check out was the longest we waited)","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Close to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th Ave shops and more.  It was so easy to walk to several places.  Loved the hotel character, though don\u2019t expect new stuff everywhere.  Hotel had not fully called back all staff as of early June.  Rooms were comfortable.  Only issue was the elevators, which were extremely slow at times and we ended up actually taking the stairs down a couple times from the 11th floor.  Next time we may just request a lower floor so it\u2019s not an issue to use stairs.  We would definitely stay again though, without a doubt.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Dirty carpeted hallway. So sad to see a historical building in a good location that is kept as a 2 star hotel . The management should be fired . The hotel elevators took about 20 minutes wait , that is if you are lucky , otherwise you are asked to use the device elevators . This is NOT A FOUR STAR. At least if they down grade to a 2 or 3 star the guests would know what to expect , a four star hotel does not use the service elevators , does not have dirty stinky carpets in hallways , does not use rags that at one time used to be towels . I wrote this to at least save the next person reading this from the disappointment and inconvenience that I had to endure .

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":112064,"title":"Great location, but a few issues hold it back","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-05-03","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We just got back from a weekend in NYC with the family. We booked two rooms; a city view room and a regular room with parking. This hotel has two major advantages working for it: The location and the price. We got a great deal for a Saturday night, with the regular room coming in right around $100. I thought the hotel was in an ideal location; it's very easy walking distance from Times Square and from Central Park, and there are some high end restaurants in the area as well. It's close to the 59th Street Bridge and there's a parking garage right across the street, so if you're driving in from Long Island it's perfect. \n\nHowever, the hotel itself has some issues that keep it from being truly great. The biggest issue honestly were the elevators. There are three elevators that service the entire hotel, and they are TINY. Like, 4 people with no luggage if you're small, tiny. On Sunday morning when everyone was going to check out it was impossible to get an elevator that we could fit even 1 person on. There was another man on our floor who was waiting to get on an elevator in front of us, and he said he was waiting for 15 minutes. We ended up noticing on the fire plan that there was another set of elevators in the stairway; they may have been service elevators as they were bigger and not as \"nice\" but it didn't say they were off limits so we ended up taking them because the wait was ridiculous. \n\nAnother major design flaw was in my bathroom. As I mentioned we had 2 rooms, a regular room and a more expensive city view room. The bathroom in the regular room was fine, but the bathroom in the city view room was comically small compared to how large the room itself was. Somehow the smaller\/cheaper room had a bigger and better bathroom. The regular room had a bathtub, the city view room just had the shower. I couldn't sit on the toilet without my legs hitting the sink. And worst of all, the sink was a pedestal without room to put anything on either side, which the hotel accommodated for with a ledge that runs the length of the bathroom. That's fine, except the ledge protrudes over the sink. So if you bend down to wash your face, there's a good chance you're going to hit your head on the ledge if you aren't careful. It's baffling considering how nice the room was, and how the bathroom felt like an after thought. \n\nAnother disappointment was that the bar, Randolph's, was closed. We have stayed at the hotel before and Randolph's is quite good. I'm sure it's due to Covid, and we were told we could enjoy a drink at Murals 52 (their restaurant across the lobby) but neither the ambiance or selection were nearly as good. \n\nAnother issue that we had was with the bell service. We had about 15 bags among our party, and I asked for a cart to assist. There was one (very hard working) bellman on staff and he said that I would have to bring the bags into the hotel to load it on the cart, as they had no way to get the cart curbside. However, as I said he appeared to be the ONLY one working, which on Sunday was clearly insufficient. He was trying to help guests with their bags on check in, help guests checking out store their bags, and get luggage up to the rooms all at the same time. Hire more staff.\n\nIn general the staff was very friendly and hardworking...our waiter in Murals apologized that the bar wasn't open and he offered to make us a drink that wasn't on the menu if they had the ingredients. The lobby staff was very attentive, and asked patrons to put on masks if they took them off, and gave one to a girl who said she didn't have one. The hotel itself felt clean, but it does feel small in the lobby and hallways.\n\nOur room was a good size, and the TV had a lot of channels if you're into that. The rooms and bathrooms are very dark though, so if someone in your party needs light to get ready you may want to bring your own. The light in the hallway in our room was on a dimmer, but it flickered at it's highest setting and just wasn't bright enough otherwise so we had to leave it off. Our city view room had 2 sets of windows; one faced immediately into a building across the way, and the other also faced part of a building but also part of the street. So of the 4 windows, we were really only comfortable having one open at all times to let in light, otherwise we could see people in the other windows (and, could be seen by them). \n\nOverall, you can't beat the Warwick for it's value and location. If the bar were open it would have added another star. The elevators are a major deterrent that can lead to frustration, and the lobby and shared areas are tight. Thankfully the rooms, outside of some of the bathrooms, are spacious. We have stayed at the Warwick in the past and would again, just know what you are getting into with the wait if the hotel is crowded.","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Linen on the bed was dirty, stained and full had dirty particles on them. Water was muddy and brown and felt like it had not been run for weeks. Took pictures of these and Jahmal(God bless him), who was working at the front desk that night switched my room. \nI got a new room which was much bigger and cleaner than the other one but that had its own problems. This room had a connecting door to another guest\u2019s room and OMG the two nights we spent together with these guests were hell. I complained several times to the front desk and even to the manager about these people smoking weed in the room and nothing happened. My room felt smelled weed. Apart from that these other guests in the connecting room stayed up and partied and made so much noise till almost 5am. This I complained to front desk and manager as well. I had a 5 month old baby with me and my wife and and you can imagine what it felt like for him. Our baby only was able to sleep the last night we spent in the room by which time the other guests had already moved out. My wife called the front desk around 4am about the noise complaint on our second night and was told they would look at our bill and make adjustments which they never did after we checked out. \nI still don\u2019t understand why after all the complaints I made they didn\u2019t do anything about the smoking and noise they had to wait till they checked out to fine them 300 dollars fro smoking in the room...at least that\u2019s what i was told.

For the past couple months we have been requesting a refund as we the border is still closed and we could no longer make our trip. The hotel declined to refund us multiple times. To decline a refund during a global pandemic is incredibly shady and greedy. All the other hotels we booked for the year refunded us immediately with no issue. That's not even the worst part. I looked up reviews of the Warwick to see if others had had issues with refunds and found out THE HOTEL IS CLOSED by other reviewers! So not only were they declining our refund requests, but if we had somehow managed to get to New York we wouldn't have had a place to stay when we showed up. The hotel fully knew they were closed when we requested our refund for not being able to travel over the border, but I guess they were hoping we wouldn't notice they are actually closed so they could keep our money. We called the hotel out on the fact that they were actually going to be closed for our trip and told them we would be talking to our credit card company if they chose not to refund us. They finally refunded us. We were planning to re-book with the Warwick for all of our future trips to New York but due to their less than honest communication with us and their greed we will not be booking with them in the future. I am seriously disgusted.","travelDate":"2020-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel is extremely centrally located, it has some charm - being old - but also somewhat worn down. Most of the employees were friendly, the room was relatively clean - but again it had not been renovated for some years. I had booked the room through their own web-site. We were three, one adult and two children. According to the print-out of our booking; \"breakfast on us\" and booked for two adults and one child. We only received two vouchers for breakfast. Thus I asked politely for another voucher at the front-desk. The man at the front-desk (he said he was the manager..) declined to give us another voucher - according to him the offer was for two with breakfast. I tried to explain that when booking there was no indication that the third person would not have breakfastr and that according to the print-out we had booked for three persons  -with breakfast.  This was a minor issue - our daughter, (12 years - 30-35 kg) doesn`t eat much for breakfast - that would certainly not ruin the economy - the behaviour of this manager is a much greater threat - he was rude, unfriendly and when he at last gave us the third voucher - his non-verbal communication was extremely negative. The front desk director later apologized. Possibly the web-pages had given some information (with very small letters) that there was only breakfast for two - but there was no possibility to add breakfast for the third guest - and absolutely no need to treat a guest patronizingly and insolently.\nOur room was located towards 6th Avenue. Due to some reapir of the street, every vehicle passing by made a noise like a minor thunder-storm. I tried to ask for another room at the front-desk, but their response was that they had no responsibility for the noise.... The air-condition\/heating system sounded like an agricultural machine in desperate need of maintenance and lubrication. Four nights sleep disturbed.... \nTHis could have been a four-star hotel, but today they do not deserve more than 2 or art most 3 stars.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The suite was for 4 people (2 double beds) we had 1 bathrobe! 2 coffee cups, 2 glasses, no bottled water! this was a must as the water from the taps had a terrible taste. The coffee machine had nowhere to plug into so we had to make hot drinks on the floor next to the nearest plug socket. We had no breakfast tea, only green\/peach flavoured tea, we asked at reception, and was rudely told they don't have any. Next day we saw maintenance man, and he said they had some and promptly left 4 sachets, but these were never replenished. The AC\/heating units were noisy and had to be switched off at night. The units along with the windows let in cold air. The running joke was that they were made of swiss cheese. The so-called double glazing was non-existent and didn't do anything to stop the very early (6 am) construction work opposite and the pneumatic drill wars at 12:40 am, yes 40 minutes past midnight! When trying to request a late checkout, we were told to ask on the morning of check out, we could not do it the night before, the reception staff were not helpful, the maids and maintenance folks were very helpful and pleasant.

Desde la entrada todo es muy lindo, nosotros fuimos en Navidad y estaba muy bien decorado, nos gust\u00f3 que el lobby no es enorme, es muy acogedor, cl\u00e1sico y elegante. El restaurante del desayuno tambi\u00e9n es muy bonito y a pesar de no ser muy grande, lo m\u00e1s que tuvimos que esperar por una mesa fueron 10 minutos, el buffet era variado, ten\u00edan un tocino delicioso, el pan franc\u00e9s y los wafles no estaban tan buenos. El Randolph\u2019s Bar siempre estaba muy animado, con mucha gente, nos pareci\u00f3 que es un lugar visitado no solo por los hu\u00e9spedes del hotel, sino tambi\u00e9n por los locales.\n\nLa ubicaci\u00f3n no podr\u00eda ser mejor, a unas cuadras de Rockefeller Center, del Radio City Music Hall, del Central Park, de 5th Avenue, Times Square; se puede llegar a todos estos lugares caminando.\n\nLas habitaciones son amplias y c\u00f3modas, la decoraci\u00f3n bonita, aunque los muebles est\u00e1n un poco viejos, pero bien cuidados. Solo dos \u201cperos\u201d le pongo a este hotel. El primero es que la limpieza de las habitaciones no es su fuerte, no es que estuviera sucia, eso para m\u00ed es lo peor en un hotel, sino que la limpieza diaria no la hacen con cuidado, no pasan bien la aspiradora y hab\u00eda algo de polvo, si por ejemplo hab\u00eda alguna basura tirada en la alfombra, no la levantaban. Afortunadamente el ba\u00f1o s\u00ed estuvo muy limpio todos los d\u00edas. \n\nEl otro problema fue en la recepci\u00f3n la noche que llegamos, nuestro vuelo aterriz\u00f3 muy tarde y estuvimos dos horas en la fila de migraci\u00f3n, pues solo hab\u00eda un oficial atendiendo; acabamos llegando al hotel como a las 2:30 am.Ten\u00edamos pre pagadas dos habitaciones con vista a la calle, y solo nos dieron una de esa categor\u00eda, la otra era interior, muy obscura pues daba a una pared, le explicamos al se\u00f1or de la recepci\u00f3n que no solo ten\u00edamos reservadas, sino ya pagadas las dos habitaciones con vista a la calle, cuya tarifa es mayor, nos dijo que estaban llenos y que era lo \u00fanico que ten\u00edan. Considero que aunque llegamos muy tarde, si ya hab\u00edamos pagado por la habitaci\u00f3n, nos la deb\u00edan de haber respetado; como soluci\u00f3n nos ofreci\u00f3 que al d\u00eda siguiente nos dar\u00edan otra habitaci\u00f3n y que su personal har\u00eda el cambio de nuestras cosas despu\u00e9s de medio d\u00eda. Nosotros ten\u00edamos planes para estar fuera del hotel todo ese d\u00eda, y no quer\u00edamos que movieran  nuestras cosas sin estar presentes y sin siquiera ver cu\u00e1l habitaci\u00f3n nos iban a dar, entonces decidimos quedarnos. El cuarto estaba bien y era c\u00f3modo, pero nos hizo falta ver el cielo, no se pod\u00eda saber si estaba el d\u00eda nublado o soleado. \n\nTodo el personal fue siempre muy amable, excepto el se\u00f1or que nos recibi\u00f3 en la madrugada, seguramente no le gusta tener que trabajar a esas horas, pero nosotros ven\u00edamos muy cansados de un vuelo largo y de horas en migraci\u00f3n, hubiera sido bueno recibir un poco de cortes\u00eda de su parte.\n\nA pesar de estos inconvenientes, sin duda nos volver\u00edamos a hospedar en el Warwick.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Our room was on the 26th floor, very large with two queen beds, nice desk, closet, and the bathroom was great. The shower was awesome great for those that are tall. We were able to walk to most central places and easily took train nearby North then walked back. Parade morning at 4:30am I got a good spot out front and the teens enjoyed watching from window.

The latter is what I would base all my bookings on, and we felt it was very much out of kilter. \n\nThe pros - the location is excellent if you are visiting the main tourists spots of Manhattan or if you want easy access to the subway - no complaints there. The location is on the corner of 6th Ave and a stones throw from Central Park, Times Sq & Rockfeller. The room was well cleaned each day and the doorman was friendly. The room was spacious and bed comfortable. We didn\u2019t have breakfast or dinner so can\u2019t comment on that. \n\nThe negatives \/ not 4 star standard - the place is run down. We chose this hotel as we thought it looked like an old school New York vibe, but it\u2019s just old. The decor is v dated, the paintwork cracking and the upkeep was poor (wardrobe door handles missing and not replaced etc). The air con system is also ancient and v noisy. The elevators were painfully slow; only two out of the three where working and at times you were waiting a full 5 mins minutes for one to arrive. Generally speaking I would say the reception staff and concierge were not up to usual standards. We had aa definite feeling of disturbing them and when we had a query on our bill, reception washed their hands and sent us to the concierge. That gentleman promised help and confirmed he would be there when I returned; however he was not and did not pass over the issue to his colleague - again below the standard expected of this star and rating.\n\nOverall, fine as a base but I think your money could be well spent elsewhere as this would not be up to a usual 4.5 TripAdvisor rating, particularly when it wouldn\u2019t be considered particularly good value for money!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It\u2019s different - location and style of hotel - than we usually go for. We\u2019ve stayed at the Grand Hyatt on our previous stays but this time got a fairly ok deal at the Warwick and though why not. Location wise it\u2019s a couple of blocks from Central Park and close to radio city and magnolia bakery...there are plenty of subways so I\u2019m hoping getting around won\u2019t be too bad. In the past we\u2019ve been closer to Times Square but we\u2019re looking forward to a change in scenery. Couple of things about the hotel: it\u2019s old New York, so if you\u2019re looking for modern or contemporary this is not for you. I was a bit reluctant when I first got here but there\u2019s something quite charming about it. On checkin we had to pay additional taxes which we weren\u2019t aware of...it\u2019s around $25\/night so unless you book directly with the hotel expect to pay this...not entirely fair because we would\u2019ve been happy to book directly with the hotel had we have known this.  We booked a premier king room. It\u2019s nice, ok decor, biggish bed but the bathroom is tiny. It\u2019s a single cubicle shower and you\u2019d find two people in the bathroom together impossible. Breakfast isn\u2019t included in our rate and it\u2019s works out $40 or thereabouts per day per person. \nWe asked for a roller bed and were told it\u2019s $30 per night...by this point we\u2019d already paid out more than we expected and hadn\u2019t even seen the room yet! But the manager was great and sorted something out. \n\nI signed up to the Warwick membership and thought I\u2019d get one complimentary breakfast but this isn\u2019t the case.

The elevator was out one morning and we waited almost 15 minutes to get downstairs before deciding to walk.  But the biggest Problem is the restaurant and bar areas. The bar is about the worst hotel bar I have ever been to in my life, and everyone in our party always agrees. The Drinks are poorly made ( ie super sweet cosmo in a juice glass!).  Murals restaurant is horrible.  I got an eggs Benedict with well done eggs. Then the waiter didn\u2019t see the problem.    Seriously?

Water pressure and temperature was disappointing also.\nWhen we checked in we had to wait over 15 minutes whilst the check in person checked with the Manager about our Warwick Journey situation.  When he came back I would have to say he was unpleasant - but them I was frazzled as well after a bad experience from JFK.  He assured us that the telephone call included international calls and when we asked for clarification he said \u201c I said I would honour the international calls\u201d. This was after querying the Resort Fee - believe me this is not a resort and the the USD27 odd per day it is not worth it.  We only used internet and this added around AUF$350 to our bill for the week - What a ripoff. After some hours we get a telephone message to go back on this promise and not only NYC calls were included.  We send an email to guest relations on the 11\/8 or 12\/8 with no response as yet.  Poor service. The Assistant Desk Manager had included the Director of front office and told me to contact him.  It is his responsibility to contact a disgruntled guest and should have made contact with me not the other was around.\nThe service in Randolphs was slow and when the food came it was not as ordered, the excuse - the kitchen forgot some of the ingredients and some are not available so were replaced - the dish was taken back and the missing ingredients added - Isn\u2019t there any quality control in this establishment?\nHouse keeping comes as early at 9am so don\u2019t forget to put out the sign or you will be disturbed.\nThe bell hop took my case to the lobby down the stairs but there does not seem to be any service for case delivery or pickup.

There were no  emergency lights in the hotel, which I found unbelievable and probably illegal. People were packed in the lobby sitting in the dark on the floor and on the second floor mezzanine. The bar and restaurant, which had seats and couches were not open as staff said they could not open them because of no lighting- however the bar had at least one emergency light. Staff had glow sticks! We were told we could walk up the stairwell and there was not emergency lighting of any sort all the way up to floor 21. That to me seemed extremely dangerous. Friends went across to the Hilton which had everything open and candles around. They sat in the bar and were given free cold soft drinks and well looked after. Quite a difference. I understand that a blackout is nothing anyone would expect but the lack of emergency lighting, the climb in the dark and the ineptitude of staff during this disruption were all very unprofessional.

I read through some reviews from May and I was surprised to not see others complaining about this, so maybe it was the bad week we were there. We were there for 4 nights and one elevator (out of 3) never worked and it often seemed like only one was moving. We waited an excessive amount of time in the AM to get downstairs. We began to dread the morning elevator ride. We ended up walking in the back of the hall and discovering a second, much uglier elevator that was for the cleaning crew. We ended up having to this elevator (that wasn't even for guests) the majority of the time. This was disappointing given that 2 nights it was $500\/night! All in all, I think I would stay here again.

Many of the furniture were slightly creaky or roughed up, showing their age. Several trims and moldings were starting to crack or had paint peeling off (in less conspicuous areas, but still). The A\/C unit was a little musty and needed some maintenance, and the upholstery, the curtains, and the bed covers all looked somewhat dated (to varying degrees). Fixing these would go a long way towards looking like a classy historic hotel instead of an aging one. As is, this is hard to rate as a 4.5-star hotel.\n\nThe WiFi was not working for two out of three days of our stay. To their credit, the front desk staff was apologetic during check-in and took off two days' worth of facility fees when I asked them to upon check-out. However, the way they dealt with the matter was quite impersonal and matter-of-fact. It just felt like the hotel staff were having a rough day and were overwhelmed.\n\nThe biggest issue was with the cleaning service. The cleaning staff were exceptionally attentive. They checked in on the room several times throughout the day and always tried their utmost best to make sure it was cleaned properly. They were warm and cheerful. I don't have anything bad to say about them. However, the room I was assigned was close to the storage area where the cleaning supplies were kept, and from morning through turndown service, whenever we were in the room we were constantly bothered by noise. It was extremely disruptive when we were trying to sleep in after a long night. Again, they were not making a ruckus or anything; they were simply trying to do their job well, but they had to access the area so many times that it was impossible for us to get calm, uninterrupted rest.\n\nOh, and the mattress was a little too soft for my liking, because I have a bad back. However, they might be perfectly comfortable for most others who prefer soft beds.\n\nI am disappointed because the prices are really reasonable for a 4.5-star hotel, the location is great, and as a regular visitor to NYC, I thought I had found a great option for my future trips. I had already made another reservation at the Warwick for my next trip coming up at the end of June. These little issues really undermined what could have been a very good experience.

The room was spacious for an older hotel, quiet, and with comfortable beds.  The staff from the doormen, concierge, and front desk were all helpful.  And the lobby bar was a terrific spot for late night drinks and snacks -- although amazingly for NYC it stops serving snacks at 10:30 pm even though it stays open much later.  And the hotel price was decent for this excellent location and high quality in NYC (look for the AAA discount online).  One complaint: be forewarned that the Murals restaurant in the lobby for breakfast is the most fantastically expensive breakfast I have ever seen anywhere.  New York prices generally are not for the faint-hearted, and I'm fine with splurging once in a while.  But it cost $150 with tip for three people - two pancakes, a waffle, eggs benedict, 3 cups of coffee, 3 orange juice.  $150!  That's insane.  The coffee and juice were $48 alone.  The buffet at $34 per person is slightly less but still excessive.  I suspect they price it for foreign travelers who may not know better or care.  There are several Starbucks nearby, and a terrific diner called Cosmic on 8th Ave and 52nd St. West - just a 10 minute walk - which is excellent.  Cosmic has better food and coffee for half the cost.  Bottom line - I would stay at the Warwick again because it is clean, comfortable, and a fantastic location, but avoid Murals.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This trip was for pleasure- a girls weekend with family. We chose The Warwick because of the location ( close to the Park, theaters, shopping) and past experiences.  We\u2019ve always enjoyed the charm, and I personally like Journeys Hotels.  \nWe were hoping for rooms that shared a common hall. I\u2019ve had that room setup quit often and it works out great for a small group, but at checkin they weren\u2019t available unless we paid an additional fee, we had 3 rooms on the same floor instead. \nThe rooms are very clean, and the renovations done since my last visit were very tastefully done. We did find, however, that it may be time for another round of updating. Our iHome clock was very outdated- it had an attached charger for an iPhone 4, and the USB outlet on it was larger than it should be and did not accept our charging cords. There was one double outlet on the other side of the room, so having our phones next to our bed was not an option. Our hairdryer only blew cold air on high.  I requested a replacement twice but never got one. Also requested were face cloths. We had one face cloth each day and asked for an additional since there were two in the room, we were left a stack of hand and bath towels instead. \nThe bathroom, though small, is nicely decorated. I did struggle with getting the shower at the right temp though, but the water pressure was great. \nAlso, take note, there are no coffee makers in the rooms at The Warwick. Ordering coffee from room services is $9+. There are lots of nearby spots to get coffee to bring back, but I find it an inconvenience. Even offering it for n the lobby would be a help. \nRandolph\u2019s Bar in the lobby is alway a good spot.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We visited a couple times during our stay. Additionally, since none of our rooms were large enough for 7 to gather to chat, we used the 2nd flour reception area to hangout with a bottle of wine and some snacks. \nThe most annoying issue we found was that only 2 of the 3 elevators were operating. We often waited 5-15 minutes for one.  This has happened in past visits as well. \nThere were a few too many inconveniences for me this time.  $300\/night should provide seamless experiences. It may be time to claim a new favorite location. ","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Some of the criticism that it is an old hotel is correct, but still has charm.  Yes, the bar is too small, but really found places for six to sit, met a lot of nice people. Service was excellent and very friendly. Yes, the three hotel elevators are too small.  Was told by a supervisor from Thanksgiving to New Years, they are jammed with people in the small lobby as well as taking the elevator is a venture. The rest of the year is has a different group of travelers and time schedules.\nWe used the fire stair going down from six floors (once) and Sue's daughter\u2019s family took the service elevator many times (they said it was fast).  In the morning it was an adventure getting in, and hearing from those on the 20th floor the elevator stopped at each floor and we were lucky to get in as someone got off the floor above us. Everyone seemed to complain about it, but they laughed and we all squeezed in complained, but also seem to find it humorous and everyone got alone.  Going up was never a problem. Going down, was an adventure and fun squeezing in and meeting people.  When the morning rush was over, we actually kind of missed the extra company. \n\nThe front doorman was extremely helpful in directions, as the staff was always helpful, even working the elevator group when crowded.  The concierge gave us good advice (take the subway to the World Trade Center and how to do it).  Never saw so many Lyft and Uber SUV's and traffic was worse than San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where we are from (we thought we had it bad, but not like New York City!).\n\nI liked the breakfast.  Most in our group took buffet. I ordered the omelet, which was so large, I could not finish it, although delicious. A couple of times I brought coffee to our room and watched the news, before taking the adventure going down for breakfast.\n\nOur room was interesting, but comfortable. Bed was warm at night with comforter.  The one bathroom much too small and the shower was old school (but really very good and easy to operate, especially compared to some of the modern hotel showers).  We didn't have any problems as everything was clean and housecleaners efficient and friendly. Most modern hotels have two sinks and are large.  Having a private one where only one could use at a time had its benefits.\nI don\u2019t know if this was an average room.  It was quiet, unusual for traffic outside and we didn\u2019t hear our neighbors.\nAnd the hotel location is perfect to get around.  The history of the hotel and who has stayed there was told to us by a person who may have been an assistant manager.  One of the tricks I have about learning about hotels is to ask how long the employee has worked there. I ask bellmen, desk personnel, doormen; people I can start up a conversation. When I hear how long, as I did at the Warwicke, and the stories of famous guests throughout the years, was impressed.  They liked the place, meaning they also liked the people who stayed there.  You have a happy employee, you have a happy guest!","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I am pleased to say I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the decor is of a period, but the hotel is of a period. What counts is that it is clean and well-maintained. My room on the fourteenth floor was spacious, and the bed and furnishings comfortable.\n\nThe bathroom, though, was tiny, but I assume this is the original design, and I assume nothing can be done to alter this. There's just enough room to stand, with the required toilet, basin and shower recess. Conversations I overheard at breakfast indicated others had similarly tiny bathrooms. That aside, everything worked fine and did what it was supposed to do.\n\nBreakfast was excellent, served in the hotel's dining room. The bar is also great, with decent snacks and light meals till late at night. The service in both was efficient and helpful. Maybe the folks on the front desk could smile a little more, but the concierges were really kind and friendly.\n\nBe warned, New York is a noisy city. The Warwick is on the corner of W54th and 6th Avenue, and even with the solid windows closed, there's always some noise. This does quieten down after midnight, but I imagine this would be an issue in most hotels in Midtown.

Arrived at 11 fully expecting them to say my room wasn't ready and they'd have to store my luggage, but the nice guy at the front desk said they did have a high floor room available for me.  Not sure if hotels realize how happy ppl are when they let you check in early and don't play the \"no rooms ready til 3:00 game\"; there have to be some rooms ready earlier even if a hotel was sold out the night before as everyone doesn't check out at 12.  Anyway, that wasn't an issue here.  My room was quite large by NYC standards.  Very clean.  Big closet with shelves would be perfect for a longer stay.  TV has lots of channels including 4 or more HBO channels.  Large bathroom (noted that the counter and toilet were lower than normal but I don't think this was a handicapped room - didn't really bother me but it might someone who is tall).  I didn't hear street noises from the 29th floor.   All employees I came into contact with were nice.  Went to the bar for a drink and it was pretty busy for a hotel bar.  I would definitely stay there in the future.  They have a $25 \"resort fee\" as with most hotels in NYC, but as a tip - if you join their \"Journeys\" program and book directly through the hotel, that fee is waived.    My only complaint was that the water in the shower either took a long time to get hot enough or never got quite hot enough - same with the sink.    Minor issue that the bathroom has a fan which comes on when light is on (no separate switches) and it is kind of loud; drowns out the TV coming from the other room if you would like to hear it.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

I enjoyed my stay and it was priced better than the hilton across the street. I do have some important advice and feedback though which is why I rated this as average.  First, ensure you get a room that does not look out on a brick wall. I checked in and my room window literally looked at a brick wall that was very close to the window. I received no natural daylight in my room at all.  They moved me the next day after I complained at no extra fee.  Personally, if they can't provide a window with daylight they shouldn't have a room there.  I'm not expecting a view everywhere I stay but for the amount of money paid, I feel I deserve some natural sunlight.  The other thing I thought was odd was that as a corporate guest I was provided breakfast vouchers with dates for each day of my stay.  On the first day no one said anything and I thought they were good for the entire breakfast buffet. The next day, as I was seated, I was informed that the voucher was only good for 4 pastries, excluding bagels.  When I checked out I mentioned this and that it was not ideal that I wasn't told this on my first day and that I was now being charged for that breakfast.  They told me this was made clear on the voucher by the worrd \"continental breakfast\".  I'm sorry, but no, I didn't know that continental breakfast only means 4 pastries and nothing else in the buffet.  To assume that guests know this is not ideal and quite honestly the whole policy comes across as petty.  Otherwise, the hotel was lovely.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

When family from Ohio visited, I selected the Warwick because it was in midtown, had a good reputation, and had reasonable prices, at least for a New York hotel. The one-bedroom suite (2007\/8) was largely as advertised and illustrated in both official and traveler photos--spacious enough, comfortable, and clean. However, when I scoped out the room before my family arrived, I saw that one of the toilet paper rolls had barely half a roll and the other less than a quarter roll, with no back-up rolls anywhere. To be fair, housekeeping promptly brought up spare rolls, Later, my sister noted that the vanity mirror's light was out and that the bathtub drained very slowly. Yes, they could have alerted the front desk, but they had more important things to do in the big city. The beds were comfortable, the suite was made up properly each day, and room service was fine. The breakfast room off the lobby is generic but pleasant. The hotel really doesn't have a restaurant--it's attached to the bar, which was thronged with people every evening, making it impossible to get a table. The public area was quite small, able to seat only 8 people. The staff was friendly. If I could, I would rate this hotel as 3.75, and were it to pay greater attention to detail, it could be a 4.5. Bottom line: despite the deficiencies, I would definitely put my family up there again..","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Overall, I found the staff very helpful and pleasant. We stayed in a suite which over looked the avenue which in my opinion was definitely worth the extra money as it was a great experience. The hotel is very traditional and very clean, the hotel is rich in history with many celebrities staying here over the years, with photos around the hotel to showcase this. I used to be a regular visitor to the Waldorf Astoria, but since the closure I have been looking for a new place to stay in New York and can happily say I will now be returning to The Warwick. The location is perfect, literally minutes walking distance to Central Park, Times Sq, Rockerfeller, Empire State Building etc. \n\nI had zero issues with the lifts as per some of the other reviews, and considering I visited at a busy time during the holiday season, I can't really understand how this could be an issue - maybe people are just inpatient when it comes to waiting 1\/2 minutes for a lift during peak season in a very busy City or I was just very fortunate. \n\nThankfully I read the negative reviews regarding the $25 per night fee and was advised to sign up for the Journeys Membership (free of charge) and this automatically gets waivered. Otherwise I would've been left very disappointed! I would advise the hotel to change this policy, as it is a ridiculous charge considering the hotel is not cheap, I would expect to receive these extras for free in any other 5* and can't see the point of it in place if it is so easy to get around with out paying by joining Journeys Membership for free. It just leaves a bitter taste in customers mouths who are not aware of the Journeys Membership waiver. \n\nFinally, the reservations team (Navlat) was extremely helpful in organising my booking and was a pleasure to deal with.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Fine. Well... the price of the room doubled and there was a three night stay minimum (understandable).

The shower control valve was also loose, making temperature control somewhat difficult. The real problem was that we had no heat on the day of a terrible snowstorm. Maintenance was valiant in trying to repair it, but no luck. One of them finally brought us a space heater and we asked for extra blankets. It took several calls to the desk  before any response to our requests. Throughout the fiasco, we NEVER heard from management, were not offered an apology, a bottle of wine, a bowl of fruit or a discount on the room. We were initially told there was no room available to move us to, and we would have to wait until the next day. This turned out to be not true, according to the front desk. It seems as if no one is in charge. One other annoyance - one of three small elevators to service 30+ floors was out of order for our entire 4 night stay.

Things that are not great - firstly, we were travelling with children (not babies) and there really is no common space where we could go with them in the hotel. The lobby is tiny, the bar not really appropriate for children, the restaurant is completely unappealing and the buffet breakfast was quite simply, dreadful. I can honestly say I have never had a worse hotel buffet breakfast experience. I ordered a la carte and I was horrified as it all came directly from the buffet. Even the children were underwhelmed. Also the staff at breakfast really need a pep talk as the service was as bad as the food. Do not bother with it. One of the 3 tiny lifts was out of order for most of our stay, which meant we could wait for more than 5 minutes each time we called it up to the 18th floor. Not great. The shower went cold mid stream on a number of occasions, and the A\/C units are incredibly noisy. We really wanted to love this hotel, for its wonderful heritage and the story it tells - but it simply does not live up to it.

You are centrally located without being in the craziness of Times Square, which is too busy and stressful!\n\nBreakfast is expensive so we went to Pret-a-Manger around the corner most days and it is great. I really recommend it if you want to keep costs down.\n\nIn terms of the staff, the doormen, bellhops and housekeeping staff are extremely kind and were so nice to my father. I did not find the reception staff to be kind or helpful. When we had to move room due to an issue on the hotel's part (I won't go into the reason why, as we were compensated for the inconvenience eventually) they were unsympathetic and unapologetic.  \n\nFor those of you travelling with elderly or disabled friends of family, the premier plus accessible rooms are good but not all have roll-in showers and, even though there are grab rails, the toilets are not elevated (by contrast, the beds are too elevated).  For those of you where there is more than two people per room, be aware that the double beds are very small and you should look for a twin room with queen-size beds.  Otherwise, the hotel is wheelchair and mobility scooter friendly.\n\nI had a lovely stay in the Warwick and will definitely come back.

Everything is definitely walking distance.  Even if you need a ride, taxi is easy to get and it's fairly easy for Uber as well to get to.  \n\nThe bed was comfy, actually one of the better sleeps I've had at hotels.  Our room needed some work.  When we first got there, there were no shower curtains.  Called front desk and after 30 minutes had to call again for it.  Our room's closet also had an odd, wet smell to it.  Most likely from the humidity.  The AC unit is on its own, so it gets pretty darn loud, definitely louder than some other hotel's.  Also, for some reason the AC unit had a crazy amount of condensation and actually made the ceiling wet, cause paint to actually drip off.  It got a bit onto my clothes.  \n\nService was hit & miss.  Check-in experience wasn't as friendly as some of the other hotels, and with the AC issue, when we reported it, one of the staff almost had a \"well, what else can we do\" attitude.  It wasn't until one of the staff at the front desk was free after talking to another guest that she was asking if we would like to switch to another room.  Since it was our last night, we decided it wasn't worth the trouble.  We also witnessed a few very very public arguments when going in & out the hotel. \n\nThe gym is a bit small, but decent.

Consider it a decent splurge on your being lazy to head out to the NYC culinary universe. \n\u2014When you call for your car, Reception just plops your card on the counter without summoning the cheerful and eager bell staff. \nTip:  If you want the car ready when you\u2019re ready, call repeatedly to bug the reception staff (who are indeed busy) to call over the valet.  But don\u2019t keep the car waiting outside in NYC traffic.  Or, of course, go outside and get the valet yourself, who handles it pretty quickly. \n\nPros (huge):\n\u2014location:  Walk 5 to 20 minutes to Amazing. \nNear great food trucks, delis, various bus and subway lines, yellow cabs, MOMA, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral; 5th Avenue; reasonable as well as upscale shopping (Nintendo, NHL, diamond district; high end brands...) etc etc etc etc!!\n\u2014room:  nicely appointed and sized. \nTip:  Push the light-blocking shades behind the plastic barrier so you get more flow from the air conditioning. \n\u2014great staff. \n\u2014great valet parking service for extra charge. Some other NYC hotels have no garages or faraway lots. \nTip:  Park and forget; driving is a crazy idea in Manhattan. \n\nTip:  While not at all visible near the hotel which is in an active and apparently safe area, there are several panhandlers you will pass during the day several blocks away or on the subway.  Have a few spare dollars in a quickly accessible place to give to the ones who will probably use the money for food.  I passed one guy close to Rockefeller Center who really needed shoes and I wished I had a spare pair to give.\n\nTip:  Your room is probably nice enough to bring back food and sit and have a good view.  There are many places within a block or two to take out, including several food trucks and delis that are rated very well on TripAdvisor.  I didn\u2019t try but there\u2019s probably a few delivery places too.\n\nTip:  The higher up you are, the less you will hear city noise.

It was her first visit to the city so we had a long list of sites we wanted to see. Our flight arrived several hours before our check-in time and hotel staff graciously held our luggage for us so we could explore the city until our room was ready. SInce we were't very familiar with how to navigate the city, location was important to us.The Warwick was conveniently located close to Central Park, Times Square, Radio City Music Hall and MoMa,NBC Studios and many other points of interest as well as shopping and great restaurants. The Love sculpture was also just steps away. I am a big fan of Starbucks and there were at least three within a very short walking distance from the hotel. We loved exploring NYC and the Warwick was a great home base for our excursions. We loved that the Warwick wasn't a cookie cutter chain hotel and had a unique look and feel, along with an interesting history. The steps leading to the second floor displayed pictures of famous guests like Cary Grant, Elvis, and the Beatles. The hotel had a retro vibe but didn't seem dated to me. The room was comfortable and larger than expected. This might seem like a silly comment but I really liked the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" light switches.The staff were friendly and helpful. Previous reviews I read before booking the hotel mentioned being frustrated with the resort fee but since I joined the Journeys program and had it waived with no questions asked. Other reviewers also mentioned the small elevators. They are indeed small but the only time this proved to be inconvenient was during one particularly busy morning when we were in a hurry to leave. The only negative comment I really have is that there was a minibar instead of a mini-fridge. It would have been nice to been able to have had space just to store our own snacks and drinks. Before booking this hotel I read a ton of reviews before making my finally deciding on The Warwick.Since there are so many options in NYC, I was unsure if I had made the right choice but after a great visit, I can say with confidence If we ever return to NYC, we will definitely return to the Warwick!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Warwick was easily the best of the three. \n\nFor one the location is perfect. A couple blocks from Central park, Rockefeller center and fifth avenue. Out of the way but still less than 15 minutes away from Times Square and Broadway area. And Subway stop options all around it. Easily my favorite area to stay in New York when I want to do all the touristy things. Also close to Halal guys the best street food in the city (and the only one you will see a long line at for a reason). \n\nThe room was spacious. I couldn't believe how big it was and it was just a standard room with a handicap accessible shower. It was updated and modern so there were plenty of USB ports, power, labeled light buttons, etc. It was also super quiet even though we were only on the fourth floor. Closing the shades at night seemed to really help the street traffic and the inside building is very insulated so we never heard anyone outside our door. The floors are small so that helps a lot with foot traffic as each floor only has a handful of rooms. The wheelchair accessiblity from shower chairs to wider doors to easy access in and out of the hotel was great. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.\n\nThe people here were also the best of the three hotels we stayed at. Out of their way friendly and helpful. The main entrance has a couple steps down, my daughter is in a wheelchair so the doorman walked us to the side entrance right around the way and showed us how to get thru. We checked out and needed to store our bags and they stored them at no charge for the day (the Hilton across the street charged $5 per bag). \n\nThere are only two negatives about our stay here. The elevators are way too small. We couldn't fit four of us and our two bags and our daughters wheelchair. So theres frequently a wait for elevators. We discovered there are three elevators in the stairwell that are much bigger and less crowded so used those most the time (they are generally in use by staff but there was no notice that said for staff only so we assumed there were fair game and anytime we ran into staff they were very friendly). The other is the restaurant\/bar attached to the hotel is extremely over priced for plain food. There are phenomenal restaurants each direction you go within a couple minute walk, dont spend the high prices to eat basic food here.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Auch den Times Square kann man von dort aus gut zu Fu\u00df erreichen.\n\nBei Buchung der g\u00fcnstigsten Zimmerkategorie bekommt man ein Zimmer zum Innenhof. Da das Hotel \u00fcber 30 Stockwerke verf\u00fcgt, kommt daher in den innen liegenden Zimmern kaum Tageslicht hinein. Sie sind dunkel und um nach dem Wetter zu sehen, muss der Wetterbericht im TV eingeschaltet werden.

Man bat uns jedoch gegen einen Aufpreis von ca. 50 $ pro Nacht ein Zimmer mit hellem Ausblick an. Dieses durften wir uns vor der Buchung anschauen. Als wir das Zimmer besuchten, befand sich darin allerdings noch eine Person - das ist ein absolutes No-Go!! Zudem sind 50 $ pro Nacht nur f\u00fcr Tageslicht ein wirklich stolzer Preis.\n\nUnser Zimmer war ger\u00e4umig und gut ausgestattet. Das Badezimmer war leider etwas klein und sah abgenutzt aus.

You cannot beat the location. Were upgraded to a suite (without asking) on the 12th floor and we had more space than we could use! Large sitting area, comfy bed, spacious closet and good size bathroom with wonderful bath products. Enjoyed the extra mini fridge to store anything we purchased and the lighting system in the rooms was clever. Only downside was being on the 12th floor, our views were brick walls and we were unable to assess the weather for the day - not a huge deal!

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":112064,"title":"Avoid","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-05-27","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"The short version: what a farce of a hotel that cannot deliver a basic standard of room. Aged, smelly, occasionally cramped, indifferent staff. Location great, however. Will never return. \n\nThe long version: stayed at the Warwick hotel in two parts over two weeks having booked on hotels.com: the first a 7 night stay from Friday to Friday and the second a 5 night stay from Sunday to Friday. Both stays I had booked a Premier (King bed with courtyard view) room. \n\nOn the first stay, I arrived around 10.15pm. The receptionist seemed rather surly. I was given room 923. On entry to the room, there was a distinct mould \/ wet smell. I called reception saying I wanted to move and was told that there were no other King rooms available and that I would have to go to a room with two single beds. This was unacceptable for a 7 night stay and so was told I could then be moved the following morning. I waited in the room and someone arrived with replacement keys for room 1623 which was in fact a king room. He asked if I had used anything in the room to which I responded \u201cno\u201d, probably so some other sucker could move straight in. He did, however, agree there was a mouldy smell. \n\nRoom 1623 had the same layout as 923 overlooking the inner courtyard of the building. The room was large. It was, however, all a bit shabby and dated: many marks on the skirting boards, chipped paint, no easily accessible power sockets next to the bed and the room seemed to be sloping as the drawers on one of the bedside tables constantly opened despite me closing them a number of times (I gave up in the end). \n\nOn the first stay, WiFi was down for one whole day and despite complaining staff were indifferent. \n\nThe bathroom of 1623 was reasonable with Gilchrist & Soames toiletries provided. I really liked the exfoliating soap. \n\nOn my second stay, I was initially given room 1903. The bathroom was tiny such that I could barely sit down on the toilet as my knees were wedged between the sink and the hard shower door. Also the shelf above the sink meant that the tap could not be turned on the whole way. I complained and was then given room 1223, which like my first visit and room 923, smelt mouldy. There must be something wrong with the air conditioning in that part of the building but despite mentioning this to the manager, he had not heard of any complaints (despite the member of staff agreeing on the mouldy smell last time). On going back to reception, the receptionist seemed at a loss and noted \u201cbut you booked via Expedia (the parent of hotels.com), what do you want me to do\u201d? I retorted that I just want a room that doesn\u2019t smell and that I can use the toilet. \n\nThe manager then came to reception and agreed to show me two rooms. I was happy with the first he showed me, 3002. This had a large layout and a relatively small bathroom but there was a bath meaning it was different to 1903. On going to sleep, the aircon became ridiculously noisy and even after putting in earplugs I could still hear it. I complained in the morning and asked someone to fix it but as I was back late that day, I spent one more night in that room. \n\nIn the morning I then spoke to another manager who acknowledged that my experience had been not up to scratch. He then agreed to hold a room until I got back from work that day. On arrival back at the hotel in the evening, I moved into room 1020, which was the biggest room I had had so far, didn\u2019t smell, could sit on the loo and whilst the air conditioning certainly wasn\u2019t quiet, it was less noisy than 3002. It had a Sixth Avenue view. \n\nCleanliness could be greatly improved. Room 3002 had a thick layer of dust on the bathroom shelf. The duvet had dirty marks on it etc. \n\nOverall, very disappointed with my experience here. There\u2019s a great disparity between the rooms, they seem poorly maintained, shabby, dirty and staff seem to assign poor rooms to third party bookings. I would never stay here again. My opinion: avoid completely. ","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

This is such an occasion.\n\nIt concerns a \"mandatory\" fee of $25 per night that the hotel imposes as a \"Facilities Fee\" that is essentially hidden. It was mentioned in my booking.com e-mail I received after I had booked, so I should explain further.\n\nIf you see the initial  listing for this hotel through booking.com it says, with an accompanying icon, \"free wifi\".  'Free' means you do not pay, it my opinion.  Additionally, when I checked in, I received a paper which says \"local, 800 and long distances calls are complimentary\"  Complimentary, in my opinion, means you do not pay for them.\n\nBut the the wifi are local calls are precisely the reasons the hotel says these services are \"free\" or \"complementary\" because they are under the \"Facilities Fee\".  In other words, it tells you up front that certain services are \"free\" and then charges for them on check-out.\n\nHere's the real clincher: when I checked out, I noticed first this \"facility fee\" and then noticed charges for 5 local calls I made, at 1.40 each.  Despite there being 5 calls and each one taking two lines on a one-page bill (it appears as \"Telephone Local\" and \"line\" on two separate lines) the check-out person who had scanned the bill somehow claimed she did not notice those ten lines related to charges that were covered by the \"Facility Fee\". They were removed when I objected to them.\n\nIt's not the charge of $25 a day per se that bothers me.  It's the way it is imposed that does.  \"Free\" and \"Complimentary\" actually mean $25 per night.\n\nNeedless to say I think booking.com should remove the \"Free wifi\" icon on the site and the Warwick needs to be much more transparent in its letter it hands out to its guests.\n\nI will never stay at any Warwick hotel again.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Upon check in, I was a surprised to see that this was a 4 star hotel due to the carpet and chair stains, as well as stains on the bathroom shower curtain. Since we had dinner and show reservations, we didn't stay in the room very long. When we returned back to the room to go to sleep, we pulled the covers off the bed and red stains all over the sheets. I don't know what they were but I can only assume it was blood based on the color. I called the front desk and was advised they could not move us to another room but would send someone up to change the sheets. I told the front desk I was not going to sleep in that bed after I saw what was on the sheets. We immediately checked out and asked for a refund.

However we had multiple issues with the room and the service. First off our AC was nearly impossible to regulate and as a result the room was either too hot or too cold, these rooms are not large and this exasperated the problem even more, there were also quite loud background noises in our room, they sounded like fans or something(the ac was switched off at this stage).The alarm clocks had obviously been set by someone else and went off at 7 am on 2 mornings of our stay.......very annoying!!The shower head fell off and hit me in the mouth while i was showering on the second day, it took 3 reports before the issue was addressed!! the people at the front desk were not only inconsiderate but i would rate them as being passive aggressive, I was not at all impressed with their demeanor.We had to double check the bill also as we were being charged an extra night......a slight smile from the girl at the desk \"Oh sorry about that sir\", I got the impression she couldn't care less whether we spotted the fault or not.The other gripe was the lifts............they take an age...........when they are working! We resulted in taking the service lifts instead as they were quicker and are right behind the main lifts.In short I would not bother with this hotel again, it was decidedly average.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The halls also looked tired.  One of the three small passenger elevators was broken throughout our stay.  We ended up taking the service elevator twice. Also, I like to have a grab bar in the tub.  The Warwick's bathrooms are small, lovely and marble but there is  nothing to hold as one enters or exits the tub.  We find that most hotels have a grab bar as a universal accommodation - not just in rooms designed for disabled guests. There was no mat or feature on the floor of the tub to prevent falls. \nAgain, it remains my favorite hotel in New York.

I suspect a lot of business travelers found themselves trapped in NYC that week, and they remember their hotel home either fondly or with some degree of resentment. My experience -- despite the enormous sadness of the experience -- was very positive as the hotel and their skeleton staff did everything humanly possible to make their reluctant guests as comfortable and safe as possible. I've had a soft spot in my heart for this grand old hotel ever since. My latest trip was just another example of how well the Warwick operates. It has a wonderful location -- a nearby drugstore, Starbucks, several wonderful restaurants both formal and casual, and spacious, old-fashioned rooms that seem like great values in today's hotel world. I am almost sorry to suggest it to others as this may well put me in a position competitive with other potential guests, but I think the hotel deserves to be better known to business travelers.

The bathroom was smallish but we had plenty of room to tuck away our things. \n\nWe did not have much need for specific staff attention but when asked everyone was responsive.\n\nThe room rate included buffet breakfast in the \"Murals\" room downstairs and I would say the breakfast was somewhat better than average for a hotel. Waiters were attentive and for the occasional drink the bar was inviting. \n\nWe had not complaints with the staff and I noticed concerns about the \"facilities fee.\" Regarding the latter I just suggest reading the fine print and make sure you compare apples to apples with other hotels. \n\nBecause of the competitive rates compared to other hotels in the area, the nice room\/suite, and the breakfast we will probably return to this hotel next year. \n\nHint: If you are thinking about staying here, join the loyalty club. In January they offered a promotion on gift cards that saved us 20% - maybe they will do that again!!!","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The extra charge is not explained at check-in. Disgraceful behaviour from a hotel previously renown for good service.\nThe horrible room I stayed in and many other rooms at the Warwick are built around a quad which is covered over by a mesh which blocks the light. The result is that the room is in permanent darkness as if it is constantly night time - even when the sun is shining. An unpleasant experience to come back to on a sunny day.\n\nThe location in mid-Manhattan is good; but there are a lot of better hotels in the same area. The Warwick has lost the plot in terms of customer service. The overall impression is that customers are a source of income and generally a nuisance. Obviously poorly leadership resulting in  poorly trained staff and very low motivation to be friendly or helpful.

Stepping back in time to the suites of Old Hollywood or choices of more modern times, our suite balcony offers a stunning view of the city and breakfast for two in romantic intimacy. I wrote about our stay in this magical city at the Warwick in my book My Gift of Now which is available on Amazon. The attention given to us by Joel with the intention of making each of our stays memorable is consistent in grace, warmth and detail. This indeed feels like our second home while in NYC. The suites that have been renovated are much improved. The feel of Old World charm where the actor Cary Grant once lived in the hotel is mesmerizing. Even the hall phones on each floor are part of the charm of another era. The location to Central Park, Broadway, Fifth Avenue, restaurants and more is all within walking distance. The Warwick will continue to be our home while in the one and only NYC.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was surprising to me because they really seem to care. I have had so much bad news in the past five weeks that this was such a blessing the suite I v have is amazing I have a Jacuzzi tub and a sauna. The reason why this is important is I actually had a stroke and it\u2019s helping with me walking and getting around. I have been asking the doctors if they could prescribe me this kind of therapy for the past couple weeks. Now I\u2019m in New York in a suite that is actually helping me recover giving me enough room for my Caregivers. The manager was quick to actually assist me in getting something that made me very comfortable. The reason why I would give this hotel a ten star is because most hotels don\u2019t care. How many times do you hear sorry Sir cant help you. For us with cancer. This kind of caring is crucial. All I am told is where the next needle is.

It does suffer from a lack of in- house dining options for a hotel its size, and although the food in the bar, its only evening option,  is quite good, it is hardly the place to feed families with children.  On the long weekend we were recently there, we found it to be sadly understaffed both in wait staff and bar staff, but they did their best on a Holiday weekend but it was tough.  Such a situation makes hard working, friendly employees look bad when they are stretched too thin.   One personal plus for us - the hotel has not given in to the idea that guests would rather make espresso in their rooms than a traditional cup of coffee, so it was good to see actual coffee makers.  Room service can be slow at times, but the food was always warm and tasty.

This was a Christmas to New Year's visit. I actually left on the 29th of December so not really a New Year's trip.\n\nThis hotel looks like something out of a '30's to '50's classic Christmas movie. I am not kidding about that. The decorations, outfits, and style of the hotel looks like a grande example of old New York. Do not let this lead you astray because the hotel has all of the amenities of a modern hotel. The WiFi is complementary for guests. \n\nThe elevators are ornate and wood paneled. The interesting thing is that they are only about 5 feet wide and 2 1\/2 feet deep. This was a shocker to me. It is still cute. There are three elevators which can take some time to get up and down, but with the ornate beauty of the hotel, I was willing to accept that. \n\nLet's get started with the room service. It was fast, tasty, hot, and had a variety. I am not talking a full restaurant menu, but there was enough to satiate the palate. Especially about 11:30 PM when you came in from the cold while walking around sightseeing. Be warned though, they are not messing around when it comes to coffee. They serve is very strong. \n\nThe room was a little warm when we first got there, but the individual thermostats allowed us to change that. \n\nThe rooms come with an ironing board, iron, hair dryer, safe, plenty of hangers in a large closet, and a desk with a power strip on it. I know it seems trivial to add that last one, but there are enough outlets to handle two phones, a computer, coffee maker (you need to ask for that but it is complimentary), and a tablet.\n\nThe bed was comfortable, and the blankets were warm enough. The only problem I have with ALL hotels is the pillow choice. All of these hotels think the extra soft feather pillows are great. Nope. I had to fold them several times to keep my head off of the bed. That is a small complaint that can be adjusted. \n\nLet's talk about the proximity. It is about a 5 minute walk to Rockefeller Center. A definite Christmas time treat. It is a 10 minute walk to Broadway. There are three Starbucks (Not sure if you are into that) within 5 minutes. There are restaurants along 54th that are worth going to. I never thought that I would have such a time. It was a wonderful Christmas time visit. I am going to want to go there again. \n\nThe doormen where helpful and immediate in any requests. Please remember to show your appreciation with what they do.\n\nA problem, maybe because it was Christmas time was the traffic. Getting there in a taxi was difficult, but a $40 ride from LaGuardia is not something to get worried about.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It has some issues that is to be expected from a hotel like this, but it doesn't detract from the experience of staying here all that much.  There was one annoyance that stopped it from getting a 5 star review.\n\nLocation:  It is in a great location, couple of blocks away from central park, a block away from the subway and good eats all around. It really is in a wonderful location.\n\nLobby: The lobby is wonderful, it is small but it feels regal...marble and plenty of chairs and a sofa so you can just sit back and people watch. Just mind your steps if your shoes are wet. \n\nThe elevator: Yes it is small, but that is the charm of the hotel :) However, it seems like forever and a day passes before the elevator arrives to pick you up and when the door opens there is a chance that it will already be full and you have to wait more.  Some folks actually took the stairs down because they got tired of waiting. Once in the elevator, it really is pretty fast and you will get down in a few seconds. \n\nThe room (where my annoyance lie): So my room had a foyer that lead into the room itself. The view is of a brick wall. The bed was a king and there was a chair as well. The bathroom was great...plenty of shelf space.  I wish the bathtub had an anti-slip matt to go with it..sometimes I felt like I was taking a chance showering.  The biggest problem was that the room was so hot! it was like 80 degrees (for me that is hot) I turned down the heat and put it on cool but it took 24 hrs to cool down some what.   Also there isn't a coffee maker in the room, so you have to request one. I requested one via telephone from the room, the gentleman said that he will  have it brought up...never received it. Also, the room has some basic wear and tear..but if you go hunting for imperfections then you will find them where ever you go in hotels. \n\nThe staff were good for the most part, doormen where really helpful with hailing a cab, the front desk made the experience enjoyable. \n\nI would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We have stayed at the Warwick on two occasions, both at Christmas time, most memorable was over the Millennium Christmas and New Year\u2019s period. Always found the Warwick to be a fabulous experience for location, rooms, service, decor, wonderful history, the Murals Restaurant and Randolph\u2019s Bar. \n\nWe visit Manhattan regularly at Christmas and, whichever hotel we are staying in, always visit Randolph\u2019s for lunch and drinks at least once, the last time before this year being 2015 when we had the corner table looking out over the 54th\/6th Avenue junction. Perfect spot and a perfect lunch and I personally would say the best dry martini in the city.\n\nI feel quite sad about writing this review but here goes . . . we called in to Randolph\u2019s for lunch 27th December 2017 - it was busy as usual but we hovered near the bar trying to catch the eye of one of the waiting staff to ask about getting a table for four. We\u2019ve done this before and always been told when we might expect one to be available, take a seat at the bar or call back etc. Not this time, gruffly told that it\u2019s a \u2018free for all\u2019 - when one becomes vacant, help yourself. So we hung around, as did other hopeful diners, grimly viewing each other through narrowed eyes, trying to gauge each others likely speed when we all sprinted for the first available table. We viewed the room with growing unease - although the barman was a nice, efficient guy there was an irritable spat going on between him and one of the waiting staff: she had requested a Bloody Mary for a table but was told the bar was out of tomato juice which kicked off the confrontation. I should add here that the woman in question had the looks, manner and personality of a paving slab, I cannot imagine a more inappropriate job for her than waiting table. I could see people at tables frustrated by delays and other tables overflowing with stuff that should have been cleared away. Fortunately for us, a lady in a group near the door tipped off my wife that they were about to leave so we encircled their table as they were getting their coats on and sat down trying not to look too triumphal to the other disappointed would-be diners still standing. Obviously the table at which we were seated had considerable debris from the previous occupants so we waited for it to be cleared away . . . and waited . . . and waited. At least 15 minutes passed before a guy who collects the glasses for the room came over and started to clear it. We asked him if he could get us drinks while we were waiting so he went to the bar with our drinks order. The other waitress for the room then came over and put our drinks on the table and she did apologize for the delay before turning to walk away - I quickly said \u201cCould we order some food please\u201d before she got out of earshot and she replied \u201cOh, you want to eat? I\u2019ll bring some menus over\u201d!!\n\nThis is where my review improves. We had another round of drinks before the food arrived - we had all ordered a Club Sandwich as they have always been a good choice (although for some reason we were told we could no longer get a side-order of fries with these!). I know it\u2019s not fine dining but this time the sandwiches were perfection, better than any we\u2019d had at Randolph\u2019s in the past. Our thanks go the chef - we did leave a tip (because of the quality of the food not the service) and I hope he gets a share of all tips. \n\nThat\u2019s it, overall a disappointing and unexpected experience to end our Christmas trip to NY as we were leaving for the airport directly after. Will we visit Randolph\u2019s next time? Certainly will, reminiscing about our past experiences there, we had already been talking about staying at the hotel again next year. This just had to be an aberration, a bad day at Randolph\u2019s, and hopefully this shambles will not be repeated.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were shattered on our first day and ended up going for a wonder to Colombus Circle where we found an array of places to eat and shop.\n\nI can't comment on the hotel good as we opted not to go for the hotel breakfast - from what we saw most days this was the right choice. It was fairly expensive for what I considered a to be a pretty basic breakfast - most days we ended up in Pret a Manger on 6th Ave and 55th street (literally a 2 minute walk), the lovely deli on 6th Ave just past the LOVE Sculpture, Sarabeths on Central Park South or even Whole Foods in Columbus Circle for a quick and wholesome breakfast. This is NYC so of course there was never a shortage of places so I'd recommend doing your own thing daily for breakfast if you want something quick and easy... and the same goes for lunch and dinner!\n\nThe hotel reception staff were friendly but somewhat curt  (some moreso than others) - we never really asked for tips and advice to get around as we usually like to explore places for ourselves, but I often felt they were a little on the formal side and could have done with being a little more smiley and approachable.\n\nThe room itself was beyond outstanding. It was huge (if you've stayed in NYC before, you'll know finding a decent sized, let alone huge, hotel room is an achievement in itself!) with a massive bed, good sized bathroom, lots of floor space and a huge amount of storage space for clothing and suitcases.

Alcune camere arredate molto bene,altre un po troppo buie ed illuminazione alquanto tetra.\nOttimo il lounge bar Randolph's situato all'interno della struttura(anche se non \u00e8 parte dell'albergo). Eccessivamente costosa la colazione(con quelle cifre si mangia bene a cena a Manhattan).Voto basso per le pulizie(per carit\u00e0,non era una bettola ma da un 5 stelle ci si aspetta di pi\u00f9....pulizie fatte male ed in maniera svogliata dalle cameriere).Il bagno il primo giorno aveva un odore sgradevole.\nAltro piccolo dettaglio che per un 5 stelle non va bene: in camere doppie mettere a disposizione dei clienti soltanto un paio di ciabattine non \u00e8 da 5 stelle,e non \u00e8 stato un caso nella nostra camera perch\u00e9 anche in quella di amici presenti con noi \u00e8 successa la stessa cosa.\nEsperienza comunque sia positiva , albergo consigliato ma che per essere un 5 stelle al 101% secondo me dovrebbe limare certe piccole mancanze.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not only is this hotel in the best location for major attractions, the room and the service made the experience incredible. \n\nFrom staff answering phones and dealing with requests I felt as thought nothing was too much trouble for them. The breakfast buffet was worth every cent and the staff were quick, efficient and friendly. \n\nI cannot recommend this hotel more and will definitely return.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Front desk goes out of their way to help, much more personable than the big box places. Room size is larger than hotels at higher rates around that area.  Reasonable prices and attentive staff. Some question the size of the elevators, but across the street the elevator are bigger but you spend your time waiting for them\u2014not so at the Warwick. Good facilities on second floor for small or large meeting. Have held shareholders meetings there several times. Best choice in Midtown.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have dreamed of watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in person and the Warwick helped make that dream come true! \nOf course, we booked the hotel almost a year in advance through a travel agent who made sure that we received a parade route view room. We got a room on the 6th floor and it was perfect! When we arrived there was a hot thermos and a blanket on our bed to use for the parade. The morning of the parade they had a stand in the lobby with coffee, hot chocolate (the best we had all week) and some pastries for purchase.\nFor Thanksgiving Dinner we made a reservation at their buffet. The food was great, my only disappointment was that there was not any pumpkin pie.\nThe rooms are a little small but it's a boutique, 1920's hotel so what do you expect? We love historical, boutique hotels so it was perfect for us! We want to come back without the kids soon and will definitely be staying at the Warwick again. Thanks Warwick for making a magical week for our family!","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}
