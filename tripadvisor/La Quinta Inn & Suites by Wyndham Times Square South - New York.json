The hotel is very clean and modern, yet affordable for this part of Manhattan. Perfect location. A few minutes' walk from Penn Station and Times Square. The bed is very comfortable. The heating\/aircon is efficient. The room sizes are as advertised. No very one-sided contracts to sign upon checking in. No hidden charges on check out. Breakfast is good and varied enough. The lobby is welcoming.\n\nHowever, what makes this hotel truly unique is the staff. They are all very friendly, professional and helpful. I was travelling with my toddler and heavy luggage and everyone volunteered to help all the time, anticipating our needs. Everyone was super lovely, the type of lovely one would expect in a small underpopulated village in the countryside where people are just happy to meet other souls. So it's the best of both worlds. You get the proper NY and small community vibe. \n\nSpecial thanks to Cynthia and Michael. I didn't memorise the others' names, but I thank everyone. \n\nI would go back without hesitation and I highly recommend it.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hotel was in a great location and easy walk to Bryant Park, Macy's, Central Park and WTC among other spots. Special note for neurodivergent or otherwise sensitive people - this part of the city smells real bad, the noise levels are inescapable, the crush of people is worse than a mosh pit, and the traffic ... just plan on walking everywhere. \n\nDid find the staff at the hotel to be exceptional - Diana at Front Desk and Maria in Housekeeping - are true gems that went out of their way to make our stay memorable. Thank you to you both!. \n\nThe hotel itself - rooms are about the size of a college dorm room - tight quarters for two adults with two carry ons - but the king bed was comfortable. Sound proofing is not great so if you are doing the nasty, everyone will hear you for a couple of floors at least. \n\nBathroom is tight, though rain shower was a nice surprise - just be careful turning it on as there is no room in the shower to avoid the cold initial spray. Breakfast was decent - not a fan of hotel eggs and this hotel continued that trend - though really nice selection of breakfast pastries, waffles, yoghurt and fruit. Coffee was consistently better than any of the overpriced cafe's we tried. \n\nWould stay here again and highly recommend. ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We checked in at the time we were supposed to do. It really helped having complementary coffee and tea ready to serve yourself as you walk into the location. Sometimes you want to drink either after eating dessert in the city. The room and bathroom were completely clean and cozy. The room had everything they advertised it had. You got what you were promised to get. From a king sized bed with two nightstands with wall power outlets to a closet where you can hang your clothes and iron them with the appliance they offer you to go it with. You could manage your A\/C temperature as you wanted to. What I loved about the bathroom is the two types of shower knobs and heads the shower had. That was amazing. Moving on to breakfast, it was the typical American breakfast you find at many hotels with complementary breakfast. Breakfast is in the basement level. I was highly satisfied. But what I loved the most was the ability they gave us to make our own waffles. I love waffles. So I indulged in one in one of the days I ate there. The day we checked out at 11:00A.M., the Front Desk workers put our luggage away in a storage until we came back to retrieve them. This is a complementary service. The Front Desk agents were also very professional and amicable at the same time.  I cannot be any more satisfied with the service we received. Thank You Very Much for everything Guys and Gals!

We wanted to visit the city for so long as it is one of our must see cities. As we were searching for hotels specifically near to times square that fits our budget, we came a across at La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Times Square South and their location was just right near times square 38th street 333 w. The price was reasonable and it had a free breakfast. So we booked for 6nights. When we arrive from jfk airport, we booked an uber going to our hotel. As soon as we arrive we were greeted with a friendly face, and we forgot his name but we nicked named him \u201cMithun\u201d because he looked liked our ex-boss.. kidding aside. He explained all the needed info and very helpful. He was fast but very efficient, pleasant and easy check in. As soon as we went up and freshen up, the first thing we noticed is that the room was very clean and well kept. The bed was super comfy and the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. The bath and toilet amenities were super clean and no foul smell at all. The staff were truly amazing. The inn had a 24-Hour Reception Desk which is super convenient. They serve their breakfast early 6am and 7am on weekends. Vanessa prepared the breakfast buffet and never allowed the choices to be empty for the next people to eat it had lots of choices and seating. Vanessa was very friendly and helps us a lot in anything we needed and we very much enjoyed her efficiency. The Laquinta staff whoever on the shift of any time of the day and night, if you asked for some fresh towels or replenish your shampoo\/conditioner\/bathgel\/soap\/lotion\/trash bag - they wont hesitate to give it to you. In short they provided us whatever we requested. On our last day we asked the Alexis the front desk if we are able to do a late check as we got a message that our flight got delayed and she gladly gave us an hour of extension which was sufficient by the time we needed to travel to the airport which was an hour drive if it had a medium flow of traffic. We had a wonderful experience at the La quinta. Every staff member we encountered, from the the check- in to the cleaning staff were delightful and eager to help! Thank you! Will recommend to our colleagues!","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The first six nights were okay. Room size considered roomy given NY standard and compared to the Fairfield Inn and Suites Times Square nearby. The breakfast area is super small and cramped serving the same items everyday. Housekeeping provided every three days with one day advanced notice. The free water and coffee stand is good. The lobby area is super small. Service is a hit and miss. Don\u2019t know why so many people commented of the good service. Not ours. The several front desk staff were either inexperienced, cold, nervous, or rude. We were a party of four and when we checked in, we asked if there were four towels in the room. We were told of course, and guess why, only three sets were found. On our last night here, there was no hot water. We called the front desk and were told someone would check and would give us a call back for an update. We got one call but the promised second call did not come. When we checked out on our last day, we asked if the hotel could get us a taxi, I was told that would cost $95 if the taxi is needed after 1 pm as it is considered rush hour. NYC has a fixed taxi rate of $58 plus toll if the ride is between JFK and Manhattan, with a rush hour surcharge after 4 pm. I was shocked at how the hotel marked up a taxi call. So, the one night that I was charged $350 my family had cold shower and I hailed my own taxi on the street.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Needless to say my husband and I were a bit apprehensive but I do a lot of research before booking a hotel and this time was no different, The hotel is an a great location close to the Port Authority subway station and from there you can go just about anywhere you want in NY. \nOur room was clean, but be aware you MUST request for your room to be serviced if you want your bed made etc. We were only there for two nights so this wasn't much of an issue. There is coffee, tea and cold water available in the lobby and trust me, when you come back to the hotel after enduring that hot NY summer weather you will be VERY grateful for that water. \nThe best part of our hotel stay was Cynthia. She was amazing!!! Extremely helpful and professional. There is no question we asked that she didn't answer. I was mostly impressed on our first morning and seeing Cynthia serving breakfast AND checking in guests at the same time. I know she must have been overwhelmed, but she remained super clam and professional and did everything with a smile on her face. At the end of the trip we requested to speak to the manager to express our sincere gratitude for the service we received and Mr. Ahmed Latif was amazing as well. Not pretentious at all and even gave us a little gift to take back home. We will definitely be back to this hotel on our next visit to NY, especially if Cynthia is there and Mr. Latif is in charge.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

If you are in New York stay HERE! Walking distance from anywhere you want to go and they really created the best experience I've ever been a part of! I will not be staying anywhere else. Anytime I come to New York, I will be staying here at the La Quinta of 333 W 38th street!","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

She said, no problem, I am sorry to hear this news and I will take care of it. Well she didnt and my mothers limited income credit card was charged a whopping $$377 for a no-show. We had another reservation at the Hilton for additional family and they were kind and gracious to cancel per phone call without a problem. Laquinta is refusing to refund me, charged a credit card without approval and their management does not have the customer service decency to call me or respond to my emails. \nThis is not customer service- this is theft and terrible disrespect for the visitors that help this hotel in business.\nBuyer beware if they will charge me a room despite me following their directions to call in urgent matters, imagine what they will charge to your card when there is a missing towel or you check out 5 minutes late. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Very nice accommodations. Clean rooms and hotel overall ( new) decorated modern. We are in a King Premier room on the 20th floor- room 2002. Nice view of city lights makes for a great night light. King bed and linens and pillows very comfortable. Housekeeping freshens immaculately each day while we are out. Very nice hot shower, plenty of towels and complimentary toiletries and blow dryer. Coffee maker and refrigerator also in room - 2 complimentary bottled waters daily in your room. Breakfast on the concourse level. Adequate but we opted to eat out mostly instead but I do think it\u2019s nice that they have this ( basic bagels, cereals etc) Hot cookies each afternoon at 5 is also a very nice touch- coffee in the lobby 24 hours. All of these little touches make this place a great value for your money. A few blocks from Penn Station subway line at 34th. We also enjoyed massages on 36th street @ Aquis. Very affordable and worth it after walking all weekend. Love that it was close and clean and a great massage for $50.00 plus tip. My body feels better after working the kinks out.\nOverall I will plan on staying here again. Nothing disappointed us in any way. Great spot to explore the city!","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The room was kept immaculately.  Beds were comfortable as were the pillows.  We had 5 pillows on a king sized bed.  Elevators ran quickly and quietly.  I would definitely return and recommend this location to my friends.\nIf I have one small recommendation, the bathroom has terrible lighting for putting on make-up.  This could easily be fixed if they added a small light up retractable mirror on the wall.\n\nCoffee and tea and cookies are available most of  and the time in the lobby,\n\nWhite the breakfast was free, the breakfast was not good.
