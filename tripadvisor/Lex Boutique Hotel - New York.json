Then got an email offering an upgrade at what we thought was a reasonable added cost. So we upgraded. BUT - got to the hotel and the agent had booked TWO rooms for us, and charged and paid the hotel for two rooms. \n\nThe following morning, the Manager \"Odalis\" offered to call the agent, instead of me, seeing that I was clearly flustered. Odalis was on the phone for almost 30 minutes, having to call another staff member to deal with another customer on the phone and a customer entering into the foyer with their luggage. \n\nThe agent wanted still to charge me for the first night, but Odalis wouldn't have any of it and said the Hotel wanted to give a full refund for what was clearly the agent's fault. Odlis won the slightly heated argument and whilst we will be here for 10 nights, I hope to see the refund asap. \n\nWe love our superior room. The breakfast, (cereals, fruit, muffins etc)  included in the price, is totally sufficient to set us up for the day and means more savings in terms of eating out during the day. \n\nAnd a final heads-up for the rooftop area.

We had stayed at the Hilton in midtown for 2 nights prior for a work related conference and moved after the conference due to the proximity of the Lex in relation to our daughters apartment. We have  stayed in many places throughout Manhattan over the years and recognize the value of proximity, size, amenities ect\u2026 First I have to say that the front staff, regardless of the time of day, was always excellent. They are friendly and accommodating to whatever your needs are. The rooms were however, not as nice as others we\u2019ve stayed in for the same price range and area. The bathroom was nice - and spacious - but the wall ac\/heat unit was difficult to adjust and the room smelled quite musty. The size of the room (and bathroom) was much bigger than the Freehand hotel which is close by but the decor\/furnishings are very simplistic at the Lex. There was also no outlet in the bathroom or anywhere near a mirror outside of the bathroom which was odd and made getting ready to go out a challenge. Also, we left the room at 11am and returned at 10pm and although we hung the sign for housecleaning-  nobody cleaned our room. This is becoming more common at hotels - but usually they ask you upon check in or tell you that you need to request it. We just assumed by hanging the sign that it would be provided. We didn\u2019t make it to breakfast from 7-9 so I cannot comment on that - the rooftop was just a basic NYC rooftop sitting space -  nothing exciting. Overall, despite the nice staff- I think we\u2019ll stay elsewhere in the area in the future - like the Broadway plaza.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Breakfast was included but really basic (plain croissant and muffins and bad coffee), I went out for breakfast after the first day. \nFor the price in the area it makes sense, I'd stay again because of the people working there.\nLast thing, when getting a taxi to the airport which they have a button for through the taxi company so it arrives right away, I asked the front desk what the flat rate was to JFK was and was told $52. The taxi driver charged me $68 flat rate.

My three nights at the hotel did not disappoint! The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the overall vibe was great and added an exclamation point to my recent trip to NYC. Odalis checked me in and was really helpful; later when I was in search of ice to help my friends better enjoy the rooftop view, he was quick to have a bucket of ice sent to my room. The rooftop itself was a highlight of my Lex experience, as I spent mornings and two evenings looking out along the picturesque view along Lexington Avenue which stretches as far as the Chrysler Building. Getting on a train is easy, as there's a subway stop on nearby 23rd, or if you don't mind a quick walk, Union Square is close by. Gramercy Park is just down the street, and midtown and Brooklyn are just minutes away by train. Great food\/drink experiences abound as well nearby. The only negative (and it's not a deal breaker as the staff will promptly send you ice as stated before) is that the rooms don't have refrigerators.

I had seen other reviews on TripAdvisor and seen pictures so I felt assured that our stay would be good. We arrived early morning and dropped off our bags that the hotel. They said they would call us as soon as they had a room ready. Around 4:30 pm I had still not received any call so I called the front desk and the man on the phone said he forgot to call us to tell us the room was ready. Once we checked in, the room was OKAY. It had a faint mildew smell and the AC unit was extremely noisy and made the air super dry. I was not expecting a super large space or anything so I do not mark them negatively on this. It had all the basic amenities you would expect; hair dryer, towels etc. The mattress and bedding felt super warm at night, coupled with the shoddy AC, it made sleeping pretty difficult and I felt sweaty most of the night. \n\nThe one thing that really stood out to me negatively was the bar soaps and shampoos. I do not know why but when I used their products, my skin started to itch immediately and I began to develop small rashes. I looked at the back of the products and it wrote \"Made in China\" alongside many ingredients that looked strange to be in bathroom products. I would really hope that even when cutting costs, this area they could invest more in, because the soaps really made the experience all the worse!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We're in NYC for a variety of reasons (business and pleasure) and Lex has become our go to hotel. Our last visit required us to stay for 9 days and the only reason we didn't stay at the Lex the entire time was availability. It's a smaller hotel and although limited by the number of rooms, the quality, attentiveness, friendliness of staff and location make this a top choice in Manhattan.\n\nIf you're looking for trendy, you can go down the block and easily spend $100 more a night for staff with an attitude and artisan shampoos and soaps. Compared to the Lex, you'll also get much smaller rooms and limited flexibility with check in and check out.  The Lex staff is nothing short of amazing. Consistently, we are greeted with a sincere smile every time we pass the front desk, and when we need something (extra pillows, late checkout, etc.), they are extremely helpful.\n\nThe rooms may lack the hip decor of the Standard or Public, but they are spotless and the beds are always comfortable. Although a boutique hotel, the rooms are big by NYC standards, so we've never felt confined as with other hotels.\n\nFinally, the location is ideal.

If the weather is nice they have a very comfortable roof deck.  The staff is also very friendly and helpful.  My only complaint and the reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because of their advertising.  They advertised a Spring Fling rate  which was 15% off the posted rates.  Also said you got the best rates if you booked direct instead of through kayak, travago etc.  They guaranteed you were getting the best rate.  I booked a room for one night about 10 days in advance non-refundable.   About two days later the same room was advertised at $40.00 less.  When I asked them about reducing my rate to the new rate, they balked saying that since my booking was non-refundable they wouldn't adjust it.  I expected from the web site that I would be getting the best rate period, not the best rate at that moment.  Could have played the game of booking a refundable room and then waiting for the rates to drop, cancel and re-booked the lower price room.  From the advertising I felt confident in booking thinking that no matter happened in the next few days I my charge rate would be adjust if the rates dropped.

Paper thin walks meant we could not only hear our neighbors, but we could hear what they were saying. The vent system seems to somehow amplify sound. We had to keep the aircon on to blot out the constant chatter. And the breakfast....we went down first morning and didn't bother after that, it consisted of a few stale croissants (the kind made from vegetable oil not from butter), pastries (we didn't try after the croissants) and tea or coffee. We couldn't understand the positive breakfast reviews and still can't. \nOverall it was an OK choice if you're going to spend a few days in the City and just sleep in the hotel.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Porridge, fruit, pastries and other cereal options with tea, coffees and juices help kick start your day and teas & coffees are available on request 24\/7. We managed to walk uptown, downtown and cross town to visit most tourist attractions from the hotel. Nice eateries close by including smokehouse next to Jazz Standard 2 mins from hotel but we preferred the choices in nearby Greenwich and Little Italy.

Their staff and location make this hotel a fantastic option. From checking in to checking out, the staff were so friendly and helpful to us.  I would actually say this is one of the best hotel experiences I've had. We booked a cosy queen room and asked for a room at the back. It was super quiet and perfect for our stay. Only drawback to that room is not enough storage. There is a rooftop on this hotel with lovely views. The breakfast is in the lobby each morning and was perfect to set us up for the day. There isn't a specific breakfast room and it is self service. The hotel is very clean and I would again highlight how friendly and kind the staff are. We also had a good laugh with them at times which was lovely.  This hotel is in a great location pretty much in Murray Hill, beside Union Square and a few minutes walk to the Flatiron building.  For eating nearby, I would recommend the Murray Hill Diner and Banc cafe.  Cask is another place to eat nearby. Dunkin Donuts is around the corner too. There is a convenience store right next door to this hotel which is super handy.  There is a Subway also nearby. Our taxi driver highlighted to us that this area is great for Indian food and there are a lot of restaurants nearby which were always busy which is a good sign. We don't eat Indian food so we didn't eat in them. Fresh bottles of water were left in our room e ery day. In the evening, there is complimentary cheese and wine in the lobby.

While the 3rd party website promised us 2 Queen Beds, they told the hotel to give us a room with 1 bed (which most of their rooms are).  \n\nOnce this was recognized, the two gentlemen working at the front desk did EVERYTHING in their power to assist -- including spending nearly an hour on the phone with the 3rd party website trying to resolve the issue.  Ultimately, the 3rd party website let us down, but the Lex and their staff did what they could do save the day, including upgrading our room and making accomodations so that my family would be comfortable.  We try to recognize amazing customer service even in the face of disappointment, and not to blame those who were not responsible.  In this case, the Lex was not responsible, and yet they went far over and above the call of duty to help us fix it.  Beyond that, our room was clean, comfortable, and our stay very enjoyable.

The hotel itself is extremely modern and comfortable, from the well maintained and designed perfectly cleaned rooms, the luxurious bedding, to its fabulous location, it provides everything you need. But the real highlight of this hotel (as if all that was not enough), is its staff. They are the best team I have encountered at any hotel (including 5 star) across the globe, they literally cannot do enough to make your stay as fabulous as possible. Since I accidentally stumbled across this hotel when it just opened, this is, and will always be, my NYC home.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room and hotel was always clean, fresh towels and sheets every day and complimentary bottles of water each day too. The bed is very comfortable and you have heating and air con in the room. You don\u2019t hear any noise at night so we were having a great nights sleep. Bathroom is modern and always clean with complimentary shower gels and shampoos etc. You get a coded safe in the room which is free of charge and no deposit needed. Nice big flat screen TV which we appreciated when we had a long day so we ordered take out and there are plenty of channels so always films on. The hotel is in a great location right in the middle of uptown and down town. There are so many restaurants and places to eat around the hotel so you will not struggle for meals if you don\u2019t want to venture too far out at night. I would highly recommend the Thai place which is called Thai-ish which I think was 2 blocks up. Lovely food. The staff at the Lex NYC are so friendly and really can\u2019t do enough for you, always happy to help and seem like they really enjoy working there and helping you out.

Overall it is a brilliantly located, stylish, clean and modern hotel that I would definitely recommend.  Staff are welcoming, pleasant and extremely courteous - I found Rumel and Maurice to be particular nice as they always offered me my favourite black tea on arriving back at the hotel after a chilly day out and about!  Having complimentary tea and coffee to be brought to your room is a nice touch. The breakfast was better than I expected - although there isn't huge variety (hot drinks, juice, croissants, mini sweet pastries, two types of muffin, apples, oranges and bananas) what is there is delicious, good quality and plentiful.  It set me up for the day and I enjoyed watching the world go by from the comfort of the lobby each morning whilst planning my day.  I had a cosy room, and it surpassed my expectations in terms of size, cleanliness and design.  Lovely toiletries, spotless, great bath and shower, large extremely comfy bed and a bathroom light that makes sound effects! :-).\nThe reason I have given 4 and not 5 is because firstly the air conditioning is VERY loud and woke me up multiple times most nights, and secondly because on arriving at the Lex I was given room 302, which I had the misfortune to spend one night in. It has an adjoining door (locked, not that it made any difference!) with the next room and I could hear every single word the loud couple said.  I asked straight away if I could be moved, and the staff were very understanding but said they were fully booked that night. However I could be moved the next day. So I packed up everything (I had just unpacked!), had a sleepless night listening to the couple make a lot of noise and the next day my bags were moved to a quiet haven known as room 701. Much better! So although this was handled well, as I was a solo traveller staying for a week, it annoyed me that they thought they could put me in an extremely noisy room and get away with it.  So beware room 302 - I'm not sure how many other (if any) of the rooms have this issue but don't expect the noise will get better - it won't!\nAll in all though after this bad start my room and stay were faultless, and I would definitely stay again.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

The room was very clean and quite spacious (for NYC rooms) the bed very comfortable and the bathroom was a reasonable size with plenty of hot water and a good shower over the bath. The location of the hotel was well situated on Lexington Avenue, we walked a lot including at night and the area felt very safe. The reception staff were really helpful and gave us several recommendations for local restaurants. The hotel provided a continental type breakfast with coffee, hot water and orange juice, a really good start to the day especially when we were awake about 4am on our first day in NYC, it would have been a long wait for breakfast in any of the local diners at that time of day. On our last day there was a problem with our taxi booking, the reception staff tried their best to resolve this with the taxi firm and then ordered us another taxi when our failed to materialise. I would be very happy to stay in The Lex again on our next trip to New York.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The most impressive thing about this place was the helpfulness of the staff.  Every person was friendly and went out of their way to help with anything.  When I arrived, the front desk clerk helped me find a room that was quiet and not bathed in light early in the morning.  She let me look at several rooms and did it all with a smile.   The room itself was pretty basic, without even so much as a chest of drawers to put your clothes.  The desk was a narrow strip of plastic, barely sufficient to hold even a laptop.  I know that they were trying to save money on furniture but for even a little bit more money on furnishing the rooms, they would feel much more comfortable.  The bed was comfortable.  People who don't like loud heater\/air conditioners: beware!  As other reviewers have noted, the fan on the heater\/air conditioner is extremely loud and (at least in my room) couldn't be turned to \"low\".   There's not a lot in the immediate neighborhood (other than Indian restaurants on Lex) but it's a short walk to subway stations and other good things a few blocks west.  Bottom line: Very friendly and helpful staff, very basic rooms but inexpensive.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

We looked into many hotel, before deciding on the Lex, but what a wonderful choice it was.  Being  a small boutique style turned out to be perfect.  The staff knew us by name and were aware of our circumstances.  They were so very kind to us, inquired about our daughter and said they would work with us in anyway to make our stay as stress free as possible.  The front desk staff were top notch.  I don't want to name names because I would not want to forget anyone.  One really super person was Angelika, one of the managers.  Angelika recommended a Junior suite since our daughter would be with us the evening before surgery.  We had a nice quiet room in the back of the hotel.  The beds were super comfortable, the bathroom was large and more than adequate.  They provided the usual necessities; shampoo, conditioner, lotions, body wash etc. but they were a better quality than I expected.  The one thing I was concerned about when booking a hotel in NYC was that it was clean.  I never had to worry at the Lex.  Everything was spotlessly clean!  Each morning they provided a lovely continental breakfast consisting of juice, fruit, pastries, muffins and croissants.  Again, much more than I expected. Coffee, tea and ice were.  Not only did you get your coffee but it was delivered a gentleman, with a wonderful smile.  He could not do enough for you.  Another unexpected treat was their weekly gathering.  Wine and cheeses were served in the lobby for two hours.  After a particularly rough day spent in an ICU room,  we made it back just as the reception was coming to a close.  It was no nice to have a glass of wine and enjoy some cheese.hour win time and they made certain we could have a bit.  They were so wonderful!!  I highly recommend the Lex NYC to anyone visiting NYC.  It is so much more personal than the larger hotel.  The staff cannot do enough for you.  They are so pleased to be of help and never make you feel as though you are a bother.  For us, it was the best choice.  I cannot think of anything negative to say.  I would have liked a small refrigerator and microwave Since our schedule did not allow time for eating out.  But with all the pluses we managed very well. I have recommended it to a few friends already and they are surprised to hear about the \"little gem\" we found.  In the past I have found Trip Advisor reviews to be most helpful.  I wanted to share this with all my Trip Advisor friends and I truly hope this review convinces you to try the Lex when you go to NYC.  Since our daughter is still not doing well, we will probably be back in the city again next week.  Without a doubt, the Lex will be our choice!\n\n.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I highly recommend it. Although it is a budget style hotel, service from reception is excellent and friendly, with good advice on the local area. Angelica and all the other staff were first rate. Room is not big (we had a \"cosy room\"), but was fine for our needs. The bed and bed linen was very comfortable. The bathroom was excellent. We had requested a quiet room, which is what we got at the rear of the building. No traffic noise at all. I'd guess that if your room faces Lexington Avenue, it could be noisy. A basic breakfast is provided at no extra cost (tea, coffee, pastries and fruit). Complimentary coffee and tea can also be brought to your room, which we took advantage of. It's not located in a classy part of Manhattan, but we felt comfortable walking around at night and it's close to the subway and about 10 minutes walk to Union Square. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Highly recommend Penelope's at 159 Lexington Avenue for fresh, reasonably priced meal and Florian at 225 Park Avenue for a more stylish dinner. Two minor issues were that (1) the air conditioning unit was noisy when it came on (for about 5 minutes every 45 minutes, but we got used to it and it didn't wake us up) and (2) it would have been good if the room had a small fridge. We will be heading back to the Lex next time we are in New York.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It took around 5-10 minutes to walk to Madison Square Park and then a short walk onto 5th into the Flatiron district. If walking is not your thing then you are only a couple of blocks from the subway or cabs are very frequent and easy to flag down outside the hotel. \n\nThere are also great restaurants close to the hotel if you don't fancy venturing too far on an evening. \n\nThe staff in the hotel were very helpful and informative. Our bags didn't arrive on our flight and the staff were excellent in directing us to a pharmacy and clothes shops to get some emergency stuff to see us through until they arrived. \n\nThe various members of staff we met were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. \n\nThis is a basic hotel which is reflected in the price but it doesn't pretend to be anything further.

We didn't have the breakfast in the hotel but it looked good with pastries and coffee available. \n\nThere was a deli next door which has a load of other food available if you wanted something bigger\n\nAll in all it was a great trip and the Lex did everything we asked of it to make it that way.

My room was on the basement level, which means there were no real windows. But it seems like maybe the basement rooms are larger, so that's the tradeoff. My room was pretty big and the bathroom was enormous. The rooms are very minimal when it comes to decor, but they are clean and have everything you need (hair dryer, iron, high quality toiletries and flat screen TV). The air conditioning works really well, so expect your room to be pretty chilly. The AC unit is also a bit on the loud side, but the noise is a steady fan noise, so it didn't bother me. The staff at this hotel is incredibly friendly and nice. They are very eager to help and did a great job arranging a very affordable ($50, inclusive of tip) town car to take me to La Guardia from the hotel. They also let me hang out in the air conditioned lobby for a long time so I could avoid the sweltering heat while I killed time between checking out and heading to the airport. If you are looking for a place that is clean, has friendly service and is in a good location (very short walk to Madison Square Park, Union Square, Eataly, lots of shopping, etc.), this is a good deal. It's not super cheap, but by NYC standards, it's pretty darn affordable. My room was $282 a night (including taxes) while the other hotels I typically stay at were around $500-$600 per night that same night.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

We even called in advance to make sure that we where getting a balcony and they said yes.  When I checked in the hotel on Monday July 11, I was told that the balcony was out of order due to renovations of the outside of the building.  What a disappointment!  The hotel manager right away offered free breakfast for the entire stay for all three of us and some extra Marriott points Great!  The room was great until time to sleep.  My son was going to sleep on the sofa bed but it was so uncomfortable you can feel all the springs.  He called front desk to ask for a bed topper which they did not have. But was able to get some extra blankets but it was still uncomfortable.  They felt bad and discounted the room for that night and offered to change rooms with two queen beds the following morning if we wanted. The next day they changed out the sofa bed with a new one but still the mattress was horrible. I got a call from the manager and explained the problem so he offered a rollaway bed verses changing rooms.. Our room was very nice..  the sofa bed was the problem.. Now its the second night, the roll away bed was just as bad.. We gave up!! On day three we went to K mart and purchased a full size egg cratered topper for the sofa bed and WE FIXED the sofa bed problem. We laughed and still laugh at ourselves carry this egg crate bed topper from K Mart on the subway to our hotel.. The only thing I can say is GET some egg crate toppers for these darn sofa beds so that your guest can sleep comfortable.  It was a $20.00 investment for me and your hotel got to keep the topper which probable got thrown away by the cleaning people.  Other than the disappointment of the balcony being out of order and having to keep my window shades closed all day because men where on it working and the horrible sofa bed mattress this hotel was very nice and all the staff was so kind.

More donuts arrived but for someone gluten free with GERD and sensitivity to acidic foods - well, you get the gist! I travel often, am flexible and have not been unable to find something acceptable to eat in longer than I can remember. These days standard hotel breakfasts  include at least hard boiled eggs and bananas, and often oatmeal.

It was oddly shaped, with the queen bed crammed into most of the front part of the space inside the door, and then a weird, narrow extra space with a luggage rack, and that's about it. There was no desk or large flat surface on which to place anything, and only one simple little chair with metal legs that we kept banging into. The room also had no closet, just hooks on the wall! No coffeemaker, no mini fridge, etc., that are pretty much expected in today's hotels. In fact, it felt more like a \"pod\" budget hotel than an upscale boutique hotel as advertised, and was not worth the rate that we paid.\n\nAnother negative was breakfast. Coffee and pastries were included in our (too-high) rate, but by the time we came down to the lobby it was all put away by 9am. On a weekend in the Big Apple, \"the city that never sleeps,\" this seems excessively early, especially when checkout isn't until noon.\n\nOn the plus side, the mattress and linens were of good quality. The windows were fitted with tight black-out screens to keep the room dark, and since we faced the back it was very quiet. The gleaming tiled bathroom was beautifully equipped, with a great shower and thick white towels. The A\/C worked well (except that it woke me up a few times whenever it kicked on and off). Wifi is free and they provide excellent free coffee. And of course, it's a great location near Madison Square Park.\n\nSo would I book here again? Probably not. I have stayed at better hotels in NYC for similar prices (Distrikt, Refinery, Tuscany, Beacon, Andaz, Times Sq. Hyatt, NYLO) and have received much nicer, bigger, and less weird and awkward rooms with better amenities than this one.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are reasonably sized, and comfortable, and the staff at the main desk is friendly.\n\nHowever, I never been at a hotel with ruder housekeeping. \n\nI had a long flight, and I desperately needed to sleep through the day, so I went out and got lunch for about a few hours and when I got back, my room wasn't made. \nNow that isn't a huge problem, as I can't expect the staff to know when I would return, although I did put up the sign that says \"Please clean my room.\" \nHowever, once I went back to my room to try and get some rest, 3 members of the staff approached my door in a 1 hour period. \n\n1. The first guy was nice, asked if i needed service. I said not right now, he asked when would be a good time and that they had to leave at 4:30. I said 3:30 would be ok. (it was around 3 at that time). I decide to hop in the shower and get ready to leave.\n2. Only moments after I start showering, I hear knocking on the door. I KNOW it can't be 3:30 yet, so I assumed it was housekeeping knocking on a nearby door. \nNope. The knocking grew louder and louder and the housekeeping lady was basically pounding on my door. I quickly turned off the shower, but she had already let herself in. I said, \"Not right now, please.\" It was about 3:15. \n3. So, my shower is interrupted, I can't sleep, and I am forced to leave because of the housekeeping. So I get dressed (this is only moments after the 2nd lady came) and I hear more pounding at my door. I know its them, so I just say, \"What?\" \n     \"Do you want service today?\" \n     \"Not. Right. Now. Please.\" How many times do I have to say that???\n     And then in the most condescending voice, she says, \"Then put your Do Not Disturb sign up.\" And she walked away.\n\nI understand that you obviously have to leave the room if you want it made, but why ask for a time to clean if you weren't going to respect it? It wasn't even 3:30 when all of these things happened.\n\nIts a shame that this hotel hires this rude staff, because the hotel itself is quite nice and in a good location. However, I won't be staying here again and will certainly not be recommending it to others.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was exactly what I was looking for- a wonderfully priced, clean, no-frills hotel. I wasn't looking for anything luxurious because who goes on a vacation to spend most of their time in the hotel! I was pleasantly surprised by how great the customer service was and how clean the facilities were for how little I paid to spend two nights there with my boyfriend.\n\nThe front desk was very cordial and accommodating- we had arrived earlier than check-in but they were able to arrange a room for us despite our early arrival. Our room was extremely clean- the sheets, the bathroom, and what have you. They were even nice enough to provide two water bottles, complimentary on the hotel, and the bathroom was equipped with nicer-than-usual, hotel goodies (shampoo, conditioner, etc).\n\nThe next day, we had left to traipse around the city and had left the room in utter disarray. When we came back, the room was impeccably clean and they were even nice enough to have organized some of our things for us, without having rummaged through anything. I had a few shirts that were strewn about (on the floor\/bed), and they were folded with care and left on the bed. \n\nOn the day of check-out, the front desk called 2 hours prior and inquired about our stay and asked if there was anything they could do to accommodate us, such as arranging for a car to the airport, or to hold onto our bags at the desk while we tried to squeeze out a few more hours of walking about the city before our flight- we were taken aback by how hospitable they were! \n\nExcellent service, extremely clean facilities, and very friendly employees! I would come back and stay at the Lex NYC in a heartbeat.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was clean and we slept extremely well (at the back of the hotel) for the 6 nights we were there, once we had unplugged the noisy air con\/heating system! The hotel is located in a fairly quiet spot so ideal for a good night's sleep. It's just a 5 minute walk to the nearest subway station but be prepared for reasonably long walks to some of the main tourist spots and there is a LOT of walking in NYC! \n\nThe room has almost everything you need: hair dryer, iron and ironing board, small wardrobe, tv, alarm clock. The cozy room is certainly on the cosy side but it was more than adequate. The only problem is there isn't anywhere to store a suitcase or store clothes, other than a small wardrobe so you have to live out of your suitcase on the floor (not a huge problem). The bathroom was a great size, with a bath and was very clean with lovely products to use. \n\nThe hotel does offer a light breakfast in the lobby from 7-9am which is sufficient to start the day but make sure you get there in good time if you want anything other than donuts! \n\nWe were offered a late checkout (without us asking!) on the day we departed as we had a late evening flight, which was a very nice and very welcome gesture. This enabled us to have some extra time exploring the city, which was great. It was also really helpful that we were able to store our luggage at the hotel until we departed for the airport in the evening.\n\nOverall a great little hotel, it's on the expensive side for what you get (we visited just after Thanksgiving, so a busy, expensive time), but overall it's probably worth it!","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Everything from a speedy check in, helpful staff, good size room (for NYC standards) and a great location with lots of bus and subway options nearby and some good bar and restaurants. Union Square and Flatiron District close by and easy bus ride to Lower East side and West Village for exploring. We asked for a room on a high floor and at the back of the hotel which was organised so it was nice and quiet at night\/morning.  Everything you needed was in the room including a lovely power shower.  The breakfast on offer was more than adequate and replenished regularly.  We loved the touch of a note and chocolates in our room when we arrived to wish my husband a happy 50th birthday. A nice touch.  We've visited NYC several times over the years and it never disappoints each visit - we enjoyed the fantastic Halloween Day parade on this visit.  New Yorkers are a friendly bunch (sorry but it's true) and this hotel is a gem so we will definitely return and recommend to friends and family. Although I agree with a previous reviewer that I almost want to keep this hotel our secret so we can get a room when we need it.

As first time travelers to NYC, I spent tons of time reading reviews and made my decision to stay at this hotel based on TA recommendations.  We stayed in room 607, which has a queen bed and nice bathroom with a small balcony.  The balcony faced the exterior of other buildings so visually not appealing, but a nice way to catch a breath of air in the morning, rather than hanging out on the street.  The room was adequate for the two of us.  Comfortable bed and most of all, clean!  They do supply a hair dryer.  Only improvement I could make would be to put a small 3 drawer dresser under the TV for those of us that like to unpack and stay organized.  The breakfast offerings were good enough for us with pastries, fruit and coffee.  We were up and out of there by 8 most days so always plenty for us.  My husband watched some people stuff their pockets.  Come on people. The hotel gives you a list of food recommendations.  Our favorite spot, however, not on the hotel's list, was Molly's Pub & Restaurant, which is an American, Irish pub close by.  Good food, service, beer and bar. The hotel is close to the 4, 5 and 6 train stations.  We bought an unlimited pass for $31 (cost plus a card), immediately took a wrong turn but was rescued by a nice NY lady and her little kids.  Cheap, safe transportation.  Little confusing on the weekends with closings for maintenance, etc. but ask the attendant at the desk of each station or the guy running the train; seemed they opened their windows when they stopped at the stations to answer questions.  We took a taxi from JFK for $52 plus tip.  Easiest, but not the cheapest way to get to the hotel after a long day of travel.  The Lex doesn't have the craziness of Times Square but a good place for almost 50 year olds to drop after a long day. They left us chocolate for our first trip to NYC!

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":6201200,"title":"If cleanliness is important to you, pick the Lex NYC!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-09-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"At first I thought I picked a place too far from where I needed to be & that it was more money than I should've spent on a room. Wellington & another man greeted us when we arrived & helped with our bags. We had a red eye flight and arrived a few hours earlier than check in but we were able to get into our room right away which was awesome! I brought my son out for NYU housing move in day. He was only going to stay at the Lex the first night, but then, since he & I were so busy getting him settled into the dorm, and with the NYU welcome week events he attended every night it always ended up being really late & he didn't want to bother his new roommates so he came back & stayed with me. The Lex had no problem with our change in plans and were very nice about it. Even though we were hardly there long enough to make a mess, they still wanted to be sure the room was given a good cleaning everyday. I felt bad & tried to only trade out towels and reassure them that it was perfectly fine (I just didn't see any sense in them going through all the work when we hadn't even pulled the covers down on the bed the first couple days because my son had his blanket & pillow on top & I have insomnia and didn't sleep much & I had my own pillow too). I was content with them skipping my room, but I could tell it was a little unsettling for them to walk away without completing the task because they wanted to be absolutely sure it was clean. Housekeeping even called my room to make sure it was taken care of. Which shows they really are on top of the cleaning, it's important to them and it really shows! I'd like to mention that another guest had commented on the restaurant & wait staff. There isn't a restaurant or wait staff (all of the hotel staff were great though) but they do have fresh items delivered each morning for self serve, like croissants, pastries, fruit, coffee & hot water for tea & cocoa (like you see in the pictures) And I'll have to say, that prior to my stay, I'd read a review that mentioned the breakfast & said if you want anything you need to get down there early or it'll be gone and that's true because we went down at 8:30 an there wasn't even a drop of coffee and literally only 2 drops of hot water, a banana & one croissant. I was crabby (not a morning person) and rudely left my cup at the front desk & took the stairs back to my room. So later that night when I was talking to Mario (the best front desk clerk) about it & asked if he'd apologize to the morning staff for me because I felt bad for being rude. He said I will but you don't have to apologize. He said they try to keep on top of that & will run out & get things if needed & was very apologetic about my experience. And he reminded me that there's always coffee, tea & water that I could have brought to my room. I told him I knew that, I was just not ready to be around a bunch of people & then have someone push me out of their way to grab another danish. I didn't blame them, I said it wasn't his fault I didn't get down there early and he certainly didn't have any control over other guests (especially since he worked the night shift, ha!) seriously though I was just a crab. Well if it happens again he said just let them know and we'll take care of you if you don't get anything. So my advise-if you're really wanting something to eat- is to be down stairs by 7:00 am if you want first pick and probably no later than 8:00 if you want anything at all because they are tasty and there's no limit so if the first person takes 30 items (you never know!) you're probably not going to have a lot of choices if you're the 10th person down there! Oh yeah, and don't be crabby & storm off (like me) if there's nothing left, instead ask the wonderful staff behind the desk if there's anything left and then see what they can do for you, as I'm sure they will do their best to accomodate you! So overall I was so pleased with my stay there that I was happy I ended up there and the distance to NYU was still within walking distance & the dorm was in between NYU & The Lex so it worked out well for us because we also walked to Times Square and Grand Central as well as the Rockefeller center & Madison Square without a problem. I have to say that the staff was absolutely the best! I'm sure I was even annoying Mario every night as I'd request ice & I'd wait for it so they wouldn't have to bring it to my room. But if he was annoyed he didn't show it & was attentive & always very nice. He was training Dina the last night I was there & I ended up talking to them for quite sometime and I probably screwed them up because they couldn't discuss their work with me talking away. But they just let me keep on with smiles on their faces then I realized Mario's shift would be ending soon & I had cut into alot of the time he was expecting to use to train Dina! Oops! I felt bad but they were super nice and said it wasn't a problem even though it probably was! So you two, I hope I didn't screw you up too much!! I thank you all especially you Mario for listening and putting up with me! The Lex would be my first choice if I needed to stay in the city again. But next time I'll probably have to stay in CT with my boyfriends family so I won't be as lucky and neither will you because I'll still come say Hi! Anyhow, I loved my stay there & will recommend it to anyone who needs a great little hotel that's quiet, clean & has a wonderful staff! The Lex NYC is Perfect!","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

From the outside, the hotel appears to be just another storefront, with some barstools and a countertop. However, upon stepping in, the counter staff has a warm greeting from the start coupled with a smile.\n\nI had Omar to help me check in, and there was barely any hassle, even though I was checking in at about noon (check in time is about 3pm) and my room was already prepared and available.\n\nLift service is a little slow, but at least it works. There is always the option of stairs, but luggage makes this less likely.\n\nThe room itself is a little smaller than other areas or cities, but this is New York and evidently the trend. I was staying on the 7th floor, and the water pressure was rather weak, but enough to get by. Temperature was good and hot. It was nice having a tub, even if I chose not to use it. Having the option makes it lovely, especially compared to other properties that despite having higher costs, lack this.\n\nBreakfast was complimentary. Served in the lobby, where seating is at a premium, it consists of pastries, croissants, coffee, tea and milk. Fruits are present. Hours are from 7 to 9, and the clearing up is rather punctual.\n\nLocation wise, it is within walking distance of the subway, and there are some interesting places around to see: Madison Square park, to name one. Getting to hte hotel via subway is not recommended, as navigating the train stations with luggage is difficlt (not all are lift-equipped).\n\nAside from the few minor nigglies (low water pressure, lack of seating for breakfast), the only major gripe I had was that of calls. I had issues trying to make calls, even though I dialled 9 followed by the number. The only way to connect evidently was to dial 1+800+whatever number. On top of that, when I checked out, I was charged for the calls. For a property of this standard, usually calls (at least locally) are included!\n\nThe staff were apologetic about it, but there was not much they could do, since I did make the calls. However, it irks me still even thinking about it.\n\nOverall, it is a good hotel, with good location and awesome helpful staff. However, always ask before using anything, to avoid charges!","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

In the lobby they serve some coffee in a thermos, croissants (not crispy), and some pastries. No proper place to sit, not American style breakfast, no healthy options.

My concern about giving this glowing review, and the others that will follow  by other travelers is that they will end up raising their prices. I hope not because that is part of its beauty and charm is that its one of the few hotels in NYC that you don't feel like you are paying way too much for way too little.\n\nI arrived before my room was ready and the gentleman behind the counter was courteous, and efficient even though he couldn't get me in he recommended a great coffee shop with free wifi. \n\nI failed to get any pictures of the lobby but it a great space with a mired and glass tile covering much of the walls. Accented by black (can black accent?) and big windows looking out onto Lexington.\n\nCheck was smooth and painless. I got a quick run down on things to do in the area and where to eat. \n\nMy room was on the very front of the hotel, 2nd floor over looking Lexington but there was a nice think pane of glass keeping the noise mostly out and two levels of curtains. one for diffusing the light, the other to block it out. \n\nThe room is cozy, as in small, but it was very clean, very well appointed, and obvious care was given to its furnishing and no space was wasted. It isn''t the place to go if you are having a group and expect to lounge in the rooms. I do speak from my room, but i teems from the pictures all of the rooms are equally cozy. I didn't feel cramped in this room, but there wasn't any extra space, or a sitting area. There is a small desk, with a chair but it too was cozy.\n\nThe bathroom was nicely sized for the smallness of the living area. Again, nice attention to detail with excellent products and obvious care taken in how it was designed. The sheets, blankets and towels were all clean and very plush. \n\nWhen I called the front desk I was greeted with my last name and every body was friendly every time at the front desk. I was there for 6 nights and saw a good cross section between the morning breakfast, the Tuesday wine and cheese and my nightly request for ice. By the second night when the front desk picked up the phone they greeted me and asked if I wanted my ice. It shows they were paying attention and they were on top of things.\n\nThere wasn't an area that they slipped in other then one night I called for me ice, and 30 minutes later I called back down. They apologized and it was taken care of immediately.\n\nI highly recommend you trying The Lex out for its NYC value, outstanding service and its well appointed rooms.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

The major disadvantage of this, is that you can literally hear what the people in the other room are saying. This is quite annoying when people start talking as early as 6am. Luckily for us, this only happened one morning, and after 30 minutes we called the reception to complain about the noise. The other guests were then called by the reception, and all went fairly silent after that. \n\nBreakfast was good, although the choice is a bit limited: pastries, croissants and fruit. Also, the seating area is limited: only around 10 people can sit in the lobby (where breakfast is served) at the same time. We took our breakfast to our room when all the seats in the lobby were taken. This was no further problem. \n\nThe cleanliness of the hotel was very good, everything you could wish for. \nThe neighborhood is like you expect in Manhattan: busy streets, restaurants and little shops everywhere.

This was not an exception, but granted, given the territory. \n\nThings I love about The Lex is that you almost don't feel you're in a hotel and get to experience life as a local.

Es ist aber trotzdem sehr sehr nett, da sowas in den USA bei weitem nicht selbstverst\u00e4ndlich ist und es f\u00fcr den kleinen Hunger am Morgen vollkommen ausreicht.\n\nZimmer:\n\nDie Zimmer sind zwar recht klein, aber modern ausgestattet.

I was able to have a late check out of 3pm for the price of half a days stay; not a bad deal. Our flight was delayed coming in by 9 hours and we arrived well after midnight. The gentleman on the front desk was very friendly. When you check in they give you a sheet that gives wifi password, number to call the front desk, breakfast times etc and also a list of recommended nearby restaurants. It came in very handy. The room itself was definitely 'cosy', but we didn't spend much time in the room. However the bathroom was really big which was surprising. The only qualm I have with the bathroom was that the toilet seemed to be one of those saniflo\/macerater toilets, as once flushed, the toilet paper reappears in a thousand pieces floating around. Our room did not have a view... Well it did have a view of the wall of the next building. This didn't bother us, in fact I was happy not to have a street view as this would have been noisy. The walls are pretty thin, I got woken up a number of times by people coming back in the evening and talking quite loudly in the hallway. The room had toiletries, iron, ironing board, safe, cable tv, alarm clock and each day you get 2 complementary mineral waters. We would leave our room quite late in the morning (around 10\/11am) and when we came back, our room had still been made up. Although we didn't take advantage, a grab and go style breakfast is offered every morning and they have a wine and cheese night on a Tuesday. I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit New York. It is only a short walk from a subway station, and the area is very nice. Also there is a Subway (sandwich shop) right next door, and a convenience store on the other side!","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Whilst there were no special surprises for me when we arrived (and we didn\u2019t necessarily expect any, even though my fianc\u00e9e had mentioned it was my big 40) everyone was extremely pleasant and polite, assisting us with anything we requested and advising about what to do\/what to see in NYC. They even managed to find 3 little candles on the evening of my birthday when I mentioned that I hadn\u2019t blown any and that would have been bad luck\u2026 (thank you Angelica!!) \uf04a \nThe room was immaculately clean and maintained and was more than adequate for our stay. Even though it was fairly small (which we expected as we booked the \u2018cosy\u2019) it had everything we needed (i.e. no cupboard but coat and clothes hanger in the corner of the room). It was at the 7th floor so the noise wasn\u2019t too bad, provided you kept all the windows closed \u2013 you are in NYC, what do you expect!?\nThe breakfast was served in reception \u2013 standing room only kind-of-style - and consisted of pastries, fruit, coffee, juice. Not the kind of breakfast that fills you up, particularly if a group of Russians is staying there at the same time as you (then you have no chance for anything to be left for you to have!) however, a lot of Hotels in NYC don\u2019t even offer breakfast, so this is more than enough to get you going. The staff always allowed my other half to bring coffee and bits up to the room whilst I was getting ready and the lovely housekeeping guys, by day 2, was already ready with a box to carry it all up to the room (we didn\u2019t even need to ask for one!). Just lovely little touches like this make the whole Customer experience so remarkable.\nThe staff at The LEX in fact, is what made the difference for us. They were all lovely and extremely helpful. Angelica, Wellington, Omar, Andrew - everyone was great to chat to, before and after our long days out, and they offered more advise on things like Subway closure on certain days, President visiting etc and anything else tourists should be aware of.\nLocation wise, the hotel is 5 minutes\u2019 walk to the Empire State Building and very close to Union Square where you can take the Subway if you are not a \u2018walker\u2019. Go to Eataly if you can. This is an Italian market with a Bar and a few Restaurants within. It is on the other side of Madison Gardens and it\u2019s just amazing and does great food! Beware \u2013 whenever you buy anything in NYC, tax gets added on it!! So the price you see is almost NEVER the price you end up paying. Do not have the exact change! \nWe had an amazing, unforgettable time in NYC even though it flew by, our feet were absolutely killing us but we certainly made the most of it!\nOther suggestions: \nHop on and Off bus \u2013 do that at the beginning of your stay, so you recognise things later on (i.e. from the Empire State) and you know where you may want to go back to, to explore further.\nGo to Staten Island for free!\nIf you can afford it \u2013 the Helicopter ride is well worth it! It was my birthday surprise and I absolutely loved it. The memory of a lifetime!! \nBrooklyn is a must \u2013 definitely has the WOW factor (more than Manhattan in my opinion)\nPenelope\u2019s is just up one street on Lexington Avenue and does lovely food and bottomless coffee. \nWe also went to Uncle Mario for a pizza (as suggested by one of the tour guides) and the pizza was very good \u2013 one of the best I have eaten outside of Naples (my hometown, very well known as the Kingdom of pizza!). The lady (who I assume the owner\/Manager) comes across as a bit rough but I guess it goes with the atmosphere of the restaurant\u2026. \nNegative note: \nOn our last day we went to the National History Museum and were disappointed to find that a few rooms were closing to the Public due to a Private event. This had been, apparently, advertised at the entrance but we didn\u2019t see it \u2013 so we missed out on a lot of the things we really wanted to see.\nDo ask if you have any questions!\nEnjoy this wonderful city and book at The LEX for an amazing stay!","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Lex, rather cheekily, offers ear plugs to guests who might find the noise in NYC unacceptable. The location is the key aspect of this hotel, you're in Midtown on the Curry Mile, and within walking distance of the flat iron building. There are some good recommendations on food and cafes given by the hotel. Breakfast is light fare, with coffees and pastries, served in a nook by reception.

I think if you bring a lot of luggage you might wonder where to put it.  So don't bring much. Everyone in NYC only wears black !  We had a big Window that looked out onto Lexington Ave.  Coffee and a sweet roll for breakfast, along with fresh fruit ( apples, oranges and banana's) .  \nWhen you arrive tell your taxi driver 25th and Lexington, we made the mistake of saying 67 Lexington ave. and before we knew it we were on our way uptown to 67th St and Lexington! Luckily my husband realized this and quickly pointed it out to our taxi driver! Most taxi rides seemed to be $10, going to a Broadway, up to Central Park, Penn Station...also, taxis take credit cards and you can also tip with your credit card.  The first screen says 20 30 40 percent tip! If you want to tip 15% go to the second screen. \nThe Lex is really in a great location.

This is my fourth trip to NYC, and my first time at The Lex.\n\nHotel: This is a small boutique hotel, so as long as you are not expecting luxurious comfort, you've chosen the right spot. Complimentary breakfast includes some baked goods and coffee and is served in the hotel lobby - stools and bar tables. I loved this casual feel - again, don't expect a sit down with white napkin service. The room was larger than I was expecting - it was clean, well lit and maintained throughout the stay. Complimentary water bottles were a nice touch, as these usually are charged a pretty penny in other hotels. There was even a wine & cheese one night in the lobby.\n\nStaff: I definitely got the impression that the staff would help in any ways possible. I was cold the first few nights due to a strange heater, asked for two blankets, and was good. I never advised the staff of the heater (which was not heating enough and was fairly loud), since it didn't bother me enough after the second night - but I am reticent to have this affect this review, since I feel the staff would have made some kind of accommodation.\n\nLocation: On the corner of Kip's Bay and NoMad, the Lex is well situated for those looking to walk NYC. It is not \"central\" to any major tourist area, but is an easy 20 minute walk to many great neighbourhoods: Times Square and the Theatre District, Chelsea, SoHo, Chinatown, etc. Those who are less inclined to walk NYC (in which case, you are probably visiting the wrong city), can nonetheless take a 5-minute stroll to a fairly central subway line at Union Park.\n\nSummary: If you are alone, or a couple, or with friends, and you are the kind of traveler who likes to experience and walk the places you visit, The Lex is perfect. Again, I would not recommend the hotel if you are the kind of person who relies on luxury - in this case, expect to pay 3-4 times the price.\n\nWould definitely return to The Lex.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They always had something nice to say and it was never fake or forced conversation. \n\nThe room was great- smallish as expected but plenty of space to hang our big winter coats, put our backpacks and set out our winter boots to dry. It was spotless and smelled great! We were on the 7th floor with a beautiful view of the 69th Regiment Armory. We requested a higher floor due to another reviewer saying the street noise is loud on the lower floors. NYC is just loud (the city that never sleeps!), so I don't think we escaped much noise. If you are a light sleeper I suggest bringing a noise machine or ear plugs. However, it didn't bother us, and it was fun to hear all the commotion as a reminder of the bustling city outside of our window!\n\nBreakfast was included in our rate- croissants and other pastries, fresh hand fruit, coffee, tea, hot cocoa... not a huge selection but it was a perfect way to start the day. \n\nMy ONLY suggestion was that I wished that they had coffee\/hot water available in the lobby all day. I did call down for hot water one night and they brought it up for me immediately (for a little night-time tea), but I felt badly to inconvenience them and potentially have them burn themselves with the hot water coming up the elevator when I would have been happy to get it myself if it were available. \n\nI would be SO lucky to be able to stay in this hotel next time we visit NYC! Thank you for your fantastic hospitality!","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Beds are super-comfortable and bathroom well fitted. \n\nThe rooms themselves are not big - as you would expect in the mid-town area at this price range, but most definitely bigger than some I've stayed in. My stay was probably longer than the average visitor - I was there for a little under two weeks and at no point did I feel cramped or claustrophobic. Admittedly, I did change my initial 3rd floor back-facing room for a higher floor facing Lexington and not only was the room a better shape but having the view from the window gave more light and a better feeling of space. \n\nThe staff are super friendly and helpful...truly....made a big difference to the atmosphere in the hotel. They even made me coffee at 4 am (!!) and the complimentary continental breakfast was a plus (although there's a limit to how many croissants you can eat in two weeks!!).

Free Wifi, which was very fast, and although a small thing, it was nice to have two complementary bottles of water in the room. The ironing board is a small table top model, but gets the job done.

The design has a sleek,Euro-modern feel. If possible, consider upgrading  -- the larger room is more comfortable, particularly if there is more than one person in the room.

It is in an okay area but the best part is that you are very close to the 6 train which takes you and down the East side of manhattan so even if the area is not vibrant, you are very close to the subway and can get in\/out of this area quickly.  It's convenient as well because even if not the best, there are plenty of restaurants on 2nd avenue, which is a short walk\u2026.The hotel is a bit unusual in that it looks like a restaurant front with a pop out door (to block cold from coming straight in) and when you enter, there is a tiny lobby which, in the morning, has a continental breakfast set up.  Nice touch.  The staff are lovely.  We had a junior suite, so not sure what standard rooms look like.  It was very spacious, nice beds, small couch, tv and good sized bathroom.  There is a safe (although one of those odd thin ones but big enough to fit a small laptop) good (and free!) wi fi, a small ironing board with iron\u2026etc.  So well apportioned.  I did not have a view as was on the main floor (entry level floor) but it was quiet and in NYC that is what I want. Even if you were quite high up though, I don't think this is a hotel with views.  There is not much of a hotel life here so if you want a hotel that has a bar or big common areas, this is not for you but, otherwise, I think this is a very good new find!","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

It was easy to get to two subway trains and plenty of restaurant, grocery options available nearby.

The rooms toward the front of the hotel look out on an interesting old building (national guard armory?). Street noise was really minimal. The only reason I didn't give The Lex 5 stars is that it lacks a bar in the lobby. Maybe that's unfair, though. If I could give it 4 and 3\/4 stars, I would. Bar or no bar, I definitely WOULD stay at The Lex again. It gets good reviews for a reason.\n\nP.S. - One of the hotel staff recommended Penelope's (Lexington Ave & 30th - maybe 5 min walk North) for breakfast, and it was outstanding.

Even better is to discuss what you want to do next and they are full of inside knowledge and helpful tips. The rooms are a bit on the small side but ours was ok. Let's face it, you should be spending maybe 12 or 15 hours a day out of the room visiting and eating, the other time just asleep in the hotel. Bathrooms are very modern. The whole hotel is very clean and well managed. Breakfast is 'sold' as grab and go. Just some juice, tea, coffee, pastries etc. in all that is enough as you want to hit those attractions early to avoid the worst of the queues. The hotel is quite literally a 5 minute walk from Empire State and what a lovely building that is to look at, super architecture.

It was the perfect base to explore one of our favourite parts of Manhattan (the Flatiron district) and to finish off our wedding prep. We loved how close the hotel is to Madison Square gardens and the famous Shake Shack. Very handy for a quick late night burger! \n\nThis is a very small hotel and the lobby is tiny, but for what The Lex lacks in lobby\/lounging space, it far makes up for in room space, service and amenities. We booked a 'cosy queen' room, expecting it to be a shoebox. We were very pleasantly surprised to find that it was modestly sized. There was enough space to leave our suitcases at the end of the bed, a wardrobe (I had no trouble hanging up my wedding dress), a desk and chair. There was also an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe.  Our room even had a balcony, with the Chrysler building peeking out behind the buildings! We were able to enjoy a few glasses of wine on our little terrace, which was fab.\n\nWe were told by reception that the cozy queen rooms are slightly different so we may have been lucky and had a slightly larger room. We have stayed at Pod39 before (a 3* hotel not far away) and the room was more expensive and far more claustrophobic. \n\nThe bathroom was also more spacious than we thought it would be - and everything was immaculately clean. This is a new hotel, but we couldn't fault the housekeeping.\n\nFree water was provided daily in our room - and we really appreciated this, especially as so many hotels charge $$ for it. Another bonus of staying at this hotel is that they include a free breakfast daily in their funky lobby area: little assorted pastries, fruit and filtered coffee and tea. It set us up for the day and we thought this was a lovely touch.\n\nThe WiFi was also included in the room rate - and we had a fast connection.\n\nThe highlight of our stay was receiving a lovely bottle of wine, packet of s'mores and a personal note written by staff to congratulate us on our upcoming wedding.  It is all these details and little thoughtful touches that made the Lex stand out for us.\n\nWe requested a mini fridge to be sent up to our room to store the wine, and this was at our door within minutes.\n\nFor what we paid to stay here ($225pn equivalent in pounds), you won't get better value or quality for your buck at any other New York hotel! We would recommend this hotel to family and friends without hesitation.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We decided before booking we would spend a little more on our hotel in New York having stayed in Iceland for a few days prior to our arrival. It didn't take long browsing through all the booking websites to find something in the right area at the right price. All the reviews about it being clean and having good service were spot on and so we didn't hesitate to book. The price was very reasonable compared to every other hotel that claimed to be of a similar standard too.\n\nUpon arrival we were greeted at the door check in was simple and straight forward and the staff were very informative and genuinely interested in our plans.\n\nWe got to our room, dropped off our luggage and got ready to head out and in that short time (10-15 minutes) The staff had printed off all the information and directions including subway trains to get to Coney Island.\n\nThey couldn't do enough for you, at breakfast the coffee was constantly topped up, if they ran out of anything they rushed out to replace it ensuring everyone was looked after.\n\nThe room was a lot more spacious than we anticipated and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. The bathroom was really clean and had everything you needed, towels, soaps, shampoos etc, constantly topped up so you never went without.\n\nWe used a couple of the suggestions for local restaurants and they were all spot on too.\n\nI cannot praise the staff at the hotel enough and will definitely look to stay there again. I've recommended it to friends who are looking to go New York and hopefully this review  will help any doubters too.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I drove in from Philly & found plenty of street parking for free both days (Sun & holiday) in the block next to The Lex. The front desk staff are VERY friendly & welcoming; its pretty no-frills (no bar, restaurant, gym) however they do include free wifi & a nice, fresh, breakfast of baked goods & coffee- in fact they'll bring you coffee & tea anytime you want. The rooms are decent sized for NYC & I loved the balcony (no view except neighbors thru the airshaft-but really relaxing) a balcony in NYC is a rare treat. The bed is comfy, bathroom large, modern w\/ nice smelling soaps & lotions. A 20 min walk to Chelsea to the south or Mid town theater district to the North. There a several very good restaurants nearby (Blu smoke-great!)- if you're into Indian food then you are in luck-I'm not a fan but so many people were waiting for the many places nearby that you should find something. Note that the scent of curry can be smelled even on the 6th floor when the balcony is open- it may bother some or be heaven to others.

Our room faced an old brick wall and iconic water tower but a balcony was a great design touch that prevented the room feeling blocked in and oppressive - making a feature of the quite typical rear view from many of this type of fill-in building in New York.

This is a newer hotel added within the past year so all furnishings were in excellent condition.  No coffee maker in room which I missed however it is has beautiful art deco functional rooms and my room was exceptionally clean.

It is clear they take pride in their service and reputation of the hotel. Our every need was taken care of. \n\nThe rooms were extremely clean and well maintained. We had a standard room facing Lexington Avenue and slept with the screened window open all night. We could definitely hear the city noise, however we enjoy the sounds of NYC and it doesn\u2019t keep us from sleeping.  \n\nThe location was perfect for us, as we wanted to concentrate on the lower portion of Manhattan exclusively and we enjoy staying in the quieter more residential neighborhoods. We appreciate the free Internet in the rooms and also appreciated the coffee and delicious croissants on the continental breakfast. It is a nice touch and more than we have received at other hotels.\n\nThis is definitely a no frills economical hotel with basic amenities, however they do a great job at maintaining a boutique atmosphere. The staff is excellent - some of the very best I have dealt with in my 15+ trips to NYC. Thank you for a comfortable and pleasant stay. I would highly recommend your hotel to my friends & family.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had booked a cheap room and were not expecting much considering how expensive it usually is to stay in New York.\n\nHowever, from the point we arrived at the hotel we knew we had made the right choice picking the Lex. The lobby area was clean and stylish, the personnel were extremely helpful and professional.\n\nOur room was small, which we knew already in advance, and it also happened to be on the 2nd floor with windows giving straight to Lexington Avenue. Surprisingly, we had no trouble with the street noise. The room was modern and they clearly have paid attention to sound insulation with their windows.\n\nEverything in the room was spotless, almost as if we had been the first guests there (I doubt that, but that's in how good condition everything was). We understand the hotel is brand new so only time will tell how well the rooms will age.\n\nThe breakfast was nice although quite limited. But hey, it was included in the price and we could just grab the pastries and a cup of coffee on our way out. That's 15-20 minutes saved, which was nice. They also had fresh fruits, which always feels nice in US where it feels difficult to eat healthy.\n\nThe WiFi in the hotel was complimentary and very fast when compared to many other possibilities. We measured over 10 Mbps speeds which made occasional browsing a blast.\n\nThe location is great. A bit away from the busiest midtown but still within walking distance to many places. The metro stations are just a couple of blocks away should you wish to get further away. The neighborhood seemed nice enough with lots of restaurants (especially Indian) nearby. There is also a Walgreens closeby and a small deli\/shop next doors in case you need to purchase any personal items, snacks, water etc.\n\nThe air conditioner was modern and efficient. The \"quiet\" mode was quiet enough not to disturb our sleep.\n\nThe only nitpicking we could come up with was the poor sound insulation in the walls between rooms. We could very clearly hear the neighbors have their intimate moments during nights, and all the talking during the mornings could be easily heard to our room. So not much privacy there and ear plugs can get handy. Also if you travel with small children, you might want to take this into account if you don't want to explain them why the woman next doors is not in trouble despite the loud screaming.\n\nNevertheless, given the price, cleanliness, location, breakfast, free wifi and professional & friendly service, I can wholeheartedly recommend the hotel.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was in NYC for a week on business.  I got a great deal on the room, so I was very happy about that.  \n\nThe room was clean, the sheets were a very nice, soft and crisp white cotton.  The bed was comfortable, not too soft, not too hard.  Yes, I am fussy.   The bathroom was spectacular, nice tile, very modern, and came complete with some pretty fantastic products.  \n\nThere is a free breakfast, which included coffee, tea, juice, doughnuts, muffins and some pretty good croissants.  I think there was some yogurt, but I am dairy free, so I didn't eat that.  Too much sugar and not enough protein for me, but it was nice to start with coffee and the nice, fresh croissant.  \n\nThe location was superb for my needs, close to the subway, and there were some excellent dining options nearby.  There were a few cute little thrift stores a couple of blocks away, and a fab breakfast\/brunch place a few blocks up on Lexington.  And, I might add, within walking distance to some great shopping!  \n\nWhat stood out for me at The Lex was the staff.  Everyone at the hotel was absolutely friendly, and I felt that they went out of their way to be helpful.   I had to scan some documents, and they did that for me at the front desk.  \n\nI highly recommend the hotel.  I enjoyed my stay, and would stay there again.","travelDate":"2014-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

As a new hotel, it is very clean and the decor is nice and modern. However, the best thing about the hotel is the staff. We had a number of questions that needed answering regarding local travel, places to eat, the Citi Bike's and many others, and no matter who was on the desk, they helped us with an answer. They were truly nice people who genuinely cared about our stay in the city, which was a nice thing. Also served was a small, free, continental breakfast in the lobby, which was a lovely bonus.

I asked for a quiet room, and got one away from the elevator in the back of the building. It was on the second floor, with a \"terrace\" that was basically the bottom of a shaft. Nevertheless, it was quiet. \n\nThe room itself was very, very tight, but I felt that the designers made the best use of the space. Ceiling height was great, which made it much less claustrophobic. I believe I had a standard queen room, and it is really suitable only for 1 person to stay in. I would go insane with another person. Everything was brand new, and I loved the floor to ceiling headboard for the bed. It really classed up the room, even though the rest of it was pretty blah.\n\nThe most outstanding feature of my room by far was the bathroom. It was pretty incredible, almost as big as the bedroom itself. The floor was a really nice wood-look tile, and there was plenty of counter space. The black and white tiling looked sexy and chic and classic all at the same time. The tub surround was entirely tiled in black, which I usually would not have liked, but again due to the ceiling height, as well as the fairly wide tub, it wasn't an issue. Shower pressure was fantastic.\n\nUnfortunately, when it came time to sleep, I discovered the shortcomings. The A\/C was extremely loud, and the auto setting only allowed it to go off for about 2 minutes for every 10 minutes of on. That it was unable to maintain 70 degrees in a room no larger than 200 square feet was pretty silly. And then on top of that, the bed was just not that comfortable. Perhaps I am too spoilt by pillowtops - although I did not look to confirm, it definitely did not feel like I was sleeping on a pillowtop mattress. \n\nI skipped breakfast, but did notice that it was a simple spread in the small lobby on my way out. I really wanted to like my stay here, and was hoping that I would discover a new goto boutique hotel, but I did not get a very comfortable night's sleep. Having said that, if the hotel is able to fix or replace the a\/c units, I can probably be convinced to try it again.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There is small waiting area and I was shocked to find my mother sitting on the couch sleeping when I return at 4pm after no one called as I was promised to let me know about room availability over an hour before.   It did not look good.\n\nAlso, when I called I was told our view will be facing Boruk College building which sounded exciting instead we were facing the walls all around the window.  I cannot travel afar because of my disability and Manhattan has become my vacation destination.  Since we are locals we do not do much sight seeing and spend half of time in the room, enjoying the hotel, the view from the room and hotel's facilities.  In this case this was a complete disaster having to pay for the most expensive room in the hotel that looked like being berried in the whole.\n\nOn the other hand the entire stuff was outstanding, friendly, not too much in your way and most of all displayed excellent team work effort.  Being in their company felt like being with friends.  Even tourists were friendly.\n\nThe continental breakfast was excellent, not too much choices, but just enough to fuel up for the day ahead or to grab it on the go. Coffee, variety of croissants, fruits, milk. assorted teas.  Most of all, the freshest croissants and muffins we ever ate.  \n\nI and my best friend enjoyed Madison Sq Park - my 2nd favorite after Central Park in NYC and I finally got to eat in the famous Shake shack explaining to my mother that the long line was part of the entertaining attraction :) \n\nThe property lobby is not large, but cozy and very modern.  We loved everything about the room except the view from the room which made the room dark and depressing.\n\nThis is very beautiful property and in excellent location.  My advice is if you book the room with two queen size beds speak to the manger not to the stuff member to guarantee you don't get to spend your vacation in New York in the basement that is if you care about seeing the sky from your window.  On the other hand If you plan on using the room only to sleep in then it is ideal choice for it is quit, dark with no outside noise.\n      ","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We very much appreciated the soft new towels to come back to. \nThe staff were friendly and helpful and one member of staff went out of his way to hail us a cab as we struggled to do so in the street outside. \nThe location of the hotel was good - only 2 blocks from a subway station and close to Madison Square park. The hotel is not exactly in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan but it doesn't take long at all to get to the major places of interest. \nWe enjoyed breakfast every morning with a selection of pastries, muffins and fruits. I recognise that breakfast is complimentary however I think that a jug of fresh fruit juice such as orange or apple juice would not have gone a miss. For someone that doesn't drink coffee, this would have been appreciated. \nJust a tip for potential future guests - it was actually cheaper to pay for the room directly through the hotel rather than using any online hotel room booking services. \n\nThankyou The Lex for a great stay. We will most definitely stay with you again as the value for money tops most other New York hotels. I believe your hotel will soar to one of the very top hotels in New York on Trip advisor in not too long.","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Before I went, I read reviews that it could be noisy, and being a light sleeper, I asked for a quiet room. All 9 nights I was there on the highest floor, I was never disturbed be it by hotel guests or traffic outside. During the day, you can hear occupants in the next room on their tele-conferences quite clearly, but at night, it is very quiet. If I could rank the things I found impressive about this place it would be first and foremost the professionalism and warmth of the staff, the cleanliness of the room and the comfort of the bed, and hotel location.

La stanza era pulita, moderna, con un bel bagno nuovo, accessoriata di tutto il necessario come in un Hotel di categoria superiore, compreso ferro e asse da stiro. Il nostro viaggio si \u00e8 svolto alla fine di maggio, quindi dopo il freddo e prima del caldo. \nL'unico reale difetto dell'Hotel \u00e8 l'impianto di climatizzazione in camera, troppo rumoroso e poco regolabile nella potenza del flusso. Se fosse stata estate o inverno sarebbe stato un problema, non solo per il rumore, ma anche per la turbolenza d'aria che si crea nella stanza (molto piccola come la maggior parte delle stanze d'albergo a NY). Nel nostro caso abbiamo potuto tenerlo spento, quindi tutto \u00e8 andato bene. \nNon c'\u00e8 una sala colazione, che \u00e8 servita sul bancone all'ingresso della Hall e bisogna pazientare un po' che si liberi qualche posto, ma considerando che si tratta di un tre stelle e che, contrariamente a quanto di solito succede a NY, offre la colazione, va bene cos\u00ec. Troverete giusto qualche croissant, frutta, latte e caff\u00e8. Non aspettatevi un'american breakfast, ma va bene comunque per partire alla scoperta della citt\u00e0. Per il resto l'Hotel \u00e8 molto pulito, la posizione \u00e8 buona, vicino alla metro e a molte attrazioni raggiungibili a piedi. Il personale di reception \u00e8 pronto a dare buoni consigli per qualunque esigenza.\nUn'avvertenza per i soggetti sensibili, e non attribuibile in alcun modo all'Hotel: Manhattan \u00e8 infestata dai ratti che spesso, alla sera, fanno capolino fra i sacchi della spazzatura che vengono lasciati (qui come nella 5th Avenue!) per il ritiro sui marciapiedi vicino all'ingresso!","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":6201200,"title":"Clean, Modern room wth Excellent Service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-06-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"The Lex hotel has only recently openned and is on Lexington Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets. \n\nFirst of all, location -  It is about a mile and a half from Times Square and all of the attractions there, making it a $10-$15 cab ride (including tip) or 45-50 min walk away.  The Lex is also right next to the Number 6 line (lesss than 5 min walk away) which can take you straight to Grand Central Station, downtown to the Brooklyn Bridge or uptown to Central Park and Museum Row.  So while it may seem a little out of the way it really isn't once you learn to get around. Additionally, there are plenty of restaraunts located nearby and if you are a fan of Curry this place is right next to Little India so you can take your pick of about 10-15 different Indian restaraunts.  Finally if you want a good Espresso, Stix Cafe is just up and around the corner on 23rd Street.\n\nNext, the Room - The room is small but that is apparently the way it is in New York City.  Having said that it is modern, clean and well appointed.  The Bed is of a good standard and the 40\" Samsung LCD in the room means that staying in, for what ever reason, is pretty comfortable.  The bathroom is also in great condition with a very good shower (with half size tub) and well appointed basin. Here they have also made good use of space so you don't feel like you are shuffling around and making it quite easy to get yourself ready for your time travelling around New York.\n\nFinally, the hotel and staff.  The Hotel itself is fairly basic, there is no hotel restaurant, fitness room or any other type of ammenity.  It has a lobby that is easily accessable from the street, and always manned, and your room - that is it.  But if you just need somewhere to stay in New York that is all you need.  The hotel does do Breakfast in the lobby every morning , where you can get a cup of coffee and a pastry, and also does  welcome drinks on a Tuesday night.. \n\nThis brings me to the best thing about this hotel - the Staff. The staff were attentive, informative, friendly and ever ready to help.  If you need advice on anything New York they are happy to provide;  every time you come back from your travels around the city they are there to welcome you back; and if you need help or anything is lacking in your room, they fix it immediately.  I cannot emphasise enough how good they were.  \n\nOverall this is an Excellent boutique hotel - you get a great room, with great service at a great price.  You need to work a little to get around but once you have it sorted it is easy.  This is not the Ritz, so you don't get a heap of other ammenities, but I found it to be a great place to base myself for a week exploring NYC.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}
