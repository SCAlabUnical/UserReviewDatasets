The location can\u2019t be beat, we booked this hotel because of the close proximity to radio city music hall. We came for a family trip to see the rockettes, the first time for all of us. We went to the 8pm show and then walked around to see the light show at Saks after the show. When we returned to the room, we were all very tired. After getting ready for bed, we turned down our bedding and the sheets had clearly not been changed from the previous guests because there was hair and fuzz all over our sheets. I then turned down the bedding of our children\u2019s bed and again there was fuzz, a sticker from a piece of fruit and hair. I have never had this experience before at a hotel. We called down to speak to a manager and they had offered to change our room but with it being almost midnight we declined, the Manager sent someone up to change our bedding. I believe his name was Joseph, he was very apologetic and friendly. We helped him make the beds because of the time of night and our kids were exhausted. The next morning I spoke with another manager who really didn\u2019t apologize but just said she could assure me they don\u2019t get many complaints and offered me an upgrade with my next stay. I explained that I am sure If this is done with my room I am sure It isn\u2019t the first time. Please check your sheets when checking in. She did ultimately give us a credit for breakfast and waived the resort fee for our troubles. It\u2019s just very troubling to have this experience in a hotel.

One elevator went down when we were there and there are no stairs for guest use as the concierge explains it\u2019s for safety. I did check the map in our room to ensure there was a plan with stairs in case of emergency to exit. They have a menu for dining on the tv which was not updated.

Some are really lavish, while others are cozy and charming. It turns out that I stayed at the Omni more than three times throughout the first half of the year. It should go without saying why I returned to the same hotel, but my receipts show it. \n\nThe Omni has set itself apart from a number of hotels I have visited over the years, from its classic modern stylings to its iconic TikTok doorman. Luxe hotels are the new \"it\" thing, with never-before-seen amenities and experiences, but nothing beats a classic. You know you're in the presence of something exceptional the instant you step through the revolving doors and enter the elegant and gorgeous foyer submerged in white marble lined with gold trims and wood accents. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and attentive. They are always willing to \"figure things out\" and are helpful and accommodating. \n\nI've been in \"smaller\" rooms as well as the grand suite. It's the same every time... I feel at home. And, no, I don't have a \"home\/house\" as the amazing photographs of the Omni show. Each room's stylings were modest in nature and without pretentiousness. It wasn't attempting to be something it wasn't. \n\nMy most recent stay was my favorite. It was a gift for my birthday. We Leos have huge personalities and much bigger demands. So my wife booked us into the large suite. My wife, by the way, is a Leo too. Needless to say, it was fantastic. We had several friends and family around for a night on the town which started in our room. There were no problems. It seemed as though we had the entire hotel to ourselves. Great memory.\n\nTo be seen for who you are and your character speaks volumes in this day and age. The Omni team knew me... supported me as a returning guest, and provided me with the sense of security that you provide to all visitors. \n\nThe Omni on Madison Avenue is a New York City institution, conveniently located near sights such as St. Patrick's Cathedral, Time Square, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue, Central Park, and Park Avenue.

It was a lovely touch and it pushed this property to the very top of our list. We live 1.5 hours from the city and visit very often and tend to stay at different hotels, to try them out. We were very pleased with the level of service (thank you Maria at the Front Desk for all your help and patience!), from the front desk to the bellmen, and helping by attending to my request made prior to my stay asking for a tea kettle for my room as I tend to like to have it available as a heavy tea drinker.\n\nOne of the nicest things is the 17th floor terrace open to all, from there you can see St. Pats.\n\nAlso, the upgraded room we selected (Premier Skyline King - 12th floor and above) after booking with a AAA rate, was fantastic! Love the space, the temperature of the room, bed, pillows, bathroom and especially the location, it was so quite despite being on 52nd street! \n\nLove Love Love this property! The location smack dap in the middle of midtown, across and a bit down the street from Cartier (as an example of how close to the bustle it is) and around the corner basically from St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\nWell done! You and your crew should be proud.\n\nWe are now proud members of your rewards club and hope to return often (Which I recommend to acquire two drink vouchers at the restaurant per stay).

I knew this was my place. \nIt\u2019s 1 minute walk either street for most metro lines, you\u2019ll walk to Times Square in under 10 minutes. \nThe staff are amazing, not your run of the mill staff in most hotels in New York. Usually you just get checked in, charged extortionate resort fees and never speak again. Not here. All the staff were so friendly I even had a chat with Seth about football. I thought my knowledge was good, his was way better. \nThe minute you get out of the elevator you\u2019re greeted by Mary or Kevin who want to do everything to help you. \nI mentioned to Kevin one day I was thinking of walking the Brooklyn bridge and he gave me exact directions of where to get the best pictures and the quickest way to get there. What a professional. \nOne night we came down in the lift and thinking of maybe doing a show. We met Mary at the desk and our show and dinner were booked in seconds. She was a queen. \nCould not recommend this hotel highly enough, we were treated so well from check in to check out, I need to mention Willy the doorman here because he got us a cab at such a busy time and brought our bags to the cab for us.  \nMy 8th,9th and 10th time visiting the greatest city in the world I\u2019ll be staying here.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

They use the guest's name, they acknowledge status, they engage in polite chat but are also efficient.   \n\nThe housekeeping staff are clearly stretched thin but are polite and efficient.  When I returned from the office at 6 pm my first day my room hadn't been serviced but a maid knocked on the door as I was leaving for dinner at 6:15.  Cleaning was limited: my sheets didn't appear to be changed at all during my five-night stay, carpet wasn't vacuumed, but things were tidied.  At least it's something.  \n\nFitness room is actually pretty decent but equipment is jumbled.  Most noticeable was that staff clearly didn't even check the room for days at a time - several used towels were strewn in the same spots for several days before finally being picked up.  equipment was never arranged - dumbbells were never put back on the rack, bosu balls were all over.  Again, staff clearly didn't pay attention.\n\nI was in a basic king-bed room facing the interior so I assume the entry-level room.  It had clearly been refreshed - looked like fresh paint, carpet and TV.  furniture isn't new but was in good condition.  Bathroom was small but nicely arranged - looks like it was redecorated about 15 years ago.  HVAC is a joke - like most NYC hotels in the winter you can't actually make the room cooler, it's always going to be warm; the numbers on the thermostat are just there to entertain you.  Oh, and pet peeve: NO COFFEE MAKER (or refrigerator) IN THE ROOM!!!  And in a hotel with no room service and no free coffee in the lobby, this is a no-go for me.  \n\nThe attached bar\/restaurant was a real let down.  I wanted to have dinner solo one evening but they wouldn't seat me in the dining area and pointed me to the bar.  The bar was packed most evenings and I never saw anyone checking vaccination status (required by NYC law and, uh, logic).  Since there's no coffee maker in the room (see above) I hoped I could just walk in the morning and grab a paper cup to go - nah.  This is another huge turnoff for me.\n\nOverall, convenient location, good staff, OK room and gym, but lack of room amenities and lack of dining option means I'll avoid the Omni on future visits.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This is why my review is very honest as I am hoping to help other people deciding if this hotel is good enough for their needs. Why? Bc this hotel might be OK for an American citizen coming for a 1-2 days business but not OK for turists or a couple. Well I was quite disappointment rather than satisfied. This hotel provided a bed, roof over my head, shower, toiletaries INCLUDING quetips\/swab and towels. What I was very disappointed in was that the room had NO complimentary water nor tea nor coffee like the rest of the worlds hotels has. Even 2 star hotel have such needs so this is why I will give this hotel 3 stars. I called the receptionist and I asked for tea and they brought to my room 1 teabag, 1 lemon slice, a spoon of honey and a bill charged 7 USD for this tea. I had no option but to pay and was hoping it would be a magical tea but it wasn\u2019t. It was not possible to open any window so I would leave the AC on around 75 F\/24 C. Every night my throat would get so dry and I was missing drinking water hence why I ordered the tea. Very annoying that I had to deal with that for the 5 days I was staying! Breakfast was really expensive too so it would pay better off to get ubereat or find some other place. I had 1 XL bathrobe for 2 people staying in my room. When I asked for a size small I was told they had only one size so I guess it is made for an average american size. Hotel is great walking distance to most things but I found out it would be better to stay in East Village as most nice events were happening there. Cleaning lady was very pleasant! I did not see why they had hired 2 men to stand by the entrance 24\/7 but wouldn\u2019t open the 2 heavy doors you had to pass to enter\/leave even for a lady like me.

It's an easy walk for business and sites such as MOMA (about 2 blocks away). Central Park is about a half-mile away. I walked to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but it's about 1.5 miles along 5th Avenue. I enjoyed the walk, but you could easily take an cab\/Uber\/Lyft.\n\nMy room was modern and clean. It was smaller than hotels I've had elsewhere, but that's pretty much true of any hotel in New York. There were ample plugs at the desk for my phone, computer, etc. They have Internet included in the rate if you become an Omni rewards member (which doesn't cost anything). You can upgrade speeds for a fee, but I found the standard speed fine for reading emails.\n\nThe staff was pleasant both at check in and when I spoke later on a logistics issue.\n\nWe had a fire alarm go off, apparently for technical reasons, at 3 a.m. I would view that as an aberration.\n\nThere is no coffee maker in the room. You might be able to get coffee at the restaurant downstairs. I'm not sure of how common this is of other New York hotels, but I would have liked a cup to start my day in my room.\n\nThis is a nice, well-located hotel and would make a good choice if you are in New York for business or pleasure.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The concierge were extremely helpful on a number of occasions. The adjoining restaurant Bobs has a bar which is quite pricey but this was expected in central New York. Location is great, close to the main attractions and also a metro station which was easy to use. The only downside was the city tax we were required to pay (around $35 per night) so it is worth being aware of this before booking as it can increase the overall cost by quite a large amount if you are staying for a few nights. Although, we had researched this and understand it is standard across city centre hotels. Overall a good base for a busy few days in New York City. ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It doesn't have the grand lobby and the rooms were not particularly luxurious, but they were clean, comfortable and well-appointed, and the service was excellent.  \n\nWe were on the 4th floor overlooking 52nd Street, and did not have any problem with noise. I saw one comment about waiting for elevators - we did not find them to be slow, and also note that there are two banks of elevators on either side of the lobby, maybe 50 feet apart, so it should not be an issue.  The rooms are nicely done, although showing their age a bit.  Bed was very comfortable.  There was only one bathrobe in the room, so I requested another, not knowing my husband had also asked - we ended up with four robes!  Also couldn't figure out how to reset the time on the clock, so they ended up replacing it with a newer one, which was nice as it had USB outlets on it as well.  They do have electrical outlets at each bedside, which I always appreciate.  There is no coffee maker in the room, but if you sign up for their free loyalty program they will deliver your choice of beverage each morning.  There's also an umbrella in the room, which came in handy one day.\n\nBob's is a good restaurant, we had breakfast there a couple of times, as well as a nice steak dinner and, another night, a light meal in the bar.

The furniture is okay, although the TV only has two movie channels but you can Chromecast to it from your cell phone.

The service was good, most of the staff was friendly, and the entire hotel was very clean.  The best thing about this hotel was the location, at 52nd off Madison, which was a long walk away (or short Lyft\/Uber) from Times Square, Radio Center, Ed Sulivan Theater, and NBC Studios, but the immediate surroundings were a step up from these notably busier streets.  We had one notable problem while there, with the heat in our room. The first night it was fine, second night it blew only cold air.  Staff responded within an hour and attempted to fix it. Then it started only blowing continuous hot air regardless of the thermostat setting. We finally cut it off entirely and did not call for a second repair.

Check-in was a snap, though it was a Wednesday afternoon in fall and probably not their busiest time. My daughter was given a welcome gift at check-in (a bag with cards, games) that she was pleased to receive. We had a King Room and it was surprisingly spacious for a NYC hotel. The room was clean, well-lit and pleasant. We both slept well on the very comfortable bed and the shower had really great water pressure. The hotel also delivered cookies and milk before bed. The room felt like a luxury after other stays I've had in NYC. I did sign up for the Select Guest Program at no cost so I could have free wifi. It was our first stay as a Select Guest, so some of the amenities may have been tied to that program membership.\nIn the morning, leaving our luggage with the bellhops for the day was very easy. \nEvery employee we interacted with was professional, warm and helpful. \nThe location is superb. You aren't on a main thoroughfare, but you are steps away from many attractions and the bus and subway (E,M). It's a fairly short walk to\/from Grand Central. Rockefeller Center, Radio City and all the Fifth Avenue shops are nearby and you can walk to\/from Broadway shows along Times Square. We visited the Met and the American Museum of Natural History easily, choosing to walk one way to the AMNH through Central Park.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The room is huge for NY standard.  However they definitely need to do major updating; sound proofing their windows & doors.  I could hear my neighbors slam their doors all night long.  On top of that, the bed was stiff and the pillow was flat.  I think it is time they update their beds.  And worse of all, I was on the 15th floor.  From 7AM on, I heard so much street noise, from cars honking... but the worse of it all, the construction nearby the hotel.  I could hear drilling and hammering from 7 AM until the time I checked out.  I was so stressed from the noise that I had to make a complaint to Expedia.  This is not acceptable.  I even have proof as I recorded the street noise with the windows closed from the 15th floor.  I was facing Madison Ave and below me, there was no construction.  Again, I am a New Yorker, I have stayed in many hotels to relax, I was so stressed after leaving this hotel, I took myself to a spa.  If you need to hear the video, I am please to sent it your way.  Paying $300 a night for this rubbish is not worth it.  I stayed in the heart of Time Square and I never heard noise pollution like I had in this hotel.  Use your money wisely and go somewhere else.  CitizenM is good or spend a little more Park Terrace.  Please, these old school hotels need to refurbish.  I will never stay at an Omni again.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Berkshire Place seemed perfect for our four night city break hence the booking. Checkin was again very pleasant and efficient. There was a slight discrepancy with our booking reservation but staff indicated they would get our room changed at first light the following day. And indeed they did this. The gentleman who sorted us was Tsering if I recall correctly. He moved us efficiently to another room and kept us abreast of the slight delay in the change the next day. Expertly done as expected. The room was quite spacious for my little kiddo and me. Two double beds. The beds were really comfortable and ensured a great rest every night. The bathroom was a fair size too - often in NYC they are tiny. And two closets were perfect for us. Plenty of ironing stiff and spare towels and pillow cases. My only gripe with Omni is there are no coffee making facilities - yet as a designated Omni guests one gets complimentary coffee or orange juice in the morning anyway so that makes up for it. The concierge was on hand for excellent advice on more than one occasion - and always with a big genuine smile too. A welcome change in the hotel world these days. It\u2019s unfortunately check out day today - but we are already planning when we will return.

They served a very good cup of breakfast tea and a vast selection of food, hot selection (eggs, bacon, pancakes), plus bagels, muffins, fruit, yoghurt.  We also ate dinner there on our first night, which was very good.\n\nCheckout was at 12.00 and we were able to leave our cases in the hotel during the day until our return to the airport.\n\nWe would definitely stay at the Omni again if we return to New York.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"NONE"}

So we had a room you couldn\u2019t look out of and no water in room on arrival. The budget hotels we stayed at welcomed us with iced bottled water at reception and free tea coffee and at one free hot cookies.

The bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping excellent, so those were big positives.  \n\nBut compared to the other two hotels there was no USB sockets in room, no water, no fridge, no tea or coffee, the shower leaked and the bathroom door was sticking.  The price of food and drinks and breakfast was also extremely high but that isn\u2019t so unusual in this area. However, no matter where in the world you come from $14 for french fries plus a required $5 a person for room service delivery plus around 20% tip surely makes this hotel win the dearest fries award.

I am a fairly independent traveler, but some trips go much better when you have help from a concierge (what I just described was London for $650\/night).   Given how much is going on in NYC, the concierges here are very valuable and there are several of them & they're 10 feet across from the elevator.  Everything I asked them was answered in seconds and answered correctly...unlike the London situation. \n\nThe only downside to this hotel is for noise-sensitive people. I thought the interior courtyard-facing rooms were going to be quiet, but you still get a lot of the siren noises of NYC and the ambulance honking...maybe some car honking, even though the street is beyond another building altogether.  (You're just facing office windows).  Internally, there are some strange things going on with noise that other reviews mentioned.  The AC unit can be loud.  If you don't care, then ignore this - the rest of the hotel is good & the bed is comfortable.  They even squeezed a fairly decent gym in here.\n\nThe location matters because cabs take longer than walking in many cases.  The subway is also a much better option, and the concierge can tell you what subway to take most of the time (they stops are close to the hotel).  Almost everything I wanted to do could be reached by the subway or on foot.  The only thing about this area is that the restaurants can be overpriced for what you get because it is a very expensive location where the food isn't great.  So I had some disappointing meals on my trip because I was often eating nearby, particularly near the theaters.  When I ate elsewhere, it was much better.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

So as you can see, no real complaints here, but there just wasn't anything outstanding or above average.  The lobby was not at all inviting, but the hotel location was super convenient in MidTown. From the pictures, I mistakenly thought there was a rooftop bar, but there is a rooftop patio, with a view of the church and a few chairs and they let you order room service to that location, but it's not really a destination.   I'd stay here again if someone else was paying for it or there was some super deal on price.  For the same price or less, I've preferred other hotels with interesting people-watching lobbies or some modern decorating scheme, or some over the top service touches.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I do agree with others that there is a slight smell in reception and also our room did not smell fresh. We booked the hotel through BA in a package deal. On arrival we were asked for our credit card. It was not explained that they would put a holding charge of $75 on there. I had to query this when we noticed it after a couple of days. We were told that this would be released within 48 hours of checking out. This has still not been released, so i am very unhappy about this. I do think that this should have been explained to us on check in and not just taken. I had emailed the hotel before arrival to let them know that we were celebrating our daughter's birthdays of 18 & 21 this year. They would not offer us a free upgrade, we would have to pay nor could we join the select membership because of the booking being done with BA. They did however still provide us with free wifi and 2 free drinks every morning, which was a lovely touch. They also sent some prosecco and cake up to our room for our daughter's. So i have mixed feelings about this hotel. The room was clean and was cleaned every day, but there was a strange smell in there. The beds were comfy and we were on the 9th floor so it was quiet. The staff were lovely and friendly too, so i can't fault any of them to be honest. Would i stay there again? No i don't think so.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

From the moment I called to make the reservation, to the time we left, our experience at this location did not disappoint. When I called Reservations, the Reservation Specialist kindly reminded me that we qualified for a \"free\" night which I didn't realize (so I was thankful for that). She helped me book a basic level inside room. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to a very nice and quite comfortable one bedroom suite with a view of St. Patrick's Cathedral, and with big THANKS to Cindy at the hotel, we were treated to a complimentary bottle of Champagne, Chocolate Covered Strawberries, and a Cheese & Fruit Platter that was delivered to our Suite, complete with a personalized HAND WRITTEN note wishing us a Happy Anniversary. We were blown away, it was all such a nice personal touch and something we won't soon forget. Everyone from the gentlemen at the Concierge Desk who assisted us with dinner reservation recommendations, to the Doorman and Bellhop guys who were extremely friendly and helpful with our luggage and made sure we got the discount sticker to self-park our car, to the staff at the Front Desk (and to Kevin (?) who happily extended our check-out time), and the Waiter in the hotel restaurant that served us breakfast, were all just simply on their A-Game and delivered top notch customer service from the moment we arrived right up until the minute we left...Although our stay at the Omni Berkshire NYC location only lasted twenty-four hours, the professional level of quality service the entire staff delivered, left us with a memorable experience that helped make our anniversary weekend more special and one that we will remember for years to come.

We booked a premium executive king. The room was large for NY standards with good size bathroom. This is where the good stops....\n\nThe hallway had a strange smell, possibly marujana. The room despite the descripition by Omni had no robes, slippers , bottled water or ipod docking station.\n\nThe bathroom had complimentary toiletries, these were not restocked when used, nor was the bottled water.\n\nThe concierge was located directly in front of the elevators, they never made eye contact or asked if we needed anything.\n\nThe curtains did not meet in the room and had to be clipped together each night to keep out the light.\n\nOn checking out (yes ut was 3.15am) but we were not even asked if eveything was ok. \n\nSo compared to previous stays at the Shoreham and Parker House this was poor. So we've left NY  disheartened and when we do come back we know not to stay at Berkshire Place.\n\nOne note of thanks, the doormen and bell men were always friendly and welcoming.\n\nAfter going back to reception asking for robes they were delivered but did not smell fresh.\n\nAs we are loyalty members we were given vouchers for a morning drink.\n","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

First of all the location of the hotel is fantastic - steps to 5th Ave.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The decor and overall feel of the hotel for me is that of slightly faded but very comfortable; this isn't a 5 star hotel so little things like the shampoos etc in the bathroom are provided but not what I would call high-end.  Some of the paint is a little scuffed.  Its just a little bit tired.  But that was fine with us, because our room and indeed most of the hotel was quiet and peaceful which we weren't expecting based on the location.  We treated ourselves to a suite and having that extra space was a REAL luxury.  The bed was gigantic, and two huge flatscreen TVs one in the bedroom and one in the lounge.  The bathroom was big.  The suite overlooked an internal courtyard well not really a courtyard, an outside space - the only natural light we got bounced in off the other buildings but it was light enough and so so so quiet.  We got breakfast from Isadora's across the street, perfect.  One night we ate at Bob's downstairs, very good.  The hotel was a welcome retreat at the end of each day and we could not fault the comfort and peacefulness.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location was great and the room was fine.The shower was fabulous! What would have been a positive experience was overshadowed, however, by the obscene cost of food in the restaurant. There is no coffee available in the room or hotel lobby for hotel guests to enjoy, so guests are directed to the attached restaurant (Bob's Steak and Chophouse) where guests are charged for coffee (Each cup costs either $6 --it went on my room bill, so I didn't know the cost until I ate at the restaurant the next day.) The day we were leaving, we went to the restaurant for breakfast, as it was early on a Sunday morning and nothing else was open. That's when we really felt like suckers. There was no breakfast menu displayed, and there is none online. (There is a dinner menu online, but it does not include prices.) Once we sat down and got our menues, we were horrified to see that everything on the menu cost more than $25! Omelets cost $28, and other breakfast prices were comparable. The total bill for two cups of coffee, a mediocre omelet, and an order of yogurt with granola was over $80.They had even added in a tip, with no option to change it. The whole experience left us feeling as if the hotel had taken advantage of its guests. I realize the restaurant is not run by the hotel, but that is the source of room service and morning coffee, so there is clearly a relationship. At the very least, coffee for hotel guests should be available--and free. I won't stay at the Omni again, since we like to stay at hotels where breakfast is available. It's available at the Omni, but we're not willing to be gouged again.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had booked via the app HotelTonight and then upon check in we had an option to upgrade our room and we decided to do that.    However, it was raining a lot and our room 1822 began to leak from the ceiling overnight and into the morning and the water went into the closet and onto some of our clothing.   The hotel staff members that we interacted with were all very helpful in getting us all moved to another room (1618).   We were really pleased with their service and helpfulness.   Due to the ceiling leak and time lost due to having to deal with that, the hotel made it right by refunding us the upgrade fees as well as their daily \"activity fee\" (or whatever it was called).    The size of both rooms that we had was very spacious for NYC standards, in my opinion, as well as the bathroom.  I felt that everything was very clean and the bathroom was inviting and not creepy like in some hotels.    It ended up that our credit card got charged for something it shouldn't have, but the hotel continued to help us when I called them to get it resolved.   Thank you to Francesca, Elvira, Claudia, and Jasmine for all your help and making our stay a great one.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The lobby is beautiful, with lots of seating. Front desk personnel are very professional and treat guests like family. My room was on the 15th floor (1501) and it was very clean (a pretty good-sized room). Beds were very comfortable, big TV, and nice bathroom. Only negative about the bathroom is that there\u2019s no exhaust fan so after a shower, it can get quite hot and humid. Not a big deal though, just a heads up. Housekeeping did a great job as well. A lot of outlets in the room which was a plus. Bob\u2019s restaurant for breakfast (connected to the hotel) was very good. I absolutely loved the outdoor terrace on the 17th floor overlooking St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral... a very nice place to just relax and socialize. The balcony also has heated panels so when it is cold out, it is not as harsh which is great. A very airy fitness center also on the 17th floor. I stay at an Omni property whenever I can.

Rooms were typically high, but there were some decent deals to be had on the unnamed hotel bargain sites which is where I made my booking for a very reasonable rate.\n\nUpon arrival after an early-morning flight, I was very happy that my room was available for early check-in.  The elevators looked old but moved quite well.  The hallways seemed a bit dated, but also seemed clean.  The room itself was a king bed, next to the ice room, overlooking the AC unit in the middle of the building.  The room consisted of a king bed, desk, nightstand, lamp, chair, TV, and closet with safe along with a standard bathroom.  The desk had a bit of wear but otherwise seemed clean.  The rest of the room also felt clean and I applaud the house-keeping team.  The bathroom was decent sized, though there was a white floor rug that couldn't really fit in the room without getting bunched up under the shutting door.\n\nBeing a room on the inside rather than on the street, I didn't really have many noise complaints.  Except for the person occasionally hacking in the next room, noise was not an issue.  On the final night of our stay, there was an occasional overwhelming smell of pot smoke in our hallway and creeping into our room, but it did not linger for long.\n\nLocation was pretty good.  There were plenty of good cafes and restaurants in the area as well as a drug store the next block over for snack and drink items.  The theater district was very walkable, though the subway was also convenient.\n\nUpon check-in, I was advised that there would be a $75 hold on my card.  I was not advised that there would be a $25\/day resort fee that would be charged, nor was I advised as to what amenities that resort fee opened up for me.  I suppose I used the internet, but I was otherwise disappointed at the \"value\" granted by these fees.  At least at other hotels in Manhattan with a resort fee I've stayed at, some \"store credit\" was given for the on-site cafe or restaurant or, at the very least, was told about the charge and was provided a list of things the charge included.  I was not even told about the charge upon check-out ... I was waved out with the staff member noted I had prepaid.  I'm assuming the $57 charge on my credit card includes even more tax on the resort fee since I have yet to see a receipt.\n\nNote: This hotel does allow dogs.  This was not a big issue for me, though there were some delinquent pet owners during my stay that I observed letting their dog poop in the lobby.  Not quite a classy welcome home.  Perhaps part of the resort fee is dog doo removal.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The one restaurant on site is a Steak Bar where you can get a beer and a glass of red wine for a mere $30! We had breakfast in a cafe around the corner, where interestingly we bumped into half of the other hotel guests.\nFinally there is a $25 Amenity fee charge 'PER DAY' allegedly to cover the costs of the 'hotel facilities' interesting, as there were none that we found, and we certainly didn't use any. We were told at 'check out' that this was supposed to cover the cost of the WiFi yet when we tried to connect we were warned of a further $14.99 fee, so didn't bother. So being charged an extra $75 Dollars felt very unfair.\nI'd love to tell you the staff were great too, but as we hardly interacted with any of them, I cant. Also Hotel sent us to the Airport in an unlicensed cab, think it was one of the Bell Boys 'mates'! \nSo all this makes it sound as though we were unhappy, but overall the Hotel was fine, it just lacked soul, and very simple things like the ability to make yourself a cup of tea! it all felt very much as though their priority was to 'take your money', rather than 'look after their guests'","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was our 1st trip to NYC and stayed with another couple from CT. I purchased the rooms via PL. As with many hotels on PL, you get what you pay for. So I wasn't expecting too much. But to my surprise, OBP NYC is a very nice hotel. The first impression, the lobby, isn't that opulent nor spacious but it's modern and bright. We arrived early so we were able to quickly check our bags and go out for late lunch. The check in process was quick and the staff was friendly, nice. And when we need cabs, the guys always helped us get them. Our room faced the street so we had a nice view and the room seemed recently updated. It was tastefully done, very clean. Nice big closets to hang our coats and shirts. The bathroom was spacious and bright. We expected a small room but our 2 double bed, premier room was good sized, bigger than I expected given what I've heard about for NYC and older hotel. Please don't associate \"older\" has a negative. Yes, the hotel has been here for a long time but you wouldn't know it too much from the inside. We didn't eat at the restaurant but we did have afternoon drinks at the bar. When we were there, it was lively and the bartenders were all very friendly and helped me pick a beer. Patrons were very friendly and talkative, just felt very comfortable there which I wasn't expecting given the stereotype I had about NYC. The location is great which is one of the reasons I picked this hotel. There's a Starbucks just a couple blocks away and other places to eat breakfast\/lunch within a block or two. There's a pharmacy a block away for basic things you might need. And the subway stop is like a block and half away, do down and there's a Dunkin' Donuts.  I could go on and on, but trust me OBP is a very nice hotel.

Also, the subway is only a few minutes walk too so everything in New York was so easy to get to.\n\nIn addition, I must praise the staff - when we arrived, which was about 5pm after a flight from Manchester, our room wasn't ready.

You have no idea how these small things make such a difference because all you actually want to do is get to the room.

Our goal: shop, catch a museum exhibition and have an elevated dining experience. Normally I'm more of a downtown NYC person but in retrospect this midtown location worked out perfectly. Why? Because on 1\/1 most shopping is closed but hey not in Midtown! Literally right across from Rockefeller Plaza with all those associated shops, 7 min walk from Saks and right at the part of Madison Ave that begins the shopping options. Most major fine dining restaurants were also open.\n\nProperty itself: considering it's an old building I really like how the rooms are decorated. Tasteful, clean and classic. Doesn't feel old, musty or like you've been condemned to live in an old person's house. Even the bathroom is comfortably spacious, with enough counter space to be useful. Nice long desk that was about the width of the room so plenty of space for that too. Thoughtful touch: corkscrew along with the requisite ice bucket, tongs and glasses. Noise level was more from the hallway, can't complain about the noise from the street. Lobby is functional so not a huge lounging space but who cares, it does what it needs to do. Check-in was smooth, although the promised text message on when my room would be ready never arrived.\n\nOverall, fantastic for what it is and the location is easily the best part of it.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we downgraded our room to get a cleaner room away from the elevator, they were unable to supply an additional chair to comfortably sit in our room.

Also, they have instituted several policies at this property which I do not believe benefit the customer. \n\nFirst, they have removed all mini-bars and refrigerators which means you can't bring any leftovers back to the room or chill a bottle of water or wine. Second, they no longer allow you to review your charges from your room as you go along so that if you see an issue you can't address it immediately. Instead, they send you an e-mail before you check out which means standing in line with the crowd to resolve a questionable item which could have been settled in advance of checkout. The restaurant is ridiculously overpriced even in NY and they automatically add 18% for a gratuity regardless of party size or quality of service. \n\nThen, after we had checked out, I received a call telling me my bags were still in the room long after we had left the hotel (obviously a function of their poor room assignment process.)

During Check-in we weren\u2019t greeted, asked about our flights, if we had questions about location. It was straight to the point- Name if reservation, confirmation of checkout, we need a card for incidentals, here\u2019s your key. I don\u2019t know if this is typical NYC behavior but we were unimpressed. During check out we were hauling our 2 large luggage\u2019s out the door and again their were 2 men greeting in the lobby in which they didn\u2019t even open the first set of doors the bellmen outside were the only ones to open the second set of doors. So rude. \n\nRoom\/Amenities: Our room was always kept tidy and theirs your basic necessities of a 4-star- toiletries, blow dryer, safe, 1 robe for two people?, ironing board, channel assortment, etc. nothing impressive for your standard Felix king room.\n\nFor our next NYC stay we will definitely try somewhere else.

I had held off writing this review at corporate's request while they were looking into my issue, but they never got back to me so here goes.\n\nIt's clear that the Omni was once a great property but is now suffering from neglect. The property just feels old, and not in a sort of grand and charming way. The furniture is dated, the carpet is dirty, the wallpaper is scuffed, etc. Moreover, the staff had a miserable attitude when it came to mundane things like delivering toothbrush\/toothpaste kits, making sure the crib was in the room (as ordered in advance) and fixing the TV (ours stopped working the last night for some reason, and despite repeated calls to fix it, no one from maintenance ever showed up). Finally, note that the hotel tacks on a $25 per night amenity fee at the very last minute. The fee was instituted just 1.5 months prior to our stay and purportedly covers WiFi, the gym, newspapers and access to the concierge (besides WiFi which is table stakes these days, all of the above was of course available free of charge 1.5 months prior). Most concerning regarding the fee is that it is not disclosed anywhere on the website (i.e. under terms\/conditions, reservation FAQs, etc.) and is only sprung on you at checkout with no details provided depending on which channel you book under. I had reached out to the property to mention my dissatisfaction at the bait-and-switch, and when they were unresponsive I gave corporate a call. Apparently unresponsiveness runs in the family.\n\nThere are plenty of great hotels in midtown. No need to stay with these guys again.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I said I would call back when I had a little more time. I did call back about an hour later and was told that though the original room was still available, if I wanted to have a rollaway, I would need to reserve a larger room, even though the original room was some 270 ft.\u00b2 I explained that the sales associate with whom I had first spoken had told me that the original room would in fact accommodate a rollaway. To no avail, the second associate insisted I needed a larger room at a substantially higher price. Deeply disappointed by the Omni Berkshire's attempt to charge me more that had been agreed, I immediately booked a room in the same area with another major hotel chain where the room is larger and the costs transparent and consistent as well as lower. \n\nI hope sharing my experience will encourage the Omni Berkshire's management to adopt a fair and transparent pricing policy that is in keeping with the other properties in the otherwise excellent Omni chain.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

So much so that I didn't feel like going back to the room during the daytime. It was truly depressing. Also, some of the furniture in the room had visible signs of wear (like the desk).

I spent ages researching our choice of hotel before travelling and we weren\u2019t disappointed. This was our first time in New York and we booked the trip to celebrate a special birthday and meet up with friends from California who we had not seen for a long time. We took a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel which was easy and relatively cheap. On arrival check in was easy and the receptionist was very friendly. The room was a premier double and was very comfortable and a reasonable size. The bathroom was well appointed, the shower was good and there were  good quality toiletries available. We went out to a nearby restaurant to eat and on our return there was a lovely birthday cake, bottle of sparkling wine and handwritten card in the room  - a very thoughtful and much appreciated gesture. The bed was very comfy and we slept really well indeed. There were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room but this is quite standard in better class US hotels apparently. If you join the loyalty scheme I think you can get free hot drinks delivered to the room but this is not available on your first stay if you book through Expedia, as we did. There is a deli across the road which serves every type of breakfast and other food that you can imagine at very cheap prices - it may not be the most glamorous place to sit and eat at, but the food is really very good, especially at around $4 for a breakfast muffin. There are also a number of coffee shops very close by including Gregory\u2019s which is a great NY coffee shop - we very quickly became Gregulars !!! The hotel is in a fantastic location for exploring the city- there are two subway stops in close proximity to the front entrance. Negotiating the subway system is easy and a great way to get around and see the sights. We enjoyed sitting on the decked area on the 17th floor of the hotel in the evenings with a bottle of wine from the local store - there are ice buckets in the rooms and an ice machine on the 17th floor. There is also a small gym on the 17th floor which doesn\u2019t seem to be used that often by guests. We didn\u2019t eat at the restaurant at the hotel, as for us the prices were prohibitive and because we also prefer to explore restaurants outside of the hotel. Despite being in a very central location and within walking distance of some of the major city attractions, the hotel was very quiet and peaceful and has a touch of old world charm that is often lacking in many establishments. Everything and everywhere was immaculately clean and all of the staff that we met were very friendly and helpful. I think the hotel would definitely benefit from a bar area (away from the restaurant) where guests could sit and have a drink at the start or end of an evening, but this is a minor point. We are very particular about where we book and stay when on holiday  - I can honestly say that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Omni, have no criticisms to make and would recommend the hotel to anyone. We would like to return to NYC to explore the city further and would have no hesitation in returning. Thank you Omni for making our first stay so great !!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Connections with the major subway (Metro) lines are convenient and only a few blocks away. For example no transfers to other metro lines are needed to get to Broadway (4 stops on the A C E lines) or the MET and Guggenheim museums (4-5 stops on the 4 5 6 lines).\nThe MOMA and Rockefeller Center are also within an easy walking distance. Breakfast locations are directly across the street from the hotel entrance, or around the corner on Madison Avenue, among others.\n\nWhile the hotel\u2019s outstanding location is reason enough to stay here, the friendly reception and service we received from the staff made the hotel an excellent experience and as such a highlight of our special trip to NYC. The front desk staff went out of their way to accommodate our every need and upgraded us to two very nice, quiet and luxurious rooms. The second room was a little higher up and therefore experienced less traffic sounds (which we were not used to and was more than usual due to the UN General Assembly taking place). Thus, we had the rare and wonderful opportunity to stay in two different - and very nicely appointed - rooms on the 11th and 19th floors. A number of the front desk staff went out of their way to make our stay even more memorable by helping us celebrate my wife\u2019s birthday with a very nice bottle of sparkling wine, a number of tasty amenity platters and even a hand-written welcome and Happy Birthday card. This is a very personable hotel and staff, who go out of their way for their guests. \n\nWe really felt very privileged and special throughout or stay. As mentioned above, we attribute our fond memories and experiences to the extra efforts made on our behalf by the various staff members at the front desk and behind the scenes in the office. \n\nPerhaps not everyone will have a chance to experience this hotel the way we did, but I can only say that it will be remembered as a highlight of our visit to NYC. \n\nTherefore I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to make the best from their visit to this fascinating metropolitan city.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Offered zero help and redirected us to Expedia who said they would relocate us to another hotel for an additional cost of \u00a3750.

My son called the hotel several times to ask for help as we were stranded in the US with nowhere to stay. They displayed an absolute lack of an empathy for our situation.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":113300,"title":"Good Hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-09-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Nice hotel, good location. Close to Fifth Avenue, walking distance to Broadway & Rockefeller Centre (for Top of the Rock viewing), Central Park, Times Square & subway station nearby.\n\nArrived about 8:30pm, one doorman\/bellman on duty but he wasn\u2019t really paying attention as we got out of the cab so we just made our own way in with our luggage & approached reception.  Checked in promptly & politely by a friendly guy. Allocated an \u2018inwards facing\u2019 room on the fifth floor, had read an earlier review regarding noise from the air condition equipment servicing all the rooms & located outside on the third floor level, so I asked if we could possibly have a room higher up. Appreciated an earlier warning that if you had not booked directly with the hotel, but via a \u2018third party\u2019 (eg travel agent) you were unlikely to be allocated an \u2018outwards facing\u2019 so didn\u2019t bother to try for that as well.\n\nNo rooms available higher up so we decided to just be relieved we weren\u2019t on the noisy third floor.  I should say \u201cnoisier\u201d really, because I could see what the other review meant. The equipment outside (yes, roughly level with the third floor) is huge & IS noisy. I could hear a constant low hum from it even 2 floors higher!  I don\u2019t sleep well in strange rooms & my hearing is very good so can\u2019t really blame it for keeping me awake.\n\nReception directed us to the lifts, concierge desk is also located there & there\u2019s a cold water unit & plastic cups so you can help yourself to a drink. Good small maps on the desk there to help you navigate round the midtown area & subway routes. Didn\u2019t need the services of the concierges so can\u2019t comment on that.\n\nInvisible the whole time to the doorman\/bellman but that was fine with us, wheeled cases we could easily manage on our own, which was just as well because he was busy doing nothing!\n\nEasily found our room, no view to speak of apart from the windows of other rooms & this massive hotel servicing equipment a few floors below. To be honest we don\u2019t spend time sitting in the room anyway, so we weren\u2019t particularly bothered by no view which is just as well. Apparently there is a roof top seating area guests can use, but we didn\u2019t bother to go up & find it.\n\nNice clean, tidy, well equipped, sizeable room. Bigger than I had been led to believe hotel rooms in New York are! Pleasantly surprised.\n\nPlenty of mirrors, TV, tea\/coffee making facility, a safe (now that was a bonus), hairdryer, iron & ironing board, dressing gowns\/slippers, loads of storage space for clothing. King size bed, which we both found comfortable.  Air conditioning was working well, good job because it was in the high 80\u2019s during our stay (& 92 degrees one day).\n\nWell-equipped bathroom, though I couldn\u2019t get their hairdryer to work from the sockets in it, fine with me, I just moved to the full length mirror instead, so no problem.  Good supply of bathroom products though they use soap, so no shower gel. Shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, cotton buds & some cotton wool pads.  Plenty of towels & face flannels.\n\nGot very early morning wake up calls from banging doors. I had initially assumed that was inconsiderate, noisy, rude, guests arriving or leaving at the crack of dawn. But no, I discovered that a room close to ours appeared to be allocated to staff (changing into uniforms perhaps??), their coming & going was the door slamming.\n\nOnly used the hotel restaurant once for an evening meal. 1 beer, 1 cola, duck with jacket potato & veg, pork chops with fries & veg (though it came with smashed potato but I couldn\u2019t be bothered to point out that wasn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d ordered as it didn\u2019t really matter), came to just over \u00a3100 (including the tip). OUCH!  Didn\u2019t eat there again though not exactly because of the price, we found the service to be offhand, very offhand. We assume because there was only 2 of us & there were 2 or 3 tables of several people, so clearly the tip would be bigger from those.\n\nDirectly opposite the hotel is an eatery of some sort, cooked food served like a school canteen & sandwiches with an eating area upstairs. Probably a cheap place for a quick meal, didn\u2019t use that either but it is worth investigating.  Apart from that place the hotel location isn\u2019t necessarily great for just nipping out for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat. Chemist & supermarket nearby.\n\nAsked early on if we could possibly have a later check-out than midday, got an extra hour free of charge with no problem. Decided not to pay for more & sat for a couple of hours on the comfy sofas in reception with a book & cold drinks from the supermarket. They have luggage storage if you want to utilise it & go out though.\n\nWe\u2019d had a couple of more attentive doormen for a few days, but when we asked one if he could help get us a cab he said the guy outside would do that. No-one outside & clear he just couldn\u2019t be asked, so we walked a few hundred yards to the corner of the street & hailed our own. I\u2019ve seen compliments paid to doormen at the Omni on other reviews, so perhaps we were just unlucky during our 6 nights there.\n\nI\u2019ve deducted 1* from my rating due to lack of attention by waiter staff in the Omni restaurant & doormen\/bellman.\n\nUnfortunately getting a cab took over 30 minutes though, it was so hot people who might ordinarily walk to their destinations were using the cabs, so very busy.  Apparently the cabbies are not allowed to refuse a fare if they are available, trouble is when you are going to the airport  (with what is supposed to be a set charge), & blatently obvious because you\u2019ve got suitcases, you may get the excuse we got when they are obliged to stop, \u201ccan\u2019t go to the airport, I\u2019m finishing in an hour\u201d. So I suppose technically they can\u2019t be accused of refusing to pick up a fare.\n\nDo your research regarding yellow cab set charge for airport runs beforehand, & be crystal clear about roughly how much it should be. Know in advance, have the cash (include a tip) ready & just hand it over.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have stayed in many Luxury Hotels in New York City and I have found that the Omni Berkshire is the nicest of them all at affordable prices and in the greatest location!! I have stayed at the Omni many times in the past few years. My recent stay at the Omni in August was fantastic just like all the other times I have stayed at the Hotel....so I decided to write a review. To start, the location in Midtown is central to everything you would want to do and see. The Hotel is located in walking distance to Broadway, the best shopping and Central Park. One night we took the short walk to see a Broadway Show. We took the short walk to Central Park and to Rockefeller Center for lunch. The Hotel is only 2 blocks from the Subway for a quick ride Downtown (Subway fare only $2.75) to Soho, Chinatown and Little Italy). The Omni is on Madison Avenue (the best shopping in the world) and only 1 block from 5th Avenue (also great shopping).\n   Everyone at the Berkshire is so friendly and helpful.....from the moment you arrive including the Doormen (particularly Lenny), check-in personnel at the front desk and housekeeping staff. The recently renovated room was quiet, smoke-free, very spacious and EXTREMELY CLEAN!  The bed was so comfortable....I slept better at the Berkshire then in my own bed at home. The marble bathrooms are luxurious and are well equipped with everything you need (water pressue in the shower superb).\n   I met the Manager of the Hotel in the Lobby (David Chase)....he was so nice to take time out to see how our stay was going. From the short conversation I had with David Chase, he appears to be very hands on at every level of the Hotel, personable and has done a remarkable job keeping up the high standards of the hotel.\n   The new Restaurant at the Hotel is Bob's Steak and Chop House....nice for a great Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner. Bob's Bar is also nice for drinks with 2 huge big screen TV's.\n   The Concierge desk was very helpful in giving us directions, making plans and getting us dinner reservations. Every type of food\/restaurant is within walking distance of the Omni. I like Sarabeth's (Central Park South), Norma's and 40 Carats\/Bloomingdales for Breakfast\/Lunch\/Brunch....all within walking distance. If you need theatre tickets, the Concierge will help you as well....we already had tickets to see \"Dear Evan Hansen\" (we loved it!).\n   I can't recommend the Omni Berkshire Place enough. Everything about it is perfect. There are so  many hotels to choose from in new York City but this one stands out above the rest.  The Omni is so comforting and welcoming....it feels like a home away from home.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We didn't use the restaurant Bob's because we found it a little pricey for our budget but it seemed a really buzzy place.  My only negative comment really was as we were leaving the doorman asked if we needed a taxi to the airport and said he had a private guy we could use that worked with the hotel for $65 dollars including tolls and everything, as we had paid $70 for a yellow cab at JFK on arrival we accepted only to find that it was in fact $65 without tolls and a tip on arrival at the airport so it ended up costing $75!

The location is perfect with easy access to all parts of the city by subway or walking.  I booked through a 3rd party and arrived a bit early at 1pm.  A room was available on the 3rd floor in the back but it faced an air vent which had the potential to be noisy at night.  So I returned to the front desk and was given another room on the 7th floor also in the back.  This proved to be a satisfactory choice.  While it was without much natural light, it was quiet and peaceful.  I suspect if you book via a 3rd party you will be given a room in the back sandwiched between 2 buildings.  That is perfectly acceptable although you may want to ask for a higher floor if the vision of seeing a vent bothers you.  The room was wonderfully comfortable and nicely arranged with an actual chair and a side table that faced the tv.  I have no idea why other hotels do not arrange furniture this way. The bathroom was well appointed with elegant marble finishes that suggest an era long ago.  Steps away is the Blue Bottle Cafe for a great pour over coffee to start the day.  Also nearby is the restaurant, La Grenouille, with its riot of flowers inside.  One could eat reasonably here if the pre theater menu is ordered or if one stops by later for a snack rather than a full meal.\nThis is one of the few hotels that still gives its guests a NY Times, WSJ, Asian Financial, and USA Today.  I appreciate they offer these periodicals for free.  The gym is decent and on the same floor is a small terrace with an herb garden to enjoy the view.  The bottom line is that virtually all guests will enjoy the Omni Berkshire Hotel.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

The check in process was relatively easy. I was too early for check in- but they were great to send me a text when the room was ready. When I went into my room- the first thing I noticed- no toilet paper. Even worse- hair all around the bathroom sink and toilet. I was tired from walking around the city all day- so I just did my best to clean it. I then moved to the bed area. Gum stuck to the bedsheets. Black streaks along the pillow cases- and some other stain on the sheets that I won\u2019t go into detail on. Not a big fan of co planning- but there was no way I would sleep on those sheets. I called the front desk- the apologized- and said they would send someone up to take care of it. 40 mins later- no one shows up. It\u2019s night time and I am already exhausted. I call the front desk again- this time they just transfer me to housekeeping( why didn\u2019t they do that the first time?). Housekeeping says hey will be right up. About 10 mins later a woman from housekeeping knocks on the door. I let her in and I show her the sheets- even she was pretty disgusted with them. She puts the clean sheets and pillow cases on the FLOOR!- and then proceeds to remove the dirty sheets which land near the clear sheets on the floor. I typically love staying at Omni properties- but this is by far one of he worst properties I have ever stay at. I am hoping day 2 is better than day 1 - I can\u2019t imagine it being any worse.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

We arrived very early intending to check our bags and head out for our first day of sightseeing, but they let us check in to our room early! Great start. In the room, we discovered the carpet was damp and called to let the staff know. A housekeeping manager came up to the room in a matter of minutes to check it out, and when we returned later in the evening there was a floor fan\/dryer in the room. It helped a little but we turned it off and went to sleep. The next day we came back in the middle of the day to rest up from a morning of activities, and found a mildew odor from the (still) damp carpet. We called again, and someone came up and attempted to freshen up the room with a spray. On the way out for the afternoon and evening, we went to the front desk and asked if was possible to move rooms if we came back and there was still an odor. Before returning, I got a call from the hotel telling us we had a new room, offered to move our belongings for us, and to pick up the new keys when we returned. We opted to move ourselves and they even kept us on the same floor. Once we moved, everything was fantastic. Room was very comfortable. We slept well. Even got another follow-up call from housekeeping manager apologizing and offering any additional help we needed. Earlier in the stay we requested a refrigerator, which they were out of at the moment, but when we moved rooms we discovered one waiting for us which was very nice and already cooled.

I added valet parking because lets face it, it makes it much easier.  When I approached the front desk, the lady that was checking us in could not get past the fact that I cancelled a couple of reservations before my current reservation.  And she kept telling me I didn\u2019t have valet parking.  Word to the wise, please print out your reservation before you check in.  Keep that reservation handy, because they will change the price. mine increased by almost 100 dollars, yes, just for one night.  When leaving I had to deal with the same lady again\u2026..she could not get past the reservations I cancelled before.  Then she was going to add parking again, trying to double charge me for parking.  Another person working the desk came over and explained to the lady that it was already charged on my bill as a package for the room, I thought she finally gave in gave me a copy of my bill and I thought that was it.  But I went on my way to my next location (another Omni in Providence RI, which by the way is the best hotel ever!), when I got to my next location, I noticed, when my back was turned, they charged my card anyway for the parking again.  Yup!  Nice huh!  Just be careful and watch this hotel even after you leave, check your credit card for rouge charges.  I am an Omni fan.  I love Providence and stay at the Omni at least once a year in Providence, but I will never stay at the Omni in New York.  Its unfortunate that I felt I spent most of my vacation trying to resolve credit card charges that should have never happened in the first place.

When my wife mentioned this trip was for my birthday, the lady receptionist offered a room upgrade on the 7th floor with a view of Madison Ave for $30 a night which we accepted.View was excellent.  Our room was nice with a king size bed. Again the room was immaculate, but no tea or coffee making facilities which apparently is nothing new for U.S. hotels. (This was our first trip to the U.S.). Mini bar was empty and no water. Initially, we were under the impression that we could ask for a couple of bottles of water from reception when the water dispenser in the concierge area was empty but after a couple of days of asking, we were met with the reply from two separate receptionists of \"I'll see if we have any left.\"  and they came back with \"This is the last one.\" Of course it was(!) We ate once at the hotel restaurant. We ordered steak and salmon. Both were incredibly salty and the wine very expensive. We got the impression that the hotel was aimed more at corporate customers than us tourists. On the eve of our departure, (we needed a cab at 5am for our flight), we were told by a friend that the main bridges would be closed. We checked at reception the afternoon before our departure and were told to see the concierge. On approaching him, we were greeted with a very disdainful look and dismissively told that \"the bridges would be open and reception could have told us that\".  Personally, I did not really care of the internal politics between staff, all we were doing was making 100% sure we did not miss our flight!

She said no and walked away.....   Later I about to leave the room and go have breakfast when I received a call from the doorman advising me that my limo was downstairs. I told him thank you , but the limo is early...He told me that he needs the room on the street and that I must come down now !

Those at the front desk were friendly and we were checked in earlier than I had expected.  The hotel is not too large, which I appreciate, as I hate getting lost in the various lobbies, waiting rooms, lounges, bars, etc.  The room was of a decent size for New York, although the area around the bed by the closet was tight, especially for 2 people.  I would rearrange the furniture or get a smaller desk and place it in the spot of the closet.  One could see that there was some updating and some not, but it was clean which is of the utmost importance.  It was not dingy, dusty, dirty, etc.  The bathtub was old, which was fine for me as I was not there to take a spa bath.  It was clean and spacious, again of the utmost importance for me.  The bed was comfortable, the linens nice and crisp, and I truly appreciated the curtains, as they extended across the entire window, thus closing out all of the city lights at night, which is extremely important.  Speaking of the night, being that the hotel is on a side street, it was quieter than if on 5th Ave, which was 1\/2 block away.  It's still the city, however, and thus expect some sirens and honking horns. It would have been nice to have a coffee\/tea machine and a small refrigerator.

There aren\u2019t a ton of amenities ... the gym is very nice and Bob\u2019s Steak House (the in-house restaurant) is fabulous - I live in Texas and Bob\u2019s is based there, and serves the best steak I have ever had).

The room itself was quite small for the four of us, we only had 2 double beds and there isn't room for a rollaway so we brought our own blow up air mattress. For almost $600\/night I would have expected at least queen mattresses and a refrigerator.\n\nNO REFRIGERATOR in our room. They delivered cookies and chocolate milk at night when we checked in, and I wanted to put the milk in the refrig for the kids to consume in the morning because I do not want my kids eating chocolate cookies and milk before they go to bed!! We ended up dumping all the milk because we couldn't keep it cold. \n\nTWO CLOSETS to hang your coats and jackets. We barely had room to open up our 4 suitcases in the room. \n\nBATHROOM was small. The toilet was leaking water all over the floor the whole entire time we were there, but I never said anything because I kept thinking it was my kids making a mess, but every day when we came back sure enough there was water on the floor. We only stayed in the room at night and I don't like maintenance crews coming in while I'm not in the room. \n\nOverall I liked the location of the hotel and the water that they put next to the elevators. My only complaint is they don't put it out early enough\/leave it out long enough. After walking 9 miles a day trying to catch subways etc, I looked forward to that cup of water before heading to my room.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When pointing out the discrepancy to the OMNI front desk agent checking us out, she was rude and impatient. I stepped aside suggesting she take the next customer while I called my credit card company to verify exactly what was charged.

A light bulb from the sconce popped out and hit the wall, then the floor and was just inches away from hitting a pregnant woman.

The location can\u2019t be beat if you want to stay right in midtown. They have a bar and restaurant on location that we did not utilize based on mixed reviews. The rooms are spacious by NYC standards, well decorated, and clean. The bathroom water pressure and temperature were great throughout. Elevators were a tad slow, but all were functional. The king bed was comfortable, however if you prefer a firmer pillow, it\u2019s best to bring your own. Our room had a sitting chair, desk and chair with phone, flat screen TV, a lighted wardrobe with bathrobes, extra hangers, ironing board and iron, Ice bucket and wine opener, and a safe. The entranceway had a huge full length mirror and the bathroom was almost fully surrounded in mirrors (+ blowdryer, a lighted adjustable cosmetic mirror and a telephone next to the toilet which my husband found amusing). Some furnishings are showing signs of wear. There was no view out our window (industrial units and other buildings), but we were fine with that for the little time we spent there. \n\nAt check in, we asked to pay full in cash. Maria did not take our cash and a $300 hold was placed on our card regardless. She treated us and spoke to us very different than the couple checking in before us, who got an upgraded room, free coffee for the next morning, and complimentary WiFi. I am not sure if this is because we booked third party, wanted to pay cash, were only staying out first time for one night, or because we looked weary from traveling all day. \n\nCheck out was a breeze. The young man at the desk (I apologize for not remembering his name but it starts with a T!) was very friendly, let us pay cash, told us the hold on our card would drop off in a few days, and said we could stow our bags with the concierge while we grabbed breakfast across the street.

The Omni Berkshire has typically been our hotel of choice when we visit NYC annually. In fact, we have stayed there four out of the last five years. However, this year we were very disappointed in our stay.  It was even more frustrating since I redeemed a free night that I had accumulated with prior Omni stays.  As a manager, I feel like you would be interested in hearing about our stay. \n \n\u2022       First of all, the safe in our room was not working when we checked in. In addition, the television was cracked and had to be \nbe replaced. Both of these items should have been checked by housekeeping to make sure they were operational prior to our check in.\n\u2022       On the second night, we called for ice\u2014we never received it.\n\u2022       There were not enough towels refreshed in our room each day. We had two adults and two teens in our room.\n\u2022       After the first night, the bath rug was removed and never replaced.\n\u2022       On the second morning, I accidently dripped coffee on the small side table by the bed\u2014the drips were never wiped up during the remainder of our stay.\n\u2022       There was a penny on the floor by the wall by the chair\u2014it was there ALL week\u2014never picked up. This tells me that the room was not even vacuumed all week thoroughly. \n\u2022       The staff at the front desk was not friendly at all!\n\u2022       The only staff member that went out of their way to be friendly was one of the bartenders in the bar!\n \n \nI have the opportunity to stay in a lot of hotels across the country and I it was my choice to pick the Omni Berkshire.  It was a lackluster week!  This was our vacation and I did not feel like you made me or my family feel like it was a wise choice to have selected the Omni Berkshire.  I sent a note to the manager of the hotel right after our visit to express our dis-satisfcation, and did not receive a response.\n \nI look forward to hearing back from you.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I decided to add a day, I had to look for another hotel for one night, and it was the Omni.  The hotel came up as an opaque (\"Hush Hush\") sale on GiltTravel.  With some online sleuthing based on hints provided by Gilt, I was able to deduce the secret hotel was the Omni, which is one block away from Lotte.  The Lotte booking was also through Gilt, although it was not opaque.  The Omni was a pleasant, comfortable, unflashy  one-night stay.  \n\nI did not realize the Omni was a historic hotel, because its exterior architecture is quite minimalist compared to other lavishly ornate Beaux Arts buildings from the same time period.  In fact, the hotel was built in 1926 by Warren and Wetmore, who had a hand in designing Grand Central Terminal.  In 1942, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote their famous musical \"Oklahoma!\" in a suite here, now named in their honour.\nThe L-shaped hotel sits on the corner of 52nd and Madison, a stone's throw from Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Times Square and its theatres are a short walk, as is MOMA.  The architecturally significant Austrian Cultural Forum New York building is right next door on 52nd.  A pleasant, inexpensive deli\/take-away place called Isadora's is across 52nd.\n\nMy room type was the hotel's least expensive, a Deluxe.  These rooms (approx. 270 sq ft) all face away from the street, so are surely quieter.  The interior view was not as dark as expected either, given the hotel's L-shape.  The room was decent-sized, especially for New York.  There were no built-in features--the closet was a modern armoire that also held shelves and a safe (no minibar).  The desk had a lot of counter space.  The bathroom was smallish, but the combo tub-shower had a curved curtain rod and there were lots of mirrored walls.  There were robes but no slippers, and no turndown service.  The room had an ice bucket, but I'm not sure if there was an ice machine.  It seems USA Today is the hotel's only English-language newspaper.\n\nThe best accommodations at the Omni are the Terrace Suites.  However, the St. Patrick's Terrace on the 17th floor opposite the Fitness Centre is open to all guests and looked like a small but pleasant place to relax in more temperate weather.  The Cathedral \"view\" from the hotel, however, is not outstanding.\n\nIf you are an member of Omni's Select Guest program, Wifi is free, and you get a hang card to put on your door that entitles you to a free morning beverage delivered to your room.  Mind you, the orange juice I ordered was tiny and from concentrate, and the avocado toast, available via the hang card at about half the price of the room service toast, was actually a lesser product that the room service version (no egg, etc).  Still, it gives you some nourishment before leaving the room.\n\nThe hotel's restaurant is Bob's Steak and Chop House, which is part of a small chain of 16 restaurants (the majority are in Texas).  I did not try it, but the menu had classic steakhouse fare, and the decor was also classic steakhouse (dark wood paneling).  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The bar looked popular.\n\nBecause my room category at the Towers at Lotte Palace was quite different from the Omni, I cannot fairly compare them.  I will say the Lotte is a larger, more bustling and frenetic place, has more obvious historic features (the Villard Mansion) and better Cathedral views.  The Omni was a quieter, less flashy place.  Both have great midtown locations for tourists.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Odd tasting Cesar salad and very unhealthy, chewey cheese hamburger\n- I understand this is NY, but even then the room service was expensive plus they have these 0.2 liter, tiny coke bottles. It screams \"nickel and dime\" and above all leaves you thirsty\n- Charging for Internet (excuse me?!?)\n- Bathroom definitely feeling dated.  What is with all the wood paneling in the rooms? Makes it feel even smaller than it already is.  \n- Toilet was plugged but that I am sure was a one off\n\nI know that a Marriott is boring but at least I know they understand what a business travel needs and that is in addition to some tasteful d\u00e9cor, mostly a productive set up.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":113300,"title":"Very nice management but our second visit had more issues than our first","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We like the Omni hotels in a couple of other locations in the U.S. and our first visit here was about a year and a half ago.  We experienced some issues with that stay (you can read that review for details) and a super responsive manager spoke with me over the phone about it and sent a gift certificate for a free night's stay.  So, this December we decided to use the certificate for one of our staycations in NYC.  \n\nI was early for check-in and the front desk staff were very welcoming and took my cell number to text me when the room was ready.  The small but elegantly decorated \"old NYC\" style lobby was filled with guests coming or going and I gave our bag to the bellman after a bit of a wait in line. Since this hotel is so close to Rockefeller Center and the flagship Saks store, I decided it had been a long time since I visited these places so off I went.  Surprisingly I got a text that our room was ready way earlier than expected while I was still at lunch!\n\nOur king room was decorated in beiges and browns and had a little extra chair and lamp near one side of the bed.  The bathroom was all in a brownish marble.  Nice.  Lighting was good.  There was no mini fridge so I called down to request one but understandably they were all out, so I asked for a bucket of ice.  Then I noticed the bedspread had several brownish red stains on it.  I considered calling to get it replaced but I was really tired and didn't want to deal with housekeeping coming and just wanted to have a cold drink and relax, plus we weren't going to sleep with the bedspread on anyway.  \n\nI turned on the TV and intermittently the sound would degrade to an annoying buzz several times.  The heater was noisy whenever it would run.  As my husband is a loyalty member, two bottles of water were delivered along with a note from the loyalty manager and the managing director (he was the same gentleman who gave me the certificate) reminding us to put the \"Select Guest\" hangtag on the door by 2 a.m. to get our complimentary morning beverages.  I looked everywhere and there was no \"Select Guest\" hangtag.\n\nTwo hours passed and still no ice delivery and by that time we had to go to an appointment so I called the front desk to tell them no ice had been delivered and we didn't want it anymore.  Instead of an apology the staff person just said \"I'll connect you with Housekeeping\" but I said to forget it and they just said \"OK.\"\n\nWhen we got back to the hotel in the late evening our room had benefited from turndown service (which included ice) and we didn't really want to try and deal with any of the other issues, so I wrote up all of our issues with this stay (complete with photos and video)  to the lovely managing director via email and sent it off to him in the early morning.  The HVAC worked fine, fyi, it was just noisy.  Then we went down to Bob's (in the hotel) for breakfast.  \n\nNot surprising, he responded within the hour, apologizing for our problems with the room and offering to buy our breakfast.  The restaurant manager graciously took care of the bill after I showed him the email and we had a nice conversation.  \n\nWith such guest-oriented and responsive management I am a bit perplexed as to how our second \"make it up to us\" experience missed the mark in a variety of ways.  I really expected everything to go smoothly for this little one-night stay.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I opened the certificate to book this trip and they wouldn't honor it. \n\nLet me tell you, after being stranded in Mexico and having to pay for that hotel because they wouldn't accept their own GC, I wasn't in a hurry to book with Omni again any sooner. Who sends a free stay certificate as an apology for messing up our vacation and won't honor it? Omni. \n\nThe location of the Berkshire Hotel is great. I felt like we were within 1 or 2 blocks of everything. The Lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and Santa even stopped by. Concierge was very helpful for recommendations \/ cabs and the room was nice. The room was not on the higher floor that we requested, so it was a little noisy from the street but still nice. \nWe had drinks and apps in the bar which was convenient and very friendly.

We were taking our children to see the Rockettes for an early Christmas gift.   Upon arriving I checked into the front desk and ask to please have two beds.  The gentleman who was helping me stated they could not accommodate this request.  What?? He stated that priceline will only give you a  king size bed.  I had no idea, it was not stated when I booked this.  Well ok, can I please get a room with two beds and I will pay the difference.  No I am sorry we are \"sold out\".  Now I am on the verge of tears.  Can you please check again sir.  \" I told you we are sold out.\"  Of course now I am saying what am I going to do?  His response \" I don't know.\"  Well we can give you a room with a roll away for an additional charge.  I agree to this as it will help a little.  We are then told our room is not ready so we check our luggage and head out to the city.  We return and ask one more time if there have been any cancellations, I know it is a long shot but no.  Ok we head up to the room and now I online going to book another hotel room somewhere else for half of my family. I go onto the Omni Berkshire website and I can book a room with two double beds.  My brother in law also called to make a reservation for this night and asked for two beds and it was confirmed that they did have availability.  Are you kidding me. I walk down stairs and ask at the front desk why they have not been honest with me, no response other than we can move you.  We decided not as we had made other arrangements.  You are a customer service company who failed in every aspect of customer service.  Your front desk staff is rude and unfriendly and you should not tolerate lying. Room was not cleaned very well, looked like it had not been vacuumed.   We visit NYC at least 4 times per year and I will never stay at this facility or recommend this to others.  Also if you are thinking of staying here, there is not any coffee in the rooms and they also do not have any small store if you need anything.  The only positive aspect was the kindness of the doormen.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The bar area is a great size and the bartender, Robert, was just as great. Our room was the perfect size for the two of us, with the comfiest bed I have EVER slept on in a hotel. Ever. I appreciated the little details in the room like the complimentary comfy robe, the built in outlets in the bedside table lamps, and (even though I didn\u2019t use it) the cute little sewing kit in the restroom, which by the way, NEVER ran out of hot water even in the 20 degrees too cold NYC weather. As well, the light blocking curtains on the windows were a much-appreciated feature. We actually slept in one day accidentally because we couldn\u2019t tell whether or not it was 10 AM or 10 PM. The actual location of the hotel could NOT be more perfect. You are within walking distance, and I mean 5-10 minutes walking distance, of the best Christmas shopping, the best Christmas show (Rockettes) at Radio City Music Hall, and the best Christmas tree in America at Rockefeller Center.

The bed was huge and very comfortable, and the room was really quiet (we were on the 17th floor and at the back of the hotel, so no street noise at all). Daily housekeeping and turndown service was excellent, and although we did not have much interaction with the staff as we were out and about so much, they were always very helpful and polite when we did speak with them. This included on our final day when the bellman stored our luggage after checkout whilst we awaited our transfer to Newark. The hotel is in a great location for shopping on 5th Avenue, Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Central Park, and there are subway stations that can get you anywhere else you might need to go very close by.

It was an ordeal that we never want to repeat again; between not being able to walk 10 feet in the area without someone trying to sell you something; surly front desk clerks and being given a timeshare pitch on the way to our room, it was not a pleasant stay. Thats why  we looked forward to staying at the Omni, and it did not disappoint.\n\nThe Omni is located a little farther away from the theater district and costs a little more, but its in much classier area and is worth the extra money. We have stayed in Omni hotels through out the country and they are generally very good. Upper management of this chain understands one of the basic principles of hospitality, you make money on return business; offer a great product and treat your customers with respect and they will keep coming back. That is where this hotel and this chain excels at.\n\nThe hotel is clean, the rooms are large for New York and the staff is professional.\n\nThe one fault I have with this hotel is that the prices in their restaurant, \"Bobs\", were very high for breakfast. Fortunately there is a deli across the street that is very reasonable and it is a good alternative to the Omni's restaurant.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is perfectly situated a block from the nearest subway station and a few blocks' walk from Rockefeller Center and Times Square. The hotel is on a side street which isn't very busy, so it feels like you're away from the middle of the crowds. I booked a King Premier Executive Room, and I couldn't get over how spacious it was! I have stayed in many city hotels, and this is by far the largest I've ever been in. There was a small foyer separating the bedroom from the bathroom and plenty of room to move around. Free wifi comes with a loyalty membership, and it worked perfectly. The water pressure in the shower was a bit too strong and felt like pelting. Otherwise, everything about the room was great. All of the staff were wonderful too. If there was any drawback, it was the lack of a comfortable lounge to relax in. The bar is part of the steakhouse restaurant, and didn't feel like a place to relax with a drink and a book or to work on a laptop. I would definitely recommend this hotel!","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

On this trip, we stayed in the $800 suite because it was a very special trip. When we arrived at the Manhattan Suite, I was immediately disappointed in the decor....it looked like it had been gathered from a thrift store.  The closet is tiny and there was nowhere to unpack. I called to inquire about this and they offered to bring up a chest of drawers so I could unpack.  Still very little closet space....maybe 4 items could be hung. The bathroom is very small and outdated.    Upon our arrival I asked the concierge, Kevin, to make a reservation for us on our last night at Ciprianis.  I never received a message or a written confirmation so on the day of our reservation I called the concierge to confirm.  I was told there was no reservation and no record of one being requested. (I distinctly remember speaking to Kevin because I waited while he and his coworker were discussing inviting the intern to their holiday party.)  We were so disappointed and he did not even ask me if he could make a reservation for me elsewhere. I made my own reservation for dinner that night on OpenTable.  As we were checking out the clerk at the desk did not ask me if I enjoyed my stay, or if there was anything he could help me with regarding luggage or transportation.  I\u2019m afraid this is my last day at the Omni Berkshire. Even the location is not enough to win me back. I don\u2019t like to be negative but I feel like I should be honest.
