I had an important meeting the next day so even though I live in nyc, I decided to stay near my appointment the night before. I've gone to the rooftop since my college days but never stayed at the hotel so I was SO EXCITED when Niya upgraded me to a room with a view of Lincoln Center! She was so cheery, helpful and made the check-in a breeze! She was super helpful with all my questions and I Def recommend seeking her out if you need anything. \n\nNow the not-so-great. First, their wifi is NOT secure, it's not password protected and my more knowledgeable friends confirmed that I should not use it - that's how data breaches and stolen PWs happen! When I asked about the password and questioned the security, the absolute opposite person of Niya asked if I was CIA and what was I doing that was so secretive that I needed a password protected connection. He was beyond rude and just challenged me asking repeatedly what I was doing online that I needed secure wifi. It was embarrassing. \n\nThe room was a deluxe king and I loved the view although the windows could use a cleaning and only open a couple of inches. It's definitely due for a makeover but the location, lobby, rooftop, view and Niya absolutely made the experience and I woke up energized and ready for my meeting!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Clean an well maintained, with friendly and helpful staff throughout.  \n\nWe had booked a family room, 2 doubles and one sofa, with a view of the city.  There were some issues before arrival, which the hotel could amend their procedure to prevent future stress for travellers. The hotel tried to take the first nights payment before arrival, but there were issues as it was a foreign card, that the bank blocked for fraud prevention.  Unfortunately they left it until the day before to take the payment, so I woke at 6am to an email from the hotel saying the payment hadn't gone through, and I had until 9am the following day (day of arrival) to update my method.\n\nI ended up speaking to the hotel at approx 2am their time, trying various cards, which wouldn't go through for fraud prevention, but was limited on time as I had to catch my flight.  Luis assured me he would note it, and the reservation would not be cancelled.  Travelling from France, it was a long day, and we wouldn't be arriving until 9-10pm.  We didn't want to arrive and have nowhere to stay.  \n\nAfter landing at JFK at 6.30pm, I had an email saying I had to call by 4pm or the reservation would be cancelled.  Again, panicking, I called the hotel, with limited signal, afraid we had no where to stay.  Thankfully it was all ok.  \n\nTo prevent this happening in the future, the hotel could attempt the payment a few days in a advance, so travellers are not restricted with time deadlines, when they have no access to emails\/calls on long flights.\n\nWe were told we had been upgraded, which was nice, but actually we didn't feel it was an upgrade.  The room was maybe a slight bit bigger, but there was no view.  It just overlooked the hotel windows opposite, so felt slightly disappointed that we thought we were going to have city views from our room.  It made the room very dark.  It was late and had already been a long day, so we just went with it.\n\nWe had booked as a family of 3 adults and two children, but there were only 2 bath towels in the room, and no bedding for the sofa bed, which we had to request.  Housekeeping was hit and miss, some days we would be left 5 towels, other days 2.  Sometimes a hand towel, sometimes not...  One day we left the do not disturb sign up, as we did not want housekeeping in, but she knocked on our door early evening, and asked why.  We said it was fine but she was trying to get in.  She asked for rubbish, which I said I would get, as people were getting changed, and she was still trying to get in our room.  It was quite comical, but a little annoying.\n\nThe rooftop bar was very nice and had a nice atmosphere to it too.\n\nOverall, a pleasant stay, but we would have preferred the room with the city view that we had booked.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I understand that it is New York City and you may see the occasional pest, but this felt out of the ordinary.  In terms of the condition of my room, the wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the frame of the bed was peeling apart, and there was a chunk missing from the molding on the wall.  \n\nWhen I complained to the front desk about having killed the first cockroach, they were relatively dismissive.  They did send housekeeping to clean it up and when I asked if they could offer next steps, they said they weren't sure what I meant.  I asked if they could spray or offer a room change, and they said they would spray.  The person from housekeeping was very kind and arrived promptly.

The room was run down very small.  TV looked like it was manufactured in 2005. \n\n This hotel charges a \u201cresidence fee\u201d of $19.95 + tax per night for their amenities which is outside of their advertised rate.  This included items that are standard for a hotel (bell hop service, rooftop bar, gym, WiFi, etc.).  I did not have use for any of these amenities and asked to have the charge removed, which the hotel refused to do claiming it was required for all guests.  If the charge is non-negotiable then why is it not included in the rate when I booked the hotel? Basically it is a way for the hotel to advertise lower rates on the comparison sites and squeeze additional money from their customers.

Prior to the trip, the college recommended places to stay and the Empire Hotel was on the list. We are soooo happy that it was recommended because we loved everything about it! The location is perfect, as it is just across the street from Lincoln Center (easy to navigate to for cab drivers and walking directions). Central Park was also very close and the theater district was about a 15 minute walk south. Within 5 minutes walk to the north (the upper west side) were TONS of delicious restaurants and cafes. And, the world famous PJ Clarke's is on the corner at the base of the hotel, too! The area was very safe and the hotel is BEAUTIFUL! The room was spacious with very trendy decor. But, the real main event was the front desk staff. We arrived a few hours earlier than normal check-in and were just expecting to store our bags and go explore the area, but Pasquale said that our room was ready. YAY! We headed up and it seems that there was miscommunication with housekeeping and the room was not actually ready. We went back downstairs to notify Pasquale and he was very apologetic, gave us extra bottles of water and said that he would call or text us when the room was ready. (Again, we were early so we never actually expected for the room to be ready in the first place and we felt very grateful for his kindness.) \nAfter exploring, we found out from Pasquale and D'Angeli that our room had been upgraded due to our patience!!! The customer service here is AMAZING! We were so grateful to them both for this grand gesture. They went above and beyond.\nAfter 3 wonderful nights at the Empire Hotel, we found out on our last day that our flight home was a bit delayed. Yessica offered us a 1pm check-out at no extra charge, which was lovely and enabled us to have a more leisurely morning before braving the airport mayhem. This top notch customer service will have us coming back again and I love that return guests get a discount at booking by using a special code for the next stay...even more incentive! I will recommend this hotel to any friends and family traveling to NYC and I hope to see Pasquale, D'Angeli and Yessica again soon!","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Fantastic location adjacent to Lincoln Center! Within minutes of the subway, buses, food, Central Park, etc.  Another perk is it's around the corner from a TKTs outpost, where you can line up for discount Broadway tickets inside a comfortable building lobby rather than Times Square (and sleep in more before lining up!) Starbucks is in between the lobby and TKTs so you can get provisions on the way for standing in line.\n2. Impressive service. Everyone we encountered from the doormen, front desk staff, to housekeeping were friendly and helpful.  For example, when we checked in, we saw that the blackout roman shades in our room were inoperable, so it was as dark as night and we could not look outside. When I asked at the front desk, she immediately switched me to the adjacent room where the blinds worked fine. When I spilled some coffee on the bedspread they immediately switched out all the bedding. I've been in large chain hotels where these kind of requests would take hours or not be addressed at all. \n3.  While it's an older building, the hotel has been recently renovated with an interesting, contemporary vibe. \n\nCONS:\nAs I work in architecture my first impressions are typically of the building itself. Some people would not be bothered by these observations but I'll share in case the Hotel can address them to improve customer experience. Some things I realize are hard to address in a prewar building:\n1. The HVAC runs on old radiators so the room gets hot and stuffy.  This is not unusual in NYC though. The bathroom has no ventilation (no vent or exhaust fan). We had to leave our window open a bit most of the time, which worked fine. The lobby generally smelled musty also from lack of ventilation. Maybe a light fragrance could be piped in?\n2. The renovation construction quality could've been better. It looked like a hook or makeup mirror was missing in the bathroom but the hole was there. The shower tile grout was messy or missing in spots, and there was tons of caulking around the doors to fill gaps. More aesthetic issues, but it could feel more upscale if it was addressed.\n3. While I expected a tiny bathroom in Manhattan, the usability could be improved. The sink does not have a rim that is level or wide enough to put anything down and there's no counter. There is a wall shelf that is about 3-4\" deep. The toilet tank and seat lids are sloped, so anything you put there besides clothes slide off. So there's nowhere to put down anything wider than 3\". A 10-12\" deep shelf above the toilet tank could easily address this. \n4. Like most hotels, it would really help to have more than a single robe hook in the bathroom. For a family of 4 there's nowhere to hang a toiletry bag or other towel if one person hangs a towel there. \n\nIn spite of the bathroom inconveniences, overall I'd still recommend the hotel and visit again. The staff always made us feel that we had a welcome base as we explored and the city and the room was otherwise comfortable.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

TripAdvisor showed the perfect hotel. Except the rating was too low. Despite all odds i gave it a try\u2026. Here is the unbiased review.\n+Location. The location is as good as is gets if you are planning to attend a performance at Lincoln center. The hotel is just a minute walk, literally across the road. Some  good restaurants like Bar Boloud and Boloud Sud are also a minute away, Columbus circle 5min walk, Central Park a block away, Broadway a step out.\n+Staff. Everyone from managers at the reception to housekeeping services were professional and helpful. No BS, no delays, everything run smoothly from check-in to check-out.\n+Dogs. Empire Hotel has a dog friendly policy, and not towards small dogs only. Big four-legged companions are welcomed as well.\nRooms. Yes, rooms could benefit greatly from thoughtful renovation. But even with the tired decor, the bed linen was fresh and crisp, towels in the bathroom white and fluffy. As a frequent guest of the hotels worldwide I appreciate crisp linen and towels more than fresh wallpaper.\nAir con. Yes it is loud. However if you are not a finicky sleeper you would have no problem at all. Pity you can\u2019t open the window, fresh air always helps. Alas, I just turned the air con off (I still got the noise, but the temperature was ok). \nOverall Empire Hotel was an excellent choice for the purpose. At the price of $200\/night I couldn\u2019t ask for more at such location. If you want a spacious newer room with modern appliances be prepared to pay at least twice of the that price elsewhere.\nI would like to say special thanks for Pasquale at the reception for his professionalism, kindness and curtesy. And I certainly will be back next time I am in the city.\n","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

After calling down to the front desk, I was given a new and bigger room, which I appreciated.\nHowever the AC unit in this new room was broken. It could not keep a cool temperature all night, and made a lot of noise while it was at it. After a bad night\u2019s sleep I asked the front desk to take a look while I was out. \nWhen I returned that night, I didn\u2019t see any indication anyone had fixed the unit, but waited to see if the unit functioned more normally. It did not.\nWhen I asked the front desk about this the following morning, they told me someone had indeed visited the room and it turned out the unit was not easily fixable. No one told me this, much less offered to change my room again because of the issue.\nThe front desk said they would switch me to yet another room and that they could move my things. I had to run to work meetings so said I could pack when I return in the evening. They said I must pack my bags at that moment or risk losing the room change due to availability in the evening, which made no sense to me, but I did it anyway (this made me late to work). \nIn both these rooms, I should add, the doors didn\u2019t align with their frames properly, leaving gaps - making it easy to hear everything in the halls.\nMy new room was an upgrade - again, appreciated, but one of the AC units in the room was also very noisy. \nI also observed several other guests in line with issues - booking confusion, room availability issues, being told they could upgrade only to be told several minutes later the upgrade they were promised was not available. \nIt\u2019s clear this hotel is poorly maintained and not well run.

I\u2019d like to register my complaint with this hotel, unfortunately. We look for the basics: good shower, good bed, air conditioning and location. So we chose The Empire Hotel, with a reasonable distance from Times Square so that there wouldn't be so much noise, as we were only going to spend two nights in NY and we would like to rest very well at night, because we would be walking a lot to see much of the city and living our dream. We arrived at the hotel and realized that the air conditioning was off, we spoke to reception, they turned on the air, we left the hotel for a walk and when we came back the air was off again, we talked to reception again and they turned it on and then we slept, after 1 hour we woke up and the room was extremely hot, we were sweating, and the air wouldn't turn on at all, the reception sent a technician and he said \u201cI'll turn the air on again, but if it turns off soon, ask to change the room\u201d, so he turned the air on again and within 30 minutes stopped working again, we had a horrible night, we didn't sleep at all, the room was too hot, and our flight was in the early hours of the morning so we hadn't slept well the night before because of the airport\/plane, anyway, super stressful. The other night, when we returned from the city, we asked to change rooms and the manager replied that there was no more room, that he had nothing to do, at most, refund 100 dollars (from a reservation of more than 400 dollars), and gave us a small fan. Anyway, very bad service, we were supposed to live two days of a dream in NY and we lived a nightmare, because in addition to the air conditioning not working, we were next to a service room\/hotel storage room where they were supposed to store things and they did noise the whole two nights, so if we managed to sleep a little in the heat, we woke up to the noise. Bad experience, I don't recommend it. The least that should have been done is a 100% refund of what we paid to find another hotel and to alleviate the physical and mental damage. A detail is that when we arrived at the hotel to check in, the girl at reception said that we had been upgraded, but she was confused, it must have been a downgrade. Worst experience of my life, I wouldn't recommend this hotel even to an enemy.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

No natural light - I find this unacceptable- trying to get 2 children ready for the day via lamps is frustrating!! The least I expect from a room is daylight. This is not a one off incident a lot of rooms are like this and therefore they should be advertised as internal rooms and priced accordingly. Or just get the mechanism fixed so the blinds work, i don\u2019t think this is asking too much. We were unable to be moved as the hotel was full. On arrival the check in girl made a comment about me to the guest in front which is unprofessional and not needed after a long flight. I found the only friendly staff to be the cleaners and bellman. As per other reviews and therefore expected the rooms are dated, and need upgrading- warped doors, mould in the bathroom. It was too dark to see the condition of the actual room.

I booked the hotel purely based on the fact they have a rooftop pool to enjoy the sun before I headed home and the website made the hotel look stunning and modern. On one of the days I lay at the pool with the roof covered over, for over 2 hours. I asked 3 times when it would be opened, the woman on the third time said she would ask maintenance to come and open it. Over 45 minutes waiting and still they didn\u2019t opened it. I then went to the reception to enquire to be told the rain is due to be \u2018on and off\u2019 today. It hadn\u2019t rained once, it was due to be a cloudy day but surely the pool roof can be open. Everybody who came up to access the pool had commented on how small and different it is compared to the photos on the website. There is about 10 sun beds which is not enough to cater for the guests. \n\nAdditionally, the hotel website portrays a luxurious modern hotel, when in fact it is outdated, the corridors and bedroom have very poor lightening and need to be renovated as parts of the wall and bathroom doors were falling apart. Furthermore, to access the rooftop we had to climb stairs that were covered in debris of clearly unfinished building works. When then sitting at the rooftop bar we were asked to move as people came in, every other table had a reserved sign on it apart from ours yet non hotel guests seemed to get priority over us. \n\nI am extremely disappointed with this as I could have easily booked a cheaper hotel and enjoyed sun in Central Park. \n\nThe photos on the website do not give a true representation of the hotel and it is over priced for what it is. Other than a good location, I would not recommend this hotel. All hotel guests felt the same. I emailed a complaint on my second day staying and I am yet to hear back from them.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It appears the staff know keys stuggle as they tell you not to put it anywhere near anything electronic. Upon arrival we were given the wrong room number, so late at night we were trying to access a room that wasn't ours. The staff member laughed and gave us the correct room number only for the key not to work (we were just holding it) we went up and down the lifts twice! With no apology \nNote: When you check in, staff offer you bottled water (free), take it as there is nothing else in the hotel (other than pre booked roof top bar) \nRooms are basic, spacious, and clean but tired. The aircon unit is cold but so loud that you can barely hear yourself think, let alone talk. In the room, there is a fridge in the wardrobe, a small table iron board, iron, and an umbrella. \nNote: There is no safe in the room. This worried us as we had to keep hold of our passports all the time. \nThe bathroom is clean and has a hair dryer in the cupboard under the sink. The hotel provides toiletries which are nice. The shower has fast raining hot water, and there are plenty of sized towels.\nNote: There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room.\nThere is no bar in the hotel, no restaurant, or anywhere to get food or drink. \nThe rooftop bar is lovely but not owed by the hotel and is very expensive. However, of the 3 days we were here, it was closed to private functions.. Not great! The hotel doesn't have any issues with you bringing food and drink back to your room. Starbucks is next door for a nice morning coffee.\nThe pool is hilarious. The hotel website makes it look so beautiful. It's not! It's very tiny both in length and width, and there are maybe 5 sunbeds. The pool is open from 11 am, and weather permitted.

The front of house manager, Tommy Tinoco, security and doorman, housekeeping and engineers, restaurant staff at the Empire Rooftop have hospitality in a regal ranking. So during my birthday, Tommy complimentary upgraded my two full bed room to a junior king suite. Huge room, especially when in Manhattan. I wouldn\u2019t return if it wasn\u2019t for upper management that follows Tommy\u2019s example \u2014- guests aren\u2019t a number, a room filler. Guests even become friends with another; I should know, I have a few as Instagram friends now. New York and its visitors is addicting. Empire Hotel helps me to know I will make my holiday and birthday plans an annual thing like I have for the last two years. \n\nOk, so for my Independence Day (week) stay, I work as a music journalist so being next to Lincoln Center\u2019s Summer In The City was brilliant for my hobbies and networking. Rooftop views at the pool for guests from below catching Lincoln Center is worth all the magic one will tell friends and gloat on social media. Let\u2019s be real. PJ Clarkes is also next door and hopping. The atmosphere in Empire\u2019s lobby is full of ambience. I am a late owl because of my career, so it helps few guests, and security and the front desk is always there to chat a conversation with even the news on. New York doesn\u2019t sleep but because of this Upper West Side location, it\u2019s very neighborly and quiet when one does want to turn in. Plus, \u2728best\u2728 sleep of my mom\u2019s life. Mine too when I wasn\u2019t just a social butterfly visiting local bars in the LGBTQIA community nearby. That was fun just coming off of Pride celebrations. \n\nWe checked in early, it was no problem. Room was exceptionally clean and ready for my mother and I for our week together before I hop music tours and festivals again across the country. I lived in a hotel before (when I was 18 and have family as executive management with top amenities but also  stayed in several across all regions of U.S.  because of my career) Empire is cannon and incomparable for the experience and smiles from staff. The building is historical, take NYC history with you. We use Empire for quality time because you want to be around a staff that also is a family.\n\nVisits also include Fourth of July fireworks obviously with help from doormen on which train to go \u2014 so easy because stations are everywhere in the vicinity, \ud83d\udc51Taylor Swift Galleries \ud83d\udc51 for all the swifties!, celebrating New York Asian Film festival at Lincoln Film Center, Silent Disco Night or Jazz Night at Lincoln Center, Central Park, Columbus Shops Center, Bloomingdale\u2019s Outlet, AMC Movie Theater, visits to ABC News studios for Kelly and Mark, local bookstores and ice cream shops\u2014 my choice Van Leeuwen and Westsider Books, Whole Foods or the Walgreens next door for my grocery needs when not dining at The Empire Rooftop or grabbing a bagel across the street or Starbucks and just an overall appreciation of the buildings architecture.

A decent number of us stayed at the Empire Hotel, about 12 of us in all.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped out of the cab from the airport, it was just magical.  I've stayed other hotels in NYC, but this was by far the best.\n\nThe cab was greeted by a doorman.  He took my luggage into a separate room for a moment while I composed myself outside.  (It was a hellacious experience getting there due to booking the room through Booking.com.  Word to the wise. Never, EVER use Booking.com, but that's a story for another time.)\n\nI returned to the hotel after walking things off, was greeted by another doorman, who retrieved my luggage.  Escorted me to check in (another few moments of what the hell, as Booking.com had my name entered incorrectly!)  that got straightened out relatively quickly, and graciously, by the woman at the counter (I wish I could remember her name, She was AWESOME!)\n\nThe doorman escorted me to my room, brought my stuff inside and exited professionally, and politely.\n\nThe bed was calling me to just chill.  Go to turn on the TV, and LO!  It wasn't working right.  I called the desk, and someone was in my room in less than a minute!  I was astounded at the customer care!  He had to reset the SmartTV, which he did quickly and efficiently.\n\nI headed out to explore the area a bit and figure out where to eat.  The rest of the alums had not checked in yet.  Again, a doorman held the door for me.\n\nI was feeling better, and headed back to my room. Again, a doorman.\n\nI keep mentioning the doormen because other places I've stayed that had them did their thing when I arrived, but little else.  There was a lot of coming and going. There was ALWAYS a doorman.  I'm telling you, the doormen made the whole experience richer.\n\n \n\nI found some mediocre food at a place next door.  I didn't finish it.  I returned to the hotel, and decided to check out the rooftop bar and restaurant.  Lots of choices of small plates, and top shelf liquor, and really decent choices of beer.  The hostess was delightful and inviting.  The food was terrific!  I had some hamburger sliders, and chicken wings.  \n\nHeaded out again as I had managed to forget some things, despite my list.\n\nI'm telling you! The door people were incredible!!\n\nThe room itself was a decent size also.  I booked a superior queen sized room. The mattress and pillows were wonderful.  The carpeted floor was clean.  The bathroom was small, but functional.  There was sufficient storage for what I brought.  The shower!  Again! Holy whoa.  It was a rainfall shower thingy, with excellent water pressure. I've been in rooms where the water was barely a trickle.  Not at this place.\n\nThen I checked out the view!! HOLY MOLY!  Looking out at Lincoln Center and the little park across the street.  (Dante Park)\n\nOther alums had started arriving, and we met at the Rooftop.  I developed a mobility issue a few weeks back, and there was a lovely sitting area I simply could not get to as it appeared to be only accessible by two flights of stairs.  Well!  A friend mentioned this to one of the servers, and et voile!  The server told her there was a service elevator to get me up there.  Someone was called to operate it, who showed up a few minutes later, and there I sat. The top of the world.  Considering that about 24 hours earlier, the sky was filled with smoke from the Canada fires, the sky had completely cleared.  More small plates.  Chicken wings again, excellent fried calamari, excellently prepared fish tacos, great fries. And great mixed drinks.\n\nWhen we'd had enough partying up top, the server was asked to get the person who had the service elevator thing.  That person showed up at exactly the right time.\n\nI can not sing the praises of this place enough.  The alums staying there had the same things to say.\n\nThank you, Empire Hotel.  You made the weekend perfect!\n\n","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I was doubtful when looking at the size of the beds on arrival but they were very comfortable and the linens were soft. There is a lovely rooftop area with pool but we visited during the Canadian wildfires which made the air quality in New York not great for sitting out in.... Such a pity as its very lovely up there.  We did have pre opera food and drinks in the rooftop bar... Be sure to book as it was a lovely experience and books out. Checkout was very fast and again very warm and friendly.

The room is not only old and worn (dirty furniture, peeling paint, chipped furniture and paint) but not functional.

The refrigerator has no interior shelves.

They ended up sending us to a room that was slightly larger and nicer, but regardless of that, the carpets look, feel and smell, old and dirty.  I didn't want to walk barefoot in the room. The bathroom doors are rusty, with peeling paint and a sketchy looking bathroom door, the bathroom sink is so small it's like using an airplane bathroom, and there is just no space anywhere. There were a few weird stains on the wallpaper, the mattress bottom sheet wasn't fitted so it came right off the mattress, and the whole room smelled musty and old. The TV did not have any of the streaming services that many other NYC hotels have at this point - while isn't a requirement, it was another thing to make me consider only other hotels for the future. \n Housekeeping also started knocking in the morning starting at 7:55AM, when check out was not until Noon.  That just seemed bizarrely early.  The bed was comfortable, but that's about the only thing going for it. ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Don\u2019t stay here for good value\u2014 other options abound in other neighborhoods.\n\nIn one week I stayed here in a \u201cSuperior Two Double\u201d room, and elsewhere midtown at a major chain brand that cost about 20% less. The chain outperformed in every facet, setting aside specific location. (Both were 2-3 blocks from a Metro station)\n\nThe Empire Hotel may be historic, but based on my stay the rooms are falling apart. In one room, here\u2019s a list of the flaws:\n\nFilthy window with difficult drapes, a rod moving in the ceiling, split wood frame and peeling wallpaper\nHeadboard semi-detached from wall.\nThin walls so you can hear conversations in adjacent rooms.\nOutdated TV with no onscreen guide- look on the nightstand to select a channel. \nNoisy AC with front panel that falls off\nExtra-firm bed (some may like this)\nRotted wood, peeling paint, rusted metal, sloppy caulking\/painting all in the bathroom\nFaulty toilet that I learned to use by opening the lid and jiggling the flush valve\nSmall sink, no counter\nTowel rack that\u2019s bent with drywall anchors coming out of the wall.\nNo vent in or out of bathroom so basically it\u2019s a closet. \nBathroom reeked of pot when we arrived\nLoud AC unit that couldn\u2019t lower the room temp on our warm 70 degree day\u2014 I wonder what happens when it\u2019s 90?\n\nCheck-in was stressful with frazzled staff dealing with complaints from people checking into t die assigned rooms. Our desk host rushed through and handed us one key with a \u201cone key\u2019s okay right?\u201d. Uh, no sir there are two of us; we want tow keys. I asked about late checkout and was provided a chart that shows $50 per hour. Yikes. \n\nI have to admit that the lobby is nice and pleasant, though oddly the bar at one side seems to be permanently closed. The hotel has no food service or lobby cafe or store. The rooftop dining option seems to be an entirely separate business.\n\nWell, the location is rather convenient , but really I\u2019d rather stay midtown and rely on the subway or Uber to get uptown. \n\nYou\u2019ve been warned.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Since we live in Connecticut, and hate having to go home via a late night train, we decided to book a room at The Empire Hotel. \nWe've never stayed here before, and chose the place based on its extremely convenient location: it's basically just across the road from the Lincoln Center, and a very short walk from a few of our favourite restaurants. It has a bar on the roof, with bar food, but we didn't partake.\nIt's a nice old place - the entrance doors and lobby are inviting, and have an air of faded gentility (it's not often that I get a chance to use that phrase). \nCheck in was smooth enough, I suppose: we mentioned that our Met Opera Guild membership entitled us to late checkout, and were met with a blank stare. We overheard the lady standing next to us, showing her Met Opera Guild card, and asking for a discount. Looks like blank stares were in fashion.\nOnce we left the foyer, we found that some madman had redecorated the public areas, with wallpaper which resembled lots of blank picture frames: basically the perfect shape and colour to confuse a guest trying to find directions to his room.\nOur room? Tiny, stuffy and lacking in basic amenities. It didn't even have a chair. I'll post a picture. It had been renovated, very badly: the sink was shallow, so that when you turned on the tap, it sprayed water all over your lap, the curtains didn't actually keep out the light. the light switches were crooked, the toilet tissue was mounted on the wall behind the toilet door (nice trick - it took us a while to find that one).  There was only one bedside light. Bottom line - awful room.\nSince we were staying only one night, I didn't rush off to the front desk to complain.\nWhen we checked out, the guy on the desk winced, and said that we had booked an \"Express Room\". Apparently, these are crappy rooms, tucked into odd corners, to satisfy the needs of people who just need somewhere to spend the night, at short notice. He suggested that next time we visit, we ask for one of their other rooms.\n\nSo, bear that in mind if you want to stay here.\n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We simply love it there.  The location is unbeatable.  Everything is within reach, at the same time, it is not a terribly loud spot despite being bordered by Lincoln Center and Broadway.  It is rather calm, in fact.  The subway entrance is right across the street, 'minimal exposure if you need to get in there in bad weather.  The building is older, which means it was not built with the intention of squeezing you on square footage.  They are comfortable in that way, but not huge, which makes it affordable.   The rooms also begin on the fourth floor, so you get some reprieve from whatever the noise level may be outside.  And of course, half the rooms have an incredible view of Lincoln Center.  The lobby is beautiful and offers space to lounge around, as does a wrap-around balcony overlooking said lobby.  Our kiddo was little when we first stayed.  Through the years, he has always loved the hotel.  I cannot recall outside noise that ever kept him from sleeping, or any personalities in the lobby or elevators that were intimidating to a child.  It's a mellow place, is what I'm saying.  The staff has always treated us with terrific service.  Storing luggage with the bell hops is easy, as is valet parking.  The rooftop bar is a terrific setting, great for having a drink or just quickly stepping out to take a photo\/selfie with that stunning view.  Maybe best of all... I don't know of another hotel so close to Central Park, that is actually affordable to stay with.  Even if our itinerary doesn't include the park at first, we can always find time to wander in because the Empire is right there!","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Our stay began with one catalogue of errors after another, Fawlty Towers springs to mind. \n\nOn arrival we were met with the the most miserable, unhelpful, rude young lady.  It was clear from her tone that she was not happy to answer any questions, so once I asked one question, that was me done!\n\nThe elevator from the lobby had a very odd smell, once we reached our floor, I felt as though I was in the movie\u2019 The Shining\u2019! I had been transported back to the seventies, the corridor boasted the most out dated wallpaper I\u2019ve ever seen in a hotel. When we got to the room we were exhausted and it was late, so you can imagine my disappointment when the room key didn\u2019t work. Thank goodness the potter had a master key and let us into the room. Originally, we were given a room on the 8th floor which was changed the next day. We had a Superior room, however, there really wasn\u2019t anything superior about it! The room clearly hadn\u2019t been cleaned, the shower was dirty as well as having dried soap suds on the tiles, some dirty grey water came up through the plug whole. The toilet came making some strange sounds and there was a rusted shaving mirror hanging from the wall. \n\nAs previously stated, the next day we were moved to the 11th floor and here\u2019s why! After a day of sightseeing we just wanted to relax, whilst watching the tv we started hearing strange noises from the bathroom on investigation the toilet seemed to be filling up with water and then the water would just disappear, we put it down to the system in America (plus we didn\u2019t want to make a fuss). The next thing we knew the water was overflowing in the bathroom. I called the reception , however after waiting nearly 15 minutes for anyone to arrive, we had to try and stop the water ourselves from leaving the bathroom, so we put down towels, to no avail! I had to leave my children to go to reception, the male receptionist acted blas\u00e9 about the situation. I literally definitely waited for someone to come with me back to the room. You can imagine his surprise when we got upstairs, to find the water was now in the corridor and had cover most of the bedroom floor. We were told to gather our belongings and that a porter would come and take them to another room. Needless to say no porter arrived so we took ourselves to reception with all our baggage. At the reception I was told \u201cYou need to go to the the 11th floor the porter has your key.\u201d By this point I was so annoyed I just didn\u2019t have the energy to chase after a porter, who we\u2019d just passed us going into the elevator with another couple\u2019s bags and had said nothing about having our key! \n\nOn another occasion, the elevators (including the service ones) stopped working. We had not been notified by the hotel and if wasn\u2019t for the cleaner we wouldn\u2019t have known. She tried to send us down the service elevator but realised none of them were working, so she sent us down some service stairs instead. We got completely lost but when we encountered the security staff and maintenance, none were helpful. We could have been up to no good and they just couldn\u2019t care less, they continued with their conversations. I had to approach them and ask for the way out. \n\nI\u2019ve never been to any hotel that doesn\u2019t offer complimentary tea\/coffee with a kettle in the room, so this was a first. I usually carry my fire stick to watch tv in the evenings, however, the hotel\u2019s tv are so old that there were no HDMI outlets usb ports, thankfully I\u2019d brought my laptop with me. \n\nAlthough the superior room was small, the beds were comfortable and the bedding was reasonably clean. The hotel is situated in good location with many restaurants and nearby tourist attractions. Central Park is a 5 minute walk from the hotel, Fifth Avenue and the Rockefeller Center are a 20 minute walk, the Lincoln Center is round the corner and there is a nearby shopping mall not too far away. \n\nI paid $2,187.60 to stay here for 8 days and it certainly wasn\u2019t worth the money.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In NYC sometimes hotel rooms are small, but with thoughtful touches for storage\/maximizing space. Not here. There weren\u2019t any places to really hang clothes because the fridge was in the closet. A tired looking chair was randomly placed. The 2 drawers on the bedside table wouldn\u2019t close and we kept bumping into them. Most of the furniture was scratched and shabby. The whole ambiance was tired and worn looking. While it might have been clean, I really didn\u2019t want to walk in the room without slippers or socks. \n\nThe bathroom was terrible. Paint was peeling and you could see dirt in the corners when the door was closed. It made us want to keep the door open since it was so yucky to see the back of the door. Towels would be taken and not replaced consistently. The shelf in the bathroom was worn and nicked, which made me worried it wasn\u2019t clean.\n\nFront desk personnel were pleasant and promptly sent up ice when we requested it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was a place to sleep.

We had 2 towels folded in the shower. No wash cloths and toiletries enough for one person. We called for more basic supplies and they were delivered.

I realize this is an older hotel but updating furniture, etc is a doable investment.\nThe air conditioning and heating unit is probably the original or at least it looked like it. The controls were deep into the unit and lopsided as if it was hanging on by a thread. We all tried pushing every button and turning every dial to gain some comfort. We never found an ideal level.\nThe rooms have no coffee makers, no ice buckets (not even sure there is an ice machine\u2014we never found one) but there is a small college sized fridge\u2026go figure.

Seriously in need of a makeover, with dirty brown carpets, barely any lighting, little storage and drab decor and furniture. Maybe it was cool in the 70s. \n- Beyond tiny bathrooms with the paint peeling off\n- Staff not particularly helpful or friendly and no concierge which, considering so much has closed down in NYC, would have been helpful\nDon't expect luxury, charm or any small personal touches. Such a shame as with this location and cost per room, the hotel could be so much more. But as a very basic base for exploring NYC it does the job.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

She was great. \nThe stay was ugh.. the rooms are old and the AC has major problems as they moved me twice until I finally got a working room. I tried to explain my stay to the agents at the desk and no one cared to help me besides that young lady that checked me in. She listened and pointed to he manager to assist me. BTW the manager with red hair as she didn\u2019t give me a name and didn\u2019t want to give me her name; was very rude and didn\u2019t seem to care to help me and only rolled her eyes and said I\u2019ll send someone up to check on my room.

The next day comes and I come down to speak to the other young lady to let her know about my experience and why I wanted to leave. She than appointed to a male manager by the name of Tom. He gladly assisted me and my concerns. To even just giving us a call to check if we are okay with our new room. Those are the little things a guest like to experience. A place that care and makes you feel at home. Now Tom went out his way to get us something amazing. It indeed helped with our stay as we stood an additional 3 night and enjoyed our time.

On arrival, we were shown to suites at different ends of the hall, one of which had dim lighting in the bathroom (which happened to be an issue for us because we were in town for a dressy event). Adam at the front desk was extremely responsive and kindly switched that second room to another one.  Our views from the front of the hotel, which overlooks the broad, angled intersection of Broadway and Columbus, were really spectacular, including a tree-filled park directly ahead and the plaza of Lincoln Center to the left.  \n\nWe went up to the rooftop bar one evening and found it attractively lit and spacious, with friendly service by the host staff and our server.  (We were sorry to learn that some fellow guests were refused access to the rooftop elevator half an hour before the bar's closing time on Friday night\u2013\u2013a tad unexpected in \"the city that never sleeps\"!)  \n\nWe also had fun taking a toddler to the pool one afternoon, but please be aware that the pool deck is reached via at least two flights of iron stairs, and the pool itself is really just a glorified space to dunk oneself (I'm guessing it's about 6-7 feet wide and 20-25 feet long\u2013\u2013my very rough estimate, but certainly it's nowhere near the size of a standard motel or apartment-house pool).  The pool deck, however, is spacious, with great views and lots of seating, including some little cabana-like areas. \n\nWe discovered the 2nd-floor Mezzanine shortly before our departure, and it offers very nice, separate seating groups and would be a good spot for guests who need a place to \"park\" themselves outside their rooms.  \n\nOverall, the decor is aiming for a contemporary feel, and although the wallpaper does admittedly strike some as too bold and dark (and even \"dingy,\" according to some reviewers we read beforehand), we were impressed that all the spaces were good, the hotel clean, the service excellent and unobtrusive, beds comfortable, towels thick and abundant, and outdoor noise nonexistent thanks to excellent windows and steady, effective air-conditioning. For those whose chief booking concern is fire safety, it might be wise to request a room fairly close to the elevators, since the fire stairs are located near the elevators as well, but I will mention that the elevators have a fairly loud ding. (This was not an issue for us\u2013\u2013our rooms were not immediately across from the elevator bank\u2013\u2013and for all I know it's not a problem even in the closer rooms.)  \n\nFor an improved experience, my wish list would be: cleaner windows (my photos were strategically taken through the clearest part, but the experience of looking out is blearier), a better-positioned shaving\/makeup mirror (it's mounted so that anyone under 5'10\" can't use it\u2013\u2013and, while we're making wishes, a lighted version of the mirror), a better-positioned safe (we had to get down on our knees and hunch over to find the right buttons), and a shower cap (a small amenity that makes a difference to some of us).  None of these things are deal-breakers, of course, and we look forward to booking at the Empire again.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

We had to literally beg for rooms on the same floor which we eventually were able to have.\n2. The hotel staff was completely ill-mannered toward us from the day we checked in.\n3.

Everything got even WORSE at the end of the first week of our stay when we returned to our rooms in the evening and found out that two of my purses had been STOLEN from my room. Realizing someone had broken into our room, I was very worried and I asked for help from the reception staff but I was told to wait until 8 in the morning (for 12 hours). They didn't even offer us a different room or tried to call the police, they just ordered us to wait in our rooms like there wasn't a burglar in our room just hours ago. Of course, I couldn't sleep a wink and waited for the security to arrive in the morning, meaning, there is no legitimate security present in the evening and at night in this hotel. The security came in the morning and checked the security cameras and CONFIRMED that a man had STOLEN two of my purses and left the hotel. They insisted that I had left my door open and that's how the burglar must have gotten in. That's ridiculous because my husband and I both confirmed that the door was locked before we left and also the hotel didn't have a camera which was pointed to our hotel room door which could record their unfounded claim that the door was left open. It was a mean manipulation strategy to get out of liability. We immediately changed to a different hotel to be safe. Tired of the Empire Hotel's irresponsibility, I went to the police and spent the next three days trying to find ways to make up for my loss. The hotel manager stalled me for weeks as if he would compensate for the bags but in the end I had to pay for the incompetence of Empire Hotel.\n\nOverall, it was a very unnerving experience to stay at this hotel and I think you should avoid it at all costs.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

But I am probably just imagining that\u2026at least, I hope so. The pool was not open because it wasn\u2019t summer yet\u2026fair enough\u2026and the gym was closed for renovations. Anyway, for the pluses\u2026the room was fairly spacious for a NYC hotel, and I was impressed with the very comfortable bed. The housekeeper did a fantastic job of cleaning the room. The location was superb\u2026right near Columbus Circle and a short walk to Central Park, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, lots of restaurants and the subway. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The price was reasonable considering the location. I would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Not from the street, from the 500 air con units that blast all day and all night. You have two options; sleep with your window open and hear the noise, or boil as the hotel air con doesn\u2019t work all that well. \n\nShowers are ok, housekeeping is fine and the place is clean enough.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":671150,"title":"First time, disappointed","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-04-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I don\u2019t know WHO waited on some of you people that RAVED about the staff, but I did NOT have a positive experience with one member of the staff.  First and fore most for those of you reading this review:  this property, even with its good location, is OVERPRICED.  By the time all the taxes, fees, and nonsense were added, my rate was over $55 per night higher than anticipated, and for the quality, and condition of the rooms, and halls, and lack of things, it\u2019s not worth the price. \nI booked through a travel site, MONTHS in advance, and am fairly certain I requested a room with a bath TUB, not just a shower. I walk a lot, have back and hip issues, and like to soak at the end of the day. In any event, even if I forgot that request on the initial booking, I was sent a note from the property, where I requested it, still weeks in advance.  I did arrive at the property early, 10:30 am (ish), and let me state that the first thing I told the female staff member at the desk, was that this was my first time at this hotel.  I knew I would not be able to check in, but I let them know I was there and that I was not happy with the total rate for the 3 nights, as it was much higher than I was quoted, but what could you do?  She would not waive any of the extra charges, including one that provided me with water and wi-fi!!!  When I asked if she saw the note about the tub, she confirmed that she did AND indicated that she had a room to offer me that would meet my requirements, but of course, it was not ready yet.  No problem, I told her, I would be back.  I heard the other staff member checking in another guest at the desk, telling him that now that they knew he was there, he would put a rush on the room cleaning.   I was not offered that courtesy.  She did say she would text me when my room was ready.  I received no such message.  Check in was 3 pm. When I arrived back at the hotel at approximately 2:40, asking please, was my room available, a gentleman checked me in and I went on up with the bellman and my luggage and shopping.  Upon entrance, I immediately saw that my room had NO tub, just a not so nice shower \u2013 big, but beat up and in need of updating.  I went downstairs and the poor nice young man said he did not have a room to meet my request. I offered to take a different type of room if that would help and NO.  She was standing at the desk, and I told him that when I was there over 4 hours ago, she indicated that she could meet my request.  She said nothing, he avoided eye contact, and I said I was not happy to which he replied \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it was only a request\u201d.  No offer to do anything!!!  No bottle of wine sent to my room, no slight reduction in my rate, nothing more than a verbal apology.\nHere's the rest: \nThe halls are EXTREMELY dark, can barely get your key card in the slot. The place was NOT clean, and the bathroom was run down.  I did have good maid service, for which I gladly tipped.  The only redeeming feature, was the roof top bar\/restaurant.  The hotel bar, which looked cool, was closed despite stating this on their web site:\nJoin us for appetizers and cocktails at our iconic Lobby Bar \nalong with pictures of the lobby bar! \nThere are NO ice machines on the floors.  I was told they were too loud and the walls are thin, for which I can attest to, as I could hear people in the next room as clearly as if they were in mine.  You had to bring your ice bucket downstairs, where other staff members (not that female at the desk) gladly filled it.\nWhen I tried to catch a little TV, it stated, no signal, or not available, or something, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work.\nA friend told me once that when you travel, your accommodations should be at LEAST at the level of what you have at home, if no better.  My home is bright, and clean, and not run down.  This hotel was not better than my home.   :  ( \nI usually stay somewhere in midtown, but wanted to be close to the park for morning walks.  I would not stay here again.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

And the Empire Hotel\u2019s location can not be beaten in NYC. But for the great location you have to sacrifice and here you will sacrifice amenities.\nThe Empire is virtually a few steps away from the Lincoln Center, a few more from Grand Central Park and Julliard, and a chipping wedge from Columbus Circle. Taxis and Ubers are constantly in front of the hotel entrance. All the subway lines pass through Columbus Circle and the bus stops are right there.\nWhen hungry there is PJClarke\u2019s, Rosa\u2019s, and The Smiths within a few minutes or less walk. \nThe hotel is extremely clean and the cleaning staff receives kudos.\nThe front desk is very helpful but the door guys will go the extra mile for you.\nNow the amenities, like wi-fi, glass drinking glasses, mini bar, etc. are missing or very bad. The wi-fi really sucks and really doesn\u2019t qualify as wi-fi. Without piggy backing off our telephone we would have been without it.\nBut the hotel saves it\u2019s ranking by having a roof top bar!

This was deemed a 4 star hotel..it deserves 1! The lobby and front desk staff were lovely and the location is great but that\u2019s where the compliments end. The rooms are super small and dark. The lighting was terrible. Our showers were luke warm at best the entire 3 days. The bathroom was only big enough for 1 person to enter at a time. The beds were double not queen. The air conditioner\/ heater was an old unit with a dial and though we had the temperature at the lowest setting it was still really hot in the room. The blind in the room on the one window randomly fell so it was all the way down and it was so old it didn\u2019t go back up. The furniture is all really old. One of our lamps looked like it would fall over at any minute. There is no closet space whatsoever and no drawers . The closet contained a mini fridge with a safe on top of it. We had a hairdryer that did not work. There is no coffee in the hotel at all. The gym was closed due to Covid . There was a bar and restaurant on the lobby floor that was closed. The only food available was at the rooftop bar. On our one excursion to the roof top bar one of the elevators was stopped because people were stuck in it and it took a long time for them to find someone with a key to get them out.

Location was great - right next to the Lincoln Center and quick walk to restaurants and the ABC building.  Check-in was smooth.  I was given a room on the 11th floor (their top floor).  Upon walking into the room, I noticed it was hot and stuffy.  The thermostat wasn't working so I called down to the front desk.  They sent up an engineer, who wasn't able to fix the problem.  He let the front desk know I wanted to change rooms.  Luis from the front desk called me right away, was super nice, asked if I needed any help with my luggage, and asked me to come down to get a new room assignment.  He explained that the 11th floor does get a little warm.  He was about to assign me a room on a lower level, but when I mentioned the great view from the 11th floor he had another idea.  He actually upgraded me to an amazing room on the 11th floor.  The new room was amazing - living room, 2 bathrooms, bar, etc...   Truthfully, it was still a little warm, but not nearly as warm as the first room.  Unfortunately, I am a light sleeper and there was a lot of noise coming from above (the rooftop bar??) so I didn't get a great night's sleep.  But that's not really the hotel's fault.  In the end, I would recommend this hotel.  However, if you like your room on the cooler side, I would request a lower floor.  And again, special shout-out to Luis, who went out of his way to make sure I had a good experience.    ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We had booked a triple room for 3 adults but the first room we was in wasn't even big enough for 1 there was no room to put clothes a tiny hole to put a few clothes also no where to put any suitcases... especially because all three of us had taken large suitcases with us as we were due to stay in the hotel for a week. So originally we were very disappointed with the room because it was lacking in space for general living space! Also being three adults we were happy with two double beds but when we entered the room we then realised that the double beds are small double beds... which we were not aware of as the website does not specify, so if you are planning on sharing a bed in a triple room DONT, as the beds were basically a large single! As we were unhappy with our room due to the lack of space we headed down to reception just to ask if they had any other rooms available that were bigger as we didn't have anywhere to put anything let alone being able to even open our suitcases in the room. The receptionist Louis was very helpful and kind, he managed to transfer us to a bigger room as he explained that we were there for my daughters 21st and he wanted to make it as special as possible for us, he also did not charge us for the upgrade do to agreeing that our particular room could not fit 3 adults in comfortably. Our new room we were transferred to was a lot more spacious and actually had a walk in wardrobe to put our clothes in and to store our suitcases in! So that we didn't have to leave them on the floor and potentially trip over them! This is the type of room you should stay in if there is more than 2 of you or you actually want space to put your items, the only thing about the bigger room was that the beds were yet again a 'small double'\/'large single' which is not ideal if you have to share... apparently all those rooms had the same size beds which isn't great especially as there is room to put a larger bed. But apart from the room drama the hotel was amazing the staff are very helpful and friendly! From letting them use the reception phone to call out or giving you directions round NY or hailing you a cab they were just great! If you stay at The Empire Hotel you need to check out the rooftop bar and restaurant the breakfast is great and the views up there are just amazing, you could sit up there all day just watching New York fly by!!!

I was there for Westminster so it was conveniently located and the online price was pretty good. I went in with pretty low expectations as I had never stayed there. I was please to be greeted (and helped throughout the stay) by very friendly door staff and very accommodating desk staff. The lobby was very warm and relaxing. Almost  a throwback to another time. I ended up with a king room with a view of a small park and Lincoln Center. Although it was on the \"first floor\" (not lobby level)  I noticed very little outside noise. The carpet and wall paprer were kind of interesting choices but very boutique hotel type. I thought it was different but cool. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable but low to the ground, as were the chair and desk. The room was small but I think that's a NYC thing, although it was bigger than the Doubletree that I also stayed in. The bathroom was extremely small but clean and efficient use of the little space It did the job. They have a super cool roof level bar. Definitely not a place for a cheap drink but apparently very popular. Over all a great stay.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The place is nice and my checkin went smoothly. I slept pretty well. I woke up and went to the gym located within the hotel. Half the weights were missing and the treadmill kept getting stuck. This may seem inconsequential for most however I travel quite a bit for work and book conditionally on the fact that there is a gym on the premises so I can maintain a modicum of normalcy while traveling. So when the equipment was not so great, I was a bit displeased. However I kept up my optimism because I figured it wasn't all bad. Then I got to my room, and decided it was time for a good old fashioned shower. That idea quickly fell flat because the shower head was busted. It did dispense some water, but however it was remarkably slow. I packed my things quickly and made my way out of the hotel. ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Over the last couple of times, we have booked our stay at the Empire Hotel.  It is near a subway stop, across the street from the Lincoln Center, lots of restaurant and shop all within easy walking distance - there is even a Starbucks around the corner!  \n\nThe hotel is a bit older, which makes it charming!  How I rate the room are by the cleanliness  of the room and bed comfort.  The bed is very comfortable and clean.  But one point I want to make it the level of service from the staff, especially the front desk staff.  We booked the wrong date, on a busy weekend for NYC.  The front desk staff got us a room, rate stayed the same, and quickly got the room ready!  We plan to say there on upcoming trip in May 2020. ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On paper this is quite a premium New York City hotel. Just off Columbus circle, minutes from Central Park and a short walk or cab drive to broadway. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if we were a bit unfortunate because we had a huge flight delay which meant we arrived at 4am, but the welcome was a bit underwhelming to say the least, especially for a city that doesn\u2019t sleep apparently as there was no one to greet us at the door or help with luggage and the guy on the front desk wasn\u2019t hugely welcoming either, I hardly got two words out of him.\n\nOn getting to the room it was freezing, so we put the heater on which was the noisiest thing ever. I had messaged ahead to see if they had synthetic bedding which they say they do, but what they actually mean is they have synthetic pillows and a blanket, which is useless in December lets be honest.\n\nThe next morning after very little sleep we went to try breakfast, which is served in the rooftop lounge. There was no signage anywhere to say that this could only be accessed from the hotel reception, and we got pretty lost in the hotel side trying to find it. I had asked in advance if they had gluten and dairy free options which they said was no problem, but when we got there the guy offered me omelette and chips at 9am, and they didn\u2019t have gluten free bread or any specifically gluten free options which wasn\u2019t what I was informed. We gave up on eating at the hotel and found somewhere else, which was actually much better and less expensive.\n\nI asked the guy at the desk if there was any chance of moving to a room with a less noisy heater and also if we could get a duvet, he was quite abrupt to be honest and said \u2018look lady were fully booked, I\u2019ll see if I can g set a guy to look at the heater but it will be later I get around to it.\u2019 When we got back to the hotel they had sorted the noisy heater  but still no duvet which I chased up with housekeeping and they were much more helpful.\n\nWe had a room on the sixth floor. The room itself was ok, it could do with a lick of pint if I\u2019m honest and some of the plug sockets were loose which wouldn\u2019t happen in the UK because of our laws, but the size was good, the bed was comfy, and it was quite a decent view of Columbus Circle. The shower was good, but the bathroom would have benefitted from an extractor fan.\n\nWe had another issue with the standard of service was when we were late for dinner, had got locked out of the room because our keys had stopped working and needed an umbrella. We went to reception to explain and he gave us a new key, but even though he had them available would not lend us an umbrella to stop us being any later through no fault of our own which ended up costing us an extra 40 dollars keeping an Uber waiting by the time we had waited in line for a new key and then had to go back to the room. This to me was pretty basic, they could have easily left a note on our room about the extra umbrella if they were so worried about it going missing.\n\nWe managed to grab a drink in the hotel bar on the last evening and the service was much better here, as too was it on the rooftop bar in the evening when we went there afterwards and the waitress was very clued up on allergies and what was on the evening menu.\n\nOverall I\u2019m told this is a good hotel experience for New York, but for me I found it quite a disappointing experience and I\u2019m not sure I would stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We arrived about 9pm on a Monday and was greeted by several memebers of lovely staff. Check in was quick and simple, we was told about how we get our 2 free bottles of water each day.\n\nOur room was on the 6th floor next to the liftt but not once could you hear any noise coming from it. Our room was perfect size for me and my partner and the bed was the most comfiest bed i have ever slept in and i wish i could take the mattress home with me. Although we kept our rook clean and tidy every day after a long day in the city we came back to find the room spotless and bathroom supplies topped up.\n\nOn our lasy day we finished our day of early and went back to the hotel to sit in the lobby to wait for our transfer the hotel had no issue with this we also got a drink from the lobby bar while we waited. The hotel stored our suitcases for us for the day which again was another simple and quick process.\n\nThe hotel is in a great location with lots of shops near by and a subway station with less then a minutes walk, central park a few minutes walk away and times square was about a 10 minute walk\n\nOverall i was gutted about leaving the hotel and will 100% stay here again on my next vist. amazing hotel ,lovely caring staff and great location what else do you need.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However, the other heater made such a horribly loud noise that it kept us up all night, which with a 2 year old was a nightmare.  We asked for it to be fixed, and they said that is just the way the old steam heaters work, so we ended up sleeping without heat the next 2 nights.  It was better to be freezing that not sleep due to the horrid noise.\n- Check in - room was not ready until 30 min after check out time.  Would not have been a huge deal, but in combination with everything else, it was just one more negative\n- Bathroom - Felt dingy, and there was a rusty wall\/side of shower that I suppose was to make it look \"industrial,\" but it stuck out oddly and you had to be extra careful not to stub your toe on the rusty area that jutted out\n- Room - Everything seemed a bit dingy and old.

The hotel is located steps away from Lincoln Center, and convenient to the Columbus Circle metro stops.  The interior is beautiful and sophisticated, with a great vibe to the lobby.  Front desk crew and valet are all warm and extremely helpful.  As with many NYC older hotels, the rooms can be stifling in the winter.  We couldn't cool down our room from 76 degrees, so the front desk executed a switch right away.  The updated rooms with doubles have a clever sleeping arrangement, with each bed placed apart, and the sq footage was a welcome surprise.  The fitness center needs updating if that is an important part of your stay.  But plenty of places to run right outside, not a deal breaker.

We had never been to New York or America before so were unsure what to expect on both accounts. When we arrived at the hotel, there was a door person to assist with our luggage straight away who took us straight to reception. We were greated warmly at reception and given complementary bottles of water. The room we stayed in had two double beds and a bathroom with a toilet, basin and shower. Although the decor is slightly dated, we could not fault the hotel on cleanliness. The room was cleaned every day, with towels changed every day and the sheets were changed at least once during our stay. The hotel also had a turn down service which was a bonus. As for location, you cannot fault the hotel at all. It was about a 10\/15 minute walk to Central Park and about 20\/25 minutes to Times Square. We wanted somewhere that was not too central, but not to far out of the action either and this hotel was perfect. Directly surrounding the hotel, there are a number of places to eat and drink, and if you are looking for something quick for breakfast, I would definitely recommend breads bakery which is directly accross the road. The hotel will also store your bags for you on checkout day if needs be. Checkout time is 12pm, and our taxi wasn\u2019t until 1pm so we choose to have one last walk around that morning before it was time to depart to the airport. The hotel was more than happy to keep our bags for us until we returned. Depending on traffic (and New York traffic can be pretty hectic) a ride to the airport can take anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours. I would 100% recommend this hotel whether it\u2019s your first time in New York or your a regular visitor. ","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is literally a 30 second walk from Lincon center, and the 1, 2 and 3 line underneath.  The hotel has a rooftop restaurant\/bar, with finger foods and drinks, which were a bit expensive, but par for Manhattan.  Two biggest things:  condition of the rooms and the resort fee.  the rooms, most specifically, the bathrooms, need updating.  Paint is peeling, doors and roughed up, etc.  There are several pictures from other guests, so you can find them on here.  Also, the resort fee is a joke.  I will be challenging them, as $22 for a hotel that does not have a pool open, and I don't intend to use the gym is basically charging you for internet (which they aren't allowed to do) and water.  \n\nOTHERWISE, this was a good, albeit a bit expensive, stay.

It's uncomfortable to work on a laptop and watch, so I just turned the TV off.

The room had a massive flat screen TV, fridge, hair dryer, iron and ironing board and the alarm clock had USB charging points in it which I used to charge my smart watch and phone each night. The small clothes hanging area is in beside the safe and fridge and was ok for shirts etc but no good for long maxi dresses which had to hang over the edge as they were too long for the space - no great inconvenience.   \n\nThe bed was comfortable and everything worked as it should but the noise from the AC system was deafening at times. My husband had to wear ear plugs but I was so tired from the walking I managed just fine.  The bathroom was very small but the shower was large and really powerful which I've never experienced in the States before. Bathroom was a bit tired and could do with a revamp but was clean.  Housekeeping in general was very good, room was cleaned, towels restocked, never ran out of toiletries etc.  They give you soap, shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the bathroom.\n\nWe used the restaurant in the hotel for breakfast most mornings which is $25 per person for a buffet breakfast which includes the usual continental items such as cereals, fruits, pastries etc but there are also hot options such as french toast, pancakes, sausages, eggs and bacon and there is an omelette station too. We were very happy with the quality of the breakfast items and the view out of the restaurant is amazing.\n\nHotel was close to a couple of subway stations as well as some lovely restaurants and was only a block away from Central Park.

Rooms are NYC small, although comparable to the competition.  It's not great value for money, but not bad either.  You just have to get your head around that in NYC $200 doesn't get you the same as in a lot of other places.  Some details of the finish were shoddy - the bathroom door had been repaired with drywall mud or wood putty and not sanded, as had a large section in the main room.  Not terrible, just not quite the quality of details I would expect.  Internet was variable - sometimes great other times not.

We had booked a twin queen room,  but on arrival were shown to the smallest room I have ever seen with a single queen bed squeezed in.  Needless to say, we turned straight around and spoke to reception,  who confirmed we had in fact been booked into a queen room as per the request from TUI.  There was no problem upgrading and luckily they had a junior suite available, which is what we wanted in the first place.  I Can't fault the staff as they were always friendly and very helpful.  \n\nThe location is very good and for first time New Yorkers like ourselves, wasn't too much of an assault on the senses.  We arrived late on the first day due to customs taking 3 hours!  Yes, 3 hours at JFK.    Anyway,  by the time we arrived and were able to sort out our room,  we were so tired,  we just wanted somewhere local to have a bite to eat.  Luckily,  there is an American style restaurant just on the corner called PJ Clarkes and we had a very pleasant beer and a burger.  The next morning we had breakfast just across the road at The Smith,  which has great reviews and while we were there was always very busy.  If you're staying in the area,  I would suggest you eat here at least once as the food is excellent and sets you up for the day. \n\nFinally,  if you need a quiet room to sleep,  I would s suggest staying somewhere where the air conditioning isn't so loud.  My wife had to were eat plugs it was that loud.

I don\u2019t often write reviews, but when I do it\u2019s to celebrate a real find. Our exceptional experience here was due to the outstanding staff. From the moment we arrived, I felt welcomed and appreciated. Lovely Maggi at the front desk is the epitome of graciousness. You knew right away you were in the good hands of someone who really cared about you and making you feel comfortable. Her natural elegance elevated the check-in experience. I also enjoyed the humor and courtesy of Chris at the front desk that morning. We came in after a red-eye which can be a grind. The professionalism and personal touch of each member of the staff helped start my stay in New York off right. Eugene at the front door was the personification of hospitality. He continued to be a valuable resource for me throughout my stay \u2013 recommending some outstanding options for morning coffee and other helpful answers to my many questions. Best of all, when I needed some service outside of his hours on duty (like car service for our trip to the airport), he connected me with his colleagues Brandon who, along with Naz, continued the standard Eugene set for me of excellent service from the Empire Hotel staff. The hotel building is over 100 years old and I enjoyed the charm of the vintage touches. The pushbuttons inside the elevators have a patina that remind you of all the history in the building. The main lobby is dark and cool (perhaps in keeping with the bar area it encloses), but still comfortable with lots of seating and a grand staircase to the mezzanine. Our 6th floor room was cozy, but included a large bed, dresser, desk, and two chairs. I loved the bold choice of the dark print wallpaper in the hallways. Our room had a big window with a nice view of the street. I never heard noise from adjacent rooms and only the occasional activity in the hallways. The bathroom had a terrific shower! It had both an overhead rain-shower and hand-held wand options. Not much counterspace around the sink, but lots of shelf space nearby. There was a small refrigerator in the closet. Also in the closet \u2013 a sturdy full-size umbrella the hotel provides for you to use during your stay (you can take it home for an additional $30 charge to your room). No in-room coffee, but you do get two free bottles of Fiji water each day (which you pick up yourself from the front desk). An innovation I really enjoyed was the magnetized \u201cdo not disturb\/please make up the room\u201d sign. You just stick it on the outside of your door with the appropriate message facing out. No more annoying door-hanging signs fluttering away when you close the door. Be sure to visit the rooftop restaurant!! Stunning views from multiple levels. Coffee and a menu as well as a full bar. The Empire Hotel location is outstanding \u2013 across the street from Lincoln Center and a Duane Reade drugstore right around the corner. We had terrific meals at restaurants on the same block. You can quickly connect to all the city has to offer via close by subway or a cab. A tiny park across the street is a welcome oasis when you want a break. The Empire Hotel is a gem that shines bright thanks to the good people who work there.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Entrance and doormen were very lovely and welcoming, great lobby and a good start to our stay. We were given a very nice room overlooking the street with a slight view of central park and lovely buildings opposite. Bathroom was smallish but nice enough. The pool however was disappointing. We all laughed out loud when we first saw it as it was much smaller than we had anticipated but was happy enough and not overly surprised as the hotel seemed good value for a pool and the UWS location. Annoyingly however the pool had such high levels of chlorine that after half an hour on day 1 our eldest son couldn't even swim in it as his eyes stung so badly. Throughout the day other children visited the pool and complained of the same thing-burning and stinging eyes. It was so bad that their eyes totally puffed up and they didn't even want to go in it. You could smell it strongly on their swimwear. We did complain about it to the pool attendant but nothing was done. it remained that way throughout our stay. Although sadly, he was filling in for someone else apparently so he was pretty disinterested. Such a shame as that was the point of us staying in a hotel and not with friends. \nThe deck itself was small but fine and the bar\/roof top was very nice with fantastic views and helpful staff. All in all I would recommend this hotel but do not book here for the pool, especially if it's for children.

But I can say that everything negative that has been written about this hotel is true \u2013 and more.\n\nI was originally given a room with an air conditioner that did not function. But it was the middle of the summer! The temperature outside was 35 degrees celsius \/ 90 Fahrenheit. The room needed a functioning air conditioner desperately. The curtains were torn and the shades were broken. Not good for a room full of afternoon light. I complained, but was told there were no other rooms, I complained louder \u2013 and they relented, but only when someone went up to see if I was telling the truth. Go figure.\n\nThe rest of this review is about the new (second) room and the hotel itself.\n\nThere is Good, there is a lot of Bad and some Ugly.\n\nTHE GOOD: The lobby is spacious and quite hip in its tackiness. I liked the lobby bar, although expensive, and they don\u2019t offer complimentary peanuts or pretzels.  You have to buy snacks and that, too, is pricey, but all in all, it was a comfortable place to hang out in and have a drink after a busy day. \n\nMost of the receptionists were quite nice \u2013 if you weren\u2019t complaining. Unfortunately there was so much to complain about that in the end it tried their nerves and mine. But there were a couple who kept their cool and remained charming.\n\nThe location is excellent. My room looked out over Lincoln Center.\n\nOnce I finally got a room with a functioning air-conditioner, the air conditioner worked fine and was not at all loud, thank goodness.\n\nThe bed was great, as well as the assortment of pillows.\n\nMy room was spacious (it was more expensive than a standard double, a Deluxe King).\n\nHousekeeping did a good job.\n\nTHE BAD: The roof-top bar was extremely loud and crowded. It was hard to carry on a conversation. The pool was tiny. Actually, ridiculous.\n\nThe rooms I and my friends occupied were VERY tired, almost shabby. The switch on the standing lamp was broken, so it was hard to turn on and off. The window shades were hard to pull up and down, but they did work. The furniture was chipped, the rug had stains, the bathroom is tiny and there is very little shelf space. The safe was placed at the bottom of the night table, cramped in between the bed and the window. You had to get down on your knees to open it and put things in. Very uncomfortable. \n\nTHE UGLY:\n\nThe windows were filthy!\n\nThe Internet was a joke and was integrated into the stupid resort fee of $25.00 a day! The Internet was sloooow and I and my friends were continually, any time of day or night, bumped out \u2013 right in the middle of reading something or writing an email or whatever. We complained. And complained. And finally they did not charge us the resort fees.\n\nAll in all: if I didn't have to, I wouldn't come here again. It was chosen because it was a five-minute walk from where we had to be and was reasonably priced. But in the end, I would rather pay a bit more and feel like the owner of the hotel really cared.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location is perfect - only a block away from Central Park, short walk to the main sights of the city. But still in a quite area so you're away from the commotion of the city. \n2. The staff is wonderful - the doormen and concierge are very helpful, polite and friendly. The front desk staff was friendly and very accommodating. The staff at the pool lounge were awesome. The cleaning staff always friendly when passing them in the hallways.\n3. Even though they don't offer parking on premises, they do have a parking arrangement with Icon Parking on 64th\/Broadway. You get your parking ticket validated while checking out and present it to the parking attendant at Icon. The only downside is you must pay by card only, no cash accepted. \n4. The rooms are very out of date, but clean. The washroom was cleaned well, no soap scum or rust in the shower\/faucets\/toilet\/etc.\n\nCons:\n1. Like many of the reviews, the rooms are extremely small and they are in need of repair. The wallpaper is peeling off the walls, the lamp lights flicker, the doors are chipped and scratched. My tip is bring over-the-door storage organizers for your toiletries and hang your clothing in the wardrobe. There is barely room to have your luggage open on the floor.\n2. We went for drinks at the Rooftop Pool Lounge on a Saturday night - the lounge was not staffed well as they had one server and approximately 30 guests. We only had one drink as the server never came back to take our food order, which was understandable as she was swamped. After an 1.5hr we decided to leave. With such an amazing rooftop location, it was a shame they weren't geared up for a full lounge. \n\nTip: 1. Since the room\/washroom is tiny, bring an over the door storage for your toiletries. There is no room in the washroom to store your shampoo\/toothbrush\/brushes\/ etc, so this would be really helpful if you're staying there.\n2. Breakfast options around: The Smith, Boulud Sud, Starbucks, Fluffy's Cafe & Pizzeria.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The neighborhood is close to everything and very quiet for sleeping at night. The air conditioning works well and is quiet enough. The room is clean enough.   The mini refrigerator is cold. The pool deck and little pool are terrific! Made my stay as I am sun and pool person. The food and drinks are fine. Much of the staff are terrific and very willing to help. The new manager of the hotel is fabulous and so caring! Really want to make the hotel as great as it can be and is working on implementing lots of good changes! On my wish list are ice machines on the guest floors for the guests as ice is not readily available.  Room service which is not available at this time. Bathroom sink stoppers would be nice too for any hand wash one might want to do. Towel hooks in the bathroom that are lower for shorter people as myself. A bit of paint in the rooms to freshen them up. Overall though my stay was great! I will be back, am sad to leave and am looking forward to next time. I hope you enjoy your stay here too!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Later in the day I walked over to Central Park for an evening picnic which was only a couple blocks away. The only negative I would say is that there was an incidentals fee that I wasn't expecting(I confused it with the resort fee) but that was just me not doing enough research and in no way the hotel's fault. I also wish I could remember the name of the staff who checked me in, as he was very patient and extremely welcoming throughout the whole confusion with the fee.

I have spent the past two days apologizing over and over again to my out of town guest that I convinced to stay in this hotel over others. The rooftop and pool deck experience were nice, and that's all I had known in the past. I assumed that the hotel experience would mirror this. \n\nIt is quite possible the worst hotel stay I have ever had. We checked in to very rude staff who made it clear we were burdening them by taking questions. We had spent a lot of time in advance reserving the perfect suite - and when we walked in it smelled so terrible of chlorine that we couldn't sit in there for more than 10 minutes without a chemical headache. The front desk told us there was only one other suite in the entire hotel with two queen beds... so we moved from the 10th to the 3rd floor, and when we arrived it was clear we had just been downgraded at our own expense, even though it was not our fault the first room was uninhabitable. There was no coffee, food, water. etc. The blinds didn't work. It was musky and the A\/C unit didn't work... we couldn't even sleep our first night because the air was so humid. Not to mention the awful lighting and strange noises throughout the night. \n\nSo, the second night the engineer had to come in and physically replace the A\/C unit! And it still was not very good. Nobody replaced our towels after the first night, so we had to call twice to get towels so we could shower before check out. Nobody ever came! So we had to fish through dirty towels on the floor to shower, before checking out. \n\nNever in my life have I had such an awful hotel experience. And especially to have this in NYC at a hotel that touts being a classy, luxury hotel - in an upgraded suite nonetheless! \n\nIt is not easy for working moms to carve out time and money for a weekend getaway. We put so much thought, time, and money into having to coordinate travel, babysitters etc. And what should have been an amazing, relaxing, pampered weekend was all but completely ruined by this hotel. \n\nMore than anything, I am just so sad...

For some reason, I like it. It has a great vibe, it is a \"darker\" hotel that almost feels somewhat steampunkish. The overall look and feel of it is what mostly attracts me.\n\nThe rooftop cocktail lounge is nice, but it gets very busy as does the lobby bar. The lobby can get incredibly loud with large groups of younger people having drinks.\n\nRooms are very small and this is where the biggest shortcoming of the hotel is. Space in NY comes at a premium, so it is somewhat expected, but they are tiny. I was alone and had a suit case and a carry one. That is enough to make it feel crowded. You can't sit on the toilet without closing the door, that kind of cramped.\n\nThere is no room service so you either have to eat at the cocktail lounge, or buy stuff outside and bring it in. Be warned, the cocktail lounge is expensive and they don't serve full plates, it is more of a tapas type of thing. You'll need to eat between 3 to 4 plates before you feel satisfied, which will bring your bill to around $70 or so, just for the food. Drinks average at around $20. So you can see how you can rack up a bill fast.\n\nThere's a Starbucks on the corner and a convenience store\/pharmacy around the corner. There is a Rosa Mexicano Mexican restaurant which is superb as well. Dry cleaners around the corner, but they do not do 1 hour service.\n\nI'm debating if I want to return or not. Aesthetically, I like it, but lack of room service or restaurant is a turn off. I also did not like that it gets so incredibly loud, although it isn't an issue once you're in your room.\n\nWiFi is stable, but VERY slow. I was getting 2 mbps down and 0.5 mbps up on average. Enough for email or YouTube, but dreadful if you need to do any larger file transfers.\n\nThe TV in the room looked like an older model, but I didn't even turn it on so I can't comment on programming. And yes, like others have commented, the AC units show their age and are on the loud side, which I actually use as white noise to drown some of the other sounds of the building and street.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We\u2019re locals and wanted a night out in the city. We really wanted to love this place but just couldn\u2019t. \n\nMore than 1\/2 the rooftop bar was closed and they wouldn\u2019t open it up for us or others that asked despite the fact that there was no event going on at 11pm on a Tuesday night and we were hotel guests.The few seats that they had were taken by couples or sleeping children there with their parents. So we left. This was a HUGE disappointment given that the rooftop bar was a big reason we booked here.\n\nI called down for extra pillows when we checked in at 4:30, but by 10:30pm nothing had been delivered to our room. We went to the front desk and were assured we would receive 2 feather pillows, however instead we got lumpy foam filled pillows.\n\nOur bed was rock hard, to the point that it felt like we were sleeping on a box spring. \nThe room was worn and not cared for. Paint was chipped on the bathroom door which would not stay closed at all. The base of the bed was ripped and frayed. \n\nI\u2019ve wanted to stay here for years, but unfortunately the Empire Hotel was a disappointment. ","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

For that reason, I won\u2019t be returning and wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel.\n\nThe location is great, just off Broadway and close to Central Park and the Lincoln Centre. The hotel staff were very courteous and the check-in experience fairly efficient. The rooftop bar is a really cool place to hang out, good food and drinks, great views, not cheap but as you would expect for Manhattan. That is where the positives end.\n\nThe rooms are small, old and tired. In fairness the bed was comfortable enough however the aircon so noisy I had to switch it off to sleep and the (free) broadband dropped out so frequently it was impossible to work. I am so pleased I had booked a Superior King Room because anything less would have been unbearable. The gym is in the basement and smells of damp and the photos of the swimming pool are a joke \u2013 it\u2019s really a plunge pool!\n\nNow for the part that really soured my stay \u2013 the hotel lost my laundry. Whilst I accept mistakes happen I don\u2019t accept the lack of care or the extremely poor communication by Housekeeping and then the Hotel Manager. Bottom line, an express same day service took two days and, in the process, they wasted several hours of my time. I got a meagre apology and the cost of the laundry knocked off my bill - which is a good job as it eventually turned up via TNT in a crumpled mess.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The location, directly across from Lincoln Center, can't be beat. The service was good. BUT...if you are expecting a welcoming, bright room (forget spacious, that's not happening), set your expectations accordingly. The lowest price category has super tiny rooms.  One price level up, is OK (no views).  Mattress was firm\/good; linens just OK.  The quality of the room\/bathroom renovation is poor and evidence of the old bones of the hotel is everywhere (and not in a good way), if you look--whether it is the peeling paint on the doors or the dingy back hallways and stairwells outside of the swank common areas. The \"splash pool\" is a joke. It's maybe 5 x 15 feet in size, tucked into an alcove.. So--stay here if you need to be close to Lincoln Center, if you want to hold court at the rooftop bar (which is a fantastic, giant space with outdoor and indoor options), and if you plan to spend minimal time in the room.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The location could not be better - right across the street from Lincoln Center. It\u2019s very convenient to the theater district, but much calmer than those humongous Times  Square hotels. The bedding is comfortable and light-blocking curtains that I love. I was in an ADA accessible room because that\u2019s what was available when I arrived at night. \n\nThe safety problem is that the floor of the bathroom (Room 837) completely floods - like over an inch of water - when you run the shower. Instead of having the shower floor slope towards the drain in the shower, it slopes towards the center of the bathroom. It\u2019s very slippery! I stepped out of the bathroom to use the hairdryer for obvious reasons.\n\nAll you personal injury lawyers out there - I notified the hotel staff about this and they said the staff knew about it and the hotel was going to install some sort of bumpers along the edge of the shower to keep the water in. In the meantime, if you get someone who is injured in a fall because of this (thank goodness I wasn\u2019t), I\u2019m your witness that they had notice.\n\nI assume they\u2019ll fix it soon.

Bed was extremely comfortable, room was not large but adequate for one person.  Bathroom was tight, and in need of a new paint job.  That's not a spoiler, though, just an observation.    I met the GM when she called to see if a prior guest had left a shoe in the room (yes, it was there), and she was so pleasant over the \"interruption\" of my stay that she graciously comped my breakfast for the next morning.  The bellmen greeted me each time I came and went, the breakfast staff were also polite.  My only thumbs-down was the pricey daily \"residence fee.\"  For that I was to be given 2 bottles of water daily plus wi-fi.  I never used the wi-fi and received the Fuji water bottles only once during my stay; I even asked for them on the second day and was refused as I didn't have a water bottle card, only my room keycard.  The GM was  not available at that time so I let it go, but as far as customer service goes, the hotel flopped on this.   If you are going to an event at Lincoln Center this hotel is smack dab across the street. Central Park West is one or two short blocks away.  Very convenient for upper midtown, too.  I would stay here again but that residence fee stinks.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

The location of the hotel was perfect.  It's within easy distance to attractions via foot, taxi (uber), or subway.  There are multiple restaurants and a Whole Foods nearby.  The staff was very prompt when there was an issue; however, dealing with those issues was at times complicated and took multiple staff members and a couple of days.  I also arrived early to the hotel (they graciously stored my bags).  They were supposed to notify me when my room was ready, they never did.  It's not truly that big of an issue, but if you state that you are going to do something, follow through.  The only issue we had with the hotel room was that our 11th floor room air conditioner was unable to keep up with the temperatures of summer time New York.  The thermostat was set at 65 degrees, but the room temperature never dropped below 85 degrees.  The outside air temperature had to drop below 80 degrees for the room temperature to finally drop.  As I'm writing this with an outside air temperature of 68 degrees, the room temperature is 73 degrees, and the thermostat is still set at 65 degrees.  If you choose to stay here during the summer months, request a lower floor because their fist-come-first-serve policy does not guarantee you one (I arrived at 9 am on my check-in date).","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There definitely were some drawbacks: the \"pool\" is more like a narrow wading track, my room was tiny (and the hall smelled like ganga the first night), and my bed was very hard with lumpy pillows, but for the price and location I thought I had gotten what my company had paid for. The real problem came at checkout. I was confronted with a bill for $91 for \"residency fees\" of over $22 a night. I had not been informed of this fee when I checked in. I was told, very rudely, that I had signed something to this effect but when I looked at what I signed, it essentially seemed like I was signing for incidentals, which I was careful not to rack up while I was there, and the \"fee\" was completely buried in fine print that I only saw once I knew to look for it. I was also told \"incidentals\" when I was checking in--no indication that this was a fee I was going to have to pay no matter what. I've since been doing some reading on SmarterTravel and apparently this is a racket many hotels are using to list at low rates on places like Expedia and then get back to their real rates with hidden fees. It was bad enough to have to deal with these deceptive practices, but the gentleman behind the counter was so rude and dismissive that I was shaking by the time I had finished the encounter. And apparently this is his usual mode of operation when any trouble arises, because he was equally rude to the poor German tourist after me who had not thought to book the airport shuttle 24 hours ahead (who would have?) and was brusquely told he should have known and he was basically out of luck.

As in the past I chose it for its location opposite Lincoln Center, convenient to events there and surrounded by terrific restaurants and good public transport to other areas.  I work in theatre, so I love how close it is to Broadway - I can get to theatre and back again easily without having to actually stay in the hell that is TimesSquare-Land.\n\nThis is an older hotel, so if you're looking for super-sleek surroundings, wide open spaces, and the latest and greatest amenities you won't get that here; also if you don't like the colour orange, you're not going to care for the room decor, which is sort of Asian Revival Meets Scarsdale in the '60s.  That being said, my King bedroom was clean, the bed was firm and comfortable (though I imagine it might be too hard for some), and the bathroom small-ish but spotless.  The bathroom lighting is pretty harsh, and there's not a lot of surface to put things on, but there was plenty of really hot water and the pressure was great,  particularly impressive for a rainfall shower. (Be aware that there seem to be upgrades in progress to the bathrooms, so it's a bit luck of the draw what your experience will be - in a previous stay I was less happy, dysfunctional drain, low pressure, and wobbly showerhead.)\n\nThe cooling\/heating system is ancient, and there's no thermostat in the room; the below-window unit  limits your control to on\/off, heat\/cool, low\/hi. The 4th was a brutally hot and humid weekend in the City, and the a\/c was only just able to keep the room on the right side of comfortable during the day, but effective enough at night that I could sleep without a problem.  It is quite noisy, but if you live with any kind of air purifier or humidifier, or window unit a\/c, it shouldn't bother you much once you get used to it.\n\nRooms on the west\/northwest side of the hotel have great views of the Lincoln Center plaza; East\/Northeast look out on the restaurants opposite on Broadway; and some (I've stayed in one) have views of the utility airshaft, so...it's worth pressing for some information when you reserve.\nStaff (especially on the front desk) are friendly, welcoming, and very helpful.\n\nOverall for culture vultures, foodies, and West Side lovers, the Empire is a solid choice and good value for the money if you're prepared to deal with its quirks.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

They have a validation agreement with Icon on 63rd that will shave about $20\/day off your parking, if you're driving (unless you want to pay the hotel's $70\/day valet fee.) The bed and pillows are comfortable. However, it's one of those hotels that looks nice at first glance, but upon closer look, it's a little shabby. The internet was unreliable enough for me to use on my phone's hotspot instead. The fridge was nowhere near 40 degrees. No coffee maker in the room. The bath needed a solid vacuuming (hair in the corners) and the grout needed a good scrubbing with bleach. The shower system in the bathroom was broken (but still usable): the controls were loose, the drain cover was not fixed and a large amount of water flowed down the wall from the handheld device even when it was turned off. And the drain backed up, even after they tried Liquid Plumbr. (It was eventually fixed by our 3rd day.) The toiletry bottle caps are the perfect size to fall into the sink drain -- which they will -- and clog that up, too. \n\nAgain, these are things you don't notice until you're there for a bit and start looking around. Would I stay here again, even at the reasonable (for NY) price I paid: no.

The room was small and dark it was also on the 11th floor near the lift, which after the 1st night realised it was the floor to the rooftop bar. Lots of noise of people going back to rooms from the bar and had loud noise of fans or generator outside. We asked for a different room and with the wonderful assistance given by Danny at reception, decided to upgrade to a king size on 8th floor. Well worth the upgrade the room was very light and spacious (no comparison to the double queen box room). Great shower plenty of hot water and good WiFi. The room was at the side of the building with view of the Plaza. The only strange thing was that the cheaper room provided a coffee machine and free bottles of water which was not provided in the more expensive room? The hotel lobby bar was relaxed and staff very attentive. Prices are expensive but only what you would expect from hotel. We did not have breakfast at hotel as $30 seemed high Starbucks round the corner and a delicatessen Mellisa\u2019s which had fruit pots yoghurts pastries etc was a better and much cheaper option. The immediate area is quieter but still has a selection of restaurants near by & only few minute walk to Columbus circle where you will find Central Park and lots of shops and restaurants.

The receptionist said it can be altered by phone and electronics but neither of ours did as I didn't have mine on me whatsoever. We get into the room and find ourselves disappointed to be on the third floor with no real \"stunning city views\" which Is what we paid the money for in the first place in buying a Junior King Suite instead of a normal Double room. \nWe looked around for an information welcome book which we had usually found in every hotel we have stayed in, detailing the prices of different services, room service menu, information regarding bar opening times, food service times etc. but we couldn't find any info whatsoever, not on the tv welcome menu either.\n\nOverall over the week we ordered food and found one day we would get more wings than the other which made the price we paid only worth paying half the time.\nWe ordered takeout on one of these nights and left the pizza boxes on the table with another bag of rubbish we had cleaned up and on two occasions these weren't taken. The second day we left a nice note asking the cleaner to please take the pizza boxes and rubbish bag and for the second time they didn't take either.\nwe then found on the last day that coming back from dinner, the bed was made as usual but only 3 towels in the bathroom out of 6? No hand towels whatsoever, 2 Bath towels and one small towel was all that was on the rack and the towels didn't seem to have been turned over at all, just folded and put back on the rack. \n\nThen upon checkout was our worst experience of all, finding out that we owed $162 for residents fee. Again, nowhere at all did it say anywhere about this fee, and nor was it ever mentioned to us during checkout or our stay at all. We were looking forward to the $150 refund which is what we were told, that it was a damage deposit we would get back but we knew this wasn't true as they immediately liquidated that money into the $162 we owed for the residents fee and they did that before even checking the room to see if it did have any damages. This just seemed like a ploy into making people happier into paying the huge residents fee because they already have $150 \"credit\"\n\nOverall, we were really dissatisfied and will not be choosing to stay again not for the same price anyway.\nAll bar and restaurant staff were very polite during our stay on the whole and the food was also good but very overpriced.\n\nI hope these issues can be raised so that other people don't have to experience the same we did.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}
