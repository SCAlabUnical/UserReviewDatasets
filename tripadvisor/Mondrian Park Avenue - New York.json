We live locally but were attending an event near by that was ending late so decided to stay here for a night instead of traveling home at a late hour. The hotel met all of our needs for a one night stay and we were pleased with our time there. We had a room with 2 double beds for myself, wife and 2 kids. This was adequate space for us. The continental breakfast in the morning does not include hot food like eggs, pancakes or bacon but was more than sufficient for my family to enjoy a meal before leaving the next morning. Breakfast includes croissants, bagels, toast, cereal, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, juice, tea and coffee.\n\nMy only complaint here is the staff not understanding the policies of the hotel. After reading some negative reviews here, I decided to call the hotel before booking to inquire about the \"resort\" fee and included breakfast, etc. The front desk associate told me breakfast was complimentary if you decide to pay the resort fee of $45 but you have the option to waive the resort fee when you check in at the hotel and therefore breakfast will not be included in your stay That sounded good to me so I proceeded with booking and paying directing through the hotel website. Immediately after submitting the booking online, my credit card was charged $45 more than the price that was shown at checkout. When I went to check in to the hotel later that evening,  (different front desk associate now than in the morning when I called) the front desk associate told me that they had no idea why that employee told me that you had the option to waive the resort fee when this in fact is not true and it is a mandatory fee. So two employee working for the same hotel at the same front desk have totally different understandings of the hotel policy? Not a great look. \n\nWe ended up going down for breakfast in the morning since we were already charged for it but would have opted to skip it if we had the choice. My assumption is if you book through a third party, they'll charge you this resort fee separately upon checkout at the hotel. \n\nHotel needs to be more transparent about these fees as it is an apparent reoccurring issue here based on the reviews. Would have rated higher were it not for being misled prior to booking.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Location - it\u2019s well located and the area is good for shops, cafes etc. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where the pros end.\n\nThe cons:\n1. When we arrived which was after check in time our room wasn\u2019t ready so they tried to put us in a lesser room than we booked - we refused and waited for our room.\n\n2. That\u2019s not really the issue though - the issue was the staff. They\u2019re really unprofessional, having very very personal conversations in front of guests checking in. They seem to think they\u2019re working in a super cool hotel and they can be chill and relaxed - they\u2019re not, this place is not cool, trendy or hip. And I don\u2019t want to hear who your colleagues are sleeping with as I check in.\n\n3. The rooms are disgusting - the pictures I\u2019ve added show you a shower ceiling falling apart and dripping on your head - who knows what\u2019s dripping. The wallpaper is peeling all over, the floors are filthy, as are any corridors too. But somehow the worst part was the mould - the wallpaper is hiding mouldy walls. They stink and who knows what effect they\u2019re having on guests health. The sheets all had holes in too - despite asking for them to be changed, if they were changed they were changed for more ones with holes in!\n\n4. For the price you pay - and it\u2019s not cheap, you expect some basic facilities - there\u2019s no iron, no tea or coffee machine, the towels are tiny and rough, the plug sockets are loose.\n\nOverall they don\u2019t care about service, cleanliness or comfort.\n\nWe complained, wanted to move rooms - but we were lazily told no other rooms available - they just didn\u2019t care.\n\nThere are thousands of hotels in New York, and it can be exhausting to find the right one - but delete this one from your list. You\u2019ll regret booking here.\n\nAnd if anyone from the Mondrian wants to reach out to discuss this - feel free, I\u2019m not letting this one drop and I\u2019ll be making a more formal complaint today.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have never expected a five-star service but abasic minimum. The standards of the hotel have been down. I checked in October 22nd. In the evening I noticed that the A\/c extraction were extremely dirty (even dangerous for breathing air as probably not been clean in months). On October 23rd morning, I nicely approached the front desk with a picture asking for the room to be cleaned properly. The front office person didn't really care but said in a none caring way it would be done. \nI came back to my room at 5:00 p.m. to get change and noticed nothing was clean. I once again nicely approached the front desk showing the picture. The front office person (a different one) was nice and said it would be done right away. I came back to my room, and nothing changed. On October 24th morning I approached the front desk in a direct tone of voice asking for immediate cleaning and compensation. the manager said it will be done. I came back at 5:00 pm and yes it was finally clean. Housekeeping left a lot of empty boxes of cleaning products in my room which I brought back to the front desk. they thought I had delivery, I explained it was from the hotel and left behind in my room. \nOn October 25th morning I called the front desk to mention that I will be departing on October 26th morning and not 27th as planned. Front desk agent said all is good and the last night was canceled accordingly. \nOn October 27th early morning I went for my check out, system were down. I asked front office to send me the bill for review prior to the charge as I want to see what the compensation for the poor cleaning service was. I received the invoice end morning with $100 discount in total from a total bill of arund 1,400 USD. I replied with my stupefaction for this low gesture for this large issue. My credit card was charged for 1,800 USD on Octoer 28th. I called the front desk and they told me they were charging the for the night of October 26th. I explained to the person that I checked out on the 26th and front desk agent confirm the cancelation of the night of the 26th back on October 25th, so no charge should apply. After multiple emailed and called, I finally had the incorrect charge remove and the proper charge apply. Yet extremely poor service experience at the resort with no management even apology and a USD 100 discount which based on the whole experience is more a joke than anything. \nExtremely sad to have to share this review.

Instead of walking away, they continued to attempt to break the lock, and also pulled the fire alarm on the floor to make me open the door.

This hotel is fantastic and I'm glad they listen to and respond to feedback.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat!   \n\nOriginal review:\n\nWe stayed for 3 nights in August 2023. The hotel itself is lovely. The rooms are small, but it's NYC, so that's to be expected. The bathroom is well-appointed, with dual rainshower faucets (one in the wall and one from above). Location is nice, it's on the east side and in a fairly quiet area, so street noise wasn't an issue. At night it was very quiet. There's also a lovely terrace on the 15th floor where continental breakfast was served, and you could take your food out to the tables and sit and look at the city view. This space was also open during the day, and we went out there a few times with a snack and just enjoyed the atmosphere. All in all, the hotel itself is quite lovely.\n\nHowever, we did experience some issues during our short stay. We like to fall asleep to the TV and our TV would not connect to their cable\/satellite system. We just continuously received an error message. I informed the staff of this each day of our stay and was always told someone would be coming to fix it \"immediately,\" but it still wasn't working the day we checked out. This was a minor annoyance, particularly as I had to continue to bring it to their attention and was assured it would be fixed and never was. The MAJOR problem with our stay, though, was the A\/C stopped working in the entire hotel. We came back late (like 1am) on our second night and I once again stopped to speak with the front desk about the TV, and during that conversation was informed that the A\/C was out and they were hoping to fix it in the morning. The desk clerk did say that many people had already checked out because of it, but if we stayed we of course would be refunded\/compensated for the inconvenience. Since it was 1am and we didn't want to try and pack all our stuff and scramble to find another place to stay on short notice, we opted to stay. It was a pretty brutal night. It had been very hot and humid in NYC that day and evening, and we watched the thermostat in our 17th floor room hit nearly 85. We had no ability to open windows to get any kind of breeze, so we basically just sweat it out all night and barely got any sleep. Thankfully the A\/C was fixed while we were out all day the next day. We were able to sleep in icy cold comfort on our last night.\n\nWe checked out the next morning in a hurry to get to our train to Boston, and the receipt was sent to me. The reason I'm leaving this negative review is that upon reviewing the receipt later, we were never compensated\/reimbursed for the terribly hot night. To be clear, we didn't ask for it, it was immediately offered by the desk clerk as she informed us of the broken A\/C, and told us it would be automatically applied by the manager the next day. I feel we were pretty understanding of the situation. Things happen, A\/Cs stop working. We get it. But to offer your guests compensation for the inconvenience and then not follow through is just bad hospitality. Coupled with the fact that I kept having to ask about the TV and it never getting fixed, I have to believe this hotel has service issues and the management team doesn't care. For this I'm leaving a negative review. Had my issues been handled appropriately, I'd be writing a glowing review. I would have happily returned to this hotel, as I really loved the convenience of the location (close to subways), how quiet it was, and how comfy the bed was. Plus that terrace really is a great amenity and one I would have looked forward to experiencing again. Unfortunately, service needs to be fixed and for that reason I don't think I would spend the money again. It's too bad because with excellent service this hotel would be a true gem in the city.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The professional photos here on TripAdvisor look nothing like it does in real life and cannot have been from the last 5-10 years. \n\nThe room I stayed in had very visible signs of wear and tear, which detracted from the overall experience. I've attached photos to show the extent of the wear: hole in the glass shower, chipped sink, missing curtains, highly damaged bedside table. While the location is convenient, I was disappointed that the hotel is listed as a 4-star property when it clearly falls short of that standard. In its current state, it feels more like a 3-star hotel at best. The hotel needs major updates and renovations.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We stayed here exactly one year ago and it was like a different hotel entirely.\nThe room we were given had a view of a brick wall despite us asking for a room with a view of the street.  The aircon was broken, the tv was broken (it took maintenance 3 attempts to fix it), the mini bar was empty and not plugged in. When I took a shower the door jammed shut and could not be opened from inside the shower. My husband had to wrench the door open from the other side.\nWorse still was breakfast which was staggering in its awfullness. Stale bagels, waffles in plastic bags, plastic cutlery and hand towels from the bathroom instead of napkins. There was no toaster to try to revive the bagels or anything hot on offer. A year ago we were given vouchers for a fantastic coffee shop around the corner with a full breakfast menu. \nThere are also no tables to sit at so guests are expected to sit in armchairs and balance plastic plates on their laps. Breakfast is served in the bar and we would have been happy to sit at the bar itself had it not been for a sign saying \u2018DO NOT APPROACH THE BAR\u2019.\nAfter I complained I was told that that was a standard continental breakfast which is frankly an insult to both my intelligence and everyone on the continent.\nWe were moved to the suite we had a year ago which was an improvement but I immediately noticed that the coffee machine that was in the room had been removed as had the kettle and complimentary tea, coffee and milk.\nThe overall feeling is that this hotel is closing imminently. The Hotel restaurant is now permanently closed and  the receptionist was telling people that it was up for sale.\nThe Mondrian Park Avenue is tired and neglected.

When we got to the 3rd floor room, it was kind of on the small side but fine for our needs. Then it all went downhill..we were woken up at 3am from garbage trucks smashing bottles outside. The windows were very thin and you could literally hear everything!\n\nWe finally got back to sleep and woke up to a dripping water sound coming from the bathroom. It got worse over time and we realised the ceiling was leaking through the light and vent above the toilet and the floor was filling up with dirty water.\n\nWe spoke to front desk who apologised and told us they will move us to a new room (also on a higher floor because of the street noise). We were given 2 free drinks tokens as an apology.\n\nWe went out for the day and came back to our new room. The new room was a shoe box and absolutely tiny. We had somehow been downgraded because of the leak in the last room. So despite the annoyance of having to move, we then lose out on room size too.\n\nTo make matters worse, I went to use the shower and felt hair on my face, I pulled this off and it was a very long hair (definitely not my own) then I looked at the wall and there was just a big clump of long hairs stuck to the shower wall - it was absolutely disgusting! There is absolutely no way the shower had been cleaned before us as you couldn\u2019t miss it (photo attached to this). The rest of the room felt very dirty too.\n\nRegardless of the terrible experience above, this hotel is definitely not a 5 star hotel. It\u2019s pushing on 2.5. I have no idea how it got a 5 star rating - there\u2019s no restaurant, no gym, a shoddy bar, poor amenities in the room and just a general dirty\/run down feel.\n\nI stay in New York all the time and I\u2019ve been to much better and cleaner hotels.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Gabriel immediately assisted me in the morning. He handed me the voucher and guided me to the nearby breakfast\/coffee establishment. Thanks to Shian, who was delightful and helpful during my stay, I had the most seamless and convenient checkout since I was permitted to check out an hour later.

Unfortunately Park Avenue isn\u2019t to the same level of standard that we have experienced at their other property. Whilst it has a 5 star hotel status, I would personally class this more than a 3\/4 star hotel, for the reasons we experienced including\u2026\n- Lack of decent facilities in the room, including iron and coffee making facilities. We also struggled with lack of towels the first couple of nights, and had to go down to reception\/call a couple of times in order to get some more for the room\n- There were minimal toiletries left in the room, of which when staying at a 5 star property you would expect this to all be there for you at your disposal. We were left to needing to go out to purchase shower gel as all that was left in the room for us was a small bottle of shampoo\n- The room also had several cracks in bathroom and mirrors across the wardrobe, it could do with a update \n- The overall daily clean of the room wasn\u2019t to a huge standard, but we did get new towels daily\n- They state breakfast is included, however as you may have read in previous reviews you get a voucher for a local breakfast cafe around the corner. This does not bother me, but they only give you $10 credit to spend per person and all of the food is a minimum of $12-15 in the store, so you would always need to be contributing your own cash in order to get anything, especially when you then also order a coffee on top. \n\nThat said, we still really enjoyed our time here and want to highlight how helpful all of the staff have been during our stay!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Without her, I suspect that the TripAdvisor reviews would be awful. I sense that she\u2019d previously dealt with guests expecting \u2018Mondrian\u2019 standard to find \u2018Mondrian franchise\u2019 standard. She was courteous, generous and extremely friendly under very challenging circumstances not just from me, but from many guests.\n- Rooftop Terrace Bar - great vibe, great views of NYC from Floor 14. Well worth the visit.\n- Location \/ excellent - on Park Avenue two blocks from 28th Street Metro so easy to get everywhere. \n\nLowlights\n- No reception \/ foyer area to relax \/meet visitors over a coffee \/drink outside of the hotel room\n- Rooftop Terrace Bar - not open Sunday\/Monday.\n- Breakfast - life has moved on post-Covid yet there is no restaurant for breakfast. They ship you off with vouchers to a cafe round the corner. Be aware - obviously the daily voucher does not cover the full cost of breakfast.\n- Restaurant - forget it. Rarely open. Seriously underwhelming menu.\n- Rooms - for the money being charged they were pretty underwhelming (tired, grubby, needing redecoration). We complained and in the end were moved to a great corner room. Eg there are good rooms but not the ones that are given on arrival \n\nNevertheless - Rachel, Front Desk Manager, made the stay for me and my guests from the UK tolerable. However, having booked the hotel at a not inconsequential cost, I expected significantly better. Whilst I would never book here again, I have to say Rachel, the Front Desk Manager, turned a nightmare scenario into an acceptable experience.

The room was spacious. The carpet was dirty and sticky but I wore flip flops. The bedsheets smelled weird but I didn\u2019t pay much mind to it, assuming that it might\u2019ve just been the laundry detergent they used. Their was something wrong with the pipe in the bathroom toilet, causing the toilet to not flush properly, and ultimately their was a leak in the toilet causing water to go all over the bathroom floors. I called the front desk and someone came and fixed it; along with cleaning the bathroom floors, but the flush was still an issue and wasn\u2019t working properly throughout my stay. Housekeeping and room service is nonexistent. If you want your room cleaned you have to call the front desk. Not enough toilet paper or towels in the rooms, even in the suites. After leaving the hotel, I noticed my entire upper arm was covered in red bumps! I was appalled, and confused as to what may have caused this. Then today I checked the reviews for this hotel and a woman had left a review of the same thing happening to her after leaving this hotel. (She had also stayed in a suite, but on the 16th floor) I went to the doctor and he said that it could just be eczema but not sure; I\u2019m guessing it might not be that, considering that this happened to another woman who stayed in a suite room at this hotel too. This lead me to believe that they either do not wash their sheets, or it\u2019s the detergent they used that may have caused an allergic reaction. So far I haven\u2019t seen any reviews of this happening to people that stayed in any of the other rooms, only the ones that stayed in the suites; so it can\u2019t be the detergent, assuming they use the same detergent for all their rooms. Like I said, the bedsheets did smell very weird and gross. Unbelievable, unhygienic, and unacceptable. Do not stay here!!! The only good thing about this place was the friendly staff at the front desk, the views, and the location. Other than that, it\u2019s very unhygienic and unkept.

However, I think it's important for other potential guests to recognize the potential experience(s) they may face when staying at Mondrian Park Avenue. Please note, I am speaking to my experience at Mondrian Park Avenue. However, based on the reviews I've just come to find on here these issues are not new.\n\nLet me start by noting that the pandemic has certainly brought about unprecedented difficulties, from staffing shortages to supply chain issues. As travel bounces back, I think it's important for guests and hotels to understand that things are being adjusted and improved each day. However, I cannot excuse my experience at Mondrian Park Avenue.\n\nPlease note, I really wanted to like this place.\n\nI completed pre-check in before my arrival and checked in a little after 6\/7 pm. Upon my arrival, another guest was having a conversation with who I believe was the on-duty manager about room issues. I thought nothing of it because it was not my business, and sometimes guests make mistakes, and sometimes hotels make mistakes. After a long day, all I wanted to do at this point was get up to my room and wind down.\n\nCheck-in was easy. When I finally got upstairs and opened the door to my room red flags began to pop up everywhere. First red flag - I requested a room with some view besides the side of a brick building. Looking back, I should have asked for a room on a higher floor. However, I wasn't notified until AFTER I called the front desk to voice my other concerns that they didn't have a room available in my room category with a view. Why wasn't this expressed to me before I checked in or after I booked the room? The images online and on social media tell me otherwise.\n\nI want to note before listing all of the physical issues in the room that the front desk associates, when I voiced my concerns about the room, tried to offer me a paid upgrade. This was extremely disappointing that this was their initial solution to an in-house issue. After profusely expressing my disappointment and concerns, the on-duty manager, Moses, who was kind during the experience, finally got on the phone with me and offered a complimentary upgrade to an ADA room, but it did not have the view I initially requested. I get he was doing what he could considering they told me they were completely sold out besides the penthouse. It was the fact that I was initially offered an upgrade at charge because there were issues in my room because of the property's lack of attention + upkeep. It\u2019s just bad customer service, especially when I went online to find that the next category of the room was going for a lower price the two nights I was staying there than what I was already paying. So when I refer to both rooms, I am referring to the initial room I was sent to and the one I was \u2018upgraded\u2019 to.\n\nNow for the room + hotel - sharing a list below of *some* the concerns\/issues noticed:\n- Severe scuff marks all over the walls in the first room.\n- Wallpaper pulled off the wall near the framed photos on the wall\n- Streaks all over the glass in both rooms\n- What looked to be either excess grout or mold in + near the shower in the second\nroom\n- The minibar wasn't fully stocked (regardless of whether someone uses it, it's just general good business practice to offer your paying guest a fully stocked mini bar) in both rooms\n- The doorstop was unscrewed, flipped upside down, waiting for someone to step on\nit in the first room. The engineer did come up and fix it after I mentioned it to the front\ndesk associate.\n- Both rooms were extremely dusty; there was a film of dust on the duvet cover. I ran\nmy finger over the duvet and pulled a layer of dust up. Things look like they had not\nbeen dusted or vacuumed in a while.\n- The shower heads had crusted over hard water on them and were desperately in\nneed of a scrub.\n- The rooms clearly had a slight wet smell to them, which no explains the sore throat I\ngot with the AC running.\n- The room had two different brands of toiletries (Malin + Goetz and Ciel spa) - pick a\nbrand and stick to it. It looks half-assed and piecemeal. Not very 4\/5 star energy.\n- It seems like there was decor missing from the rooms. (Based upon Google review\nimages, socials, and even the property site, some decor is missing from the property.)\n- Wifi is EXTREMELY slow (essentially unusable) + no cell service. I\u2019ve stayed in many\nhotels in the city and have never had an issue with cell service.\n\nAll in all, I could have gotten a better experience elsewhere. Responding to these TripAdvisor comments is great, but this hotel is extremely flawed and needs a lot of work. I\u2019m floored seeing a similarity in complaints that date back a while.\n\nI wish I could say I would try this hotel again, but I know that there are better places to stay in the city. Funny thing is, people were raving about this hotel when it first opened.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Upon entering our room the trash was full and there was a black mold\/musty smell coming from the AC. There were left over hairs in the shower and on the bed. When we asked to switch rooms they moved us to another room with similar mold issues in the shower. AC also did not work. Rooms are of very poor quality here.  There was also used floss on the hotel hallway floor. (see attached pictures).\n\nThe TV had multiple advertisments for pornography and provided directions on where to order directly on the home screen of the TV. Do not bring your children here if you want them to remain Innocent!\n\nAll the rooms are covered in dated mirrors with a pink hue that really drive home the trashy hotel feel (see pictures).\n\nThe terrace had a good view but the floors were sticky and the drinks were just ok. Don't stay on the  14th or 16th floor as they are directly above and below the terrace. The vibe is a bit more intimate which was nice but still overall not a great experience. The bartender was very friendly though.\n\nCheck out was uneventful and relatively painless.\n\nThe only shining light during our stay was the customer service provided by Justin and Marchal at the front desk and the bartender on the terrace.\n\nIf you are planing on spending your hard earned money to stay here it would be best to stay at one of the 100 of other hotels in NYC. I would recommend Soho Grand Hotel as it was worth the money and had excellent customer service.\n\nDespite the above, the location is ok (again better hotels around the area) if you are looking to stay around the midtown area. It's about a 20 min walk to Times Square and about 35-40 min walk to Central Park.\n\nThis is not a 5 Star hotel, it's a glorified best western at the most","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is convenient to Murray Hill and NoMad districts. The rooms are fine for a mid-range hotel. We had requested connecting rooms and the hotel was at high occupancy so someone arranged us rooms on the same floor. I'm not sure that calling the hotel earlier in the day would have made much of a difference. You can extend your checkout at $50 an hour till 5pm which is a nice service. Room came with breakfast coupons at a nearby coffee shop which is excellent. You can use a nearby NY Sports Club or there is an Equinox nearby if you are a member. Lighting, air conditioning and shower were all very good. Only thing is that if your room is facing Park Avenue expect some noise but it did get quieter after midnight. The hotel tells you about this rooftop terrace but most of the time we were there it was closed for private events. Elevator can get very busy at peak times; there are only 2 for about 15 floors. Other than that, we found the front desk personnel friendly and response was very prompt; request for towels was fulfilled in just a few minutes.

But know this first\u2026","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-05-02","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"This is my honest review for this hotel. I can\u2019t say that it was bad but my expectations going in were higher for this hotel. \n\nThe hotel is much much smaller than what it looks like on the website, and that\u2019s including the rooms. Our one king bed room could fit one big luggage, and I used my carry on as a night stand since the room was too small to fit two night stands. \n\nMy first advice would be to check the size of the room when booking. If you just want a bed then you\u2019ll be fine, but know that there is no place to lounge or chill in that room other than the bed. \n\nSecond advise, if you don\u2019t like loud noises don\u2019t stay in a room above the terrace. Our room was directly above the terrace and the music was blasting every night which made it hard to sleep. (You may like music over sirens though so just keep that in mind \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc)\nOur room was on the 16th floor, and the terrace is on the 15th. \nOur A\/C wasn\u2019t working great so we opened the balcony door which was fine for April weather but we got the loud music until midnight. \n\nAnother thing to know is that there isn\u2019t a coffee machine in the room, so you will have to go downstairs to the lobby to get your coffee. \nWe ended up walking one block down to a Starbucks so that wasn\u2019t an issue for us and the walk was great.\n\nThere is no room service and the only restaurant attached to the hotel was never open. I swear I never saw that place open once! So make sure you find a near by restaurants for breakfast. \nThe hotel did say that if you can have a buffet style breakfast at the Cleo restaurant for $20 a room, we just never saw that place open \ud83d\ude33\n\nAll and all the hotel was clean and in a great location. Do remember that you\u2019re paying for the location and not the luxury of the hotel. \n\nIf you keep all these points in mind you will most likely enjoy your stay, so adjust those expectations \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I walked into my room to a bunch of hair all over the floor in my bathroom when I checked in. Their blankets are old and the down inside is clumpy.

The king size room was small (but perhaps decent for NY) with just enough space for the two of us, although we couldn't fully open either suitcase on the floor away from the walkway. The interior is artistic and pleasant and the views good too. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, and kept our luggage safe after check out in the morning as our flight was not until the evening. Everything was clean and elegant, the room was surprisingly quiet, and the location of the hotel is super practical - easily walkable to Time's square and midtown. The only downside was breakfast. You get 20$ split between the two of you at a nearby caf\u00e9, which just about pays for two coffees and one croissant. We paid at least $10 more every morning for two small breakfasts. There was filter coffee in paper cups at reception every morning, although it had run out usually by 10am when we left.

This place both lack the facilities and the service mindset to be able to claim five stars. I have been in 4 star accommodations with superior facilities and level of service compared to the Mondrian.\n\nFirst of all, the hotel doesn't have a functional kitchen. That means no room service, and NO breakfast. Although I was supposed to have a continental breakfast included in the USD400 room rate, they only offer coffee and tea in the lobby. You receive a voucher for 10 dollars that you can use in a breakfast joint around the corner. Only problem is: 10 dollars won't get you very far. It only covered a cup of coffee and an orange juice in my case. \n\nThe room itself is big for NYC standards, but very underwhelming when it comes to level of \"luxury\". The first thing you will notice is that the nice hardwood floors from the pictures on BOOKING.COM are in fact carpet. The bathroom is unpractical and gets soaked every time you take a shower. The towels are small and not the luxury bath towels you come to expect at this price level. The room comes with a minibar, but no glasses to enjoy your drinks. During my 3 nights staying at the hotel, the minibar was never restocked. At this price level, I expected to find a coffee and tea maker, but there are none. No ironer either. \n\nIn it's marketing, the Mondrian will let you know that hotel include a roof top terrace bar, a club in the basement and a restaurant. The restaurant is out of business and the nightclub and terrace are not accessible from the hotel itself. When you check-in, the uninspired staff will offer NO information about the hotel's facilities. I asked for the terrace, but was told it was closed. \n\nAll in all, I recommend the Mondrian to update their marketing to reflect that the hotel doesn't offer ANY facilities other than the room itself. To pay around USD400 for a room at this hotel is simply outrageous.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Tyler Torchia, the director of Housekeeping, welcomed us with a lovely note and a bottle of wine. He quickly also sent two bathrobes upon our request. Our corner room was spacious and clean and housekeeping left it in great condition each day of our  6-day stay. While Cleo is not currently open, we were not left wanting.

That's like the Olive Garden comparing themselves to Scarpetta. The Mandarin Oriental in NYC is a 5 star hotel, the Mondarin is not and I think this is where most of the issues begin for this hotel. \n\nWe checked in at 6:30pm on Friday and were told our room wasn't ready. Apparently they had an issue with the linen delivery that day. Not the hotels fault and we were in our room by 7ish. \n\nAs others have stated, the rooms are in need of some love. Our bathroom sink was chipped and the shower head looked caked in mold. The deluxe king we had was otherwise a typical NYC hotel room, small. It came with a minibar fridge and a little area to hang up clothes. The bathroom door was right next to the bed and was a barn door style so it didn't close fully. Our phone also didn't work, so each time we needed to call the front desk we would use our cell phone to call the main line. Also, the $30 facility fee is perplexing. The restaurant was closed, we had to walk a block to the partner Cafe where breakfast coupons were good at and wait in a very long line for food. I was not aware of a gym on site or other amenities, perhaps due to COVID, so not sure how this charge is at all justified. \n\nCheck out on Sunday was very crowded. There are only 2 elevators and the wait can be very long at times. We also learned they outsource the valet parking and it took the company nearly an hour to get us our car. So we were upcharged by the hotel and had to wait an hour. Definitely consider self parking if you stay here. \n\nDespite the hotel being quite full, it felt perpetually understaffed. The staff that we did interact with, however, was extremely friendly and accommodating. Five stars for the staff all the way.  \n\nWord of advice to management. Please reclassify this hotel accurately...as a 3 star establishment. You're setting your guests and staff up for failure by trying to say it's 5 stars as the expectations that come with that were not fulfilled from our experience.

On the plus side, the room as not as small as many NYC hotels.  \n\nEverything else was bad.  Here is the letter I wrote several days ago to the hotel manager, after leaving her 3 messages and a previous email asking for a call back.  As yet, I have not gotten a reply.  Typical for my experience at this hotel.\n\nHello.  I stayed at your hotel last weekend (10\/14-17).  Many things went wrong.  It is frustrating that every effort I have made to get issues resolved required multiple attempts.  I have left 2 messages through Samir at the front desk and a previous email to Alysa (sp?) to discuss these and I have not received a reply over the past 5 (at least) days.\n\nHere is what went wrong:\n\n- housekeeping did not remove a BRA that belonged to a previous guest from the room.  I stopped at the front desk twice on Thursday and Friday of my stay and then called 3 more times before someone came to remove it.\n\n- the front desk person who came up to take care of this brought a small can of a warm beverage.  I don\u2019t know what it was since the label with the Mondrian name obscured the contents but I believe it had rum in it.  As I said it was warm, there were 2 of us.  We did not drink it\u2026left it in the room.  I assume he thought it was a gesture of good will for inconveniencing us but it came across as an odd choice.\n\n- I asked for clean towels, in part because housekeeping took dirty ones away on Friday morning (including a bath mat) and didn\u2019t replace it.  Two calls yielded no results.  I asked the housekeeper on Saturday and she accommodated the request.\n\n- housekeeping didn\u2019t empty trash when they cleaned the room.\n\n- we were not advised that 1 elevator was working the weekend we were there.  It took a 10 minute wait for an elevator that had some space on more than one occasion.  There was no sign on the elevator that it was out of order either.  \n\n- I NEVER take anything from a mini bar.   Never.  Never touch the door.  I even took pictures of the contents through the door on my day of arrival (in part because a bottle of liquor was on an angle).  I spoke to the person who checked me out (no I didn\u2019t ask for his name\u2026clearly I should have) and said I didn\u2019t use the mini bar, he said he\u2019d make note of it\u2026nothing to worry about.  I got charged a few days later for $5.44 for a mini bar charge.  It took 2 calls to Samir and then 2 calls to Stacey (in Accounting, I believe) to get it resolved.  She did issue credit.  She also made me feel like an idiot for bothering her with a $5.44 charge.\n\nI would not recommend staying here under any circumstances.  They also charge an \u201camenity fee\u201d of $30 but give you coupons for $20 for breakfast at one place.  It was decent and around the corner.  But I got no amenities at this property.\n\nI also asked 3 times for them to refill the hand sanitizer dispenser on my floor.  It never happened.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We had myriad issues in this hotel - so much so that the hotel adjusted the first night off our bill without being asked to do so. Despite this, the issues continued throughout our stay. I simply elected to stop complaining as I did not want problems with the hotel to become a focus of the trip. \n\nIn our original room on the 19th floor, we had issues with the air conditioner and the room would not cool. I had to call down to the front desk multiple times before an engineer was sent to to room. After he eventually arrived, he was unable to repair the issue, and I requested to be moved to a different room.\u00a0\n\nThe new room had many other issues. While the room had functioning air conditioner, it initially only worked with a single speed: a gale force wind; no low, medium, or high. This was remedied after the first night but you essentially had to settle on one temperature in the room without variation and had no fan. \n\nI advised the front desk that the door in this room only closed fully if pushed and thus could be easily left ajar inadvertently open by housekeeping or the guest.\u00a0Although no one had warned about this issue, the front desk advised me that this was the case for all rooms in the hotel and there was no way to remedy the issue. However,  I discovered this was false and apparently the front desk simply did not want to be bothered. Following an email to management about some of our issues, the door was repaired so that it closed and latched properly.  \n\nFollowing our report of these issues, the manager on site sent me an email advising that he had personally inspected the room. With that in mind, I returned to find the floor dirty with food residue. See pictures below. I called the front desk and was advised that housekeeping was no longer available for the day. Given this, I asked them to bring me a vacuum and proceeded to vacuum and clean the floor myself. The person who brought the vacuum agreed that the floor was gross but - like the front desk person - never offered to do anything about it. He did say he would leave a note and we would hear from management the following day, but we never heard anything. I emailed about this issue with pictures after checking out as well, but received no response from the hotel. \n\nGiven COVID-19, the cleanliness issues were particularly frightening as I was concerned what else had not been properly cleaned. I also note that the hotel staff is extremely poor with respect to wearing masks and generally never wore masks anywhere on premises (including elevators, lobby, entering guest rooms, etc.). \n\nAny request made of hotel staff seemed to be met only partially, if at all. E.g., I requested laundry information and bags and a shower cap. The bags were delivered, I had to call down for someone to bring the price information, and the shower caps never came. \n\nThe rooms also are not equipped with basic items, such as a garbage can in the room, luggage racks, etc. it also appears that there is no way to turn on\/off individual lights. They either all have to been on or off.\u00a0\n\nThese are only an abbreviated recounting of our troubles at this hotel. There were other issues, too. I don\u2019t understand how this hotel is rated as 5 stars by any reputable agency and I strongly urge anyone considering this hotel to avoid it at all costs.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

What it doesn\u2019t have is good customer service.\n\nWe recently spent two nights at the Mondrian Park Avenue in a suite on the 14th floor. The views from the corner living room were great and we liked the fact that you could open the door for fresh air. The small bedroom and bathroom were a bit tight for two people. The bed was not the most comfortable and the sheets \u2013 not fitted \u2013 kept coming undone, making sleeping difficult. The room was quiet at night and the ac worked well, even though it was a bit noisy.  \n\nFor us, the problem with this hotel is the service, or rather, the lack of service. Check-in consisted of a disinterested front desk person in a black t-shirt handing us room keys. No warm welcome. No explanation of the hotel services, no description of what\u2019s open and what is not open on the premises during the pandemic. No information about our rate and what it included (such as the breakfast credit noted in our reservation). Not even directions to the elevator (which is in a dark hallway around the corner from the front desk and tiny lobby). We learned later \u2013 when we received no housekeeping service the next day \u2013 that we had to opt-in to receive housekeeping. It would have been nice if they had explained that to us. We did appreciate how quickly staff brought up replacement coffee for the very nice Lavazza coffeemaker in our room. \n\nFor some unexplained reason, the hotel restaurant is not open (the doors are chained shut with a padlock) and the hotel has no breakfast service (although the very nice Terrace bar is open and serving food). We learned from another guest during an elevator conversation that breakfast \u2013 which was included in our room rate \u2013 was only available a block away at a local coffee shop. Again, it would have been nice if the front desk staff had told us that when we checked in. We asked at the front desk later, and received a card we used for the $20 breakfast credit at Blank Slate coffee on Madison at 30th. \n\nThe hotel is not bad, it\u2019s just not good. Basic service levels should be possible even during a pandemic. We understand how tough the past year has been: that\u2019s part of the reason we wanted to visit NYC and help the city recover.

I specifically wanted to stay at a 5 star hotel because I am very paranoid about cleanliness and wanted a hotel that was really abiding by cdc guidelines.  When I read the reviews on how this hotel was handling this situation I was sold and it didn\u2019t hurt that they also supported front line workers during the pandemic. And I wanted to support a hotel that supported them.  \n\nI was so wrong. We were given a room that was disgustingly dirty.  Even during normal times this is unhygienic and unsanitary but during covid times it\u2019s just plain old unsafe.  Bathroom was used, streaks on the shower, toothpaste in the sink, bed was completely disheveled.  \n\nWhen my husband brought this up to a front desk staffer (I will not mention his name, because at the end of the day he just works there and this a problem with the management) he said housekeeping had left and there was nothing he could do. When I spoke to him he said the room was clean it just needed new sheets and toiletries. (I have posted pictures, you be the judge of this) They also say that they fog their rooms and keep them unused for 48 hours.  How do I know that\u2019s true when they can give us a room in this state?\n\nThen to make matters worse this front desk person told his manager that my husband refused to leave the room when in fact he told my husband that someone would come and show him another room. So my husband just sat with his mask on for one hour in the room waiting for someone to get him.  \n\nTurns out we were accidentally given the wrong room but our room was now occupied. Why not just tell us this and apologize instead of giving us a bunch of excuses and then making us feel worse by insulting my big teddy bear of a husband? This is what actually hurt me the most, adding insult to injury. \n\nI am writing this review while still checked into the hotel.  (So I hope this doesn\u2019t impact our stay even more negatively) We checked in on Wednesday, so I expected on Thursday or Friday I\u2019d hear back from the manager with at least a sincere apology because I know Wednesday was a stressful day for everyone but alas, I have not even heard a whisper from him. \n\nI am shocked that a hotel group so well known for its hospitality has treated their patrons this way.  And unfortunately this unsafe situation, trumps all the good we\u2019ve encountered at this hotel during our stay and other sbe hotels we\u2019ve stayed in abroad and around the country. \n","travelDate":"2020-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Premier King looks nothing like the picture on the website and is actually claustrophobic, with nowhere to work and nowhere to put a large suitcase. I was so surprised by the size of the room that I went down to the front desk since I assumed there must have been a mistake and I wasn't given the category of room I booked. The desk clerk claimed I was in the correct room and allowed that perhaps some Premier King rooms are larger than others.

We did as they asked. When we return to our room after 11pm, our room was still not made up. I then went to the front desk and asked to speak with the manager. I had to wait for him because he was - guess where? - in the nightclub! He apologized, agreed to send up clean towels only when I asked, and offered a free breakfast the following morning. Honestly - I think they need to decide if they are running a high-quality hotel or a nightclub. They are certainly failing at providing basic hotel services and barely seemed to care. \nThird - the room sounded small in the online description so we booked a slightly larger room for two with one bed. The room was VERY small. We had been guests at the Loews Regency two weeks prior and our room was large, the service was impeccable and the price was the same (albeit a different week). At the Mondrian, we paid $919.72 for two nights in a tiny room with no housekeeping and other service was amateurish at best. AVOID THIS HOTEL. To management - BRING IN AN EXPERIENCED TEAM to straighten this place out if you want to stay in business.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms are small, with very little room to store anything.  The amenities are poor.  No alarm clock, pens or notepads.  To leave a tip for the housekeeper, we had to tear a page out of our notebooks to leave a thank you note.  Housekeeping is inconsistent and inattentive.  The shower door does not seal and water runs out all over the bathroom floor.  The bathroom has very little room to situate any of your toiletries and a musty smell comes from the shower.  We called several times for a bucket of ice.  Sometimes it would take 45 minutes, sometimes it would never show up.  One night, I returned to the room to find a bucket of ice and an ironing board that I had not asked for. There are only two elevators, which you often have to wait several minutes for.  There is no in-room coffee, though you can go downstairs to the restaurant for free coffee, but not if you have to get up early, as the restaurant doesn't open until 7.  Half of the channels on the TV never worked and the internet wasn't great.  NYC is loud, but the windows in the room did very little to seal out any of the noise.  The rooftop terrace is nice, but service was poor.  There is a late night dance club beneath the first floor, which makes for many noisy nights.  I could go on....

Most significant was the indifferent attitude of the front desk and door staff when they were there. (hardly saw anyone at manning the hotel entrance).  This was a big change from my last visit when i specifically commented that the staff were especially friendly and recognized their customers.  Other comments:  The shower spilled water all over the bathroom floor and i had to keep asking for more towels to mop up the lake of water.  The room and bathroom were unacceptably dirty \/ dusty for a top tier hotel.  No paper and pen in the room.  No Sunday papers available (seriously???!!!).  I had a room facing the light well which i thought might be quiet -- but unfortunately there was a huge saturday evening party in the apartments next door until 5am.  No one at the front desk \/ door to offer to help with taxi, luggage, directions.  As other guests have mentioned, the hotel no longer offers access to the Equinox fitness club and instead offer access to New York Sports Club.  NYSC is ok, but not particularly clean or inviting space.  Oh and don't forget you will be charged and extra $35 + tax per night for the \"free\" internet.

This time, after staying in the Mondrian in London and LA, I suggested we try the Mondrian. What a mistake! \n\nWe booked back in February and paid extra for a double room (that\u2019s one with two beds) and requested a high floor, quiet, with a view. On check in, there was only one room available, it was on the 5th floor and according to George, who checked us in, it was right opposite the elevator. There was nothing he could do, he said, and we had to take it. I totally get that preferences are not guaranteed, but we didn\u2019t even get 1 out of 3! I think this may be because the hotel is actually very small and doesn\u2019t have a lot of rooms to offer. \n\nThe room was ok, small, no storage space. Dark and gloomy, not like the website. Large bathroom for no reason at all, would have preferred more space in the bedroom itself. No coffee facilities in the room, instead you get free coffee from 8am downstairs. What if you want a coffee sooner?! There is also no water in the room, apart from a bottle of Evian for $15. What hotel does not offer a bottle of free water! \n\nAfter the first night, we returned to find our neighbours having a party. I asked what could be done about it and the reception guy was less than helpful. He said he would give them a warning and basically made out like I was making a big deal of it. When I pushed back (the door was wide open, music blaring, screaming, 4 people in one tiny room!), I was offered another room, the only one we had left. A really nice guy called Seth helped us to move, which we appreciated. He had more empathy and concern. \n\nWe actually were downgraded in the move to a standard king (we now have to share a bed), despite the fact we paid for a premier double which is a few categories up. The room faces a wall and there is a terrace underneath where people are partying til late. At 6am the bottles are collected and removed, right underneath the window. You buy a hotel room with the basic premise that you want to sleep. The mondrian couldn\u2019t even get this part right so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised that the rest of my experience was so poor. \n\nThe rooftop terrace is ok but a bit lifeless. Drinks are served in plastic glasses. It\u2019s a bit tacky with insta fabulous plastic roses, very 2017, I suppose they think people will want to take selfies and tag Mondrian. Overall this hotel lacks style but more so substance. It shouldn\u2019t be viewed in the same category as the Mondrian in London which is premium, stylish and fun. This hotel may as well be a cheap budget hotel - shame we\u2019re paying Mondrian prices. Save your money and go elsewhere. We won\u2019t be back.  ","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Had never previously stayed in that neighborhood, but decided to give it a try and ended up quite liking the neighborhood and being away from the madness of midtown.\n\nThe lobby wasn't much - just a small area with some fake rock looking thing that you can sit down on. Fine by me - a fancy lobby is most definitely not one of my requirements for a hotel.\n\nThe balcony suite was attractively decorated and actually looked like the online picture, so that was a relief.  Because it was a corner suite, there was lots of light during the day and there was a large table in the living room area that was convenient to spread out and work. I did go outside on the balcony, but being out on the balcony was not terribly exciting so I didn't use it during my stay. There was an espresso maker in the room for those who are interested - I'm not a coffee drinker so I didn't use it.\n\nOn the downside, the suite was on the small side for a suite with only miniscule closet space. It wasn't really an issue for me because I was traveling in the dead of summer and didn't have a lot of clothes with me and I was only one person, but something to note if you are two and\/or you travel with a lot of clothes (as I do in winter when I bring various coats, different sets of boots, etc.).\n\nThe bathroom was large, which was nice, and had a lot of counter space to lay out toiletries which was great since no bathroom counter space is a pet peeve of mine. The towels were probably the worst I have seen in an upscale New York City hotel.  Small, scratchy.  Not great water pressure in the shower.\n\nThe room was quiet (always a treat in New York City), except for Thursday and Friday night when I could hear loud music coming from the 15th floor terrace restaurant at the hotel. Luckily the music ended at around 11:00 p.m., so it wasn't a huge issue and I just watched tv until then to drown out the sound.\n\nThere is a $30 resort fee, which was disclosed in advance.  It didn't bother me that much because it is becoming par for the course at every hotel in New York City and, as they say, you can't fight City Hall. They did provide free tea and coffee at the restaurant bar in the morning which was nice, as well as free copies of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal (I'm a dinosaur and still like a paper in the morning that I can grasp in my hand). You also have the use of the house car, if it is around, and one afternoon when it was raining I was able to grab the car to take me to see a relative in a nearby hospital, so that was a nice perk.\n\nThe $30 resort fee also includes free Internet, which was a joke. The Internet was reminiscent of the old days of dial up and I had to go out to a cell phone store and buy a $250 hotspot (with monthly data plan as well) in order to be able to get any work done and to connect to my corporate network. If you're with Verizon, there is a Verizon store down the street (I marched over to a Sprint store which was further away). Word to the wise - if you need to do any work during your stay, bring your own Internet connection.\n\nThe bellmen were affable and helpful. The front desk was kind of lackadaisical -- not rude or anything, but, on the other hand, they didn't make you feel particularly welcome either.\n\nHad breakfast a few times at Cleo. It was okay, not great, but I always like to be able to tumble downstairs and have breakfast without leaving the hotel, so I guess I appreciated it was there.\n\nI found the neighborhood very convenient. A drug store on the next block where you can pick up anything you forgot to bring, or buy snacks. Around the corner from the hotel is Marta -- an Italian restaurant in the Redbury Hotel.  Love, love, love Marta. Really one of the best pizzas in New York City, good wine menu and attractive and comfortable atmosphere. I might return to the Mondrian just because of its proximity to Marta. The restaurant is definitely worth checking out.\n\nThe hotel is also an easy walk to the Union Square area where there are a lot of good restaurants, including my favorite place to have breakfast in New York City -- abcV restaurant at ABC Carpet.  Even saw the owner of abcV, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, at breakfast.\n\nThe hotel is also not that far from the new Hudson Yards shopping center on the West Side. Just keep marching west on 30th Street and you'll hit it.\n\nYou are also conveniently located next to the 6 train. And if you are a shopper, you are a hop, skip and a jump away from Dover Street Market, an interesting boutique at 30th and Lexington. There is a cafe for lunch at Dover Street Market, which I've been told is good, but I didn't try it.\n\nI've done a lot worse in New York than the Mondrian and while it was not perfect, I wouldn't hesitate to return (toting my own hotspot for Internet connectivity).","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

They also sponsor their doorman to scam tourists with transportation to the airport. Do not let them call a cab for you unless they're flagging it down on the street. The doorman said he had a friend cab driver who is on his way and we got in and that cab driver wanted to screw us by charging us an inflated flat fee to go to LaGuardia. It was only $10 but he was not happy when I wanted to use the meter. And your hotel shouldn't set up its customers to get ripped off.

We ended up having to pay an upgrade fee (which was even more than the room rate we paid) in order to get the balcony suite. The balcony suite was spacious and gorgeous! Definitely worth the upgrade. However the fridge was packed with drinks from the hotel that we didn\u2019t have any space for our own food and drinks. There also wasn\u2019t an ice dispenser so we had to call for it and it took a really long time for them to bring it. On the second day someone was cleaning the windows outside... and since our room was all glass they can see right into it and it was really uncomfortable. To make things worse, one out of the two elevators were broken. We were on the 19th floor.

Checked my work travel app and found the Mondrian close by.\nReserved a room and called to make sure it was booked.  I spoke with Hector the manager, who assured me the room was booked and told me to ask for him when I checked in.  He was understanding, polite and helpful.\n   Second:  Check in:  small line at check-in late at night.  Staff scrambled to get extra people to the front desk to minimize everyone's wait.  Check-in was fast and easy, and Hector again was understanding and helpful.  He put me in a very nice room since it was my first time at the hotel.\n  BEST:  The room.  It was spacious, well appointed (robes, slippers, Lavazza machine, etc) and SPOTLESS.  It was by far one of the the nicest rooms and without a doubt the cleanest room I have ever stayed at in NYC!  The soaps were nice, the glasses were clean, the marble sink was immaculate.  The shower was clean and had good water pressure--no temperature problems at all.  The room was comfortable, dark and quiet, and after a hectic trip in, it was a perfect oasis.  \n  The less-than-great:  no free waters, the hotel bar and restaurant closed early so had to walk to the deli down the street for a bite.  \n  I had a very good first stay and will stay again!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

On arrival, no warm welcome from the reception staff. It would have been nice to have been asked was this our first visit to New York, and if so to welcome us to the city and to offer to be of assistance during our stay. Instead, they could not initially find our booking (and we noticed there were another couple waiting by reception who were experiencing the same problem). The bedroom was small but clean and comfortable, although the air conditioning unit was far too loud. Good bathroom facilities. No lounge for guests to sit in. The only seated area is at reception and the seating provided is a large rock (which resembles coal) and which is not comfortable and cannot accommodate a large number of guests. Beware if you are booking this hotel because of their roof terrace. When we visited, almost every evening it was reserved for a private function. Indeed, we got the impression that the staff were more concerned with accommodating those attending private functions or the Club in the basement, than in looking after hotel guests. The hotel restaurant is good but expensive. There is a Pret nearby for breakfast which we would recommend.Good location, but could be so much better.

On Sunday they had salsa dancing and reduced price drinks. \n\nWe stayed in a room with a king sized bed.  The room was small but well designed so that you weren't bothered by it. \n\nAll in all I would have given it 4 stars BUT... As we checked out we were charged $35 a night luxury fee.  We were not informed of it prior to check out.  The lady at the desk claimed it was because we had access to a gym (4 blocks away), coffee maker in room (there was none), a very expensive minibar (we didn't use it), and use of an in room cell phone (it wasn't charged and we didn't use it).  I said all this but she said it was standard throughout the US.\n\nWe had just traveled 2 weeks through Maine and Massachusetts the week prior and no hotel charged us this.  We also go to NYC once a year and also have never been charged this anywhere else.  It was completely outrageous that they charged us with no prior warning. \n\nI  writing this to warn others.  Whatever price you think you are going to pay... There will be a significant add on in the end for services that are either not even provided (like the coffee) or used (minibar, gym, and cell phone).  It adds up.  We ended up paying and additional $105 at checkout for a 3 night stay.  I find this unexceptable.

My favorite part was the layout of the space; a sliding door partitioned off the living space from the bedroom and bathroom.  This is key in creating an inviting and comfortable space that truly feels like a home away from home vs a large box studio with the living space included in the room.  The south and east exposures gave us great morning light and a private balcony allowed for a special way to take in the cityscape.  The rooms were impeccably clean and housekeeping always did a fantastic job of tidying up the space.   \n\nRoom service was prompt and always arrived within the timeframe they quoted and was delivered within 30 minutes of ordering.  Breakfast at the restaurant on the ground level, Cleo, was delicious and the service was attentive.  On the first morning, it was freezing in the restaurant as the AC was blasting and when I mentioned it to our server, she was kind enough to let the restaurant know and they made the adjustment. There is an amazing rooftop bar on the 15th floor of the hotel with a selection of great sharable bites, cocktail menu along with great wines.  Unknown to the public, there is a private club inside the hotel! I believe the club opens starting Thursday evenings. Another great amenity is the gym located a couple blocks away at the New York Sports Club.  \n\nIt rained a couple days while we were in New York and the hotel provided sturdy umbrellas in the room as well as in the lobby for us to grab on the way out.  The hotel is situated on 30th Street; making it equidistant from the 28th and 32nd Street stops on the 6 train.  It's just a couple blocks away from Herald Square in case you need trains that will take you to other parts of the city.  It's in an extremely central location but removed enough from the hectic hustle and bustle of New York City.  Despite being on an avenue, it was quiet for a restful sleep.  The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were just right instead of being too high, which most hotels err on.  All the staff were helpful and it was a delight staying at this property.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It completely messed with my sinuses and head the first night because it BLOWS DIRECTLY AT THE BED.  I couldn\u2019t escape it in my sleep, and didn\u2019t like the Saharan Desert option, so I woke up congested and with a headache. I knew I couldn\u2019t last another night like that, we were unable to sufficiently adjust the direction of the airflow ourselves, so we called maintenance who at first said he couldn\u2019t do anything and then my partner asked about putting cardboard up to divert the airflow. He came back with a box lid and tape and it helped, though not ideal because it kept falling down and the thermometer no longer read the temperature properly, so it would not cut on as often as it should have. The room was more warm than not, but at least I wasn\u2019t sick. To make matters worse, the smell of cigarette smoke started coming through the HVAC bent in the shower in the bathroom. I assume this is from someone in another room of the hotel smoking. I\u2019m sensitive to cigarette smoke, so the smell was really bothersome. We tried keeping the bathroom door closed and the balcony door open as much as possible while in the room, at times running the shower to mask the smell. It was rough. It was the worst room experience I\u2019ve had in a really long time in any part of the world. No matter the amenities, if I cannot regulate the temperature well, get sick from forceful direct air blowing in my face while I sleep, and can not breathe clean air within the confines of my room, it is a horrible experience.

My dietary restrictions make the restaurant unusable and therefore irrelevant and a rooftop bar is not conducive to a meeting or just a place to talk to someone.

To entice me back they offered two free nights and free breakfasts for 3 people for the length of our stay.  Free nights in NYC is hard to turn down, so on May 10 we returned.  We were greeted warmly and they even had our room ready for us at 8 am.    I was asked to provide the gift certificate, which I did.  I inquired as to how we obtained the free breakfast and was told the restaurant kew what to do.  When I checked out the system was down and it wasn't until later that I received an itemized summary of the harges.  Lo and behold all the breakfasts were charged.  We chose to eat at the hotel only 3 of the 7 mornings as the food was subpar, served cold and the service was indifferent at best.  We chose not to complain about this as the meals were to be free.  After calling the manager informed us that the breakfasts were limited to $25 a person and that was all they would remove from our charges.  At no time and in no place was that listed and we were not told that when I asked about the breakfasts.  $25 a person does not get an entree, coffee and juice.  I am extremely disappointed that again the hotel has not lived up to their word.  The manager told my husband that she would get back to him but we have waited and it is about 2 weeks after the initial contact and we have not heard from the hotel.  Apparently, they think we have forgotten.  My son has relocated to NYC and we visit frequently.  We will not stay there again and I suggest if you want an honest place to stay that you find somewhere else.

I could not even sit at the \"sitting area\" (just a chair and tiny cocktail table that could barely hold my laptop); I had paid extra for a room with that \"feature\" and would not do so again.  \nCommon spaces are nonexistent except for the upstairs lounge area which, as others note, is often closed for private events.  It was closed for almost my entire stay here due to a corporate party (and time for setting it up and breaking it down).  Because of this, there was literally no common space to use; and as noted already, the room was uncomfortably small.  Adding insult to injury, we had a balcony room above the lounge and were kept up until the wee hours by the corporate party's pounding music.  \nCleo is fine but it is very specific cuisine; should really be another option for food at a decent hotel.\nLack of a fitness center is inexcusable.  I appreciate the Equinox pass, which I used, but the whole process of going there, filling out liability waivers, etc. is cumbersome and nothing like popping into an in-hotel fitness center.\nElevators: I rarely waited less than 5 minutes for an elevator to arrive.\n\nIn all, this hotel seems to be relying on the Mondrian name because it is just not up to par otherwise.

Drinks at Cleo were fantastic.\n\nWent to bed and were awoken at 4am by very drunk, very loud club goers leaving. Apparently our room was located in some proximity to either an exit or outdoor space for the club (??), seeing as we looked out directly onto a brick wall I was no quite sure HOW it was so loud.

It is a new hotel however the rooms are super small.  We booked a corner suite and were given a room which was apparently the same category of room but not on the corner.  The room was super small and had no bedside table on one side and the bathroom counter was chipped.  When I requested a bedside table, so that I didn\u2019t have to put my reading glasses on the floor I was looked at like I was speaking a foreign language.  A table was sent up to our room, but it was a meals table which clearly didn\u2019t fit in the room let alone fit next to the bed \u2013 very odd???  After a couple of days, we were moved to the suite we had booked.  This room was significantly larger and comfortable and surprisingly had 2 bedside tables not 1!!!!\nThe other issue with this hotel is there is no drop off or pick up for hotel guests.  Our taxi driver was given US$120 fine one day when he dropped us off and the concierge could not have cared less that the driver got a fine!!!  My husband and I ended up paying half of the drivers fine since we felt so bad that he got a ticket!  Shame on the Mondrian for not providing suitable drop off and pick up locations for their guests.\nThings that I liked was that the bathrooms were nice, new and clean.  The location is good.

Also, the hotel provided a cell phone(HANDY PHONE) to use during your stay , This was especially great coming from Canada where we have to purchase data. Not needed this time,  as the phone provided google map service , cell service and all the apps needed to stay in touch with loved ones back home. Free coffee every morning and bottled water was available at the front desk whenever we asked,  free of charge. friendly bell boys always available to hail a cab and open the door.

As it is my first time to visit NYC, I wanted to stay in an area which is near or accessible to several sights, restaurants, bars, subway stops and fitness centers. I was also keen on getting a room with a splendid view of the busy streets. I had gotten more than i bargained for with the Balcony King room that was given to me! At 275 square feet, i thought it would be tight considering I had opted for a room with a balcony rather than the bigger Deluxe King. However, the room was big and cozy! The very comfortable queen sized bed was located right across the window so it made my dreams of waking up to a spectacular view of the city come to life! The bathroom door also doubles as a huge full length mirror \u2014 a must for every woman hoping to plan her daily outfits for sightseeing! Service was likewise impeccable as a room was made available earlier than the standard check in time of 3pm. Hector in concierge was very accommodating and ensured to orient me of the perks that came with the room like complimentary coffee served daily until 11am, appetizers from Cleo- the mediterranean restaurant at the lobby, cocktails, and more! Josh, the doorman always ensured to open the door for me each time i left to go sightseeing or returned to the hotel after an entire day out in the cold. Josh and Hector also advised me on which routes to take to get to my planned destinations. Since the hotel does not have a gym, the guests get complimentary passes (up to 2 for each guest) to all Equinox clubs in the city, a very posh fitness chain. The nearest branch is only 2 blocks away and a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

The one of a kind service truly made it difficult to leave the room especially during the coldest days on Thanksgiving weekend. Food in Cleo was likewise delicious. I enjoyed the Lamb, grilled salmon kebab and brussek sprouts very much. My stay was splendid that I even decided to extend for another night! It was certainly top of the line service at an affordable price.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

We went back to the front desk and the girl assured us it was \"one\" of their deluxe king rooms. We told them that their website indicated something completely different and we paid extra for that specific room. Luckily a real deluxe king room was available and were put into that room, but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, like they were trying to dupe their guests. I actually read a similar review on here so it seems like this isn't the first time they've done this.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":12845266,"title":"Disappointing, to say the least!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-11-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Where to begin? We had problems with the Mondrian from the very start. Check in was an extremely slow and lengthy process. We were told our room was not ready and that they'd call us when it was available. We went out for a few hours, and still no call, so we just returned to the hotel. At this point, it was well past the stated check-in time, and yet, the room STILL wasn't ready, so we waited in the lobby for quite a while until they finally gave us our keys. \n\nThe room itself was OK, but arranged really oddly. Why is the love seat facing the closet instead of the TV? Why are the bed and desk blocking the mirrors? Why is there no in-room coffee maker? The bathroom was the worst part. They've got weird European toilets that barely have any water in them, shower heads that spray at the wall instead of down onto the person, and no hooks for hanging wet towels. Plus, the shower had some sort of leak, which led to a bath mat that was always soggy and literally never dried. There is no makeup mirror and almost zero counter space to keep any of your bathroom products, which is probably not an issue for men, but is a real pain for women. \n\nBy far, the biggest problem we had was the noise level. We were on the 11th floor, but the window panes are not very thick, so there is still a lot of street noise, despite being on a higher floor. There was also a constant commotion coming from a nearby club, and the thumping bass was audible through the hotel walls at all hours. There was a wedding taking place the weekend we stayed, and the guests decided to have an after-party on our floor. All night long, they were yelling, screaming, slamming doors, banging on the walls, and we could hear their conversations as clearly as if they were in our own room. Mind you, this went on until 3:30 in the morning, when we finally complained to the front desk. They offered a weak apology, but did little to amend the issue. We paid just as much as anyone else in the place, but our concerns were brushed off and dismissed, which we did not appreciate. \n\nAdditionally, there is a rooftop bar in the hotel that is open to the public, so anyone off the street can come into the hotel and take the elevator to any floor. There are only two elevators, and there are no security measures for accessing the floors with rooms (such as requiring a room key to take the elevator to those floors). As a result, we ended up in an elevator with a bunch of obnoxious drunks, and when the elevator stopped to let us out on our floor, one of them cursed and verbally assaulted us because apparently, we were delaying them on their way up to the bar. Money can't buy class, as you will quickly learn when staying at the Mondrian. \n\nThe clientele at this hotel could be summed up in three words: jerks with money (which are the very worst kind). Everyone seemed to have such a rude and entitled attitude. The worse you act, the more the staff fawns over you, which would actually be funny if it wasn't so sad. Obviously, we were not impressed with our stay. There is a wonderful hotel a few blocks away called The Giraffe. You can bet we'll be staying there in the future. We would never again stay at the Mondrian.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":12845266,"title":"A horror story","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-11-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"My husband I stayed at the hotel from October 29-November 5 2018.  We stayed in a Premier King.  This was our second stay at the hotel and we were excited to be able to stay there again.  I travel to NYC 4-5 times a year to visit my son and was happy to have found a hotel in a good location with nice rooms.\n\nUnfortunately, we won\u2019t be staying here again.  On October 31, we returned to our room at about 4 pm.  We were meeting our son at our hotel a little later for dinner.  Upon arriving at our room the room attendant was cleaning it.  We had left the room before 7 am but did not mind dropping a few things off and going to the lounge for a drink.\n\nAt about 5:30 pm we, my husband, son and myself, returned to our room to quickly pick up a sweater and jacket.  At that time nothing in the room seemed to be in disorder.  We went to dinner and returned again at approximately 10:00 pm.  Upon entering the room we saw a huge clump of hair that looked like something from a horror movie.  The hair looked as if it had been pulled from someone\u2019s head. Perhaps as a result of a domestic dispute. It was about 12 inches long and blonde in color.  I have dark hair and my husband has grey hair.  My husband went down to the front desk to find out who had been in our room, and to get our room changed.  \n\nWhile my husband was downstairs I discovered that my clothes had been folded and moved around with my dirty clothes combined with my clean clothes and all of the items that had been on my nightstand had been placed in a bag where I stored my electronics.  Unfortunately, the items on the nightstand included liquids that spilled in the bag ruining a portable stereo speaker that attached to my iPhone.  In addition $12 worth of tea tins were missing.\n\nMy hats and scarves and gloves had been moved from the location I kept them, gathered all together, some had been used on the subway and were filthy thus combining clean and dirty belongings.  The same had been done with my pajamas.\n\nMoving rooms was not an option as the only room available was above the restaurant where an extremely loud party was taking place.  The front desk informed me that the party was for the owner of the hotel\u2019s daughter and that the owner did not care if the party disturbed guests.  When I was downstairs, numerous guests were complaining about the noise and asking to have their room moved.\n\nMy husband and I did not sleep, and in the morning we attempted to speak to the manager.  Finally, at about noon our room was changed.  We trudged back to the hotel to switch rooms that took about 2 hours of our time, including travel time to and from the hotel.  We spoke with the manager at the time and were told that the hair was from a wig and was probably brought in on the shoes of the room attendant or the mini bar attendant.  The hair was not on the floor when we were in the room at 5:30, somehow it entered the room after that time.   The manager minimized the impact saying it was just one of those things.  There was little to no recognition that the lack of sleep was ruining our vacation and one of the few times we were able to be with both of our children at the same time.\n\nThe manager offered to take one half off of our room for the previous night.  I told her that was unacceptable and that a free stay was what would be acceptable.  She then told us that we should switch hotels.  I was not going to spend the precious little time I had with my children finding and moving hotels, which would have been near impossible as the NYC marathon was that Sunday, and the city was packed.\n\nThe manager also told us that it was the hotel\u2019s policy that the room attendants move guest\u2019s personal belongings and organize them for them.  I have traveled extensively throughout the United States and the world and stayed in everything from the finest hotels to Motel 6 and I have never stayed in a hotel where this was the case without notice.  And in fact, this was not the case on our previous stay.  Had it been I can assure you I would not have stayed again.  I do not believe it is appropriate for the hotel staff to go through my things.  \n\nWhen my husband spoke to the general manager she determined that taking the entire night off our bill plus one-half of our last night was the best the hotel could do.  I do not think this is at all reasonable.  The night\u2019s that were discounted were of course the least expensive nights of our trip.  We refused housekeeping for the remainder of our trip since they would not guarantee that our things would not be gone through and moved around.  I stay in a nice hotel so that I have housekeeping daily and fresh towels and a clean shower and fresh sheets.  \n\nAfter we moved rooms we never heard from the hotel management again.  Never an apology, nor a bottle of wine or an offer to buy us dinner.  Any one of those would have gone a long way towards alleviating this horrific experience.  While it may sound amusing, finding a strangers clump of hair in your room and your personal belongings gone through is actually quite creepy.  We do not trust the hotel to keep their guests safe from intrusions and believe that someone likely used our room while we were out.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I had just moved from the Trump hotel so I could split my time between the upper and lower areas of NYC. The experience was quite different to Trump International!\n\nPros:\n- The room was suitably clean and all amenities refreshed.\n- No bath, but there was a good shower (with a rainfall option which was nice), I liked the glass doors as opposed to the manky shower curtains that so many NYC hotels seem to adopt.\n- The lounge looked nice (and popular) but I did not really use it.\n\nCons:\n- When my taxi pulled up to the hotel, there was no one to assist me with my bags. I had to juggle my 3 large bags by myself all the way inside where all the bellboys seem to remain before they took over... I appreciate it's cold, but they should really be a bit more proactive when taxis pull up outside of their hotel.\n- The room was very small... this wasn't an issue for me (as I was solo), but I think could be for couples.\n- I really don't like it when hotels don't offer a single bottle of complimentary water (I think it's in poor taste given many guests will have travelled long distances). They had a 750cl bottle of Evian on the bedside table for $10... I mean, c'mon... there's Trader Joes down the road and CVS everywhere, so I suggest you spend 5 mins picking up a few bottles.\n- Room service menu is quite limited - don't expect pancakes or French toast... or anything elaborate. I like to treat myself if I stay in hotels, but nothing on the menu screamed out unfortunately.\n- No iron\/ironing board. I guess you can call for this, but I was in a rush so did not have this option when I discovered they were not in the room.\n- The hotel has 2 elevators only (over 20-something floors) and a busy lounge and bar, so expect a long wait if it's rush hour (I think around 7pm).... Waited a good 10 mins one time and a queue was building up!\n- Noise was a major issue for me... Could hear everything outside. PLUS, Possibly one of the noisiest air cons... This was literally on top of the bed and I had to sleep to the loud scratching sound every night...\n- Also, I difficulties controlling the room temperature - it was either too hot or too cold.\n- Terrible view from my room.\n\nThis isn't the worst hotel I've stayed at in NYC. The location is very good, you have flat iron on your doorstep, Soho and Chelsea are walks away. The price I paid was also not too bad. I also commend them on the cleanliness, but I think the noise issue alone would prevent me from staying there again. It also does not have the wow factor if you're looking to treat yourself - the staff just didn't feel very warm and friendly (they were nice enough and not in any way rude), I like breakfast in bed and didn't like the menu, room was too small...","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

There was no note or anything in the room for my wife's birthday as had been agreed. Mondrian's own website shows a Deluxe King room as being bright and spacious with multiple windows with a wing back chair and side tables. In reality our room was dark, had one small window, no wing back chair and not even enough room between the bed and wall for a side table. I understand hotel website pictures are representative of the room and the exact room may not be provided but this was so far removed from what was advertised that I can't really put it into words.

The sheets were crisp white, the pillows could have been more comfortable but in general we were very happy with our room.

Afterward we went to check out the lounge downstairs it had great music, comfy seats to relax & good ambiance as well. Before heading out we wanted to check out the rooftop & that was by far my favorite part. The views are amazing & there was a bar and couches & nice patio furniture outside so we could enjoy a drink with the view!! We stayed for a total of 4 nights and the ONLY thing that wasn\u2019t 100% was the service to the room. We\u2019d have to call down multiple times before we\u2019d get anyone to come up.

It does not provide tea and coffee making facilities in your room, it does not provide at least a couple of small bottles of water, it does not provide an iron and ironing board in your room \u2013 only on request and it takes over an hour to get to you and the iron leaks and your clothes are completely wet so don\u2019t bother trying to iron with the useless iron provided.  The hotel does not provide hooks in the bathroom to hang your wet towels on. The Mondrian Hotel does NOT do any of those things.\nOur room advertised as spacious but was in fact TINY.  The room had quality fittings, a nice large television, an air conditioner that worked really well, a comfortable bed with nice pillows and the room is decorated very tastefully.  \n\nThe room is only big enough for you to shower and sleep in, and it does lack some practicalities if you are having a longer stay, for example the hanging space provided for your clothing is tiny and it makes it very hard to hang a weeks worth of clothing in the tiny space provided, there are no draws and the room is small so you can\u2019t leave your suitcase open to grab things.  \n\nThe blinds and curtains in the room are not block out curtain, so that sun wakes you up every morning.  If you are a poor sleeper or just like your sleep you might like to pack a sleep mask to use during your stay.  The hotel provides a portable make up mirror, however there is no room or accessible plug to use it, so why bother having the make-up mirror in the room on a shelf? Well I suppose it is decorative but not practical -  it seems so pointless.\n\nYou are also unable to hand wash any items during your stay as there is no plug for the hand basin, which is quite frustrating is you are staying for more than a few days. The bathroom is equally small, but had a good size shower recess with a choice of two shower heads, however our shower door was not sealed\/fitted properly so that every time you had a shower it would flood the bathroom floor and every time you went to use the toilet in the bathroom or wash your hands you would be stepping on a very soggy bathmat where the shower flooded the bathroom floor and bath mat, this was extremely frustrating and gross.  We also found it frustrating that the bathroom did not have any towel rails or hooks to hang your towels on. \n\nIf you are looking for accommodation to only sleep and shower in for a few days, the hotel is adequate.  If you require space or like to spend time in your room, you might be better off looking somewhere else to stay.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room is of a decent size. Cleaning was not done properly as a bottle of water left by the previous guests had not been removed. The hotel is conveniently located close to subway stops though the closest one on 28th street was closed for renovation. The real minus with the hotel was that they do not offer breakfast options. You have to go to the hotel restaurant Cleo and order a specific breakfast. This proved costly, eggs benedict, fresh grapefruit juice and a tea for 50 usd tip included. This may be New York but I was in London recently and paid 25 usd for a high quality buffet breakfast at a Radisson Blu hotel. The other option is to go to the nearby Pret \u00e0 manger or Starbucks, but healthy breakfast options are limited. The roof top bar is nice.

The lobby (even with its high ceiling) is small as are the hotel's elevators and corridors. Despite this, my room was reasonably spacious by NYC standards. Beyond this, there are hits and misses. The overall style of the hotel is nice; it's modern without being over-the-top, but some of this design comes at the expense of comfort and luxury. The \"closet\" it pretty small, at least for hanging clothes; the bathroom sink is pretty to look at but difficult to use, and the stylish chair and table outfitting almost all rooms aren't much of an excuse for a desk. My king room came with a spacious balcony that was impossible to use other than for standing because it's outfitted with no furniture. But the nice view from my room made up for most of these sins. The real misses, those to make it likely that I won't return, relate to more significant maintenance issues: Halfway into my stay, I realize that the wall-mounted television in my room didn't work. Likely a power issue since the minibar below didn't cool either. Not wanting to pack up and move, I had to stay in a room without a TV or any cold water--this is a pretty material disappointment for me. And then I discovered that the plug behind the sliding bathroom door didn't work, making it difficult to iron.

And for NYC, the size was fine, so really, no complaints there.\n\nSo when we arrived we were told coffee and wife was complimentary.... The dictionary definition of complimentary is: 'given, or supplied free of charge.'.... \n\nUpon checking out, I was slapped with a facility fee. I know this is standard in NYC, which it should not be, but it is.... when I asked what the facility fee was for, I was told, for the gym, the complimentary coffee and the complimentary wifi.... Oh dear.\n\nSo because I had an early morning flight, I didn't argue the obvious point, paid my bill (which also included an incorrect tip of $20 for $30 of drinks, I tipped $8 & an incorrect charge to my Australian VISA which incurred outrageous international transaction fees... I had told the lady to charge to my MasterCard which had no fees)..... \n\nTo their credit, after I challenged the facility fee and the VISA transaction fee, Mondrian's accountant gave me a refund with minimum fuss. So this is a good thing.\n\nBut, please Mondrian, tell your staff, and perhaps the 3rd party booking agents (ie, Booking.com, hotels.com, etc), that complimentary wifi, coffee does not hold true when you guys charge that ridiculous facility fee, which you shouldn't.

All hotels in NYC are basically upward-climbing boxes so Mondrian truly takes advantage of small, aesthetic design touches - from rose gold mirrors everywhere, to some actual art pieces in the room, the cute retro outfits they make the doormen wear, to light music and even a nice scent in the lobby!! Very high end for being a pretty small, compact hotel.\n2) THE MOST COMFORTABLE bed I've ever slept in. Seriously, after 5 nights of the best sleep I've ever had, I didn't even want to come back to my pedestrian bed at home!\n3) They treated us like ballers even though we're nobodys. They put us on the 20th floor (I even had a celebrity sighting, I know I'm a loser) and even gave us a bottle of wine for my birthday!! And 2 free cocktails at the bar... I think this came with our particular room rate so if you can find that I highly recommend it. \n4) That leads me to... the 15th floor bar!! It's beautiful! It doesn't have the most incredible views so go elsewhere for that, but the drinks were strong, the vibes were stellar and the music was good. I went for Friday night happy hour, picked a gin and tonic for my free cocktail, and people watched and jammed out. \n5) The location is perfect. It is right off the 4 and 6, and you can also easily access the R and W trains a few blocks away. It's in a bit of a corporate\/work area, away from the tourists but still so easily accessible. Lots of great food around, being close to Koreatown! \n6) There is no gym here, so they give you access to the Equinox down the street. It's not the most mind-blowing Equinox I've ever been in, but it gets the job done! Like I said, the location is in a financial area so it's mostly people coming in, getting their workout in, and getting out. Tons of cardio, even some specialty pieces like a self-powered tread. A functional area with kettlebells and Viprs if you're into that, and a full class schedule. I took Firestarter - kicked my butt. It's a good added value because normally you'd have to pay for a day pass at Equinox. \n\nBasically I got to feel like a baller in New York City, which never happens if you're a regular schmo. We got a rate of like $300\/night which is apparently pretty good for New York value. Book here if you get a deal like that!!!","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I understand that it used to be an old office building which they renovated but it doesn\u2019t feel like there was enough done and the interior feels old despite the new paint\/furniture\/etc. There are 5 additional floors they added on top of the original building so I believe those rooms would be nicer. These are also the rooms advertised on their website but there is a good chance you will not be in one of them. \n\nThe rooms are small which is to be expected from NYC but for the price range you can definitely get bigger rooms at similarly ranked hotels in the area. The front desk did offer an upgrade to a suite (for an additional charge per night but still below the advertised nightly rate) so my son would have more room to crawl around. We paid for the upgrade as the original room we would have been in was just too small. Even the suite I would say is on the smaller side.\n\nOne final comment, the front desk were thoughtful and added a complementary breakfast with our paid upgrade but sadly didn\u2019t communicate this clearly to us. I only realized when we checked out and I saw it written on the bill. ","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We've been to a number of NYC hotels that only seem to care about how their property looks in photographs so I'm always skeptical when I see a hotel that seems to be \"design-heavy.\"  However, much to my happiness, this place shows that it really does care about guest comfort along with having a design focus (except for the super uncomfortable petrified wood-looking \"bench\" taking up most of the little lobby area -- there were some little kids that seemed to enjoy climbing on it but sitting on it as an adult is painful).\n\nFirst, every staff person we encountered on our little one-night stay was committed to hospitality.  They were all a pleasure to interact with and have clear intent to be helpful. Our room was on the small side, even for NYC, but it was designed to be very practical.  For example, the little tables used as nightstands had storage shelves, there were handy ledges in the bathroom, the bathroom basin sink was at a usable height, there were wastebaskets where you'd want them, etc.  And all of the materials used were of good quality, like the metals in the bathroom and in the room itself were sturdy and built to last, the linens on the bed were long enough to tuck under the mattress and were of high thread count, the stone around the basin sink was rough-hewn on the edges but had a polish that will keep it clean, etc.  Sometimes you walk into a hotel room and you feel like they had set it up like a movie set -- looks good but if you touch it you realize it is meant for a camera lens and not really practical.  Not here -- it looks good but it feels good too!\n\nThe bed was comfortable, the HVAC worked great, and the massive TV first seemed like it might be too big for the room but actually was fun to watch.  Everything was super clean.  \n\nI reviewed them separately but we really liked Fifteen Stories as a little rooftop bar.  The servers were attentive and the cheese plate was not only interesting but scrumptious, as was the cocktail I had.  And it continued the chic comfort vibe.  We were there early in the evening so I don't know if the atmosphere changes or not, but it was nice to be in a rooftop lounge where couples, singles, after-work folks and even families felt at home.  (Note that even though I've let TripAdvisor know weeks ago, as of this writing the TA listing for Fifteen Stories is spelled incorrectly so it might be harder for people to find reviews for the lounge -- TripAdvisor has it listed as \"15 Stories.\")  \n\nThis hotel will definitely be on our list for future staycations in NYC -- they get most everything right!","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is also a hotel car that can take you 10 blocks up or down --so fun!","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":7,"locationId":12845266,"title":"Lovely hotel with a few glitches","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-03-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"All in all, this is a great hotel and I'd have no problem recommending it to someone. That said, there are a few things that could've made this a better experience. The location is great, especially if cabbing in from Laguardia airport. There is a subway close by and lots of restaurants to keep you satisfied in the area. So A+ on location.\n\nThe hotel is aesthetically beautiful, both the lobby and the rooms. However, I do think the rooms could've used a kettle or coffee maker. Instead, I had to order room service just for tea and it becomes quite pricey. Realistically I could've just gone a block away to the Starbucks to grab tea but I was in pajamas and wanted it while laying in bed. The point is, it would be a nice addition, and one that I think is expected in most 4 star hotels.\n\nI personally did not find the beds comfortable to sleep in and found the sheets overstarched. I know someone else who stayed in the hotel at the same time, and though they found the sheets stiff too, they slept fine. So perhaps it's just me being picky but I struggled sleeping for the 5 nights I stayed there. But the room was lovely, and I enjoyed laying in bed watching movies on the large TV at night. The bathroom was also very nice - loved the two shower heads in the large shower.\n\nWhen I first checked in, the receptionist was quite rude and grunted at me. We hardly exchanged any words. However, the rest of the staff throughout the stay were extremely pleasant and warm so I'm assuming that lady was having a bad day. Honestly, everyone else was so extremely kind, it made her attitude even more glaringly rude.\n\nI don't often eat in hotel restaurants but I made an exception this trip and tried the restaurant Cleo for breakfast. The food was good, but extremely overprice for what it was. Skip the hotel's breakfast and go two blocks down to Sarabeth's, or any of the other restaurants in the area. I don't mind spending a lot of money on a lush breakfast, but this was hardly worth the price.\n\nAnother thing I should note was that there was a facility charge added on - at $25 a day - that hadn't been listed anywhere online when I booked. Now, at check out they were very understanding because I had booked before the policy came into place. Because of that, the fee was removed and I appreciated it. But for all those going forward, be warned... you are paying an extra $25 a day to your booking price for \"facilities\". \n\nWhile I liked the hotel, I don't think I'd book here again with that extra surcharge. Perhaps that $25 could go towards putting tea and a kettle in the rooms.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

There are lots of hotels to choose from - especially in NYC - and what distinguishes one for the other for me is service. Anticipating needs and filling them. This hotel was just recently opened when we visited, so I can appreciate that there were still some kinks to work out. The rooms were great - clean, well appointed and well thought out to maximize space. You can't beat the hotel location - prime Park Ave. real estate. Which also means that space is at a premium. There isn't much of a lobby, so the hotel cleverly invites guests up to their 'rooftop lounge' to wait if their room isn't quite ready. The challenge when we checked in was that they invited us up to the lounge to wait for our room, and left us there. The lounge was unattended and left over food wrappers dotted the lounge tables. Had there been a staff member there to greet us, offer us water, coffee or even a cocktail and to let us know when our room was ready - what a different experience that would have been! I will be back - in part to see if they've worked out some of the 'opening day' kinks.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

La camera \u00e8 dotata di ogni comfort o quasi, manca la caraffa per prepararsi th\u00e8 e caff\u00e8 per il resto veramente tutto: asciugamani a volont\u00e0, accappatoi caldi ed eleganti, set da bagno, asciugacapelli e televisore hd dove poter vedere parecchi canali e collegarsi dal proprio device e godersi Netflix e tt i servizi che sfruttano la tecnologia Chromecast se si \u00e8 stufi di sentire parlare inglese \ud83d\ude02. Letto ampio \u00e8 comodissimo. Non posso che lodare il personale: giovane, accogliente, cordiale, gradevole e molto efficiente. Menzione speciale per Jennifer, Leonela, Antoneta e Hector ma direi tutti di alto profilo professionale. Unico appunto, ma \u00e8 veramente un dettaglio: hall non molto spaziosa e arredata con due improbabili finti sassi in plasticona nera che ne occupano met\u00e0 dello spazio che dovrebbero fungere da divani e murales che con Mondrian non c\u2019entrano molto. Per concludere tornerei sicuramente al Mondrian Park Avenue. Da notare che durante il nostro soggiorno le temperature sono state veramente glaciali e tornare in hotel dopo una giornata da girovaghi, nella nostra stanza nr 1802 \u00e8 stato davvero un piacere unico!!!!","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This hotel just recently opened so we felt very fortunate to have found this hidden gem!\n\nLocation: Amazing location - within walking distance to many attractions including most of the major holiday sights.  Right next to the Empire State Building.  Lots of great local restaurants to choose from, I especially loved the nearby Korean restaurants and cafes.\n\nRoom: I loved the design! Very clean, modern, and spacious (that is...spacious by NYC standards).  We have stayed in NYC hotels several times in the past and by far this was the most spacious room.  Lots of room in the shower with a dual shower head.  Crisp modern design but also very cozy and inviting.  \n\nStaff: Exceptionally friendly staff - I felt I was welcome from the moment that I stepped into the lobby.  The front desk staff were courteous, professional, and efficient.  The doormen went out of their way to be extra friendly - even ensuring I had an umbrella for my frequent walks.  \n\nOverall, I honestly could not believe our luck in booking such a great hotel in NYC on short notice.  We look forward to staying here again.   We did not get to fully explore the grounds or the restaurant so we are looking forward to checking that out on our next visit.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

So was the service, the location, and ambiance. Unfortunately, in the middle of my visit, I suffered a horrific bout of food poisoning (from a cheeseburger I had at another hotel where my friend was staying). I spent a day and a half unable to move from my bed. The staff at the Mondrian, from the front desk to servers at in-room dining to bell boys, were angels to me during that time. In particular, Hector, one of the doormen, went out in the freezing cold to get me all sorts of things from a nearby pharmacy, delivered it with utmost concern, and followed up on me throughout the day. His concern was very comforting and a detail I so appreciated. Servers delivered towels, ice, ginger ale and offered to take me anywhere I needed. I am most grateful. It is these types of details that make all the difference in a world of cheap and impersonal consumerism. Recognition is highly deserved.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

The first day we asked for two additional bath towels as we had 4 people in the room and again had to ask for another one as they kept giving us < 4. There is no iron or ironing board, but one was supplied immediately upon request. We sensed that the people before us smoked cigarettes due to a mild unpleasant smoke scent. However, room service supplied us with a large electric air freshener and by the end of the stay it was almost gone. There is no gym and the rooms are in fact a bit on the small side\n\nHowever, we really felt welcome and the stay was great.

However, I would strongly recommend anyone looking for a midtown hotel should consider this place.\n\nIts entrance is unconventional, almost hidden and the lobby level seems designed to be uninviting. Happily, though, our room was ready and we were checked-in very quickly. The room was very impressive. The king-size bed (Simmons Beautyrest) and the huge TV (with built-in Chromecast -yay!) were the highlights. Storage was largely open (I like that) but adequate as was the space in the room. Lots of USB sockets for charging - again  yay! We did not care there was no desk. Very nice art books, though. I cannot comprehend other reviwers enthusiasm for the bathroom. It is small. There is no bath (not a problem in itself). There is a wall mounted shower and a rain-shower. But these two showers do more or less the same thing. I read into the reviews that the wall-mounted shower offered flexibilty (I would have preferred wall-mounted horizontal jets and given how up-to-date the hotel feels almost expected them.) But no- we had two fixed vertical showers for no apparent reason. All the rooms are the same in this respect it seems. How dumb is that?! But clearly some customers don't mind. However, I firmly believe that the first priority of a hotel is to offer a good night's sleep and the Mondrian gets top marks in two respects. Firstly, the bed is so good we unzipped it to find out who made it.And secondly, the atmosphere in the room was so good we did not even look for air-conditioning controls - I think that is a first for me. However, there was a strange rolling noise from the courtyard five floors below us in the early hours. So our room (611) might not be ideal for light sleepers. Breakfast in the Cleo restaurant was among the best ever anywhere (pricey but there are two Starbucks, a Pain Quotidien and a Pret nearby) . Unfortunately, the rooftop bar is not the asset we thought it might be.\n\nOur bad experience was on Christmas Day when we returned to find our room unmade and requested fresh towels. This experiience is unlikely to be repeated and the way the management (in the form of Alexander) dealt with it the next day was exemplary and gives me confidence that after a while this will be a really great hotel. It might be worth pointing out that we booked late and got a very good price. I confidently predict that this place will fill up and we will never get such a bargain again. Despite the showers I think it deserves to succeed.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Special mention to Mani and Jonathan they were great.\n\nThe room- the room had no view but to be fair we did t request one on the front so this was no problem, as it was on the back it was nice and quiet though. The room was spotless clean, amazing comfortable bed, great TV, beautiful bathroom . It wasn\u2019t massive but was easily big enough for the two of us.\nJust one thing to note it doesn\u2019t have tea coffee facilities so if you want a brew when you get up in the morning you need take your own travel kettle. Suppose you could use room service but that gets expensive.\n\nThe restaurant - looks lovely but as we were room only we didn\u2019t eat there so can\u2019t comment.\n\nRoof top bar- again lovely but we were out exploring the city so didn\u2019t have a drink there.\n\nIn summary this hotel has great reviews and you can see why, it\u2019s in a great location, it\u2019s really new and modern which is what we like \nDefinitely five star!

Surprisingly came across Mondrian at a surprisingly reasonable price. The Holiday Inn was more expensive... So of course we jumped on the opportunity. \n\nThe location is really the most attractive part of this hotel. It's about a 10min walk from Penn Station and Grand Central, similarly to Bryant Park and Madison Square Park. Rockefeller Center was a nice 25min stroll up 5th Ave. K-town is next door for great Korean food and the options are endless if you go just a few streets uptown or downtown. There are several subway options within a 5min walking radius as well.\n\nAs with many things in Manhattan, things are small. Our deluxe room doesn't offer much walking room around the king size bed. The pillows are very comfortable but I could use a slightly thicker comforter. The bathroom is compact but I loved that they dedicated most of the space in there to the rain shower. We didn't watch any TV but that thing is huge, in an out of proportion way to the room itself. We had a window facing Park Ave and had no issues with noise, but there is an ever slight cold draft that is just noticeable.\n\nAs for other amenities in the hotel, we only checked out the restaurant Cleo downstairs for dessert and cocktails which were decent. They also have an upper floor lounge and an basement bar.\n\nThings that can be improved on: \n- This is the first hotel I've been to where there was no iron\/board in the room.

This certainly was a hit! My wife and I have had our own share of travel experiences in line with our profession. We get to stay at all sorts of hotels from swankiest to cheapest and all. This hotel is different - looks complicated with all the art that surrounds the spaces, and a very nice affluent crowd in the next door restaurant, but once you set in you are greeted with genuine smiles - young crew with great attitude. We were upgraded to a much larger room with a balcony overlooking the East of the city, really comfy bed with oversized pillows and the biggest telly by far in a hotel. The only thing we missed is having a tub. But what really sets it apart from others is their staff. We had to utilize their expertise one night when my wife craved for pizza - no food service late at night. One call, within 20 or less minutes, food delivered, done deal. The best part, they gave us a whole pie and was complimentary - for the \u201cinconvenience\u201d from the hotels general manager. I would have willingly paid but they took the extra step to satisfy us by doing this. Certainly above and beyond! This hotel is by far on top of our list. No pretensions just a humble genuine and dedicated service provider to their customers. We will definitely be back with our children in the summer.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

For example, I had asked if the hotel had a lint remover (pretty standard question) and didn't have to ask twice before someone brought it up to my room.  Whereas, at the other hotels even though we are a corporate client, I felt brushed off and just a number (not a guest).

The bathrooms are large in proportion to the room and have a rain shower option.  I snagged a 19th floor terrace, and enjoyed my evening wine and morning coffee with a front row seat to NYC.  There is even turn down service in the evening - so use the DND card if this is not your thing (it is my thing -- I love the attention).  If you are planning a longer stay with lots or wardrobe changes, you may want to ask if they supply portable racks.  The closet (really just an open box with hangers and shelves) in my room could not accommodate much in the way of hanging clothes.  However, there was room in the bathroom for a rack if they are available.   I did not get to try the restaurant or bar, so I have reserved my final star.  Also, if you use the valet parking service, make sure you understand the pricing.  I did have an issue, but a manager immediately corrected it to my satisfaction.

Upstairs there is an incredible rooftop restaurant and bar and in addition breakfast is offered complimentary each morning which included fresh pastries from a local bakery and coffee and juice. Our rooms were adequate with a king bed and shower and a mini bar if you choose to indulge in alcoholic beverages or champagne or snacks. And my favorite amenity in the room was the shower! The shower is incredible it has the rainforest type nozzle and various temperature settings and water pressure options. The rooms were immaculate and the closet was perfect with open shelves for you to store your items.

Bad reviews in week one don't bode well for the future - so kudos to the Mondrian!  I gave four starts solely because I travel constantly for work and I've stayed in 1000+ hotels in my life so it takes a lot for me to give five stars.  \n\nHotel was comfortable and the staff was absolutely stellar.  Beds were great.  Stacy and Hafsa at the front desk were amazing.  I can't remember his name, but the friendliest concierge in the world with the beard was just adorable.  Door guys were all smiley and chipper.  Staff gets five stars for sure.\n\nBathrooms were a bit snug, but there was some counter space and a shelf for the ladies to put their various items.  Showers had great water pressure AND had the option for the rain shower or wall shower head.  They have a complimentary driver that will take you anywhere within 10 blocks of the hotel, which came in handy going to Penn Station really early in the AM.  \n\nThe restaurant was open so I cannot comment on that.  They did offer continental breakfast for us since there was no restaurant, which is always nice (even if it was a little basic.)\n\nAs with most hotels in NY, there is the noise from the street no matter what floor you're on.

While looking for potential hotels to stay at during my visit to NYC, the 5 star rating this hotel earned by every single reviewee seemed too good to be true, and indeed it was unfortunately. Check-in went smoothly, and I was escorted to my room by the doorman, Manny, who turned out to be the most helpful of all staff members. \n\nI booked a premium king room, and I find it to be small; the unnecessary placement of 2 chairs, a couch, and 2 tables in the same space don\u2019t help at all with making it seem larger. The bathroom, on the other hand, is even smaller\u2014 only 1 person will comfortably be able to fit inside at one time. The room was not prepared at all. There were no racks to place my luggage, and even worse, the bed had hair strands that certainly did not belong to me because I have black, not blonde hair. I also found eyelashes & pieces of string between the sheets. In addition, I found more strands of hair stuck in the shower drain, and the sink + shower were wet even though I haven\u2019t used them. My first impression of the room made me doubt the cleanliness of the hotel\u2014 my utmost priority. After speaking to a member of the housekeeping staff regarding what I observed in the first 10 minutes of my arrival, he told me that the manager will be informed right away. I waited for more than 30 minutes, and yet no one got in touch with me whatsoever. Following a very long wait, I headed to the lobby, only to be greeted by Manny that asked about how I found everything so far. After explaining everything to him and showing him the hairs + threads that I\u2019ve found, he\u2019s the one that took action. He\u2019s the one that apologized for the poor cleanliness & saught to ensure I was satisfied, not anyone else in the hotel. I was transferred to the same room type, but on a different floor. This is the first \u201cluxury\u201d hotel I\u2019ve been to that offers no complementary water in the rooms and no bath slippers. In addition, I would hardly refer to the turndown service as being considered one to begin with according to luxury hotel standards; the only change made in the evening is that the curtains are shut\u2014 lights aren\u2019t dimmed, small touches like chocolates or water by the bedside table are neglected, and the bed isn\u2019t made. Not only that, but the walls are too thin; yesterday night, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I could hear the guest next to me speaking on the phone, people chatting in the halls, as well as music being played. \n\nOn my down to the lobby during my first day here, I heard people in the elevator discussing how big of a disappointment the hotel is turning out to be. I didn\u2019t want to believe it because I made the decision to stay here rather than at the truly luxurious, 5 star Langham Place just 10 minutes away. They were right though\u2014absolutely right. My stay here is turning out to be such a disappointment, and I cannot wait for it to come to an end.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

You wouldn't know it was their first day based on the service and incredibly personalized help I received. The bellman Jonathan welcomed me enthusiastically and after a smooth and friendly check-in he took me to the room and showed me around. You can tell how proud of the rooms and the hotel he was. The artwork, the smart TV, the glass and chrome finishes and the amazing view of Park avenue with the sun setting. Everything was so well appointed and curated. I love the light in the rooms and the bed is super comfortable. This is true elegance but with a youthful energy that permeates everyone who works there. I loved the rooftop bar and can't wait for CLEO restaurant to open. I've been to the one in LA and can't wait to see what they do with it in NYC. Don't miss all the artwork in the lobby and the view of the mirrored ceiling. If you're an art and architecture lover this is the place for you. I can't wait to come back!","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Great views, comfortable bed! This hotel is dog-friendly and when I checked into my room, there was a bed ready for my dog with treats and toys from barkbox, such a nice touch! The 15th-floor lounge has sweeping views and the MPA Margherita was delicious. Special thank you to  Arva and Steven for all your recommendations. Congratulations Mondrian Park Avenue, you have the nicest staff! I will be back, can't wait to try Cleo and your Yours truly soon.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The Mondrian in New York checked all my boxes and created new ones to be fulfilled. The hospitality, the service, the location.... beyond me. I was greeted into the hotel by a warm, good-looking, friendly dark-haired woman who immediately took my bags and offered me a spritz (delicious, by the way). From that moment on, I texted my friend Julie back at home in Chicago saying she'd never see me again! I wanted to stay in that lobby forever. The rooms were modern-chic with a dash of color, but not too much to overwhelm my aesthetic experience. The food was tasty and the complimentary charcuterie inside the room was inspiring. The artwork... everything you want to feast your eyes on and more. I would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking absolute and utter excellence. See you soon, Mondrian.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
