I get it that they are going for a very vibey type of hotel, but it\u2019s just too much. My older generation relatives would have walked in and walked straight out! It comes across as a nightclub first, and hotel second.\nComfortable beds for my daughter and I, however, we are 5\u201d4 and 5\u201d6 and we both found the beds very short. My feet hung over the end of the bed, so I don\u2019t know how the beds are meant to accommodate a taller person. \nGreat location. Short walk to subway station with direct subway line that wizzes you uptown in minutes. Short walk to cool delis (Russ & daughter) and bars, and famous Katz deli. Short walk to little Italy\u2019s Mulberry Street cool shops\/cafes of Spring St and Soho. The Japanese restaurant in the basement had excellent (but v pricey) food. \nBreakfast spread consisted of croissants, pain au chocolat, pots of yoghurt, small bottles of juice and coffee. It was ok but was often picked over by 9.15am and poorly replenished. Free bottle of water in the room would have been nice, as would a mini fridge. Small room (we had a 2 bed city view) which meant that our two large suitcases had to be zipped up and upright or stepped in on way to\/from window. \nA\/C heating worked well. \nGood shower pressure.

No closets or dressers, no luggage rack that I could find, so put my bag on the one chair in the room.  It would have been very tight if I was with someone else in the room though.  The bed was comfortable and everything was very clean.  The bathroom sink is in the room and the shower and toilet are each behind separate sliding doors, which is a bit of an odd setup. \n\nMy one night\u2019s sleep was really quiet even being quite close to the elevator.  I heard no traffic noise or noise from other guests.  \n\nThere is a $30 destination fee charged upon check-in.  You can use this to offset drinks and food in the bar and coffee shop.  I kind of felt compelled to use the $30 just because otherwise it was wasted money to me.  I got in too late for bar drinks so had breakfast, which was passable and not really worth $30.  I\u2019d rather have gone out for a bagel and coffee somewhere else rather than have a cold croissant and yogurt.\n\nThe plusses outweighs the minuses though and I\u2019d probably return if I had events in the area again.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

The hotel was safe, stylish, clean, and extremely accommodating. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the reception staff and check in was seamless. \n\nThe hotel\u2019s restaurant, Sake No Hana and rooftop bar, Highlight Room are a must try. You will have a great time at both. Ladies both are great to throw on your little black dress and take group pictures with friends and family. \n\nOverall, my experience at this hotel was superb and highly recommend it to others. While the hotel itself was awesome, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention one of the most professional, kind, and accommodating staff members, Jade.\n \nJade was exceptionally helpful throughout my stay. As a female traveler, I always forget something and that didn\u2019t change this time. Jade went above and beyond to assist me with securing the items I needed, more importantly she was honest about where she recommended I go for various quality products. Jade thank you, you are a gem! \n\nAlso a special thank you to Jess and Moses you both were also awesome. \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to my next stay later this year. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Moxy brand from Marriott is somewhat inconsistent with some of the locations offering very basic services and other offering a variety of bars, restaurants, etc.  The Moxy NYC Lower East Side is part of the group offering more to do. The bars including the rooftop bar and the lobby bar were great and fun.  There is also a sushi restaurant and piano bar but I did not try either of these. \n\nThe rooms themselves are comfortable but very small.  I was traveling solo with a smaller rolling suitcase and there simply was no place to put the luggage.  There was a drawer under the bed but if you were to store your luggage there it would be difficult to access.  The shower was great and my room had a good view uptown.  The windows opened slightly but when you closed them it was very quiet.  The hotel also offers a free continental breakfast that is more than satisfactory and there is a cafe if you need more.\n\nThe hotel staff are all 1st class and helpful.  The hotel charges a $30 destination fee that includes a $30 credit per day at the lobby bar or cafe on the lobby level and a $30 per day laundry credit.  At first I was somewhat annoyed, but I was able to use my credits at the bar and get a short laundered.\n\nOne last note:  this area is up and coming but still a little rough around the edges. I found it totally safe, especially during the day, but you need to be conscious of the area.  On the plus side, you have some great food options close by including Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Lower East Side for bagels + lox, knishes, and corned beef sandwiches.  It is also a quick 15 minute walk to SoHo and maybe 20 minutes to Greenwich Village.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Heading to reception you'll meet a team of professionals, ready to do what they can efficiently and effectively to make your stay memorable. Call out to Bernie for finding a package for me, and the gentlemen (sorry forgot your name) who sorted out my multiple booking. The entire reception, however are consummate professionals. Room was great (yes smallish but it's NYC), but the design elements are top notch. And dang, the bed is comfortable. Finally, I only dined at the Fix; great food (the burger may be smallish but delish) and drinks. Nathalie, Don and Mike were amongst the spectacular team. Special mention to the Highlight Room.

The lobby is much too noisy in the late afternoon, and you hardly can hear what the reception team says. The check-in is quick and efficient. We booked a room on the 10th floor to make sure not to hear to the lobby music (and it was a wise decision). The room is small, yet well organized. The air con can be stopped but you still have this permanent noise of ventilation, not to talk about the noise of showers of the neighboors. So, we paid more to be at the 10th floor, but had to use earplugs because of this constant noise... All the features of the room are simple but enough and smart. The credit you have for breakfast (30$) can not be cumulated (in order to spend more one day, less the other day). But the quality of food and drinks is good per se, although there was no fruit.  The window, though at the 10th floor, is not large (compared to the nearby M Gallery, where all windows, whatever the category of the room are very large...). If we were to come back, we would try the M Gallery. Ventilation noise + narrow window makes it too expensive for what it is (total for 3 nights booked 8 weeks in advance= 500$ \/ night).

It's like stepping into a hipster's dream, folks. Now, when it comes to hospitality, I gotta give a shoutout to Caroline, the queen of charisma at this joint. She greeted me with a smile that could charm the cynicism out of a grizzled capitalist.\n\nBut let's not forget the free popcorn, people! I mean, I'm no expert, but free popcorn is like a warm hug from the universe, reminding you that there's still a flicker of kindness left in this brutal capitalist world. It's like a small act of rebellion against the corporate machine. You walk in, get your popcorn, and think, \"Yeah, I'm sticking it to the capitalist!\"\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, capitalism has its place, but it can be a ruthless beast. Yet, here at the Moxy, they sprinkle a bit of generosity amid the cold, hard cash. It's a sanctuary of comfort amidst the concrete jungle, and that, my friends, is something to be celebrated.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a slice of quirky luxury in the heart of the Lower East Side, with Caroline's warm welcome and a side of free popcorn, then the Moxy Hotel is your oasis in this dog-eat-dog capitalist world. It's a little haven of humanity amidst the chaos, and it gets a nod of approval from this wise-cracking traveler.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The toilet and shower are behind thin plastic doors. They claim the beds are queen size, but they are only 5 feet wide. Late night the parties go on in the hallways. I assume since the rooms are so small that people party in the hallway. If you're looking for a regular hotel room this is not the place for you. We stopped at the W to see how the renovations were coming along.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":24140501,"title":"Tiny and Terrible.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-09-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Over my many years on this planet, I\u2019ve found my biggest frustration in life is when form takes over function or, when applied to a hotel; style over practicality.  Unfortunately the Moxy is one of the worst example of this.\n\nThe hotel is brand new which means everything is shiny and new, however my room, a Double King with city view is tiny. I\u2019ve stayed in bigger police cells than this and they are generally better designed as well. I\u2019ve stayed in tiny hotel rooms before, but they\u2019ve been sold as such and have been cleverly designed to maximize every inch of space, alas not the Moxy.\n\nOn entering the room you are first assaulted by the sink unit unceremoniously dumped in the entrance hallway. Some half-witted designer, who has clearly never stayed in a hotel before, thinks it\u2019s a great idea to combine the bathroom with the entrance lobby - yes really. I went to unpack my case and was pleased to find the put-up case stand thing that most hotels have, but one problem; there isn\u2019t enough floor space anywhere in the room to put it up, so dumping my case on the bed, I looked for the wardrobe; this doesn\u2019t exist either, it\u2019s three coat hangers dangling beneath the TV, and they are fixed so you can\u2019t even take them off.\n\nLike many business travellers I\u2019m a simple person with only a couple of requirements; somewhere to work, coffee to drink and a hot shower. Once again the Moxy fails on all counts. \n\nWhat claims to be a desk is a 2\u2019 square flap that drops down from the wall coupled with a very small, extremely uncomfortable stall. The stall is good for about ten minutes before it kills your back and as the flap is only just laptop sized, you\u2019re knackered if you want to do anything else on it.\n\nIn 2023, why don\u2019t all US hotels have a coffee making facility? All UK and European hotels do, it\u2019s been a standard for as long as I can remember. I understand why the posh hotels don\u2019t because they expect you to call room service and have it delivered, but the Moxy doesn\u2019t have room service. I asked at the bar at 4pm if they served coffee and the bartender laughed at me. He then pointed me to the nearest Starbucks, a mere 20 minutes walk away. \n\nThe shower and toilet in my minuscule accommodation consist of two cubicles with sliding doors. The shower works well although it\u2019s only an overhead unit, but the challenge comes when leaving the shower. There\u2019s nowhere to hang your towel in the shower itself so you have to leave the cubicle and step back into the lobby come bathroom space. Compared to the shower, this is freezing, so not only is the Moxy a lousy hotel, it\u2019s likely to give you a bout of pneumonia as well. Once you\u2019ve finished drying off, guess what? Absolutely nowhere to now hang your wet towel.\n\nAnd so I go to bed. The Moxy features a number of entertainment spaces one of which is a nightclub. I\u2019m not sure where it is, but the bass from the music thumps through the building till 2am. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be right to review the hotel without mentioning the location. I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but my advice is to hide your wallet, walk as fast as you can and don\u2019t venture out after dark.\n\nAll in all the Moxy is lousy. If it was cheap, you could forgive some of this, but it\u2019s not it\u2019s top dollar in its category. My advice; unless you want to be bound up like a battery chicken in an egg farm, fancy a dose of pneumonia or enjoying playing \u2018name that tune\u2019 in the early hours of the morning; stay somewhere else.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

First impressions are this is a very nice, new trendy place to stay.  That being said it was also one of the more affordable places to stay in the lower east side. The customer service was fine and as a Bonvoy member we had a 30 dollar a day credit which we didn\u2019t use (more on that later). We saw a commercial on the flight to NYC for The Moxy that if you checked in at the bar you would get a complimentary drink. The Bartender nor the receptionist knew of this which I thought was strange being there were commercials on JetBlue showing young people checking in at the bar and getting a drink. \n\nThe elevators are a bit of a mess when it\u2019s busy. You have to swipe your card and it picks the elevator, cars 1, 2 and 3. If there\u2019s a line it can get frustrating. Otherwise it\u2019s fine. \n\nThe room itself was a partial city view at 210 sq Ft. We knew it was going to be small which was fine. Just beware theres not much room for luggage. The shower and the toilet were separate which was nice\u2026the sink was inside the room itself. No drawers so nothing is hidden. There\u2019s a funky metal contraption around the tv with hangers to hang your clothing. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were really soft which I would have preferred firmer. The room was quiet so I did get a good nights sleep so that was definitely a plus being they do have a club and rooftop bar. \n\nThe rooftop bar was nice and we went for happy hour. The space was airy and beautiful. We chose to sit inside being it was really windy on the terrace. I had two five dollar glasses of Rose and my husband had two beers. We ordered a mushroom truffle pizza which was to die for! We couldn\u2019t use our 30 dollar a day credit here which was a minus being that this is the only place we spent money at while in the hotel. \n\nOverall it was a good experience, I will stay again but only for short trips anything more than 3 nights we would need larger accommodations. We happened to be traveling with backpacks so it worked out just fine.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was a little worried when we checked in because our room was tiny (known before check-in) and right beside the elevator bank on our floor. I was convinced we'd be hearing noisy guests all night long. Spoiler alert -- this was one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in. We never heard noise above us and only once did we hear people in the hall. Also, we heard no street noise (likely because our room faced a courtyard). \n\nThe team was so attentive. Any requests, and we had quite a few, were quickly and graciously taken care of. \n\nI loved the vibe of the property. All four of us loved the bed linens (on our way home, we purchased a set for our home). Upon check-in, the room was uber clean. For 5 nights, I would've preferred getting our linens changed at least once. We didn't quite get the rhythm of housekeeping. They came in (didn't change the linens) and spruced up 2 or 3 times during our stay, but not daily. However, it's very important to note that they would bring additional towels and pull trash upon request without problem.\n\nNot a huge fan of the property's location, but that was my bad on not doing enough research. If you're visiting NYC to do all the touristy things, be prepared to spend more money on ride shares or the subway.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Great eye contact and lots of smiles. Secondly, \u2018Grand St\u2019 and \u2018Bowery\u2019 subways are both less than 2 minutes walk\u2026and from these, the 9\/11 Museum for example is circa 10 minutes, midtown Manhattan circa 15 minutes. And a critical tip for those new to NYC is doing proper research on how the subways work ! Over 5 days, the numbered routes relative to the colours and capital letters were anathema. Too often we took pot luck, despite asking supposed Locals in the know ! But back to the hotel\u2026 First impressions and \u2018quirky\u2019 is an adjective that comes to mind ( with not necessarily totally positive connotations  !? ). The Lobby is dark and the feel is ( perhaps ?! ) a blend of bohemian, art deco, minimalist\u2026 There\u2019s nothing Corporate about the place but outside of work, that\u2019s necessarily a good thing. I laughed when I read the word \u2018creepy\u2019 being used by a earlier Reviewer to describe the \u2018feel\u2019. That\u2019s not something we felt, albeit the lifts were unnecessarily dark & dingy. The rooms are what Marketeers might call \u2018bijoux\u2019. I\u2019d suggest \u2018small, tight, purposeful and comfortable\u2019. Everything within them fits together like a jigsaw. Whilst a cat can be swung, don\u2019t expect to increase your daily steps doing laps around the perimeter. But the beds are super comfortable, everything is spotlessly clean, the shower\u2019s great and the request for an in-room kettle was willingly accommodated and definitely handy ! In summary, this is a confident recommendation.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Well, the Moxy LES was just like that, except for the ever-changing scenery or being transported to a destination. In short, it had all the cons and none of the pros.\n\nThis hotel was clearly designed by someone whose towering artistic genius would not be constrained by such mundane things as customer comfort or convenience. The elevator area is cramped. The corridors are narrow, as well as dark and creepy---reminded me of the cheap old NYC hotels I stayed in in my misspent youth. The undersized rooms contain oversized beds, leaving little space for such plebian things as hanging up your clothing or being able to access your luggage without kneeling. The sink is about four inches deep, so water bounces out of it. The lobby area has mismatched and uncomfortable furniture, adding to the flophouse vibe.\n\nTheir web page says the hotel is \"a stylish play on the absurd\". Well, it's no Pirandello stage set; but many of the design choices are clearly absurd. All of this would be fine if the small room sizes came with correspondingly small prices. However, even allowing for the NYC location, this hotel is not cheap. We foolishly paid extra for a corner room with view. Indeed we got exactly that, but we thought a corner room would have views in two directions. We were wrong...one side just looks at other rooms of this hotel. They kept their curtains drawn, and so did we. \n\nThe $30 resort fee is another stylish play on the absurd. It had to be used for overpriced coffee and croissants each morning when we could have had much nicer breakfasts a couple of blocks in any direction. They don't give you receipts, so even though we spent less than $30 each morning, a charge for more than $30 appeared on our bill. It was only a few dollars more so we didn't fight it, and we had no proof anyway. We just resolved not to stay here again.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The view was breathtaking and just what we had hoped for and the location of the hotel could not be any better when looking forward to walk around in NYC\n\nI know Moxy is not 5 star but unfortunately the room lacked many (completely) basic things that it started to annoy us after just 24 hours.\n\nThere is no place in the room for your clothes, so we had 6 days with open suitcases on the floor. No closets. No drawers. And just two hangers (for two people staying 6 nights). I have never experienced this before no matter where in the world I have traveled including 3 other trips to NYC.\n\nThere is no fridge\/mini bar in the room, so you can not keep anything refrigerated (???). So we had no cold drinks in our room. This I have also never experienced before. We asked for a fridge in the recepetion and they delivered an old fridge to our room the next day.\n\nThere is only an overhead shower so no hand shower. Why not both?\n\nThere is no place to hang the towels near the sink, so when you need a towel you have to walk around with wet hands. This might sound like a tiny issue but after a couple of days this is just plain stupid.\n\nThere is only one bin in the room placed by the toilet. Maybe it would be nice with a bin in the room also?\n\nIt would also be really nice to be able to dim the light. All the lamps and lights in the room only have one setting. Moxy Lower East Side is a fairly new hotel so a dimmer would also be quite fair to hope for.\n\nI know some of these things might not seem important at all. Who really cares about a bin in the room? Or a place to hang the towels near the sink? Normally I wouldn't care. And if it was only one of these things that lacked then it would not be a problem, but accumulated these things just make no sense at all and unfortunately ads to a negative experience.\n\nI know Moxy is doing great work on their interior design (just like many other hotels), but fixing the above issues would not in any way interfere with the cool interior. I have seen it work perfectly in many other hotels around the world.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Looking for other options on the fly, near our restaurant reservation for a celebratory dinner, we called the Moxy in the Bowery on the lower east side, and we\u2019re very fortunate to have Demario, the hotel manager pick up our call. Demario listened to our plight and said to come on over and that he would hook us up. Demario greeted us at the hotel and was welcoming and gracious, and his staff were similarly helpful and attentive, the latter I\u2019m sure simply not our good fortune, but  reflective of a well-managed hotel staff singularly focused on the needs and comfort of its guests. Victor checked us in and he was lovely and efficient, and did a great job of informing us of all the amenities the Moxy had to offer. Our rooms had great views of the city,  and we quickly made our way to the very attractive hotel bar and settled into what turned out to be a great night in the Bowery filled with excellent food and drink. Thank you Demario and Victor, and the rest of the Moxy staff, for making the end of a trying day so relaxing, comfortable and enjoyable. ","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Moxy staff couldn't have been friendlier, greeting and welcoming me as soon as I walked in. Check in was easy and efficient. Like other Moxy locations in NYC, the elevators are secure and require key card access - a feature I love since I regularly travel solo. I was in a King City View room and IT. WAS. STUNNING! Not only was the room spotless, spacious, well-appointed and thoughtfully laid out, it had a spectacular view of the city. Watching the sunset from my room each night was a dream and I even got lucky enough to see it snow one evening which I enjoyed from the comfort and coziness of my room. Super plush and comfortable bed and linens. Fantastic water pressure in the shower. Very hip and fun neighborhood to explore if you're looking for that.

Friendly service at check in. Great service at the bar. The place had a hip feel and lots of conversation in the common areas and bar. Solid internet connection.  My room was clean, decorated in a modern hip way, and serviceable. I\u2019d give the place 5 stars but it is definitely for some types of trips vs. others which is why I gave a 4. There were some misses. The restaurant was not open. Found out it was closed on Monday (night I stayed). Getting to the hotel at 9p after travel was too late to walk around the Chinatown area in search of food. The front desk said there was no room service but the restaurant was open (no). Was given a menu at the bar but told when trying to order food the kitchen was closed on Mondays. You could see the staff trying to avoid the issue of no food - they knew it was an issue. Used Uber Eats. I was not the only one. The bar options are basic even as it was a hopping place. It would benefit from more interesting drink options and wider selection of spirits and wines to further draw people in. The room is small, which is okay and typical for NYC. But there is no closet (fixed hangers hang on a bar under the TV), no mini fridge, and no coffee maker. Water bottles are $5 in the room. If here on business, the desk is the size of a small side table. If I used the open up luggage stand I couldn\u2019t navigate around the bed.

Even the elevator system was so fast and helpful! I loved the amenities being listed with the hours they were open it was super helpful.\n\nI spent a good amount of time in the lobby lounge, the coffee was always out on time, the pastries were delicious, and it was amazing to have access to both the front room where it was quieter and the main area where I could interact with other hotel guests.\n\nI made 2 friends in the lobby due to the setup and we are still in touch!\n\nHousekeeping was super nice and every time I walked by the front desk I was greeted with a smile walking in or out of the hotel. I ordered door dash a few times and they would hold it there for me.\n\nI was truly treated like a part of a family, not just a guest, they catered to me and I felt really special there.\n\nThank you so much  Leidy for making me feel so at home while being far from my home,  I am excited to book again so when I come back this year, there is no other hotel I would choose!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

First off, we arrived pretty early on our check in day around 11 am which we prepared to not be allowed in early since check in time was 4pm. They were going to call us as soon as the rooms were ready, and as we waited in the lobby\/cafe area, Nelly came back and told us the rooms were ready for us at 11:30!!!! This has literally never happened to me, usually if we arrive to early we have to wait til it\u2019s closer to check in or we may have to pay a fee. Next, I can\u2019t even begin to explain how beautiful this hotel is! It\u2019s so aesthetically pleasing and modern, definitely a more luxury experience but for half the price! They give you a little token for a free glass of Prosecco at their bar. We booked the Executive King Room with a City view, and I HIGHLY recommend this room. The view is literally incredible, with floor to ceiling windows and amazing views of New York City. Our friends got the King Bed with a city view which was still a nice view but the room as quite a bit smaller then ours. We ran into Nelly again in the elevator and asked if an upgrade was possible but she said unfortunately our style room was booked. They ended up receiving a $30 credit at the cafe and we thought that was to make up for it so that was great! All in all I would, 10\/10 recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NY. Service and stay was EXCEPTIONAL!! Thank you Moxy Lower East Side!!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I was last on the Bowery in 1982 and I am blown away by the extent of the changes sine that time.  Such a dynamic, edgy, and fascinating community has evolved and blossomed.  Don\u2019t miss the nearby Essex Market. This neighborhood adjoins Little Italy, Soho, Chinatown and the East Village. An abundance of richness when it comes to cultures, cuisines, and sights! (and to be completely honest and transparent, on our last day we encountered human waste on the sidewalk across from the hotel, which unfortunately is a reality of the homeless situation that exists in the city and likely is more of a challenge on the Lower East Side.) But that said, the Moxy Lower East Side offers a very comfortable and secure way to access this dynamic neighborhood, now one of my favorite places to be in Manhattan. Service was attentive and quick\/responsive. The rooms are on the small side (not unusual for NYC), but the design is very efficient and they offer fabulous floor to ceiling views of the Manhattan skyline.  The room was super clean, nice bedding and linens, and I really liked the separate walk-in shower with rain-type shower head.  We reserved the executive king room and I felt it provided the minimum amount of space that made us comfortable. The combination of location, modern amenities and design, and price is unbeatable.

Where to start. I was very excited to stay at this hotel as I used to live across the street and love the area. I was extremely underwhelmed and disappointed. The facilities are nice enough upon first glance, but in my room the outlet cover randomly fell off, and the shower ran out of hot water after about 3 minutes. But, the title of my review is the main issue. Does this place know it\u2019s a hotel? Sure, hospitality is a valuable part of a hotel, but I think most would agree that they goto hotels for a place to rest and stay. The Moxy LES advertises their multiple hospitality venues, but they aren\u2019t accessible to guests. The first night I was there the rooftop bar was closed. The third night too. The second night, the main entrance to the hotel was closed for a private event, and hotel guests were directed to a small side door and through another bar. It was truly bizarre. Not only do you not get to use the advertised spaces, but you\u2019re made to feel like an inconvenience for simply trying to return to your room. Also, funny enough, the social team posted about the \u201ccatwalk entrance\u201d of the hotel at the exact time the entrance was closed to guests. Also, the elevator system is complicated as the elevator names and signage don\u2019t match up with what the screen says. And one elevator is through a service door and very unclear it\u2019s available for use. That is if it is. I scanned my card and was directed to that elevator, only to be told by a worker that hotel is only for the rooftop bar after 5pm. Not sure what to tell you, dude, that\u2019s where the system told me to go. Very disappointing service and priorities. I hope they get it together. ","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

The Fix (lobby, bar, all day cafe).  Silver Lining, a piano bar.  Sake No Hana, Japanese dishes.  The Highlight Room, their indoor\/outdoor rooftop bar.  And Loosie\u2019s, a subterranean dance floor decorated with disco balls.\n\nWhen you check in, you get a free drink token for The Fix!\n\nThe lobby is sparkling and gorgeous.  The checkin staff is awesome.\n\nI stayed in the executive city view suite, which is a corner suite with views of the Empire State Building, Chinatown, Little Italy, and other parts of Manhattan.  There are less expensive rooms with less impressive views or no views at all.\n\nRooms are well laid out.  Separate toilet and nice shower.  And you\u2019ll see some people complaining about room size, but honestly, most of the rooms on the Lower East Side are small, efficiently laid out spaces.  One or two people would be perfectly comfortable.\n\nFun touches like an erotic vending machine and a candy stand.  They have complimentary bikes, a fitness center, a co-working\/business space.  TVs have streaming.  Comfy, soft, fresh and crisp beds.\n\nAgain, on the LES, close to SoHo, close to street art and murals.  Lots of restaurants.  Little Italy.  Chinatown.  Very walkable.

I'm not too big of a fan of Marriott properties, but I am an absolute fan of Moxy LES - but it's really especially down to the Moxy\/Marriott team, both the overnights and day times. Apart from the growing pains since the opening (dust, ongoing construction, weird power outages here and there) and the rooms being slightly tight for 2 people, I honestly enjoy myself.\nI think the main selling point for me is always coming back to the Moxy front desk team themselves. \nI'm talking Victor, to Marilyn, to Deshawn, to Jess, to nearly everyone I've come across with and chatted with - they've always made sure my issues were met, and I felt like a priority (even when it's busy or TAO personnel tries to throw their weight around). I met each one of them and they're all amazing, but I only had the card for 4 of them - but it doesn't mean that the love and appreciation isn't there for the people I haven't named. Seeing them and having them remember me makes it feel like a real family thing - which is what any customer wants to feel when they're away from home for work or anything.\n\nYou can't teach humility and human connectivity with strangers. The team itself is probably what will make this Moxy a damn jewel in the city. Listen, any team that makes me feel happy that I'm sending them cheesecakes or pies or food so they can feel a little comfortable and happy working, is a team I look forward to.\n\nI'm going back literally in 24 hours and I already know, that they know, that we're going to have a solid weekend during the holidays.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I have a mixed overall review and would not stay here again.  \n\nPros:\nCool vibe-sushi bar in the lobby, great decor.  \n\nReally nice front desk people\n\nLocation-couple of blocks walking to Soho and close enough to different subway lines.  Three blocks from Little Italy and Broome St right nearby have what seem like great restaurants.\n\nCons:\nI wouldn't consider this a family friendly hotel.  Probably my fault for not looking it up as I booked last minute.  There were a group of 20 something girls partying and screaming in their rooms\/hallway while my kids were trying to sleep.  My guess is they were going to the nightclub downstairs.\n\nThe rooms are really small.  But most are in NY.   Think of it as the size of a really small bedroom.  But they are interesting, have nice bathrooms (also tiny) and high ceilings.\n\nLocation-the neighborhoods directly west and north are great.  Not so much east and south.  \n\nIf traveling without kids, I'd give it a slightly higher ranking.

I explored the city, but then I just wanted to come back and unwind in the hotel.\n\nThe rooms are exceptional, fresh and clean. It reminded of Japanese cleanliness and efficiency. You have separate large walk in shower with ornate glass, the red industrial sink just pops. My queen bed was extremely comfortable and the room is well lit. There a small desk that folds onto the wall to create extra space - so very thoughtful. My queen room had plenty of storage for two people. \n\nThe team that works at the Moxy is amazing. As I walked in, I was showered with \"welcome, welcome!!\" and smiles everywhere. It truly made my feel special. \n\nFinally, the drinks and food was amazing. It's all done in  collaboration with TAO group - which I learned operates some of the best restaurants in USA. \n\nFor the price per night, you get much more than you pay for! A top quality experience. You will not regret. The pictures don't lie :)))","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Moxy exceeded my expectations! I was impressed with the beautiful details of the hotel. The layout was perfect for two people without being too crammed. The shower and bathroom were in separate rooms,  which were both very clean. The front desk and downstairs staff were all very helpful and welcoming. I highly recommend the breakfast- there were croissants, scones, yogurt, and hot food (eggs, potatoes, bacon). The croissants weren\u2019t your sad typical hotel croissants, but it was something I would have purchased at a local coffee shop. We look forward to staying at Moxy Lower East Side again in the future! ","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

You could truly not leave the hotel all day and have plenty to do. Coffee in the cafe, the highlight room, sake bar, and you can\u2019t forget Loosies in the basement which is a fun disco club (we ended our evenings dancing here every night) my absolute favorite part of the hotel was the way the people who worked here made me feel\u2026 from the start, they were SO happy, positive, and kind. Jess and Yasira made me and my friends feel welcomed from the start and went above and beyond throughout our entire stay. They even surprised by decorating our room with balloons, banners, wrote a fun birthday note on the mirror\u2026 I was SO surprised. Their good energy is infectious and I can\u2019t thank the moxy team enough for such a lovely stay!!! Will definitely be coming back in the future","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

There's a bounty of killer restaurants and I seem to scavenge out a great new bar each time I'm here. What I've most wanted in this area though (short of a resort) is a solid hotel where I'd also be excited to invite some of my local friends to party. I don't mean to knock the independents in the area, but really I think I've given each of them at least one shot, and I don't feel compelled to go back now that I've got this place on my radar. I should mention that this isn't just a new hotel, this is a new BUILDING... as clean and can be with all the modern perks. To be honest, the breakfast here alone would have sold me with the arsenal of fresh pastries at the bar. The room was way nicer than what I expected for the money, and had insane views looking north where I could see the peaks of the city's skyscrapers. I know Moxy's reputation speaks for itself, but just want to ping this one as it's new and should definitely be marked for anyone wanting to stay near soho\/LES.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}
