The hotel has a restaurant but food options were limited , entrees aren\u2019t served with sides and the food items are a bit pricey with lack of side options to be added.

Also if you like whizzy hi-tech: the elevator system is impressive, and you get effective aircon, a Nespresso machine, and an oversized TV. But if you want normal hotel facilities, avoid. At check-in, the small reception area was chaotic, and a request for rooms near each other - made 3 months earlier and acknowledged - was not met. My room had no drawers or cupboards,  so apparently they expect guests to live out of a suitcase.  We walked out of the breakfast room as the breakfast offering was one of the worst I've ever come across. There's nothing in the bathroom except soap squeeze bottles - not even a paper cup. Everything is run by electronics, so don't bother looking for light switches.  You get the feeling you're in the hotel equivalent of an automated airport check-in with about as much character. Actually, the lobby differs from an airport in one respect: airports provide seating, but this hotel has virtually none. I've stayed in a 4-star Hilton near Times Square in the past, but the only 4-star aspect of this new Hilton is the price.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Buckle up because this place is freaking fantastic. It's exactly what you need for a business or family trip in the heart of the city.  For me it was a combined trip and we left quite happy.  I had read reviews about the staff going above and beyond.  It's smart. Set's the hotel apart.  Right away I experienced it on arrival. Everyone gives a #### about you.  Even the team at the door is welcoming and super helpful.  You ride the initial elevator up to the 11th floor and you'll be greeted by a great team.  Shoutout to Yassin.  I had read reviews about him being awesome- guess what? He is! I feel like I met a TripAdvisor super hero from all the positive reviews.  They are not lying, the guy is freaking awesome. Have an obscure question? (Like where to buy water bottles- you should get one, $10, it builds a well and there are fill-ups everywhere.) Yassin figured out who would know and have the bottles and made it happen.  Super positive energy. Really makes the place shine.  The rooms were great. Incredible showers.  Clean rooms.  It is expensive but worth the Hilton Points or dollars (or both!).  The restaurant\/lounge is *stupid* expensive.  $19 avocado toast? hahahahahaha.  $40 for a cocktail and a soda? Yup. Welcome to the big time at the big city.  It also closes pretty early at night. So the restaurant isn't the place for all your eats but the location is absolutely the best spot in town.  This has become our new go-to for city trips, personal or business. Looking forward to my next trip just so I can stay here again.  My last impression? Damn these guys are good.  Shoutout to Dino out front.  When he heard we had an uber incoming on our departure- he went a several hundred yards down the street to let our uber know he could pull into the valet \/ hotel parking zone to pick us up.  This done in the pouring rain.  He certainly didn't need to do that.  But he did and loaded up our luggage.  What a cool guy!  Thank you Tempo!

I managed to get hold of receptionist after 1 hour\ud83d\ude21 and eventually someone was sent to fix the curtain\u2026\nTwo half sparkling bottles of waters 21 dollars \u2026 mist have been mixed with gold\nThe mattress was sinking and we couldn\u2019t sleep well\nFirst night a disaster\ud83d\ude21\nThe light breakfast is not at all included and infact it is rather shameful\u2026 the person at the till will show you food premade and ask you in s very intimidating  way to give a tip which 15% he told us be very poor\u2026 fir what really for bringing the food from the fridge to the counter 1 mt circa away. I did explain that in Europe we give tips if we feel that a good service has been delivered\u2026. But he pushed us so badly and felt like if we where obliged to do it\u2026.

This was generally  speaking the way we were addressed by the staff , behind unacceptable  for a 4 star hotel. On our check out I was asked how was our stay and I  genuinely  told terrible and requested to talk with a manager. I did explain how unsatisfied we were and that I wanted a full refund\u2026 he  as well started addressing me as you guys. I sdo told him that I wasn\u2019t his friend and that it was not professional or  acceptable way to address customers older than him and mostly customer. I explained everything as stated above and he offered me a discount of 130 dollars circa and then instructed the  receptionist to take carr off the bill, she start addressing me as Anna and I did explain that I wasn\u2019t her friend to address me otherwise and she told me that they have   been instructed ti address the customer  that way\u2026    really since when??

There were multiple issues with the room and the service, and I ultimately was not provided with all the amenities I paid for. There were also underhanded sales tactics at the hotel restaurant\/bar and issues picking up a package.\n\nInitially, I checked in via the app. I had to try a few times to unlock the door. The room itsef had no issues, but the difficulty with opening the door persisted. We had to wait in line at the front desk the next day to to get physical cards, which then failed to open the door. I was told they would resolve this issue while I was out, but no action was taken. I inquired again upon returning to the hotel that day, after having to wait in line for almost 30 minutes, and the front desk staff ultimately had to give us a new room. I asked if this room would have the same amenities and was told yes.\n\nThe second room had no issues with the door, but several new issues. There was an unpleasant smell, which is likely why I found the window open upon arriving. The sink in the bathroom was backed up, and the toilet paper holder was hanging at an angle so that the roll kept falling off. I paid for a room with a Peloton, which the new room had, but someone had swapped the normal pedals out (which can be used with normal shoes), for pedals that required delta cleets. I went to front desk again, and waited again, asking for them to swap out the pedals and fix the other issues. Again, I was told they would fix it. When I returned, it seemed like the pedals had been swapped out, but the bathroom issues were not addressed. When I went to use the Peloton in the morning, though, I realized the pedal had been installed incorrectly, with the pedal and screw sticking out at angle and obvious metal shavings on the floor where the screw had been stripped by whoever installedd it.\n\nI also sent a small package to the hotel for the day I checked in, and asked the front desk three times during these interactions before they were able to provide me with it on the third day (but the tracking information and the hotel staff confirmed it was delivered on the first day).\n\nWorse, during the first interaction, the front desk staff convinced me that I had a $45\/day credit for hotel bar and restaurant. They neglected to mention there was also a $35 resort fee, so that i was only getting a $10 credit. The underhanded sales tactics continued at the restaurant, where we requested tap water and were given a $12 bottle of still water by the server. We were also charged $33 for an appetizer, despite it being listed for $19, and had to request an itemized receipt and correction. They server also failed to tell us that there is auto-gratuity of 22% both when seating us or when we paid. We were only provided with the itemized receipt upon request, where we discovered that. The quality of the cocktails and food was also poor, although at least that's subjective.\n\nSuffice it to say, I will not be staying at this hotel again. The concept seemed great, but the execution was terrible.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel was very quiet for being in Times Square and compared to other hotels I have stayed in around the area previously. A majority of the staff were very friendly and helpful especially in particular one of the female receptionists but unfortunately I didn't catch her name. It is easy to access parts of the city from the hotel with a subway station very nearby as well as being walking distance from many attractions. One bit of feedback I would provide is that the automatic blinds in the room wouldn't shut properly unless you pulled them at the same time. BEWARE - once we had checked out the bellman arranged a yellow taxi for us which seemed a bit suspicious. Once we got into the taxi and out of the city the driver started driving at least 100mph in and out of lanes and swerving around cars, it felt very unsafe, scary and as if we won't even make it to the airport. We asked him to slow down, however he then started driving down bus lanes and the hard shoulder when we were stuck in traffic, again at a very fast speed and was clearly illegal and unsafe, however this is not the hotels fault but DO NOT accept the offer from the bellman to arrange you a taxi!","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Do not attempt to check in early Do not.  The A.M. front desk folks hate their jobs and anyone who attempts to check in. Wait until after 4 pm. Do yourself a favor. I'm in my 9.5 year as a Hilton Diamond member. I have been loyal to Hilton as I travel three weeks a month for work (and even own a timeshare in mid-town Manhattan) and yet to check in early at noon instead of 3 pm was a $150 dollar upcharge for guests or $75 for Diamond members. I said no. Normally, a hotel will welcome guests in if there's a room available - it's called hospitality and reduces the number of check-ins later. The morning front desk needs to learn this. It literally costs nothing to check someone in early yet garners good will. If there are no rooms available because they're still being cleaned cool. That was not the case here. So...don't do it. The afternoon desk agents could not have been nicer. They get what hospitality is about. They were kind, considerate, welcoming. \n\nThis is a rebuild of the old doubletree that sat at this spot for years. This a a beautiful redo. Rooms are on the small side, but not as small as the Motto brand which are half this size. Great amenities, comfortable beds. The bar was lovely and bartenders great. The bell staff at the front door were so nice. \n\nThe rooms are wonderful, but you get what you reserve, so choose wisely. Rain shower, a bluetooth speaker in the mirror in the bathroom with clock and nightlight sensor were my highlights. But, it's in Times Square so bright day and night. There are black out curtains on the main switch at the front door of your room which can also control all the lights. \n\nWill stay again.

This hotel is located in the middle of Times Square and in easy reach of many subway stations.  On arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade at 40 USD per night as we had booked a room that was on a lower level and maybe noise.  I took the opinion to upgrade and was given a room on the 44th floor.  The rooms are decorated to a good standard and modern in design.  The view was excellent although this was night time.  Curtains and lighting are controlled by switches on either side of the bed sadly the controls on one side were not working at all, reported to reception who invited us to move rooms as we had yet to unpack it wasn\u2019t much of an ordeal but did delay us from going out to dinner by an hour.  Our second room was 3902 located on the 39th floor, I was told this was a double upgrade but no further charge would be made ( this room would apparently cost 90 USD per day to upgrade) \nThis had a double aspect view looking downtown, you could still hear street noise which was constant.  On the second evening i could dripping water behind one of the curtains, water was dripping down from what appeared to be a structural crack in the window frame, it had not been raining during out time in NY.  I reported this to the male receptionist who seemed uninterested and said we couple move again, we were about to leave for our broadway show and asked for the water to be clean up and investigated.  I also pointed out that this was not a new problem as when i was looking for the source of the water i noted several water stains on the fabric of the curtainn and valance.  When i remarked on this to the receptionist he said we are a new hotel and have teething problems, I reply its a bit crap as this was our second room and the problems would be obvious to house keeping staff, the receptionist asked me to stop using the profound language (Crap) I think some conflict resolution training is needed.\nWe came vback and the water had been mopped but nothing else.  During the early hours of the next morning I was woken by dripping water again!!  At this point I gave up and concentrated on my vacation as it was obvious the staff at this hotel lacked customer satisfaction.\nThat said the hotel did have its good points the bed was comfortable and the towels and linens are good quality.  The coffee machine is a waste of time it\u2019s a small espresso type with tiny paper cups provided.  We used the bar once which was ok but again I think the staff could be more attentive \nThe guy looking after the luggage was really friendly and polite\nWould I recommend this place then sadly NO, it does has a lot going for it but too many negatives for me.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There, I encountered the rudest receptionist I\u2019ve ever met. He said that security had to go up with me to check my ID, even though my digital key and ID were not accepted as proof.\n\nWhile I understand and appreciate good safety measures, I complained about the digital key not working and the inconvenience caused. Instead of acknowledging my frustration, the receptionist told me not to raise my voice and accused me of being disrespectful. He claimed that I had been discussing for 10 minutes, which was not the case; I was not even at the reception for 10 minutes.\n\nThe receptionist then called his manager. The manager was very nice, wanting to understand the situation. However, the receptionist interrupted me while I was explaining to the manager. I had to remind him that he called his manager because he did not want to speak to me, and the discussion was now between me and the manager, not between me and him.\n\nThe manager acknowledged the issue and apologized, assuring me they would work on it, something the receptionist failed to do. Throughout, the receptionist kept insisting he was right, blaming me for the errors. He desperately needs basic communication training or perhaps a different role not in customer service of a $200-plus per night hotel.\n\nHis attitude has unfortunately cast a shadow over my entire stay at the hotel. I will choose a different hotel next time, as New York has plenty of options. I no longer feel comfortable at this hotel.\n\nIf you want good service, I would recommend different options, not this hotel.\n\nI suggest the manager review the CCTV, as I never raised my voice, discussed for 10 minutes, or did any of the other unfriendly things he accused me of.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

The staff and both managers are unprofessional. They know nothing about problem solving and should be trained or fired out. i.e. They agreed the decrease the price for 1 night to the normal level (the Ball view is 3-4 ties more expensive) after FOUR hours of negotiations. Their behavior was as of carpet dealers on the Eastern market... Spanish shame. As result: 1) Mariott completely spoiled our New year celebration. we had been the loyal customers. 2) we wasted 4.5 hours of our life during the New year celebration in discussions with the staff. 3) My family made a decision to leave the hotel on 1st January due the staff behavior. 4) on 1st January I missed the excursion and lost 60 USD as I was in discussions with the manager about the decreasing of prices for rooms.

I was glad that I could leave my bags in my room and start my New York adventure.\n\nThe room is a little compact but it was fine because it was just me in the room. There is no closet, but rather a rack with hangers where you can hang stuff up, above where you can set your luggage on a ledge.\n\nI loved the Bluetooth mirror in the bathroom, which was easy to pair with my phone. I also love Apotheke products, which was the brand of the bathroom soaps and shampoos.\n\nWhen you enter the hotel from the street, you take an elevator up to the lobby. To get to your room, you transfer to another set of elevators. The elevator system is very efficient because it's the type where you enter the floor you need and it tells you which elevator to get into and it goes directly to that floor (and any other floors of the people who are in the elevator with you). The lobby could be a bit more organized, though. I didn't like how when I was waiting to speak to someone at one of the desk pods, people would cut in front of me. It happened more than once.\n\nThe restaurant in the lobby was convenient to pick up morning coffee and pastries. My friends and I brought pizza back one evening and they wouldn't let us sit in the cafe area. We made it clear that we wanted to order drinks but they wouldn't let us in, so we sat in the lobby instead, taking up what little seating there is in the lobby. The cafe closed shortly after we sat down so we felt it was silly that we couldn't sit there and also order drinks.\n\nOn Saturday night we wanted to get drinks at the bar but they wouldn't let us in because they were closing for construction. It was 10pm. This feels like a missed opportunity because 10pm on Saturday night is prime drinking time and they were closing for the night. Hopefully they finished all of the construction in time for opening.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Location is perfect, close to major attractions that are all within walking distance.  Our room was on the 36th floor and the elevators are really fast. We never had to wait for one. Our room was small but modern and was cleaned well daily. The bathroom amenities like the LED mirror with bluetooth and the rain shower fixture are superb. For the price we paid to stay at this hotel, it would have been nice to have at least some water bottles available in the room.  The hallways always smelled so nice and the hotel in general is kept very clean. Although this hotel was really good, we cannot give it five stars because of the following reasons:  1) The wifi is not premium high speed at all, so if you are staying at this hotel on business, you won't get anything done! 2) The restaurant in the hotel is expensive and has very limited options 3) The Urban Destination Charge that the hotel charges is ridiculous. It's already costly to stay at this hotel and this extra charge is just a cash grab, especially when the charge includes premium high speed wifi which is not premium at all!  All in all this is a very nice, clean hotel, but if we ever go back to NYC, we will more than likely try a different hotel. ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-12-19","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I am currently at this hotel and while it's rare for me to do review before leaving the location,  I think it's only fair to warn off as many people as possible from making the same mistakes as I have. \n\nWe arrived to Tempo on Saturday 16th December around 3:30pm.  We were told our rooms are not ready yet and to take a seat in the restaurant.  We waited around 45 minutes whilst the rooms were cleaned,  checked and made available..... which is not the end of the world.  But after travelling all the way from London we were ready for a rest. \n\nAnd this is where the problems began.  The hotel WiFi was not working (and still not when I write this)  The hotel staff didn't seem bothered by this and couldn't understand why I was making a fuss or refusing to pay for the internet charge.  Considering it's a city centre hotel WiFi is important to business customers and families alike,  but no one cared.  Then theres the rooms itself.  Ignoring the fact that I'm paying almost $18,000  for our stay,  there's no water in the rooms,  no facility to make tea and only paper cups.  Our room was not cleaned for 3 days,  until my wife called reception to ask why, and they struggle to answer the phone at reception at the best of times. The rooms are compact,  theres almost no. storage space other than a clothes rail and coat hooks on the wall. It's not ideal when you're staying for 12 days with 5 or 6 cases in an expensive but small room. I get they are trying to be \"eco friendly\" and reduce plastic waste,  but there's no reason why water cannot be provided in recycled plastic or even glass bottles. \n\nAnd then there's the restaurant!!  It would be an insult the give this any sort of star rating.  The food is expensive,  the choices are very limited and having to eat breakfast out of a cardboard box with a plastic fork is not an experience I enjoy or recommend.  The one saving grace is Chef Kitt who has gone out of his way to help us with my sons food as he has some severe allergies.  Other than that,  I recommend you go out somewhere else for all meals. \n\nOh... band don't get me started on the in hotel shop.  Once you see that  1ltr bottle of water costs $12 you won't be going back there for anything else. \n\nSo I advice you look for somewhere better and cheaper to stay. If I could afford to move to another hotel at this late stage I would have gone already. ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We quickly realized that this very thin wall had to be the other side of the next door room\u2019s bathroom wall. With zero soundproofing. Actually, worse than zero soundproofing, the (lack of) construction AMPLIFIED every. single. noise. the neighbors made in the bathroom. Loudly. \n\nConversations, going to the bathroom, and\u2026 shower sex sessions that was like graphic porn was being directly amplified into our hotel room. Good for them, get that fun hotel sex. However, when you can hear every graphic, fluid detail (I am not talking about muffled moans, I am saying I unwillingly knew exactly what was happening every moment of their session) of strangers next door having sex basically like it was done in front of a megaphone directly into our room, it took away from feeling like we had our own private space to relax after our city exploring. And, on the flip side, we didn\u2019t want to disturb them as well, so we were making sure we were speaking softly & being more quiet than natural. Yes, we turned up the tv and tried to tune out the noise, but the way that space between rooms was designed, it was echoing and bouncing off the walls like freaking surround sound.\n\nYes, the location is great, the room itself was well designed for our needs, loved the bathroom & bed, the staff was kind and efficient. But the soundproofing design flaw really took away our ability to feel like we could decompress and relax in our own private space.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It turns out the reviews were wrong: They UNDERstated how phenomenal the service is. Throughout our stay EVERYONE was very upbeat and went out of their way to be helpful. But all of that pales to what happened after we checked out. We had just called an Uber when my wife got suddenly and violently ill with what turned out to the the flu. Without getting too graphic, she started vomiting and then passed out. The staff came running out to help, bringing a wheelchair, towels to clear her up, calling the hotel doctor, and taking her back into the hotel. They put us back in the room we'd  been staying, told us they'd charge us less than half their lowest rate. From then until we left, every time I went to the lobby the staff asked me how she was doing,. The manager called our room to check on her. When I went to the hotel restaurant to see if they had any watermelon - the only thing that sounded good to her - the chef personally made a beautiful, huge platter of watermelon and refused to let me pay for it. In short, I've never seen a hotel go above and beyond the call like at. (Oh, BTW, the hotel is very stylish yet comfortable, and shockingly quiet given its Times Square location.) In short, I can't recommend the Tempo by Hilton New York Times Square more highly.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

He should be recognized as one of your most valuable assets.\u00a0\nI chose to stay at this new hotel because this is where my wife and I had stayed there when it was a doubletree several years ago. After the doubletree closed we chose to stay at the Hilton on the Avenue of the Americas. Mistake number one on this trip was not going back to the Hilton.\nWe arrived in the city around 10:30am on Tuesday November 7th. I went to the front desk to try and check in. Much to our surprise there was a room ready. An even bigger surprise\u00a0was when I was charged $150.00 to check in early. I guess I am wrong to assume that as a Diamond member who has spent over 100 nights in your hotels in 2023 that an early check in was a benefit\u00a0I had earned. After talking with the front office manager later that night she was able to remove this charge from the final bill.\nAfter spending the day walking around and enjoying New York City we stopped at the chick-fil-a to get my 7 year old son some chicken nuggets. My wife and I were going to use the close to $50.00 F&B credit in the hotel restaurant to have dinner. I was again surprised when the waitress came over and informed us that we could not have outside food in the restaurant\u00a0while the kitchen was open. I could understand this if the restaurant had a kids menu but it does not. So on day one I was unable to use my F&B credit.\nAfter walking back to chick-fil-a to get myself and my wife dinner to eat with our son I went back to the lobby to ask to speak to a manager. It was 5:30pm. Anyone that could actually do something had already left for the day. It is my understanding after speaking with Destiny who I believe was the front office manager\u00a0that Matt is the GM of this property. I asked her to have Matt call me. She assured me that everything we spoke about would be put in her report and Matt would give me a call. 3 days later and Matt still has not given me a call.\nThis hotel has a \"market\" area as well as a restaurant. The restaurant is open for breakfast for a few hours in the morning. Beside the counter they have a cooler where you can get drinks and snacks. If you get something from here you can use it as part of the F&B credit. However this cooler closes at 11am so when you come back in the afternoon and want a soft drink or a bottle of water you have to get it from the \"market\" area. The food and beverage you get from the \"market\" area is not allowed to be charged as F&B. Can someone please explain this one to me?\nThursday when it was time for us to leave we went back to the hotel to get our bags. We were going to use the restroom in the lobby area before we got in our uber to head to the airport. We were once again hit with a surprise. The not so wonderful restaurant where you can not get a decent meal and especially can not get anything for a kid to eat was closed for a private event. Guess where the restroom is. You got it. The closed restaurant. So I guess we will just hold it for the hour ride to LGA. Speaking of restaurants you should change the about us section of this hotel on their website and the app. You claim that the restaurant has iconic NYC views. It has a great view of a solid dark wall. Maybe it should read if you walk out of the restaurant and down the hall pass the check in counter then you can have an iconic view.\nJust an overall bad experience. I expected more from a brand new hotel in times square. I expected the same level of service and hospitality\u00a0that I receive at countless other hilton hotels around the country. Go back to being a doubletree. Or better yet in my case I will stay where I know the service and food is good. The hilton around the corner.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We have stayed in this hotel before it shut down when it was the Double Trees Suites and we've stayed there twice originally.  It is now Tempo Suites and it is amazing.  Still ironing out some issues looking at the reviews but our experience was overall great.  We are regular visitors to New York and we will stay again.  We had a little trouble checking with our room key with the key not working, (wrong room keyed in at front desk), given another room which was wrong again, got in this time to find a bouquet of flowers for someone else and then upgraded to a top floor with a ball drop view room (thank you very much!).  We didn't mind! The first room was great anyway but the second room was jaw dropping!  Ironically we had stayed in that style of room before and it was interested to see the differences with the refurb.  The room was perfectly thought out with shades which are electronic.  Coffee machine but only three pods so you have to fight if there are 2 of you but no problem you can buy a pack in the shop downstairs.  The beds are amazing!  As comfortable as the ones in the Bellagio in Las Vegas and no bed has EVER come close to that in my eyes over 10 years ago!  Like you are sleeping on a cloud if you can imagine that (if I can imagine that!).  Things to improve: 1) please serve tea to the Brits at the very least.  I was dying for a cup and they refused to serve me a cup \"oh no we don't serve that here\".  Really?!  What happened to the American dream of you can have anything you wan?!  Apart from a cup of tea?!  2)  Highball restaurant which by the way is going to have a fab outdoor dining terrace due to be complete by end of Nov is FREEZING!!!  Everyone sat in coats.  I asked why so cold the staff knew about this but appeared to not have any answers as to why so why Tempo is it sooooooo cold?  Made me very reluctant to want to be there but maybe that's why to discourage you to stay too long?  The food is amazing though but prepare to be very cold.

Unfortunately, our experience was marred by several significant issues that I feel compelled to bring to your attention.\n\nFirstly, upon our arrival, we encountered a security issue where we were robbed by a scamming cab driver who charged our credit card a staggering amount of 650 USD from JFK. Understandably, we immediately sought assistance from your security team to obtain video footage of the incident. However, despite our repeated requests, we were left waiting for an extended period of time without any response or assistance. It took us two days to finally meet with the head of security, which is simply unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, we were also disappointed with the housekeeping service. On the fourth day of our stay, our room was not serviced despite our request to the reception before leaving for dinner. Upon our return, we were dismayed to find that the room had not been attended to.\n\nAdditionally, during our entire stay, we found the overall level of service to be poor. The reception area was cramped with limited seating, making it difficult for guests to comfortably wait. Moreover, the lack of storage space in our room was inconvenient, especially during a six-day stay. The rooms were also noisy, further adding to our disappointment.\n\nTo make matters worse, when we checked out, we were informed that the system was down and we could not receive a receipt. This lack of organization and communication only added to our frustration.\n\nAs loyal of Hilton hotels, we had high expectations for our stay at your establishment. However, the service we received fell far short of these expectations. It is disheartening to compare our experience with the neighboring hotel, where the hospitality and security were significantly better.\n\nRegrettably, based on our experience, we have no intention of returning to your hotel in the future. We hope that you take our feedback seriously and make the necessary improvements to ensure a more satisfactory experience for your guests.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We ate breakfast, wandered around Rockefeller Plaza and never heard back. So we went back around 2:45 pm to a huge line. I tried to check in online at that point and was unable. So waited in the line only to be told our room was ready. While I understand this was unusual, I was disappointed that we were never contacted. The elevators are plentiful and fast, which was great. The room was tight for 4 with luggage, but doable. The blinds are electronic, but ours was already broken and on our last night we couldn't get the blinds down, only the shears so our room was quite bright. Definitely working out the kinks, but overall a great location and great hotel. I tried to call the hotel to provide feedback, but was told to post it here. I was hoping to get our rate adjusted at check in as I found a slightly cheaper rate, but with the enormous line I didn't both and then was unable to get it fixed during our stay. Also we did call down for pillows and extra towels and only after calling back were they delivered.

Finally find out the system is down. I understand its a new hotel but I didn't really get a great answer just come back at 4. Ok so where do I check my bags? \"over there\".  A not so pleasant gentlemen took my bags and we set out to explore until 4 :30 sh. Of course it poured while we were out, so when we returned soaking wet to the hotel after 4pm there was a line of people all the way back to the restaurant\/lounge. So I waited while my husband who had hurt his foot while we were out sat in the lounge area. When I finally got to the desk, I handed the gentleman my credit card and DL explained the room was in my husbands name but he was in the lounge and I had no signal and couldn't get on the wifi to reach him. I was given two keys for us, no other explanation about anything whatsoever, got my bags and we went to change into dry clothes. \n\nThe room was on a high floor, small and clean. Nice to have many plugs and a window to pop open. The bed and pillows were comfy, and the bath was nice but that is where it ends. There was not a full roll of toilet paper in the bathroom when we arrived and not a single extra roll in the room, seriously WTH.  The rubber fittings on the shower handle were already coming off, when we showered with the door closed, a large amount of water leaked onto the bathroom floor-so I had to mop that up before drying my hair UGH, and there was not hook or anywhere to hang the hand towel. I know it is a little thing to complain about but it isn't an expansive vanity, with two people sharing the tiny sink leaving the hand towel on the counter top is gross. \n\nFortunately we had carry on luggage but there is really nowhere to store luggage. I have been on cruise ships with better storage. There isn't a good spot to open your suitcase to remove clothes to hang up, I don't want to put my suitcase on the bed, and then there is no drawer space so you have to leave your carry-on with socks and what not on the case for the safe, It is fine not to have a closet but good grief, any decent wall organizer could handle some shelves or a drawer.\n\nIt was a lot of money to spend on a room that required so much extra effort to be comfortable. I am curious how well some of the fittings will hold up over time, some things seemed well thought out, others not so much. We didn't spend much time in the room, but I expected better. \n\nWe checked out early and a much more pleasant man took our bags and arranged a car for the airport so we could sight see until it was time to go. That was the level of service I expected for our entire stay but didn't receive.\n\nAnd after checkout-with no receipt I might add, I see the destination charge of $80 on my card for amenities I was never told about.  It is Hilton, they open up new hotels all the time, I get that technical issues occur, but better communication all around is desperately needed here so people don't feel cheated. So with feeling cheated, the glitchy system, and the other little things I don't think I would stay here again.  Another night here and I would probably have to go buy some toilet paper.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

No microwaves in the room.  Valet is a 3rd party don't use it if you have to because they can't bring your car back you will have to walk 6 blocks like we did to get our car with luggage.  It's not worth it!  They don't have a lot of food options in the hotel no hot breakfast.  But it's NY you can go outside the hotel to get food lots of great options.  Finally, they don't answer the front desk phone you have to go down there to speak with someone which was very frustrating; however, they seem extremely busy all the time at the front desk not sure why they don't answer though.

Great location off of broadway! However, I experienced unreasonable prices\/service , particularly breakfast and coffee in the lobby canteen. I was given 1 slice of avocado toast and coffee for over $20usd. Really bizarre, 1 slice of toast (why not 2?) ?This seems obviously egregious for the value.  However- I happen to incidentally mention this to an evening bartender, Alex . Much to my surprise, Alex expressed concerned as to my experience and offered to get a manager for me to provide feedback. Glori, the manager came over and  to my surprise actually wanted to hear more. When i shared my view, she and Alex were open and accepting of the feedback. They then offered me a glass of wine as a hospitality gesture of appreciation. These two are on their game!

Certainly did not expect to get a room since check-in is normally 4pm, and we wanted to walk to get lunch as well.\n\nBut we never ended up receiving a text at all. So didn't go back to the hotel until 3:30pm because of that. We had to have our toddler sleep in the stroller while we pushed him around in the crowd.\n\nThen, now when checking out, for the first time I hear they need an hour notice for valet car retrieval. Well nobody told me that when I arrived. So I'm sitting here waiting endlessly for my vehicle and have a long drive back to Canada and way behind schedule because of the lack of communication.\n\nWhy don't you even just put that on the valet ticket or something. So that it's in writing.\n\nWe were all packed before 9am, and walked over to grab a coffee at McDonald's before checking out and asking for the car. Had we known, we would have obviously asked for the vehicle earlier.\n\nWhat a complete waste of my time. There are so many positives to the hotel, but they didn't earn my time for that because I have to spend it on writing the above instead.\n\nRoom 2321 (Oct 8 to 9).","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everyone was friendly, helpful and welcoming from the Valet (wish I could remember his name, his daughter just graduated college in PA with a degree in architecture), bell staff (David and Jose), front desk  and the cafe staff(Henry and Chelsy). Please note that the entrance and where you will park for the valet is under construction, so there were only 2 spots right by the door, so be prepared for some NY style driving. This also causes for some back up with the bell staff, as it takes 1 hour notice for you to receive your car. \nI appreciated security at the entrance door and that the for the elevator to your rooms you enter your room number before entering, so not everyone else knows who is getting off at what floor. \nTha main lobby has amazing Times Square views, as do many of the bedrooms. Rooms are standard NYC size, but have everything you need to store your items, including a mini fridge, as well as black out shades, since the lights in Time Square makes it daylight 24\/7.  The bathroom was large with a mirror (and lighting around it that could be dimmed), a step in shower with a rainfall shower head, and bulk toiletry dispensers.\nCafe had a few grab and go items, but could use more variety.\nThe hotel itself is located near everything you could want from restaurants, the theatre district, souvenir and chocolate store shopping.

The hotel is very chic, and the rooms are excellent. I stayed in a king room. From the shower and bathroom to the bedding, flatscreen, automatic shades, this was by far one of the nicest rooms I\u2019ve stayed in for the money.\n\nThe only thing at this very time that I can say that could\u2019ve been better (unfortunately cannot be avoided because of construction) was the valet service. Now this is not a reflection on the staff of the valet, but just the overall availability of space to be able to pull your vehicle into valet in the first place, considering that , the front of the building off of 7th Ave is under complete construction. I had to circle around the building twice, which took me nearly 45 minutes until I was able to finally contact the hotel and have a valet attendant meet me out there. The service from them again was excellent, It was just the process that could\u2019ve been better, I would assume that it will be better once the construction is no longer there.  My advice in the meantime is to make sure that you pull up to the hotel traveling eastbound on 47th St. this is where you will find the entrance to the hotel currently as well as the valet service.\n\nIf you choose not to use the valet service, my advice would be to research the multiple parking garages that are in the area. I use Google maps, for example and found multiple garages. However, there is one garage on 47th St. that was nearly the same price as it would have been for me to valet, which is ultimately what I did. The next time I go, I will look for the icon parking garages, which are all over the entire area and only a few blocks away for about half the price, if you don\u2019t mind walking this is your best option and guess what you\u2019re gonna be walking anyways so why not?\n\nOverall, this is a five star hotel and I know you will enjoy the day very much.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I used my one free night, and when I looked it up online there was two  queens but when I called in, it was gone and the person attending the desk at the time told the agent I would likely have to pay the difference but would need to speak to the manager to confirm. The manager called back the Hilton agent noting they can upgrade me to the 2 queens room with no additional charge. I was super appreciative of this and my family very much impressed and loved the room.\nEvery single staff at Tempo were so kind and amazing. They showed true example of hospitality.

I reserve the reviews for the really good or really bad experiences.  This is one of the really good experiences.  Not even good\u2026 legitimately perfect.  I am unable to find one single fault with my 4 night stay.  The hotel is brand new, only open 2 weeks, and the rooms and public areas and accommodations are spotless and well appointed.  The rooms (by NYC standards) are fairly spacious, offer motorized shades, wireless phone chargers, rain showers, bluetooth speakers, etc.  The bed was more comfortable than any Hilton property I've stayed in, granted I was probably the first or second person to ever have slept in it.  One of the biggest complaints of travelers staying in larger city hotels is the wait for an elevator.  This hotel has 3 from the street level to the lobby (11th floor) and another 5 or 6 that go to guest floors.  I never waited more than 20-30 seconds for an elevator.  If anything, they're too fast.. by the time you get to them the doors are closing... This needs to be improved but is a small tweak.  The biggest strength of this property is not the public areas or accommodations, it's the staff... The words \"no\" or \"maybe\" are not in their vocabulary, the answer was \"absolutely\" or \"my pleasure\" to any and every request I had.  I'd recognize the shining stars, but to be honest, I literally did not come across an employee who was not friendly or helpful.  The only area for improvement would be the restaurant... Everything I had was outstanding, but the menu was extremely limited and room service was not offered.  Bottom line... Great property and I'll choose it every time I get the opportunity.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I had no idea it was the former Doubletree Time Square until I arrived. So if you want Time Square access, it doesn\u2019t get any better! They completed a $2 billion reno and it shows. The rooms are much more European in their feel (very modern, small, and efficient) but they have everything you need including a small refrigerator and coffee machine. The mattress and bedding are high quality, and I loved the different pillow options included on the bed. The towels were super plush - I\u2019d love some of these at home. The rain shower and detachable wand worked great, and great water pressure and temperature. The lighting made it easy to work, and I loved the \u201crelax\u201d option for more subtle lighting in the evening. The shades and drapes are automatic - I used both given the lights from Time Square pouring in. Interestingly, there was not much street noise, which was great. I had a room on the 25th and 17th floor (I extended my stay) and they had the same layout.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the level of service that I received EVERYWHERE in the hotel. From the gentlemen at the check in, to the folks in the restaurant, to the security staff, to the ladies who checked me out, to the bellman at the door, everyone was genuinely kind and seemed to care about the quality of my stay. When I checked out the 2nd time, they helped me pack my pizza (John\u2019s on 44th never fails!), found more of the Bluestone Lane drinks I fell in love with to take home, and arranged for my transportation to the airport. Every single person smiled - I travel a crap ton, so a smile means everything to me; and everyone delivered. The only small mishap was in the restaurant - I ordered the pork belly and it was not hot when it arrived. The server apologized, took the plate and returned with a new plate of perfectly cooked pork belly - and it was DELICIOUS! Again, the server clearly cared about my meal and my experience. \n\nThe entrance is actually on 47th right now, as they are completing the Broadway entrance. I received a text to let me know that just prior to my arrival, which was nice. \n\nIn short, for the location, the service, and the quality of the room\/hotel amenities, this will remain where I choose to stay when I\u2019m in the City! Now\u2026 if they had a hot Doubletree chocolate chip cookie\u2026 Lol!","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Before we arrived we received a text asking if we had any requests prior to our arrival.  A extra step of the wonderful hospitality we enjoyed. It\u2019s a brand new hotel in the middle of Times Square, Manhattan, NYC.  The room was beautiful, comfortable and clean and a good size for the location.  Everyone was a delight, the bed was one of the most comfortable one I\u2019ve ever sleep on, the shower  and amenities were equally wonderful.  A shout out to the front desk team for being some welcoming to us.  Great view of the city.  We enjoyed everything about our stay at the new Tempo by Hilton Hotel - will definitely return!","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}
