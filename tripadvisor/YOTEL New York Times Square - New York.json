DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU LIKE HOSPITALITY AS THERE IS NONE TO BE FOUND HERE. The least hospitable hotel I've ever stayed in. I thought I would contact you before I write a review but we have had the worst experience at Yotel. Upon trying to check in at the kiosk there was no reservation found. We then waited 20 minutes in line to check in with the desk. When we tried to check in the front desk worker said there was a $301.20 additional fee that needed to be paid. I told him that I already paid all the taxes and fees in full when I book the room. He asked to see the reservation and confirmation. I should him it on my phone to which he proceeded to tell me I hadn\u2019t paid it and still owed. I then called the credit card company I booked through as my confirmation showed I paid the fee. The front desk worker made me rudely told me to leave the front desk. The credit card company then said it also showed that on their end that I paid all fees and shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything additional and that if I wanted to pay it they would reimburse the fee as there must be an issue between them and the hotel. After being on the phone with them for an hour while sitting in the lobby, I went back up to the front desk to pay. The front desk employee was once again extremely rude and mocking about us finally paying the fee.  I explained to him what the credit card company said so stated that I was going to pay it because they would reimburse me as a travel credit. He said they shouldn\u2019t reimburse and that he knows we didn\u2019t pay the fee. I paid the fee anyways so I don\u2019t know why it effects him if they reimburse me or not or why he felt the need to mock me and speak so rudely to me. The experience was so horrible and the fact that the front desk worker was still rude and mocking after we paid the fee anyways says a lot about this hotel.\nThen to top it off the room was dirty and small. Location's alright for NYC, but that's about the only perk. Staff here are so rude and unhelpful. Dirty stains everywhere on the floor, and my and blanket on the bed.\nManagers generic reply only addressing the facility fees and not about how rude employees are to guests or dirty rooms clearly shows that they don't care about the guests.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In addition, the hinge mechanism allows them to slam with some volatility. A lot of guests were cognisant of this and during the late-hours there was little noise from doors. Sadly, the cabin crew were not. Upon their start of room servicing, door slamming from cabins and laundry storage areas was a frequent occurrence.

One of the hotel staff cleaning opened my door multiple times throughout the stay when I had my \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on the door clearly marked. \n\nI was very frustrated and annoyed with how the cleaning staff seemed pushy and adamant about cleaning the room in the early hours 8-9am of the morning.  These occurrences resembled itself by  speaking loudly in the hallway and knocking on every single door- even ones with the sign! I noticed this with other rooms, for example the room next to mine also received the constant \u201cknocking\u201d and interruption to their stay as I hear them get frustrated with them too. \u201cNo we do not need a towel. It is 8am and I am staying for multiple nights. Please go away.\u201d \n\nOn my side I pretended to be asleep to avoid any awkward confrontation, but  then it seemed that they were just waiting for me to get out of bed to pounce on the room. I noticed there was a motion sensor within the room. so these actions should have been completely avoided. Perhaps there is a way for the staff to not feel so pressured to clean each room every single day. For a multiple day stay, I don\u2019t actually expect my room to be turned over every day, and would rather see the staff be able to save their energy for the rooms that DO need cleaning. I would have probably asked for one cleaning but felt uncomfortably chased every day of my stay. \n\nIs there any way customer service could acknowledge this?

I had booked a single room, so it was quite a small space, but we're in New York. What do you expect? My room had a very comfortable bed with an electric control to recline from a sofa style to a full lay flat bed! I liked it. It made good use of the limited space! The bathroom was small but manageable. It's kind of open plan if that makes sense, so not for the shy ones out there. As I was solo, it was fine!\n\nI booked a package which included breakfast. Well, the service was good. The staff were very nice, albeit, very busy. The selection is not great, but it was manageable. Scrambled eggs were always in the tray so I was happy. Along with that, they also served noodles and more substantial 'daytime' food! The hotel seems to have a deal with a few Asian airlines, so their crew were usually there. I think some of the breakfast dishes catered to them, which was fine by me. Nothing like a hearty breakfast!\n\nOf course, the location of the hotel means you are never in the room for long, except to sleep. If you are, you are wasting your trip and money! The hotel is perfectly placed to enjoy Times Square and to also walk around and enjoy everything that New York City has to offer. \n\nMy only negative comment is that on the final day, my flight was at night, so I would have liked to leave my luggage and venture out a little before catching my ride to the airport, but they have this policy where I would have had to pay (not a small amount) to leave my things. As I had a few items, it added up and didn't make sense, so I just stayed in the hotel, working and killing time. It's a shame, but I couldn't justify spending that much to leave my things for a few hours.\n\nOther than that, it was a nice stay. Would I stay here again? If I had an earlier departing flight or less luggage; Yes.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

The bed was very comfortable and housekeeping did a fantastic job daily. \n I wish I could be as positive about the lobby staff. On top of the city tax the hotel makes you pay a compulsory service charge where they say that its for use of their amenities which includes use of their storage luggage robot and discounts on attractions. You get better deals online for attractions and when we came to use the robot it was conveniently full and we were charged $3 per item for the lobby staff to put it in a room. They even wanted $3 for a coat! I asked them to wave the fee as we had already paid for storage and they said 'we should have checked out earlier and If I want to complain then go elsewhere.' Funnily enough someone got the robot working and one of the staff went running over asking who had touched it? It was self service and quite clearly the staff had stopped people using it to cash in. \nIt's such a shame that the money grabbing unhelpful attitude of the lobby staff spoil the hotels reputation which is actually a good concept. I would of recommended the hotel if it wasn't for them. I think Yotel need to seriously consider employing staff that are out to service themselves and not their customers.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Specifically, my interaction with Jj, Chris, and Renee Gomez was nothing short of disappointing and unacceptable.\nUpon departure from the hotel, my friend (two tiny girls) and I requested assistance with our luggage and the use of a luggage trolley. \n\nHowever, we were informed by Jj, Chris, and Renee Gomez that there were no luggage trolleys available, and if we desired assistance, it would come at an additional charge of $20, payable only in cash. This policy is not only unreasonable but also reflects poorly on the hotel's commitment to guest satisfaction.\nRather than wait for assistance that should have been provided as a standard service, we opted to transport our luggage ourselves. \n\nThis involved navigating multiple elevators across different floors, a task made significantly more difficult without the aid of a luggage trolley. Despite witnessing our struggle, Jj, Chris, and Renee Gomez made no attempt to offer assistance, instead choosing to stand idly by and watch as we struggled with our belongings.\nWhen we reached the ground floor, we once again requested assistance, only to be met with dismissive remarks. Jj, Chris, and Renee Gomez insinuated that we should have pre-booked a service if we wanted assistance and went on to suggest that they were under no obligation to assist us, citing their gender as a reason for their refusal to help.\n\nThis level of unprofessionalism and disregard for customer satisfaction is completely unacceptable. As paying guests of your establishment, we expected to be treated with respect and courtesy, not met with rudeness and indifference. It is clear that Jj, Chris, and Renee Gomez failed to uphold the standards of customer service expected of them, and their behavior reflects poorly on the reputation of Yotel.\n\nI urge you to address this matter promptly and take appropriate action to ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future. Guests should feel valued and supported during their stay, and it is imperative that all staff members understand and adhere to this principle.\n\nI trust that you will investigate this complaint thoroughly and provide a satisfactory resolution. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\nNadezhda Kuleshova","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I arrived very early after an overnight flight, and before that, upon booking my reservation, I had requested early check-in. When I arrived, quite tired from no sleep during travel, I was informed that I could check in early - at an additional cost (of almost one night's stay) - none of this had been explained before in the reservation process. Because I desperately needed to rest, I paid the additional fee, and was sent to a cabin with HVAC issues - the vent rattled so loudly that sleep was impossible. I requested a change of cabin, and was sent to one where the bed was made with dirty sheets - including what looked like a *drop of blood* on the linens. I immediately requested new sheets. It took a while for security to arrive, to remove the soiled sheets with gloves. It then took over an hour for a new set of sheets to arrive -- and one of those was dirty, too! I made up the bed and tried to sleep, which was difficult with a sunken mattress and no duvet\/ comforter (we're talking about NYC in January, and the temperature was about 25F\/ -3.8C outside. I then waited another hour for a duvet\/ comforter to arrive, which ALSO had dirty patches.\n\nAdditionally, the cabin had the following issues:\n- broken bedside lights (on hinges installed in the wall, which wouldn't hold up\/ had to rest on the headboard for support) \/ need rewiring\n- electrical outlet panel above desk was not anchored into wall\/ came out upon removal of plugs. Not all outlets actually function.\n- broken sink faucet\/ handle (the handle actually comes off when one tries to turn on the faucet)\n- sliding shower door would not stay shut when showering (an issue because of water spillage and NYC winter temperatures)\n- shower drain was slow to drain\/ basin would quickly fill\n- toilet smelled like it had not been cleaned or sanitized\n\nThere were communication breakdowns among the staff across every issue, on the phone and in person - including sending people to my room without notice or warning, which would have been appreciated from a customer standpoint. One of those staff members, the building engineer, gave me an unwarranted attitude. \n\nIt became clear to me that the hotel runs their staff using an app, which sounds like it lacks personalization or communication. They also need some instruction in customer service. Furthermore, when I notified a day manager of the lack of cleanliness, hygiene, and sanitation, and requested a refund of the early check-in fee (because I checked into and paid for a dirty room), I was punted to email another manager, rather than having my issue resolved on the spot.\n\n I've stayed at Yotel several times over the last 10 years, because its location is convenient to business needs at Javitz Convention Center, but after this visit, which lacked in professionalism, courtesy, and cleanliness, I will not be back.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

I'll be honest given what we paid we really couldn't fault the hotel, the only reason it's not a 5\/5 is there's a couple minor things that could be improved upon. First of all the location is fantastic, 10minutues walk from being in the heart of Times square, 20minutes from Central park and an easy walk from the subway station if you're travelling public transport from JFK like we did. We had room 1912, I requested a room with a city skyline view and as high as possible before we had to pay deluxe room prices and that's exactly what we got. Onto the room itself, an iron and a hairdryer were included and the room was clean, the bed we found comfy and loved you could turn it into a sofa with 1 push of a button, spacious shower and decent level of storage for a 4 day stay. The only things we felt let it down was the room was warm even with the air con on its lowest setting so we kept the window open, meaning you heard all the sirens of NY (however after walking 12miles a day it tended not to interrupt your sleep). Some of the finishing were a little worn e.g. bits of edging missing etc, and finally there was no refrigerator in the room. One thing that was disappointing was the advertised terrace never seemed to be open, not sure if we just kept missing it or not but the outdoor seating was always covered over.\n\nThe robot luggage storage facility was easy to use and the reception guys were not fussed about how long you left your luggage stored, which was helpful as we checked out at 11 and didn't need to head up to JFK until after 3. Also when it actually comes to checking in you can literally do it all yourself on one of the check in screens.\n\nOverall a really great stay at Yotel, they delivered on my request, the location was us first timers was excellent and there were plenty of amenities within comfortable walking distance. We certainly wouldn't hesitate to rebook should the opportunity arise. For the British tourists my best comparison is it's a Premier Inn with frills.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":2079052,"title":"Disappointing experience at Yotel New York","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-15","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"I recently had a highly disappointing experience during my stay at Yotel New York, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts and concerns. Unfortunately, my expectations were far from met, and several aspects of the hotel's service left much to be desired. Here's a detailed review of my stay:\n\nCons:\n1. Poor Customer Service: The staff at Yotel New York displayed a lack of empathy and understanding towards my situation. Despite explaining that I had a family emergency and needed to travel back to my city, they refused to accommodate my cancellation request. Their inflexibility and apparent disregard for my circumstances were deeply disheartening.\n\n2. Excessive Charges: The hotel's approach to charging guests was disappointing. I requested an early check-in at 12pm, which is a fairly reasonable ask. However, instead of offering it as a courtesy, they insisted on charging me an exorbitant fee of $60. This felt like an opportunistic move, taking advantage of guests' needs and charging excessive amounts for basic services.\n\n3. Misleading Advertising: I was left disillusioned upon seeing the room I was assigned. It was a far cry from the advertised descriptions and amenities. The room lacked the promised comfort and quality, leaving me questioning the hotel's commitment to providing accurate and transparent information to its guests. This false advertising is unacceptable and misleading to potential customers.\n\n4. Lack of Flexibility: Yotel New York's rigid policies, particularly the non-refundable reservation policy, felt unfair and unaccommodating. While emergencies and unforeseen circumstances can arise, the hotel seemed unwilling to make exceptions or show any understanding towards guests in distress. This lack of flexibility left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a guest.\n\n5. Noise Issues: The hotel's location in a bustling area resulted in significant noise disturbances throughout my stay. The constant street traffic and noise from neighboring rooms made it difficult to relax and get a good night's sleep. The lack of soundproofing in the rooms was a major drawback, further adding to my overall dissatisfaction.\n\nIt's disappointing to have such a negative experience at a hotel that I had hoped would provide a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The issues I encountered, including the poor customer service, excessive charges, misleading advertising, inflexible policies, and noise problems, have left me with a lasting negative impression of Yotel New York.\n\nI urge the hotel management to reevaluate their approach to customer service and consider the importance of empathy, flexibility, and transparency. It's crucial for the hotel to align its services with the expectations set by its advertising to avoid disappointing and frustrating guests in the future.\n\nBased on my experience, I cannot recommend Yotel New York to fellow travelers, as there are certainly better options available that prioritize customer satisfaction and provide a more enjoyable stay.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

In the morning we spoke to a staff member at the desk. He called security who stated because we did not report it on the night he could not do anything about it!! I explained how on several occasions both I and my sister who was 2 rooms down from us had tried to get help to no avail.\nOur details were left for the manger to contact us. We did not hear from manger, we returned later to be told she was in a meeting, and given her card. We were informed she would contact us. I sent an email to her work email on the card. Detailing the full night we had. That was 6 days ago and still no reply!! I sent a reminder email. My sister was staying on for a further two nights after us and she experienced the same awful goings on 2rooms down from us,  she never received a call or anything from the hotel. We were extremely disappointed and upset that the hotel have not made any contact. The lack of sleep and being subjected to continuous weed smell and smoke into our room was awful. The noise level had to have been heard by other guests on other floors also. \nWe will not be returning or recommending this hotel.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is in a great location 10\/15 min walk from Times Square. The  subway is also a short walk away. The rooms weren't huge but certainly not tiny. The reclining bed is a great way to save space when getting ready. The shower was great and we had a fab view of the city. There wasn't a lot of storage but we knew this and it wasn't a problem for us. There is an iron which was handy. There was a smart TV in the room which you could link to home netflix etc.. The staff were friendly and always someone on hand to ask a question. They are clearly trying to make this a self serve hotel but not sure they are quite there yet e.g. self check in machines but still need to go to desk if you have multiple rooms booked which we did. The staff arranged a taxi for us back to JFK. It was a flat rate of $95 plus tip. ( be mindful they charged us an extra $10 for paying on card) We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on this but there is a fab diner called Westway diner 5 mins up the road for anyone looking for local recommendations \ud83d\ude00 overall we enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend for a budget hotel in NYC!

No great choice at breakfast - again, basic. But service was efficient. Rooftop bar nice enough and had a tasty ribs dish. But just be aware this is a very automated hotel. Check-in and out at a computer screen and if you leave your bags after check-out, a machine grabs and dumps them. Nobody seemed to have gone for that option.

Our stay was very enjoyable indeed. \nWe stayed in a 'premium queen' cabin. Whilst fairly small it was perfect for a four night stay, the bed was extremely comfortable, (room was tidy and bed sheets replaced every day) with a shower room, toilet, wash basin, iron & ironing board, hairdryer, large tv, bedside desk with four charging USB points. \nWe had read that the bed extended via a button and when it was fully extended there was no room to walk around the end of the bed. This is NOT true, there was plenty of room for you to comforatbly walk past should the need arise in the night. \nAfter a hectic day sightseeing around the City, the rooftop bar and lounge on the 4th floor was the perfect venue to unwind and relax before bed. There was a small but decent choice of snacks, meals & desserts to choose from for a reasonable price. \nThe staff were excellent from the check in guys on duty in the lobby to the waiting on staff in the bar & lounge. \nThere was a small kiosk (also on level 4) where you could grab a coffee and a pastry before heading out for the day. \nWe didnt use the robot with regards to our luggage storage on our departure day but for a fee of just $2 per bag, the staff lablled up and stored our luggage for us until our taxi to the airport picked us up.\nThis was another service the guys on reception sorted for us, they booked us a taxi for a flat fee of $85, this may sound a bit high but our fee from the airport to the hotel (with the familiar yellow taxis) was just over $100 including toll fees and tip. \nThe location was really good, with Times Square being just under a mile away. For any able bodied person this was a 10-15 minute walk.\nWith my mobility not good at all and my wife not a fan of the subway, I downloaded an app called My Transit and this proved to be an invaluable tool for getting around the City by bus, just find the route for your desired location, get on at the recommended bus stop, all within 25 yards of the hotel entrance and scan your phone (if you have a google pay etc) or your \ncredit\/debit card and get across the City for the equivalent of 89p. \n\nAll in all we would definitley recommend a stay at the Yotel and would like to thank all the staff for their help and kindness.

These are not rooms designed for humans. These are machines for living. However, these rooms are not designed with care or forethought like the architects of the 20th century. The sink is too shallow to hold your hands underneath the faucet. There is no fridge, which, for $300 a night, should be a given - I was unable to save my takeout for the next day. The trendy purple lighting is grating and cheesy and can\u2019t be toggled unless you\u2019re at the terminal. The curtains that go down at the push of a button are not intuitive (the button to shift them is on the other side of the room) and were not functional and necessitated a visit from the front desk. Because they couldn\u2019t close all the way, I slept poorly due to the light of the city streaming in through the window. The rounded, austere aesthetic isn\u2019t pleasant to look at and lacks all humanity. These rooms were designed for simplicity and ease of use, but they only go to prove that if if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. Sometimes being able to tug on a curtain to close it, or turn off a light physically, or having a traditional sink, isn\u2019t only faster, but they\u2019re more intuitive and offer more control. The cute-sy branding of \u201cMission Control\u201d and other Yotel monikers for the hideous in-room phone makes it difficult to decipher who I\u2019m calling. I want the front desk\/concierge.

You have to take it to floor 4 and transfer to another elevator to get to your \u201ccabins.\u201d I was rolling my eyes the whole time.

The retractable bed was a smart, space-saving touch and it was surprisingly comfortable. \n\nMy qualm is the room just didn\u2019t feel as clean as I would like.

We emailed the hotel to advise this just in case.\nAnyway we arrive at the hotel, only to be advised our rooms had been sold on, since we didn't turn up. \"its like an aeroplane seat\", said the male receptionist, if you don't turn up they will sell the seat again. Now thats not what we wanted to hear, after already missing a days holiday. We are also advised that they were fully booked up, and theres nothing they can do. We had booked flights and hotel thru BA, who also were uncontactable, and so after getting zero assistance from Hotel, even though we had booked for 9 nights, we found accommodation elsewhere for the night.\n\nThe following day, after contacting BA, we managed to get ours rooms back, although BA also had trouble getting assistance from Yotel.\n\nAnyways once we got settled in, the rooms were more inviting and spacious that the previous nights IPOD rooms. \nWe were expecting compact rooms, but to be fair, it was just what was required.\nSmart TV was perfect with a multitude of channels, including HBO movies.\nThe rain shower and toiletries were perfect.\nWe were on floor 17, and all 3 rooms had nice views.\nThe rooms had smart electric  beds, that went to a relining mode(ours didn't work, but we never asked to get it fixed)\nAlthough compact, theres enough space for storing suitcases, hanging up clothes, drawers for smaller items. \nRooms came with an ironing board and iron, hair dryer and safe.\nThe beds were extremely comfortable, with ample pillows.\n\nThe rooms were valeted daily, and looked great, but looking closer at the fixtures and fittings, you could see they all needed slightly better deep cleaning. \nAll in all the standard of the rooms was better than i was expecting, going by some past reviews.\n\nThe hotel entrance is manned by two receptionists and 3-4 concierge.Apart from the unhelpful first night, they could not be faulted and were courteous and helpful.\n\nThere is a nice meeting\/dining\/outside area on level 4.\n\nLocation is perfect. not to far from the craziness of times Sq, but far enough to not get bombarded by crowds when you leave the hotel.\n\nWe had 8 nights in there hotel, and although the rooms are compact, we would stay there again.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It seemed modern and spacious on the photos, but when we first got through the door, we thought is a joke, as first thing after you open the door is a bed ^^ very small room, at least for Premium Queen. Small space between the bed and wall with \u2018smart TV\u2019 which wasn\u2019t really smart, no apps whatsoever, couldn\u2019t even connect your phone or tablet. After you passed a bed, you\u2019ll find a sink and shower and a toilet with slide door, which by the way were really heave to operate (toilet one). Toilet was right next to the window, so we weren\u2019t sure if we can be seen from the outside, which made us a bit uncomfortable, so we had to use blinds every time we used it, as door were awkward to open and close. On top on everything, you have to pay extra \u2018facility fee\u2019 for each night forty something dollars. I understood it was due to the terrace on the roof! Imagine my disappointment, when I found out it was on the fourth floor! The building goes up on to 27th floor I think. We stayed on the 20th. Also, the signage on every floor says there is a water and ice somewhere there, but turned out it\u2019s only on odd floors, and the ice bags are never there.

I stayed in room 2638, and it was so tired and dingy \u2014 and obvious that corners had been cut to save money (but under the auspices of having a chic, industrial vibe). Paint everywhere in hotel and room (including on furniture) was peeling, and the handle on the faucet was broken. Some of the elevators were out of service, and eveb the up\/down lights on some of the elevators were broken and didn\u2019t light up when you pressed them. The room was relatively clean but floor felt grimy. The shower door was only a half door (so you couldn\u2019t close the shower), and there was a huge gap above the bathroom door (again, part of the \u201cmodern, industrial design,\u201d but in practice it meant absolutely zero privacy). There is no refrigerator or coffee maker in the room. And no complimentary coffee in the morning \u2014 just an overpriced and understaffed coffee stand. There is supposed to be an ice maker on every floor, but the one on our floor was broken, and I was instructed that only floors 8 and 9 had working ice makers. I am used to the tiny size of NYC hotel rooms, but at $500 (!) a night, I expect everything to be in good shape. The whole hotel was shabby. Staff are polite enough but there is hardly anyone around, and they certainly do nothing to add to the experience. They all seemed a bit tired and overworked.  The luggage robot is a silly gimmick and requires staff to help people figure out how to use it. That space would have been better utilized as a traditional luggage storage area. Only upsides: nice view from my room, beds were comfortable, good water pressure. That\u2019s why I am giving it two stars instead of one.  ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Firstly the check in process is very easy to follow where you check yourself in using a tablet\/screen. Staff were on hand to help if needed. \n\nThe rooms are clean and have what you need to bunker down from a busy day exploring the city. Select beds recline to allow more space when you\u2019re not sleeping. Not a complaint, more of an informal that the rooms are on the small side but they are cosy and have enough room to store luggage. The shower was incredible, great temperatures and water pressure. \n\nRecommend a room looking out to the river but am sure that over views of the city are equally nice. \n\nThe staff for the hotel are soo friendly, helpful and just generally really nice people. They helped us store our luggage in a cool robotic controlled storage system AND they organised a car to take a group of 5 adults and luggage to the airport for and incredible price - major thanks to them for that! \n\nThere is a bar and restaurant too. There isn\u2019t a kettle in the room if you want tea or coffee in the morning but there is a hot drinks vending machine next to a cold vending machine on Level 4 (where the dining area is)\n\nThe area surrounding the hotel could be potentially seen as a bit rough but this isn\u2019t to do with the hotel at all. This is more of a heads up. CVS pharmacy across the road for snacks, drinks and anything else you may need. Then it\u2019s roughly a 10 min walk straight to Times Square and a metro station to get everywhere.\n\nAll in all, hotel and staff are brilliant, surrounding area a bit rough but quiet to escape the hub bub of TS but not being too far from it either.\n\nHighly recommend, please ignore the negative reviews!","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On the way to the hotel, called to confirm the room and was told it was a queen no bunk. Hotel staff was rude indicating that's what I booked. Discussed at check in, showing the confirmation on my phone that clearly said queen with bunk, but hotel said no bunk room available so we ended up in a queen with no bunk. i.e. We paid for a room with 2 beds, but got one bed.  \n\nAfter multiple calls to TMobile travel, they indicated it would take 24 hours to do anything. Went back to the front desk and was told that I was out of luck, room was prepaid and they wouldn't do anything about it. After additional discussion, front desk said they may have a bunk room later that day but nothing was clean yet. Come back later. I wasn't happy but seemed there wasn't anything I could do, so returned to my room. \n\nAbout 15 minutes after I got back to the room, we heard the lightest tapping sound and my daughter asked if that was at our door. I didn't think so, but got up to go check and before I could take a step, housekeeping entered the room. No idea why, no calling out \"housekeeping\" etc. We packed and went back to the front desk, letting them know what had occurred and that we were checking out. They agreed to refund the resort fee (or whatever the extraneous fees were called) but said the room fee was paid to the company I booked it through, so they couldn't refund. \n\nAfter several calls to TMobile travel, they indicate that the hotel has agreed to a 15% refund and they can't do anything more. The whole mess ended up taking up most of a day of our trip between calls to TMobile, discussions with the hotel front desk and finding\/booking\/checking into a new hotel. \n\nAlso of note, the bathroom is open concept. Shower has some privacy film and mostly blocks the view of the toilet but there's nothing to cut toilet sound. \n\nLots of technology in the hotel but much of it broken ... vending, phones, etc. Lots of better options within Times Square that are closer and cheaper.

I asked one of the staff on the 4th floor and he just pointed to where the elevators are, when I explained I don't know what floor we need to go to he just said the same, not really helpful. \n\nThe room was quiet small and it was a struggle at times, you can't fully open the door if the bed is down and with 2 large suitcases there was limited storage, I am glad I brought coathangers. \n\nTheir was no fridge in the room and no ice machine on our floor. So felt like we kept buying water\/juice and ended up going to waste, the cold water from the sink was not cold at all. \n\nFound the staff on mission control really unhelpful. I asked about late check out and he just said do it online, asked about the fee and he said it will tell me online.\n\nI was really worried about staying here after we had booked it due to many reviews mentioning extra or hidden fees. When we checked in our resort fee was 172 dollars which was what our tour operator had told us and then 200 dollars refundable deposit. When checking out the machine brought up the 172 dollars again, I spoke to the man and he told me to go to mission control. I spoke to a woman who was the most unhelpful person I've spoken to in a hotel, I explained I've paid the fees and when checking out its bringing them up again. She said I've not paid the fees yet, I had when I checked in with money coming out of my account, and it was a holding charge. Again I explained the money has left my account when I checked in.

If the person above you is having a shower you will hear the water running down your room, can hear people's doors getting closed etc. We didn't really adjust to the time difference so we were up early anyway but it was hard to get an unbroken sleep.\n\nThe location for the hotel itself is the massive bonus. 10 min walk from times square, round the corner from Broadway, 10 mins from the piers and 10 from central park. \n\nIt's a shame as the hotel is in a really great location but there is a few small things that could be done to make this a much better hotel.

Check in and check out was quick and easy. Room had everything we needed with a lovely view although on the morning of check out there was no hot water and no time to get this seen to before we had to leave. Around 2am of our last night we woke up to a strong smell of cannabis in the room - we weren\u2019t going to get out of bed and go downstairs at this time to report this. Was a shame the outdoor terrace was closed during stay (tables and chairs covered up) as it looked lovely with great views. On checking out we tried to store our bags using the yobot but apparently this was full. A staff member came out and took hold of our bags before saying it would be $4 cash only. We had no cash and asked if we could pay when we collected the bags and the man said no. We were stood right next to a sign that said this gratuity fee was SUGGESTED. We challenged this and the man said the suggested gratuity was to store bags with the yobot (how do you tip a robot\/machine??) and for him to store our bags it was a mandatory $4 fee. He then pointed us to an ATM which charged us $6.55 for exchange fees when withdrawing cash (despite using a travel card) so it ended up costing us $10 to store our bags although this is advertised as a complimentary service by the hotel. Having to provide a tip was not the point, it was the fact it quite clearly says this is suggested but the man insisted it was mandatory.

Every encounter was pleasant and they took the initiative, always offering ice or help in some way we didn't expect.  We made the mistake of not checking the Javits Center conventions prior to booking, and we had a heck of a time finding anything for less than $500\/night.  Recommend paying for a high floor, we were put at the top, and the views were great.  The bed was very comfortable and for 2 adults, this room was adequate in size for our luggage and ourselves.  The hotel was booked solid full, and yet we didn't feel crowded in any way.  There is a fabulous food truck right outside, and we had breakfast at the hotel restaurant and it was reasonably priced and very good.  Back in the day, I would never have even walked in Hell's Kitchen, so I was happily surprised at the great Chelsea-like vibe from the 1990's I felt while roaming around in this part of Manhattan.  It is easy to get a cab using Curb, and we were able to walk from the hotel to Rockefeller, although it was about 1.5 miles.  \n\nI have never seen Manhattan so crowded, we went December 6-10 2023 and it was so insane I'll never do it again at that time of year.  I was disoriented by the sheer size of the crowds, and it was way too hectic and not really fun for us.  I worked at McGraw-Hill when it was at 45 Rock, and there was just no way to orient myself to enjoy visiting that area with the crowds being what they were.  I might try again later in December, but I urge people to check what conventions are in town before making plans.  There were 4 or 5 big ones at Javits, and it ruined our experience with so many people in the City at the same time.  Christmas time used to be fun there, but I don't recommend it anymore.  It was just easier to stay in our little Hell's Kitchen 'hood  by the Yotel.  We found great local bars and restaurants, and found no reason to leave that area once we explored it.  The Yotel was clean, quiet, and we liked it.  You will notice an aroma of marijuana, but we smelled it everywhere in the City, since recreational has been legalized.  Still beats the smell of cigarettes, and I'm sure it will be regulated for smoke in the same way down the line, but for now, expect it to be everywhere because it is.  We paid a lot more for the room given supply and demand, but it met our needs in every way.\n\nOne important thing, I read some reviews of people not liking the shower set up.  Yeah, well, don't share a room with your children and expect privacy in the bathroom, it's just not set up that way.  Find a different place to stay if you need total toilet and shower privacy, it worked fine for us and was not unlike other places we've stayed that are not in NYC, like The Vibe.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel also didn't not mention the others such as fees and the discounts on museums and other places which would have been useful.

The so called facility charges. We paid  216 dollars extra charge for 5 nights which I think includes a small amount in taxes. For this you get the use of a gym, free WiFi and discounts on some local business and some sightseeing and entertainment. I used the Gym once, the WiFi seemed ro work very well and we disnr use any of the discounts available. Doesn't seem like much of a deal, but I look at it another way, it's more of a top up on the very cheap rates we paid for the room, which still works out pretty fair as hotel rates are very expensive in Manhattan in general and compared to other hotels it still.works out much cheaper plus most hotels have a resort fee too,so it's not like you can get away with it elsewhere. So anyway moving on. Self check in was a breeze, and there was a member of staff on hand ro help out if needed. Room wasn't the biggest but it was fine, a lot of people.in the reviews complaining that the rooms are small in the reviews which makes me think they've never been to Rome or Paris just to name two cities where rooms are generally much smaller for exorbitant prices. Room was clean, with a nice flat-screen TV a small table and wash basin and a fabulous view of the Hudson River. The shower was good and I didn't have any problems with hot water either I'm the morning or at night. The shower and toilet are stain glassed you can't really see anything from the room but you can hear, so I guess this won't suit everyone, it will depend who you travel with. The only thing about the room that isn't great is you can hear your neighbors, pray for some quiet people next door or I recommend taking ear plugs. Only on the first night did we have some issues the couple next door had music on quite loud till the early hours, however i had earplugs so didnt suffer too much, the rest of the time i had no problems. The staff are very nice and always willing to help or give advice, a big thumbs up to them. I didn't have breakfast there so can't comment, I did buy a couple of coffees from the Korean gentleman on the 4th floor and they were very good. The Hotel is about 10 minutes from time Square on foot and 18 mins from Penn Station. Very much walkable. Overall if your on a budget and want to stay somewhere  central I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. Very good experience. ","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check out tablet gave me an error code and the staff person just said i could leave which was weird. Also never told about all their extra stuff, i.e. a bar, a yobot, the gym. Didn't know where any of that stuff was.\nHere's specific details of my check in.\nBut i got there at 11pm, go to my room and right off the bat the bed is broken. I try to call the front desk, the phone doesn't work. I have to go to the lobby (which requires two elevators) and the person was quite rude and dismissive. He gives me a new room and when i get there, (i KNOW this is probably stupid but for me, it's now midnight, I'm exhausted) the light switch is this small box under the TV instead of just a normal switch like my first room. I can't figure out how to work this one, the lights are flashing like I'm in a rave, they are very dim, it only illuminates around the tv! I go downstairs and the guy is dealing with someone else (who seemed to also be having a problem) but he sees me and says \"are you done?\" I said \"I'm sorry, can i change, the light situation is confusing and its just staying purple\" and he frustratingly says \"well the maintenence guy is coming\" as if he already told me but he never said that and then asks for my room number (so clearly he didn't send someone. Maintenance comes and the guy just says that's as bright as it goes...you're not the only one to complain.\n\nI wish i had just gone with a simpler hotel. This was not what it cracks itself up to be.\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We checked ourselves in at the kiosk which was straightforward and easy to do, and printed our own room keys. I was a bit nervous about being charged resort fees after reading several other reviews, and had prepared to refuse this, however was pleased to see that there were no additional charges to our invoice, other than a $200 holding fee which was refunded to us at the end of our stay. We had a standard room, the view was ok, the room had a bit of wear and tear but that is to be expected but otherwise was generally clean. Bathroom area also fine, although the door slides across and is not sealed so you won't get any privacy, this was fine for us but may not be desirable for others. The room was quite small, but we had no issues with the bed controls that allowed you more space. We did have an issue with our air conditioning unit when we first  arrived, and as temperatures were around 30 degrees at the time this was a bit of an issue. We actually ended up chatting to somebody in the lift who had the same issue, he let us know that a maintenance worker had come and fixed his, and oddly enough said maintenance worker got in the lift with us shortly after. He very helpfully came up to our room within half an hour and reset our air conditioning. Ice machines didn't work on all floors, however our helpful lift friend also let us know which floors had ice, and which ones had bags for ice. I wouldn't recommend eating\/drinking in the hotel, the bar had a good vibe but if you're doing your best to budget there are plenty of other places in NY to grab a drink or something to eat that won't cost you your life savings. There's also a liquor store one street over from the hotel, where you can pick up a bottle of wine for around $10 and take it back to your room to enjoy. There is nothing extravagant about staying at Yotel but as far as hotels go I would recommend. Definitely not the worst place you can stay, and essentially you're only really there to sleep and shower.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

While this could be a fun game it can sometimes become frustrating.

We had a good experience storing our bags with the Yobot, but this could definitely go south in many ways at no fault of your own.  Fortunately, hotel management had the foresight to implement a mission control service which allows you to store you bags with a human if you choose, but there is a cost to do this so make sure you bring 5$ incase the free service of Yobot becomes disrupted.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I\u2019m lucky I had $360 in my account as others may not be in that position. \nI have stayed in Yotel Boston, Edinburgh and Glasgow so I\u2019m aware of the standard of rooms prior to arrival.\nWe unpacked and settled to sleep after a long flight from the UK. \nOn waking up we noticed the bed did not recline or work into the seated position. There was no curtain to divide the toilet area for privacy which was apparently taken away for Covid reasons!! The shower cubical was not frosted glass so no privacy at all for showering and very little for using the toilet. There was no plug top on the wash hand basin and surfaces were cracked\/Brocken mouldy. Surely some privacy in the shower is a basic requirement even for the closest of couples or families. We were offered a room swap however after unpacking we had a busy schedule for a short trip in NYC so had no time to re pack and accepted a small refund. \nOn check out we checked our cases into the secure room controlled by a robot and on our return there was no trace of them and staff had no clue where they were and suspected them stolen, after a long investigation 1 was found within the room under a different PIN number from what I had input and the 2nd was in another part of the hotel and no one could offer any explanation why it had been moved or handled from a secure self service area. We had no idea if someone had been through our bags prior to catching our flight. The lost bag contained my wife\u2019s anti rejection medication so we were clearly deeply worried at the time. During this we found the female manager not to be interested in any way, very rude and unhelpful. She barely took time to speak to us or even have eye contact. On finding the bags we had missed the chance to catch the public transport as planned and feared missing our flight home so we arranged a private car from the hotel which with any undesirables of customer relations you would expect the manager to offer payment of this as an apology however this was not offered and when queried it was refused. The manager eventually handed me a piece of paper without explanation showing a $40 refund but no apology or explanation. Out taxi was $100 due to the good driving and local knowledge of the driver to just catch our flight.  I still don\u2019t know why our bags were moved or by whom!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Nothing, you can ask for a mini fridge for your room and if they have one available they can lend it to you for free, but the minimalistic design of the rooms make you bump into it every now and then (hence the reason why there was a common place\u2026) If you want to heat something you are out of luck. By the way avoid the coffee machine at the 4th floor\u2026 the worst coffee I have ever tasted, it shouldn\u2019t even called a coffee machine, I hope that maybe it was broken and I didn\u2019t know\u2026 I can\u2019t believe they charge you for that\u2026, on the bright side, the coffee at grab and go is great!\n\nI get the minimalistic concept but I would taken into account having a space for a coffee machine, microwave and a mini fridge since the common place is not a thing anymore.\n\nThe lack of those amenities is not the end of the world but should be considered if you are traveling on a budget or you are with a baby and need to heat milk or need to store cold stuff like insulin.\n\nRooms need a little update as it\u2019s age is clearly shown on the bed and the tables on the side, also I would change the toilet seat when it start to look like a public bathroom\u2026\n\nDo I recommend Yotel? Well if your trip is for less than 3 nights sure is conveniently located but for longer trips I can\u2019t recommend Yotel as I did 10 years ago when there are other alternatives that offers free breakfast and\/or have the coffee machine\/microwave\/fridge combo and are at the same price range, also the lack of space can be an issue if you are staying longer than a weekend of if you pack a lot of stuff.\n\nTLDR: This is not the same Yotel I enjoyed so much 10 years ago, there are better alternatives elsewhere.\n\nPS: Did I mentioned that their WiFi sucks?","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Because there were five of Us, reasonably priced options in Manhattan are limited. Yotel had the option for 5 for about $300 per night before tax.\nThey overcome the fire hazard law by assigning two rooms as one. The rooms are at the end of a hall and have a cool feature: they provide an ante-room which can be used by the key for either of the rooms and both room keys work on either room. So entrance, then door on either side.\nThe rooms are European styled, small but with plenty of amenities. The queen bed operates as an electric futon and can be rolled up during the day. The lighting is ample. The shower has a wide shower head, hot water and good pressure providing an exhilarating experience. There are also euro-style towel warmers note:on\/off switch on base).\nBathroom has a nice wide vanity. We had plenty of room for everything and to get ready.\nThough modest and snug, the room is laid out well and makes staying there easy. It's actually kind of cool how the tv stand doubles as shelving for keys and change, etc. there were 4 ush ports and two 110v outlets.\n\nI was totally satisfied with every aspect of the rooms, but for more finicky people: they are a little dated and worn-not unclean-just ready for a makeover. The charge port stations were loose and made it especially difficult to charge with the 110 block. The doors slam hard-a dampener would be nice. The toilet doors are part of the shower wall, so there's never total privacy in that room.\nBeyond the room: The hotel is located close enough by foot to Times Square or Bryant park.\nThe subway entrance is just on 8th avenue. The area is not noisy or congested. The hotel provides a bar -which seemed always open and a restaurant-which was open a lot. There is a coffee shop open until 2-Their coffee and service is good, but it's fairly expensive.\nOtherwise, the only coffee (or l'm assuming ted) is provided via a vending machine in the lobby - it was okay. There are not many dining options in the near block. We walked to Westway Diner for late Breakfast. There is a full grocery store across the street. The hotel lifts are incredibly efficient-which is always nice.\nOtherwise, it was fun friendly, modern and inviting. There were a host of guests from around the world world, which was cool. I would def stay there again.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

To be honest after doing 30,000 steps most days in NY it was lovely just to come back to a clean, warm room and watch TV, and rest our legs.  We had small issue with yapping dog in room opposite.  But after mentioning security, kept an eye on it.   Great area, loads of nice local deli's and bars nearby.   Would not hesitate to stay again.

I reserved a room and I needed a second room, a few days into my stay. I approached the Front Desk around 2-3am to make this reservation. The agent on duty proceeded to tell me I can make a reservation online. I stated that even though I was standing right here in front of him, I still had to make a reservation online? and he said yes. Where is the customer service in that? There was no line or anyone else in the lobby at that time so I don't see how it would be such a hassle.\nI made my reservation (in my room from my cell phone) and went down to check in at 1:58pm the next day from the self-service kiosk. The kiosk stated \"If I check in BEFORE 2pm, it is a $60 early check in fee. If I check in AFTER 2pm, it is free\". So I decided to wait 2 minutes. I went to the front desk and asked the agent there if there were any bigger rooms available for upgrade and she let me know that there was, for a fee.\u00a0\u00a0(at this point it is 2:15pm-ish because the only agent at the desk was helping another group check in and she came up 15\u00a0mins later.) I stated that was fine. I asked if I could go ahead and check in. She said if i were to check in BEFORE 3pm, that it would be a $60 early check in fee. I pointed to the kiosks and said that if it was after 2pm, it should be free (because that is literally\u00a0what the self-serve kiosk stated). She stated \"well maybe you booked a different reservation style that lets you check in early, i don't know\". I BOOKED DIRECTLY THROUGH THE YOTEL WEBSITE. So i just took my debit card and ID, and checked in from the Kiosk without a fee.\u00a0\nHow does the front desk agent not know how the kiosk works? or not even attempting to rectify the situation by AT LEAST verifying if i'm correct and checking the kiosk herself?\u00a0\nI am highly disappointed in the customer service of this establishment and will never stay again.

That's right. Upon arrival we got our room from the automated front desk (I like that, since being a millennial, I hate to deal with people for this tasks. Got up to the tiny room (also, no problem with that, love that from NYC - missing the Hudson hotel :\/). Suddenly I start to notice: The bed can't convert into a sofa, so is extended 8a feature I was expecting to use in the room, since I was going to stay for10 days). I though, \"well that's ok, ill use the common areas featured in the webpage, ill try that later\". Then I notice that que curtains that separate the bathroom from the room are non existent, all of the furniture have bad wear, the TV mount is missing a part, so all cables are exposed, the \"use to be\" a screen in the mirror is no more and the sink is clogged. So I decided to go do to found a person, which I did in a thing called \"mission control\". She was, what I thought rude, but I notice that she had a speech memorized. She was willing to switch my room, but instantly I notice that there was nothing she could do since the all the hotel is like that. I told her to send someone to check the room, which she did. A \"trying to be helpful\" guy came up, I was nice to him, since I understood they probably had to deal with each check in like this. So basically he told me the motor on the bed \"are broken since covid\", he unclogged the sink and that was it. I stay there, util I needed to put my valuables on the safe, and THE SAFE DID NOT WORK EITHER. So the maintenance guy, brought another safe and in 5 minutes he unscrews the old one, and put a new one. \n\nSo, since I was thirsty, I want to my floor for water and ice; you guess. No water and Ice, the machine is broken one EVEY FLOOR. There is just 2 working on the entire building. So  at night, I went to work to the \"public areas\" featured in the hotel webpage. Yeah, as you were thinking, I got lectured by this rude lady \"this is a private property, this terrace is not part of the hotel, so you need to go to your room and work there\" (here I did got mad, and try to book another hotel, with no luck). In my room I found out that the WIFI is useless, and the front desk (or Mission Control) won't help, they will tell you a number to call (the internet company, know, I know) and they will tell you \"there is a lot of guests using the wifi, ill try to reset it). As you may know, that will not help at all, so I decided to stop waisting my time, go to sleep and go to a we work the next day. \n\nWhile being there for 10 days 1 elevator was broken, the sky lobby was under construction (I hope maintaining it), the robot that guard your suitcase was broken, the hotel was dirty (elevator with trash), and my room had mold in the shower. \n\nIn 2022 I do not recommend Yotel, the once shiny and modern tower hotel.

They seemed pompous for just wearing a suit. The rooms are small, my bathroom toilet smelled terrible and the odor never went away.  Housekeeping opened my door while I even had a do not disturb sign along with calling front desk to not have housekeeping during my stay.  They also came to visit me an hour after I called front desk to not have housekeeping so I don't know what was communicated.  I did not get my final receipt from the hotel for both of my rooms I reserved and purchased. I was never asked if I wanted one during check-out. The check out person was named Jenny and she wouldn't help me with the other hotel final receipt bill for the other room since it was under my friends name but I paid for it along with leaving my credit card for incidentals for that room too so all I wanted to know is if I got billed for unnecessary charges. She told me for my friend to get the hotel receipt although I purchased the room under my credit card. Now I hope to not expect extra charges from both of these hotel rooms I purchased during my stay.  I wouldn't go back here again, the rooms are very small for two people along with your luggages so good luck with space.  You could hear people talking in the hallway so if you want peace and quiet, don't come here.  I had to call security twice for the people making noise in the hallway.  The first time calling, they never answered the phone.  Also, good luck trying to call front desk or they call it \"mission control\" because they never answer the phone.

Now for bad: Biggest issue was the Yobot was not working, so that meant no baggage storage on the day of checkout (might be permanently broken as previous reviews mention the same thing). The only option was a link to a website called luggage hero, where you find another place to store your baggage and pay by the piece and hour. So now you have to carry\/wheel your luggage throughout NYC to a place to store it, if you plan on spending the day in the city after checking out. This to me is a major inconvenience and one of the reasons I will not stay here again. There were also some minor annoyances. The elevator in the parking garage right next to the hotel was broken (again might be permanently broken as previous reviews mention the same thing). I know it's not the Yotel's fault, but not fun to have to carry\/wheel your luggage uphill on the winding driveway into the garage. If you use the self service kiosk for check-in, they have blank hotel keys that you hold up to a device to program for your room. Several of the kiosks were empty, so had to grab some from another one. Then we had issues with our room key working in one specific elevator, where it would not let us select our floor.

Also, the staff was nice and gave us a late check out when he needed to nap.\n\nBut the good didn't outweigh the many disappointing things about this property. First, there is no food service that opens before 7am. I know some young children sleep in but not mine \u2014 nor do I frankly \u2014 and 7am is much too late for breakfast on any day except Sunday, and at a hotel in the middle of Midtown. Second, what food service there was was completely not geared towards families. There was no children's menu at the restaurant, nor staples like mac n cheese or chicken tenders. I get that children are not their primary audience but to not even have the option was very disappointing.\n\nAlso, the room was, how to put this, well worn. It was clean and appointed perfectly adequately but that was about it. Also, the rooms lack either a fridge \u2014 would have been great for breakfast before 7am \u2014 or a kettle in the rooms?\n\nI won't be staying at the Yotel again, with or without my son.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

We\u2019ve even introduced multiple friends to its location and fun atmosphere. However, after this last day we will not be returning.\n   It was my birthday weekend and to make it special my husband booked the VIP suite for its amenities such as large private patio with furniture and hot tub.\nWe had checked in and unpacked and everything in the room seemed fine. There was significant fire damage to one of the large planters outside and many of the plants used for privacy we\u2019re missing. The patio furniture was missing its cushions,  but we figured we could call the front desk and inquire later that day.\n   That first night upon returning from dinner around 10 PM we entered our room and turned on the lights and all they did was strobe on and off continuously. This happened in the bathroom, bedroom and main seating area. We called down to the front desk and they sent someone right up. The maintenance person said it would take about 20 minutes so we went downstairs to have a cocktail at the bar. \n   Returning about a half hour later the maintenance person said he was unable to fix the issue. He had turned off the electricity to the lights but we could still use any of the outlets or they could move us to a different room. He said they could most likely fix this in the morning, so we figured we\u2019re going to bed anyway, we don\u2019t need the lights and we would wait and keep the room.\n   The next day I checked in with the front desk to see if there was an ETA for the maintenance crew and the front desk knew nothing of the issue. Again, they said they would send someone up to take care of it. We went about our day and when we got back they were still working on the light issue but for the most part had fixed it. Excellent!\n   Knowing that we would be using the hot tub that day and sitting on the patio furniture I decided to fill the hot tub and we checked with the front desk about cushions for the patio furniture. They said they no longer had the cushions. What? Excuse me? Why still have the furniture there if it can\u2019t be used.\n   Once the hot tub was filled I followed the directions to turn on the jets and they did not start. Once again, we checked in with the front desk and they told us that they had turned the hot tubs off at the beginning of the month. We were quite disgruntled considering we had purposely booked the room because it advertised hot tubs from May through September. No one had told us we could not use the hot tub when we checked and the room was still at its full rate. How can you advertise it amenities and charge for them but not have them available.\n   And the final straw for us was during our last night when around midnight we were awoken by knocking on the door. There was a front desk person and a large security person asking if they could come into the room. After my husband had a chance to put on clothing we let them in and they said that they thought we had checked out earlier in the day and didn\u2019t know why we were there. \"Nope. We leave tomorrow.\" They turned around and left with no apology for waking us.\n   Upon checking out there was no inquiry to our stay and no apology for any of the disruptions or lacking amenities and no offering of a discount. What has happened to customer service in the post-Covid era. As stated, we will never return to Yotel NYC.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The reception is not efficient for check in, the temperature is always freezing in the whole hotel (with no option to regulate the temperature in the room), and if you try to call \nthe reception from the room, with luck they will pick the call with 5 minutes waiting. \n\nThe bathroom of the room is absurd, you can't even close the door, so if you are not alone in the room, you can forget privacy, and all sounds and smell will be felt in the whole room.\n\nPart of the staff is rude. One day at 8h30 one \"engineer\" (as he called himself) strongly knocked at the door to check if we had some leak in the room (???), saying it with an agressive attitude, without introducing himself. I had to ask if he was an employee, but he did not even say his name or apologizing for knocking at that hour. \n\nThe hotel says they have self check in and the \"yobot\" for the luggage store, but both machines didnt work ever... people from the reception had to intervene.\n\nIn the check out date, at 10h the luggage storage was full... so honestly i suspect the capacity of the storage is not very good...\n\nThe bar has a nice terrace, but for 2 beers we paid 30 dollars...\n\nIn summary, i dont recommend staying at this hotel. There are better alternatives that are not so much more expensive.\n\nTo end, this hotel is rated with 4 stars. How can this be???

I was told there was nothing they could do to help except to have me request an authorization directly from my bank. And not just my bank, a personal banker. This seemed VERY SCAMMY. I ended up cancelling my reservation and leaving.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

No; it is a heavy surcharge.\nAfter paying it, you are not exempt from paying tips either: the bar\/restaurant personnel and the housekeepers\/cleaners still expect those to come from you.\nNor does it allow you making use of regular, completely basic, hotel items like a kettle to boil water in your room: no way of getting one. I found this extremely disappointing and even indecent.\nIt seems that the facility fee offers discounts in some shops and stores in the surroundings, but we were not informed about this either. Moreover, this is no reason to charge a facility fee in a mandatory fashion. If customers want to enjoy this kind of benefits, it should be optional. Just like some will buy a City Pass and others don\u2019t.\nAs for our room and the location \/ neatness of the hotel. This was all well \/ as expected. And that\u2019s just how it should be: \u201cwhat you see is what you get.\u201d\nUnfortunately, with the facility fee it is totally the opposite: it\u2019s a bad practice in every way that you look at it.\nIf you want a no-frills hotel in a well-connected area, Yotel is certainly a recommendable option.

I was relieved to that everything worked as it should!  The smart bed is a great feature and soooo comfortable!  I loved the lighting behind the TV.   The waterfall shower was amazing! I had a room with a 'river view' which was the least expensive and I was blown away by the lit up buildings at night - it was everything I wanted coming from the UK!  The room IS small, but I suppose it depends on what you are used to.  I'm used to small budget Travelodge rooms in the UK, so this is like a high end, luxury version of that for me!   Rooftop terrace was lovely. I stayed during the week, so I can't speak for the weekend, but I found it quiet almost everytime I went to it and always plenty of places to sit and enjoy a meal or coffee to start the day.  The only disappointment for me was the  lack of coffee making facilities in the room.  I had to go down and buy one on the 4th floor by the rooftop terrace, which was a pain, because I tend to drink my first coffee of the day in my pyjamas to wake up and THEN get showered, dressed etc!  The location was perfect - five minute walk to the subway and just a little further along is Times Square.

But, Jared from engineering came to our room and had it fixed within 30 minutes. The lightbulb had blown and he replaced it promptly. He was very nice and fixed the issue gladly. The mission control staff was very friendly and prompt as well they made sure everything was taken care of. The only downsides we found came from the room design itself. The bathroom was more of an open concept than I think most are used to. There is no actual wall between the shower or toilet and the rest of the room so sharing the room with someone could be a little bit awkward. One thing We didn\u2019t know when booking is that Yotels seem to be independently owned and operated so some of the standard things you will see from yotel do not apply to each location. For example asking the yotel chat bot about late checkout will give you a different answer than mission control on location. So it would be best to just ask mission control at the location rather than yotel. \n\nThere is no way to give multiple ratings so I can leave this here\nStaff 5\/5\nCleanliness 4\/5\nLocation 3.5\/5\nAmenities 3.5\/5\nValue 4\/5\n\nOverall the hotel and stay was very good they had exceptional staff and were very friendly.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They said it\u2019s because their little luggage robot thingy is broken (it\u2019s been broken more than a year) and they say they have no way to store it.  I am not sure why a closet isn\u2019t an option\u2026 but.  So your options are you can pay $59 for early check in or late check out, you can sit with your luggage (but there isn\u2019t much seating because for most of seats and the lovely patio you have to buy something from their restaurant) or \u2014 they have a QR code for independent places that will store your luggage for a charge.  The closet place is across the street and $2 an hour excluding tip.  So budget extra $$ depending on how long you leave your bags.  (on their web page \u2014under the description of their amazing luggage robot \u2014 it says their robot isn\u2019t working but if you book third party or don\u2019t read about the robot you wouldn\u2019t know and other places on the website it lists bag storage as a service) Additionally \u2014 they have a $40 resort fee. This is not uncommon in NY but it usually comes with some small benefits.  Their benefits are things like discounts on squash lessons and eye glasses (who comes to NY to get glasses?!).  I am not sure why the resort fee instead isn\u2019t a discount to the off site luggage storage or their restaurant\u2014 which would actually be useful. \nService was not professional.  Guy monitoring check in kiosks had no idea what is going on.  The front desk person repeatedly called me \u201clove\u201d and the manager called me \u201cdear\u201d. This is not an appropriate way to refer to an adult and not professional.  They had looked at my reservation so I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just use my name.   \nThe rooms are fine (that\u2019s why the 2 stars).  Small \u2014 but that\u2019s to be expected for NY.  But it\u2019s a 4 star hotel with 2 star service.  Basically they don\u2019t seem to be playing the long game.  They would rather use shrink-flation than have repeat customers.  Heed the reviews.   They have a low rating for a reason.  I stay in NY a lot.

When I Yotel was offered up as some sort of special promotion on one of the booking sites, I jumped on the price and location since previous reviews were very positive.  Check in was done at a kiosk.  The process was relatively intuitive, and next time I'm sure I will be able to move through it a bit more quickly.  I was really plased with the \"cabin\".  It is, indeed, very much the size and configuration of a cruise ship cabin.  Everything you need, and nothing you don't.  (Although a coffee maker would be nice.)  The bed is electrically operated to move from a recliner to the sleeping configuration.  The room was perfectly clean, and everything worked.  Unless you need to spend a lot of time in your hotel room, this is a great place to stay in the city.  I didn't get a chance to enjoy the terrace or the restaurant, but both looked very inviting.  My only complaint is that the mattress was crushed where people tend to sit, and I kept rolling into the divot all night.  Highly recommended and I'll be back.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I had asked a staff member when I had arrived (with my bags I had to store) at 10am, if check-in  would be possible at 3pm as advertised, and they confirmed yes.   It was not true.

(Also, Ice machine on level appeared permanently out of service, and no indicator on it of where to go to get ice).  \n\nThe in room netflix\/streaming link did not work, so TV only had basic cable and the room guide channels were just an ad that would loop.  \n\nWe were given an ADA (handicap retrofitted room) and the bathroom is poorly converted so bathroom floor was always wet from the shower due to poorly designed floor dividers, and the bathroom door did not close properly. \n\nIt was way too expensive for the many little things wrong that seemed to be left that way for some time.   It also isn\u2019t very close to Times Square- its title-  on foot- being more that two blocks westerly. it is closer to the hudson river\/hudson yards.

Check in was slow as their autonomous system was down and only one person manning the front desk.

This is an unacceptable option, the least the hotel can offer is to pay for the storage fee since their service is inoperable. We booked a total of three separate rooms because these are micro units. You can become claustrophobic if there\u2019s more than one person in the room since there\u2019s no where to stand unless you had the smart bed in a seated position. There\u2019s also no fridge or closet. The shower & toilet is also frosted glass so it\u2019s difficult to share the room unless you\u2019re very comfortable with your travel partner. What use to be modern has been worn down and an update is badly needed. The glass door did not shut so water leaked each time the shower was used.

You need to access two separate elevators to reach your room. The view wasn\u2019t bad and the windows do open for ventilation.

Eles indicam um aplicativo que \u00e9 pago por hora\/bagagem, onde voc\u00ea deixa suas malas em estabelecimentos \u201cvolunt\u00e1rios\u201d como restaurantes, lojas e mercearias. Ou seja, te for\u00e7am a ou ficar com sua mala ou confiar em um aplicativo e terceira pessoa para guard\u00e1-la em seguran\u00e7a. No que fomos questionar se n\u00e3o haveria nenhuma possibilidade de guardar as malas eles nos deram 2h a mais para o Check Out (que ainda n\u00e3o seria suficiente para o tempo que ainda t\u00ednhamos na cidade). Tentamos conversar com a gerente Jenny e ela n\u00e3o s\u00f3 n\u00e3o foi nenhum pouco amig\u00e1vel, como tamb\u00e9m usou essas duas horas de \u201clate Check out\u201d como um cala-boca. Insinuando que o hotel j\u00e1 estava fazendo mais do que a obriga\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00f3s que est\u00e1vamos errados de querer um servi\u00e7o que \u00e9 comum em acomoda\u00e7\u00f5es do mundo inteiro. Durante a hora de Check In e Check Out era poss\u00edvel ver diversos h\u00f3spedes largados com suas bagagens pelas \u00e1reas comuns do hotel por n\u00e3o terem onde deixar suas malas. Afinal, a regra de n\u00e3o armazenamento de bagagem tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 v\u00e1lida para os h\u00f3spedes que chegam antes de ter seu quarto pronto. Entendo que o servi\u00e7o do rob\u00f4 pode estar fora de funcionamento (no entanto, ao que a recepcionista deu a entender n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo pontual e tempor\u00e1rio, visto que desde pelo menos janeiro ele n\u00e3o funciona), no entanto \u00e9 completamente SURREAL que o hotel n\u00e3o tenha nenhuma solu\u00e7\u00e3o para dar essa comodidade ao cliente. Novamente: o servi\u00e7o de armazenamento de bagagem \u00e9 uma pr\u00e1tica comum no mundo inteiro e \u00e9 completamente improv\u00e1vel que um hotel que se faz com a imagem de \u201csuper moderno\u201d n\u00e3o tenha.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":2079052,"title":"Disappointing stay @ the NYC Yotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-04-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I stayed in the London Yotel last summer and absolutely loved it so I specifically wanted to stay at the NYC location. Though I appreciated the early check in at 2:15pm, I found the rest of my stay ranging from underwhelming to disappointing. Upon arriving, I found the room was worn and dingy with scuff marks, tape residue, cracked grout and torn vinyl around the bed frame. The bedsheets and towels were clean so I decided to ignore the rest since we were only there one night and figured such issues would be present in the other rooms as well since this is not a newer property. This morning as we were preparing to check out, I was doing a final check of the room to make sure I didn\u2019t leave anything behind when I dropped my phone on the floor. Bending down to pick it up, I saw a pile of trash under the bed presumably from a previous guest (bottle cap and fork were visible, but I didn\u2019t look closer than that). Again I decided to not complain because we were checking out anyway and if they are thoroughly cleaning the rooms they should easily find it on their own. After check out, I asked to store my backpack as we planned to explore the city more for my birthday and go to a nice brunch where I didn\u2019t want to bring in my travel bag. I was told that the property didnt offer storage and was referred to an external third party app that provided other storage options at an additional cost outside of the property. At booking, it did mention that the fancy robot that normally stores luggage was out of commission but not that the hotel didn\u2019t offer luggage storage at all. This is not usually a speciality service as even the cheapest hostels will hold your luggage for you so you would think that they would have figured out a way to accommodate luggage storage at their hotel while the robot gets fixed. Had I know this, I would have booked elsewhere. I wish I chose better for my birthday trip and am now hesitant to stay with Yotel moving forward due to this wild inconsistency between properties.

Clearly designed with a futuristic theme from 1970s movies like Logan's run and Star Trek the motion picture, but chipped corners and peeling veneer revealed a cheaply built room that lacked most basic amenities.  Chromecast for the TV didn't work, there was no TV but local channels, so if you didn't have a device to watch things or listen to music on you were  out of luck. There was no clock  The pillows were small and lumpy and they took dirty towels but didn't replace them. I attempted to call the front desk but the phone didn't work. Every time I talked to the front desk in person they said they'd send someone right up and they never did. There was no in-room coffee and the vending machine in the lobby didn't work. They had a cafe but the line and the mornings took 10 to 20 minutes just to get beverages. \n\nOverall I've stayed in similarly priced hotels that had much better amenities, coffee in the room TVs that work, etc., And being worn down in New York is expected but not when you're in a future istic hotel that brands itself as a boutique stay. \n\nFortunately the location makes up for a lot, but there's a lot of hotels at this location. I'll be staying at one of them next time. ","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The guy says we must check-in (an extra $50) and if we can\u2019t check-in early, then they will take our bag. The lobby is shockingly full of people trying to navigate the kiosk (all still interacting with the reception and greeter - so \u201cnot having one\u201d is proven to be pointless) and also being \u201cforced\u201d into checking in early. \nAt this point it feels more like the \u201cmachine not working\u201d is more of a ploy to pull more dollars out of its guests. \n\nI pay and we go up to our room.
