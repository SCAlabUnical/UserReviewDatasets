Just slapped the cheapest paint on the walls and called it a hotel. \n- Shower flooded the bathroom with water bcs of how bad the design is and there is no way to avoid it\n- Toilet paper is worse and harder than Scott (I didn\u2019t know that was possible) \n- Hair dryer is  $20 hair dryer from CVS \n- Walls and ceilings are falling apart. \n- LOUD! You hear everything from your neighbors and hallway. I was down the hall from elevator but heard the bell every time. \n- AC is loud and rattles and bcs rooms are so small it blows right on top of you\n- plastic cups in the bathroom. At a 5* hotel! Plastic wrapped in plastic! Like you get at a cheap airport hotel!\n- If you order food to your room and ask for fork and knife they bring you plastic utensils!  \n- No coffee maker or tea kettle in room. \n- NO mini fridge\n- The rooms even deluxe and suits are TINY with no view and the smallest window imaginable and window doesn\u2019t open. \n- not enough umbrellas for people if it rains\n-packed tiny lobby with people makes it impossible to actually get to the desk if you need help. \n- the ceiling where the curtains are isn\u2019t filled in. There\u2019s no ceiling it\u2019s the inner part of the stone of the building with dust and dirt and who knows what else in it. So gross. \n\nI don\u2019t understand what about this hotel is hip besides maybe the location? \n\nThe one plus is they use grown alchemist soaps but that isn\u2019t enough to do this hotel any justice.

The hotel bills itself a five star property, which it is most definitely not. Having stayed in many NYC hotels over the years, this is a nice, but unremarkable spot in the mold of many other boutique properties that have come and gone over a three to five year cycle, that will work for the right guest but actually could be great if only the management and staff wanted it to be. Service is unenthusiastic and without the five star polish you\u2019d want for premium pricing. Dining is serviceable but not great, though the library workspace is a nice setup for travelers, especially since it will be hard to work from your room with such tight quarters. The hotel does not have a gym onsite which is a huge, and curious miss for a Marriott managed property of this size and profile. Overall I would give four stars, except for the lack of a gym, which knocks it down to three, and is such a foolish miss making it hard to envision personally booking there again until that changes. But I would happily recommend this hotel for single travelers who do not need many services, provided the rates are reasonable at the time and the guest had business or leisure plans in SOHO, NOLITA, or TRIBECA.

Before entering in the room on the floor in front of the door and all along the hallway there was a cable covered by tape and some different Wi-Fi router, maybe a sudden problem solved as possible (but 11H is a five stars hotel not a motel). When we entered in the room we found a sorprese in the bathroom. It was used, with some paper in the wc and a terrible smell of marijuana. We called the reception to solve the problem and after a quarter we received the visit of an housekeeper who asked again about the problem and then cleaned the bathroom. Before she gone my husband asked kindly to have a bottle of water and chocolate (usually complementary in this hotel) and the housekeeper with a derisive laugh said \u2018\u2026so you wanted chocolate\u2026\u2019 I don\u2019t know what upset me more,  if this bad situation or the housekeeper behavior. In any case I slept the last night in nyc wrapped in the smell of marijuana that I hate.  I don\u2019t think I will go back at 11 Howard. ","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I am big on customer service and their customer service here started off well.\nI called at 3am in the morning of my reservation date and spoke to KEVIN, whom offered a warm and welcoming energy in the wee hours of the morning. That was a pleasant beginning. I explained to him I was celebrating my husband's surprise birthday extravaganza and our hotel stay here started the journey that would lead to his surprise party on 8\/21 at the Giando on the Water and end with his surprise trip to Aruba, staying at the Aruba Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino ( You can see I love lodging with the Marriott domestic and international). I requested early check in for 12 noon in order to personalize the room, possible upgrade and asked for a complimentary birthday item from the hotel and KEVIN was eager to assist. He noted the account and agreed to inform the staff of the request approvals. THANKS KEVIN! As a platinum elite member, these little gestures of kindness not only awarded for the level but provided by the staff is what keeps me lodging with Bonvoy, along with superior customer service. My experience with Marriott has always included the accommodating gestures and to date, at 11 Howard, it continues to be the same thus far. So, my experience, because of KEVIN, is going great. I will keep you posted!\n\nUpdate 1: My journey with 11 Howard Hotel Designs continues to be awesome! So, after following the instruction of KEVIN to give the hotel a call after 9am, I encountered MICHAEL. I guess they may be identical twins, lol, because MICHAEL was just as accommodating as KEVIN with a splash of \"follow up\". After speaking to MICHAEL, not only was the notes Kevin left in the system but MICHAEL made sure to apply the touch of surprise I really needed to make the surprise birthday extravaganza a \"hit\"! I was officially granted the upgraded room,the top floor and the complimentary birthday amenity sent to the room. MICHAEL called me back to make sure to inform me everything was taken care and to double check details for a perfect setup. Has your Hotel done that?? Lol....\nSo far, my journey is flowing in excellence...Thank you MICHAEL!!!\n\nUpdate 2: I must add another member to the great service, JONATHAN.

It sound like the air conditioner was landing planes and the toilet refilling sound like it was a water hydrant after the water spout was busted. Not to mention, the shower water was not draining properly so it was filling up over my feet, DISGUSTING!! Needless to say, I was moved to ROOM 1115. This room was just as small and had no logically accessible outlets. However, it had an extension cord for guest usage? Not for $400+ a night!!! The staff tried to accommodate me with a bottle of white wine and seltzer water, although nice, definitely not a compensation for a $2000+ stay.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Unlike what many other posters have mentioned above, I did not have a good experience at all. Clearly things have changed since they first opened in 2016.\n\nI arrived a few hours early for check in as I had a meeting moved up. I was told that they would wave the early check in fee for me this time..... My Queen room was apparently not ready yet, but the good news is they were going to give me an \"upgrade\" to a King sized bed room - what a joke. The room they assigned me on the 10th floor was the smallest room I have had in NYC (and I have had some small ones). You could not even walk around the bed it was so tight to the wall. The tiny desk was right below the TV and if you wanted to plug in your laptop to do any work, you had to unplug the TV as there were no other outlets ?? I noticed the floor map on the door and my room was 1\/2 the size (or smaller) than every other room on the floor.\n\nWent down to the reception and asked if I could just wait for my Queen room to be ready. They then agreed to move me to another room on the floor, which was a normal size, but had a King bed. I asked if they had my Titanium Elite number of file and was told they were a Design Hotel and Marriott status did not matter here - that is very clearly the case. Went to the new room and sat down on the bed only to hear a crack. Looked under the bed and 2 of the slats from the frame had come loose (one had duct tape which they had clearly used before to try and repair). I did not have the energy to go back down again and ask for a room without a broken bed. It turned out to be a poor judgement call on my part as the bed was not comfortable at all.\n\nUpon checking out I asked them what the $35 daily fee included, as they offered no complimentary breakfast options (just coffee). It included Wifi (which Bonvoy guests should get for free) + access to a UFC gym around the corner (for those looking to fight in the Octagon) and a $10 a day minibar credit (which was not mentioned at check in). Had I known, I would have used it on some bottled water (which also was not included in the room).\n\nTo add insult to injury, they charged me $9.00 for a Kit Kat bar that I did not have. Good thing I had that $10 a day credit to offset that one....\n\nCaveat Emptor.

We asked to be moved rooms. The new room on the other side of the floor was equally nice however the catering staff for the event were hanging outside our room the whole time chatting. I tried to drown out the noise with the TV but it was pointless. We complained on our way out but the front desk staff didn\u2019t seem to care. The following morning there were event staff removing furniture throughout the floor. The main areas of the hotel were also closed off due to a Netflix show being filmed.

The doors, the fixtures... everything is just not quite there. There's no room service at all, and when I called down for 2 water bottles they told me it would be $30. No coffee in the rooms, no bathrobes, and no gym either. The cleaning staff only ever cleaned half of my room (I would get back and I would either have new towels or my bed made, never both). Service is abysmal, I asked for 2 wake up calls which never happened. It's like, fine... not dirty and comfortable enough. But it's really more on the 3-star tier, which is why the price is sooo confusing to me. Weirdly they also have a private sauna company working out of the 3rd floor, who also take up the communal working spaces, and the bar\/nightclub is LOUD. I was woken up at least 5 times during the night by people slamming doors, and when I returned from dinner there were people puking outside of the hotel.

I went back this past week and stayed for four days, checking in on the day that COVID-19 was announced as a pandemic. Since my first visit, 11 Howard's service seems to have progressively gotten worse.\n\nThe Good:\n* A gentleman dressed like one of the porters (he didn't wear the 11 Howard sweatshirt or the all-navy suit) checked my fianc\u00e9 and me into the hotel. He was welcoming, clearly explained the benefits of our Amex benefits, and highlighted other hotel benefits like the complimentary water bottles.\n*  Housekeeping staff did a great job tidying our Howard Deluxe Room, especially because of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n* Room service delivery team was lovely every time we saw them (we ordered frequently as part of 'social distancing')\n\nEverything else:\n- I asked for a detailed breakdown of all of our food and beverage charges during our stay. Upon check-out, I was told that they couldn't do it at that time but would email me the information. I didn't get anything. After four days, I called the hotel to request the information again. They emailed me the folio but not the itemized receipts. I responded back to the email to ask for the correct information and didn't hear back. I sent a follow-up email the next day and still haven't heard back.\n- There were some questionable design choices made with our room. For example, the closet was in a small hallway that made it perfect for getting ready or ironing clothes. But I quickly realized that there were no outlet plugs in the hallway, and the only available outlet plugs were in a small cramped area by the bed. Also, the toilet was installed so close to the sink so that when washing your hands, the toilet seat was right behind your calves.

I called down after realizing that between the small room and no closets, loud party on the terrace two down from us, it wasn\u2019t going to work. I was told the Terrace bedrooms are much smaller than the other rooms.   Nothing else was available.   The non existent closet is half height so you cannot hang any coats, long pants, dresses, etc unless you want them wrinkled.  (See photo).  And on the upper half tiny closet they have the safe installed so no use for anything but stacking shoes.   We used the desk area for a dresser to stack clothes.  There is a small dresser with three 6\u201d drawers.   \nNo coffee Nespresso in the room so you have to get dressed to go for coffee.  Which disappears between 0930 and 10 on weekends.  Hey, this is NYC I\u2019m staying on west coast time so I don\u2019t know why coffee can\u2019t be there all day like other properties.  Bathroom has no counter space so plan on putting your makeup or hair supplies on the toilet seat as you get ready.    We used the app to order extra towels and wash clothes - got extra towels and toilet paper and Kleenex.  Not even sure how that got translated. Not a 3 star so thus my debate with the rating.  The rooms are danish modern and minimalist, but that should not mean minimum service and rooms.   Same complaint as others with breakfast - couldn\u2019t get service.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":10040329,"title":"Ottimo hotel a Soho","lang":"it","publishedDate":"2019-09-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel insieme alla mia compagna a fine settembre 2019. La camera era una Deluxe al decimo piano. Avevo precedentemente avvertito dell'arrivo in tarda serata per il check-in e Katherine (la direttrice) mi aveva assicurato che non si sarebbero stati problemi e cos\u00ec \u00e8 stato. L'addetto al check-in \u00e8 stato molto carino a consegnarci le chiavi ed a proporsi per recapitare i bagagli in camera.\nLa hall dell'hotel, di notte, ha delle luci soft molto suggestive che a mio parere ben si addicono allo stile moderno metropolitano della struttura. Negli ascensori e nel corridoio si respira un buonissimo odore, oltre che essere molto pulite. La camera, come detto una Deluxe al decimo piano, \u00e8 abbastanza grande con la parete esterna interamente finestrata. Letto king size grandissimo, forse un po' morbido per i miei gusti ma \u00e8 un aspetto assolutamente soggettivo (ad esempio la mia compagna ha gradito questo tipo di materasso). Il bagno \u00e8 molto grande, con una doccia veramente enorme e ben funzionante. Generalmente le rifiniture dell'hotel sono di buon livello, incluse rubinetterie ed accessori (che noto subito, deformazione professionale). Il tutto completato da un armadio (finalmente, a NY non \u00e8 facilissimo trovare camere con armadio chiuso) in cui sono inseriti frigo-bar, cassaforte, asse e ferro da stiro.\nContrariamente a quanto letto nelle recensioni precedenti, la camera \u00e8 sia pulita che silenziosa, per quanto possono essere silenziose le stanze a NY che, ricordo, \u00e8 la citt\u00e0 che non dorme mai (intendo dire che si sentono alcuni rumori esterni quali macchine che sfrecciano a 100 km\/h e truck della spazzatura ma onestamente dopo aver esplorato a piedi la citt\u00e0, non mi hanno certo disturbato il sonno).\nIl personale dell'hotel \u00e8 delizioso. I ragazzi della reception molto simpatici, pronti al saluto ed a scambiare due chiacchiere; il personale delle pulizie sempre presente ma svolge il suo lavoro con molta discrezione e non si fa notare (la nostra camera \u00e8 stata pulita e sistemata ogni giorno, compreso il cambio della biancheria giornaliera). Aggiungo che Katherine (che avevo contattato via mail prima della partenza) ci ha voluto incontrare una mattina per un caff\u00e8 per essere certa di aver esaudito tutte le mie richieste e per rendersi disponibile per ogni altra informazione sulla citt\u00e0, cosa che onestamente mi ha fatto molto piacere e non mi era mai successa.\nIl bar dell'hotel di notte si trasforma in club con musica e diversa (bella) gente che frequenta il locale (credo che sia una gestione esterna visto che le porte di comunicazione con l'hotel vengono chiuse e nascoste). Onestamente il volume della musica non mi \u00e8 mai sembrato troppo alto tale da disturbare il sonno ma capisco che tra il club e la nostra camera c'erano sette livelli di differenza, magari le camere al terzo piano possono essere un po' pi\u00f9 rumorose.\nDurante tutto il soggiorno i ragazzi della reception ci hanno offerto ad ogni ora le bottigliette di acqua (gratis) che, per la cronaca, sono personalizzate con logo e foto dell'hotel, un altro particolare interessante (magari inutile ma comunque bella idea).\nAl termine del nostro soggiorno, in considerazione che il volo di ritorno sarebbe stato nella tarda serata, ho chiesto se sarebbe stato possibile (pagando) depositare i bagagli e magari utilizzare il bagno di servizio per una rinfrescata. Eccoci accontentati: late check-out (ore 16:00) e deposito bagagli (un paio d'ore) gratuiti. Che dire, questi sono i particolari che fanno la differenza (specifico che due anni fa in altro hotel a NY una cosa simile mi cost\u00f2 sui 40 dollari circa).\nIn conclusione, 11 Howard Hotel ci ha conquistato e siamo usciti completamente soddisfatti da questa esperienza. Un \"GRAZIE\" a tutto lo staff.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

You walk into the breakfast lounge and it\u2019s not obvious at all that this is where breakfast is served, nobody comes up to assist you and help you with that lost look on your face thinking \u2018am I in the right place\u2019! It\u2019s just a coffee lounge with 2 large tables, a sofa and a few small low coffee tables. There was a girl on a reception desk who not once smiled and asked if she could help us. When you finally work out you are in the right place you will find complimentary tea and coffee making facilities which are supposed to be provided until 10.30am every morning however each morning we got earlier and the free drinks were removed earlier also until after 4 days there were none at all at 8.30am! You order your food from a small menu (which is not cheap if you don\u2019t have breakfast included in your room rate). The food was very good to be fair however we only got to sit at a proper table once out of 7 days ..we had it on our lap on a sofa for the other 6 which I don\u2019t think is acceptable for the price we paid!!\n So this is the reason that none of our party of 12 would stay here again ..we felt that the breakfast set up and the size of the rooms were not value for the amount per night we paid. 2 of our party moved to another hotel nearby for the last 2 days at half the price which they said was a lot better. So this is the reason I have only given 3 stars for this hotel. \nOther details:\nTIP...I asked for a room on a high floor to avoid noise from the disco after reading a previous trip advisor review ....and it worked, we were on floor 11 and heard no hotel noise...only the outside traffic noise which is expected in NY. \n\nTaxi from JFK in a \u2018yellow cab\u2019 is a flat rate of $52, however I flew back from EWR which is not a flat rate and cost me $89 in the quiet period and took me just over an hour at 2pm on a Friday.

Starting from the fact that we were allowed to check in about an hour earlier, to the great location (SoHo, Little Italy, Tribeca, Chinatown are more or less are all equidistant), the location that yet feels somewhat discreet, with the entrance on a small quiet Howard St, to the very efficient and friendly staff, to the cool, minimalistic design, all of the above result in a relaxed and hustle-free stay, and make one want to come back again. \nThe reception desk per se, in its classical sense, is not available. Instead, once in the lobby, head to a big round table, always manned by the hotel's staff. Using a docked tablet, the staff handles your check-in, check-out and answers to all your other questions or needs. \nTo use one of the three elevators (more than enough), you will have to place your room key card on the black pad, beneath the floor keys. \nThe WiFi (complimentary) was good, no issues. As with most hotels, you will have to type in your last name and your room number. \nOur Deluxe King room was of a nice size, and even though it wasn't particularly spacious (248 sq ft), it included a separate sitting area. A 48-inch flat-screen TV didn't, unfortunately, have a built-in Google Chromecast. \nThe sleep comfort and the soundproofing were both great, even considering that our room was right opposite the elevators. \nThe USB ports on the night tables are in the docking devices, very useful to charge your cell phones, still having them by your immediate side.  \nThe room features KEYPR, a convenient technology with in-room tablet for ordering hotel services, in-room dining, etc. A propos, the in-room dining offers several choices, including a few satisfying 24 hrs a day options for the night revellers. The prices are quite budget-friendly for a hotel. \nThe multiple choices minibar (the locations of which are the fridge inside the closet and the drawers beneath the TV), the roomy closet, the umbrellas in the hotel's lobby, the unlimited free bottles of water, the doormen constantly present and doing their job right  are all great additions contributing to our high ranking of 11 Howard.     \nThe bathroom is very spacious, with both the sink and the shower featuring golden-tone lavish furnishings. The bathroom toiletries are by Grown Alchemist, one of Australia's biggest skincare exports. Be careful when using the sink, it's designed in an awkward way with lots of unintentional splashing.  \nThe view to Howard St and part of Lafayette from our 5th floor wasn't \"all that\", so make sure you request a room facing Lafayette St, if available. \nThe 3rd floor fitness center is your typical hotel mini gym, with scarce options, however, showing your hotel key would get you a free guest pass at the nearby UFC Gym, at 277 Canal St, on the corner of Canal and Broadway, about 2 minutes' walk; it is a full scale gym with all necessary equipment. \nThe dining includes The Library (accessible via the spiral staircase to the left of the entrance), which is open for breakfast and also offers all day menu (until 10 PM). We, however, didn't get there and don't have any pertinent information for you, neither have we stopped by The Blond, a lounge and a club accessible via the same spiral staircase. The Blond also features its own entrance on Howard St, thus eliminating too many contacts, if any, with the merrymakers heading to and from. \nLe Coucou, located on Lafayette St, right around the corner, is a different story. It is a proud recipient of a 2019 Michelin star, and serves excellent French cuisine, perfectly prepared and served. We have been to Le Coucou three times already, and can't recommend the place high enough. Please refer to our dedicated reviews of the establishment.\n11 Howard had great choices for wellness seekers. Just Ageless is a non-invasive skin care and body contouring studio and HigherDOSE is an infrared spa dedicated to \"getting you hot and high\".\nWe parked at Park-It, an open but attended parking lot at 395 Broome St., 5 minutes' walk ($48 for a 24 hrs period); the other option would be City Parking at 40 Mercer St, with the same walking distance of 5 minutes.\nHighly recommended.

I also reached out in advance of our stay to ask a couple questions about the room types and request assistance with reservations and received prompt and helpful responses. We had no issues with housekeeping as some other reviews mentioned, and our room was on the 14th floor so no issues with street noise or noise from the bar (but did hear some hallway noise, which I expect in most any hotel...). Location was great and I would stay here again. The only two suggestions I have relate to the facility fee. I knew in advance about the fee and inclusion of $10 daily mini bar credit, so while I find it odd it wasn't unexpected. No problem, I'll force myself to take something out of the mini bar each day. However, if you are going to call it a \"daily\" fee then you probably should check the mini bar daily and apply what's taken towards the credit -- if you only check the last day and attribute all the items to that day then obviously it will exceed the $10 limit. Alternatively, just call it a $30 credit for a 3-day stay and allow guests to decide if they want one more expensive item or several less expensive items and then just check it at the end of the stay... My other comment is regarding the coffee and tea available in The Library that is also part of the facility fee. Why not offer that all day? It can't be that difficult to keep that out. At the least the hours should be extended. We came down at 9:05 on Monday and were told that the coffee\/tea self-service ends at 9:00. I think it lasts until 10:00 on weekends, but in either case I think that's fairly early to end that, particularly when you are charging for it in the mandatory facility fee. In no way are either of these things dealbreakers, but both seem like relatively easy adjustments that would be nice for guests.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The food was good but on this trip didn\u2019t manage to go to restaurant which is highly rated.\n\nMy reason for knocking a star off was the facility fee.  I have only encountered this in Miami before but it seems to have spread.  To be honest I expect in my hotel rate - tea and coffee making facilities or similar.  I expect WiFi and I didn\u2019t really want a $10 a day credit for the mini bar.  I expect when I book a hotel to use their facilities and everywhere else I go that\u2019s what I get.  America seems to be going the way of a budget airline.

Tons of light from the windows and a creative table setting for the room that worked out to be really handy. The bathrooms are hug and the toiletries are high end.

There's unlimited high quality coffee from 7:00 am to 9:00 in the very odd minimalist restaurant that turns into a club \/ bar at night. What I didn't like: the hallways are DARK, like ridiculously dark ALL DAY long - as well as the elevators... to the point that you have to turn on your phone light to find the number for your floor. The lobby set up is this bizarre, low table \"conceptual lobby\" scenario I guess. While the staff were outstanding and responsive to all needs, it felt really awkward to see all these men and women constantly having to hunch down to table level to read the single pad screen. I understand that the hotel is catering to more of a high end party crowd in the evenings, but the eye strain in this place is crazy.

This is my first review because I really wanted to love this hotel and hope they can turn around these issues.\n\n1.Its very difficult to get the front counter\/ concierge to answer the phone. Expect to wait on hold for a few minutes each time.\n\n2. Bottled\/ Filtered water is provided in the lobby only, not the rooms. There is no coffee\/ tea facilities in the room either. We once rang down to reception (waited for them to answer) and requested 2 bottles of the complimentary water be bought up because we were in our PJ's and were told we would be charged for this service. We went down in our PJ's to get the water. The man at reception had someone phone to apologise and they said they would make sure water was put in our room each day. This never happen. Its a small thing but it would have gone a long way.\n\n2. The Wine List belongs at the Burj Khalifa - The cheapest bottle on the room service menu is $60 but this one was sold out the entire time we were there. Next cheapest bottle of bubbles was $110. There was no wine or champagne in the room mini bar which brings me to my next comment.\n\n3. There is a $30 a day 'service charge' which covers the internet, phone calls, $10 mini bar credit and a discount on a steam room that was booked out the every time we tried for an appointment. So basically for me, and I'm sure many others, you are charging me $30 to get a $10 mini bar credit for items (that conveniently doesn't include wine). It just doesn't feel right to force someone to buy mini bar items daily. I've never had that in any hotel I've ever stayed in. It felt as though this fee was a farce. \n\n4. Similar of many NY hotels - the rooms are very small (though beautifully decorated) with bed corners that stick out - expect to knock your shins multiple times. \n\n5. House Keeping was basic - as many other people mention they just make the bed and don't take away the trash. We had to put ours in the hallway to get collected.  Face washers were taken but not replaced. At US$520 a night for a small twin room this is inexcusable. \n\nMost of these issues are service based and could so easily be fixed making this an amazing hotel in an awesome location. The price per night was not cheap so these small things should be expected.

Hard to tell who works there and who doesn't when it's crowded but got to know a few familiar faces. They ended up being pretty friendly.\n\nAs for the room - small but super nice and comfy. Pillows were my favorite part. Bed was great, too. Also liked the room darkening shades. It was weird having the refrigerator in the closet though. Wish it wasn't there so I could have had more room to hang a couple of the longer dresses I brought. The hallways were unnecessarily dark, but I guess that goes with the \"hip\" vibe of the hotel. \n\nThe hotel is in a very good area near Chinatown, Little Italy and good shopping on Broadway. Very safe and about a block away from a train stop. There's a couple coffee shops nearby, too. :)\n\nThe Library is a nice place to hang for a change of scenery. Didn't do the club or dined there but does tend to draw a huge crowd during the late night on weekends. \n\nMy only two complaints: 1) not enough toilet paper in the room - when one roll went empty, there was a second available but would have been nice to just have an extra roll placed in the room by the cleaning service so there's always two rolls. 2) Even though there's three elevators, they all move at the speed of a turtle.

We have stayed at many NYC hotels, as we come in 4-6 weekends a year for overnights. These have included five stars like ThePeninsula, the Westhouse, the Giles, four star like the Westin, and even the three star Holiday Inn on occasion  to save money.  How 11 Howard is billed as a five star boutique is beyond me.  First, nearly every person with the exception of Jonathon, the valet, carried themselves with an air of attempting to be professional, while in actuality being annoyed, inconvenienced, or simply disinterested.  \n      The check in \u201cdesk\u201d is a round table with two phones\/tablets that face each other.  The entire lobby essentially stands around wondering where to go to check in.   You can\u2019t make a line around a circular desk- it doesn\u2019t work.\n      When we were there the tablets were down, so a gentlemen came and asked me for my license and credit card and disappeared for almost 10 minutes.  Because the staff does not wear any uniforms of any kind, I even started wondering if some random person had just taken my credentials!\n     Our room ended up being a king, instead of two doubles.  When I called to ask about the error, I was disconnected three times.\n      No one even tells you that you can order concktakls in their lounge and the waiter almost never appears to take your order anyway!\n     Lastly the room was ridiculous for five star- so tiny it was one full step for main bedroom to bathroom.

The stay itself was worth a 5 star + rating. The rooms are good but what sets the hotel apart from others is the staff. Katherine Woods is phenominal and a true asset for the hotel and she really made the stay special for us. The people working on the front desk were great overall and very welcoming. I am a fan of the hotels decor, it's a very \"cool\" hotel with dark hallways that are contrasted by bright rooms with big windows. I'd be very likely to book with them again, almost guaranteed if it was just based on the experience we had there.\n\nNow for the bad. After having paid for our stay months in advance, the hotel by mistake billed us again for the whole stay when we were checking out. Since we stayed there between 1-8th of august it was a hefty charge to have extra on our card while on vacation. It also charged around 1000 dollars on our credit card  as an insurance, which is understandable but this charge should be dropped from the card soon after checkout. After reaching out to them they refunded the extra charge, and also said the insurance they charged would go off the card. That however hasn't happened and its almost 20 days since we checked out. My creditcard company needed a confirmation from 11 Howard to drop that charge manually but once asked for that, they stopped responding to emails about it which I find really unfortunate since this is quite an inconveniance for us.\n\nOverall great, recommend the hotel and the great staff but the aftermath has ruined the experience a bit.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Swedish minimalist pastel aesthetic is essential to a hotel with extremely small rooms (even for NYC).  The room was so small I could hardly move around without banging into things - a large person suffers here - a petite person might not mind as much.  I had only a small suitcase and it was just me but the space was extremely reduced.  The bathroom was almost impossible to use - I was constantly needing to step around to open or close the door in order to get in shower\/sit on toilet\/brush teeth.  With two people it would have been too much.  No counter space so hair dryer is hung on the back of the door (had to call to find it).  \n\nLocation is good but not perfect - a block from the versatile Canal street subway station and it felt a tad shady after dark.  It's not the heart of SoHo but not too far to get there walking - very close to Chinatown.  I found plenty of good places to eat nearby.

I am an early 30-something well-traveled, successful creative director who works primarily in hospitality branding, and who always chooses well-designed hotels. I recently stayed for 3 nights and found more cons than pros at 11 Howard. \n\nPros: \nPrime location. \n\nIt\u2019s a beautifully designed hotel. I\u2019m a huge appreciator of Danish\/Nordic interior and furniture design. I had no issue with the minimalist lobby\u2014I appreciated it. The materials and finish of rooms are nicely done; lighting design, showers, bathroom fixtures, etc.\u2014all beautiful. \n\nStaff was mostly accommodating and quick. \n\nCons: \nRooms are indeed tight. I booked a King Deluxe and the layout of the room I got looked nothing like the photos\u2014it was extremely tight (although the bathroom large), the walls were scuffed up in multiple places, and there was very little natural light. I asked to see another King Deluxe and spent the rest of my stay in a larger room with a very tight bathroom on a higher floor. \n\nWhile I appreciate the design of the lobby, the staff tends to hang outside the front door of the hotel chatting as there\u2019s no desk at which to situate themselves. As a result, you often have to go find them outside to ask for a bottled water. (Or was I supposed to go into the drawers and grab it myself? Different staff told me different things.)\n\nRoom service delivers every meal in excessive takeout packaging. There is an option to select \u201cplated\u201d on the tablet from which you order (the software is buggy, by the way; more on that below), but takeout is the default, and even when I did select plated, it didn\u2019t arrive that way. Three room service orders over three days, and I had a mound of bags and packaging piling up, which wasn\u2019t taken by the cleaning service (nor was the neatly arranged lineup of empty water bottles I\u2019d collected over a few days of staying here; it seems the cleaning service just makes your bed?). Not okay in a tight \u201cdeluxe\u201d room; the excessive packaging is certainly not \u201cconscious\u201d hospitality. Suggestions: make the room service default \u201cplated\u201d; put filled glass filtered-water carafes in every room that can be replaced as needed upon request; make sure cleaning service actually cleans up the room and disposes of garbage and recycling upon each visit. \n\nThe software on the tablets is buggy. One morning, I attempted to order breakfast service at 10:50 a.m. (breakfast stops at 11). For reasons unknown, the only menu option that displayed was the late-night menu; by the time I got the breakfast menu to display and attempted to place the order, it was 10:59 a.m. and the checkout screen would only allow for breakfast delivery the following morning. Cool\u2014I guess the all-day available pre-made A\u00e7a\u00ed bowl that comes served in an oversized flat plastic takeout container will suffice. \n\nAs other reviews have noted, the gym is very tight here and consists of two small attached former guest rooms on the third floor. It was fine for me\u2014nobody else was working out while I was there, but had they it would have been awkward; there was no soap in either of the bathrooms (disgusting); they have conical cups for the water dispenser, which means you can\u2019t reuse your cup; overall equipment is limited. \n\nHaving stayed at numerous design-focused hotels in New York within this category, I think 11 Howard has some homework to do. While spaces are indeed beautiful, I don\u2019t sip the casual, conscious hospitality Kool-aid. 11 Howard is pretty on the outside, but it lacks soul when it comes to the little \u201cconscious\u201d details that matter.

During my 5-day stay 11 Howard failed to live up to a basic standard I would consider the minimum for a five-star rating.  I have stayed in dozens of top NYC hotels and this was by far the worst of them, unless you count the separate restaurant Le Coucou, which is amazing.  \n\nWhy is it one of the worst?  Well, let's start with the fact the entire hotel shakes considerably every five minutes when subway trains come through.  Next up, let's look at the place.  It is missing a LOBBY for goodness sake.  All I found at any time in the entry way was a few kids dressed in street clothes only intermittently looking like staff.  The room serving as a lobby is missing any decor, and has a single table with no desk or chairs.  It left me wondering where I even was for 5 minutes after I first walked in and someone showed up after knocking on a back security office door.  \n\nThere is no valet either.  It took me 1 hour and 50 minutes to get my car from a service they hire out at one point, which was the last time I left my car with them.  They apologized and offered to comp it, but still no excuse for not having your own valet and calling yourself a five star hotel.  \n\nNow let's talk pets.  They allow them.  A dog was barking loudly and continuously in between subway trains in the room next door while the hotel staff could not reach the owner, who had no doubt left.  \n\nSo all in all, I'd say the concierge, valet, rooms, service, view and decor here are sub-par for the area, and the lobby situation just bizarre.  I did not find issue with the food or restaurant, but I'm sure some will find the downstairs dance club to be too loud on weekends as well.  The house was definitely bumping.

For most people this place will be overpriced for what you get, but if that's your thing then you'll love this place. It's actually fascinating as the entire system seems to be rigged like a game. Know the rules.\nThis is the sort of place that rewards you for knowing where you are. Most people expect standard amenities and to get what you booked. Not at this place. Know that whatever you booked, you'll likely get a lesser version. The \"trick\" is, if you don't ask for what you booked, they won't give it to you. So you have to ask. Sometimes multiple times. Book a room wit a corner view and a king bed? You'll probably get one on the 5th floor, queen bed, and you'll feel the subway.\nCleanlinees? Some rooms are clean and upgraded like you'll see in the photos on the website. They're on the higher floors. Anything lower though and you're likely in a room that hasn't been fully renovated yet, and may be a little dirtier. Just ask to be moved and maybe they'll have a room for you.\nExpecting standard hotel treatment? Housekeeping service? A minibar? Good luck. You'll maybe get someone who comes by and makes your bed. Some days. Ask for more towels. That's how you get new towels if you're staying more than 2 days. Minibar? You have to call and order everything up yourself.\nWant to actually go to the club or restaurant? Also tough, but if you ask enough maybe the hotel staff will help you get in. That said, if your floor is low enough you'll feel like you're at the Blond, because you'll hear it and the people on line outside. Just as good as being there.\nAll in all, if you like fighting for what you want in a place that's trendy, this is the place for you. If you want a standard stay where you know you'll get what you intended to book, maybe stay somewhere more established.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Hotel is hip, and rooms are lovely, bright, and stylish. Beds are wonderful, and I loved the shower. Housekeeping is meticulous. Staff are warm and approachable, excellent service, but not in a \"bowing and scraping\" kind of way. Le Coucou, the onsite restaurant is amazing. Loved it at night, adored it by day. The Library is a beautiful, restful, inspirational spot. Make sure to drop in for coffee, breakfast, or just relaxing or working. \n\nThe downside: Have to deduct one dot for two significant drawbacks, the fitness rooms and the room layout.\n\nThere are two workout rooms \"Lift\" and \"Run\", both are very small, have good equipment, but not a lot of it. There is only room for one person to work out comfortably at a time. On both occasions my daughter used the \"Lift\" room, someone else came in, expressed frustration, and left, putting her in an uncomfortable situation. On the plus side, complimentary day passes to the UFC Gym are available. This was very enjoyable, so do take advantage of that. If an onsite 24\/7 fitness room is important to you, you may wish to look elsewhere.\n\nRegarding the room layout: With this being our thirteenth visit to NYC, we are not strangers to smaller hotel rooms. Our two double bedded room was the most frustrating room I have been in (though it was very beautiful). Very awkwardly placed furniture made it difficult to be in the room for periods of time. On the plus side, it helped me see what a wonderful space The Library is.\n\nPlenty to love here, but for the price, those drawbacks are significant, and they dampened our otherwise wonderful stay.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

If it was BAD, i don't write a review simply because it will be unfair to negate the efforts of the business owners who set up establishments to take care of their family and employees.\n\nBUT in this case, i make an exception and I will give a candid review to bring to light the disrespectful, unprofessional, and pathetic concrete and glass disaster that is 11 Howard, and I will focus on Joseph (-)- The Check-in Receptionist that i had the displeasure of meeting and the Night manager who facilitated Joseph's dishonest and rude behaviour.\n\nI arrived New York late at 11:50pm after a 16hour Non Stop flight. Made my way to 11 Howard and the rest has to be the worst 1 hour i ever spent checking into a hotel, and yes, it took 1 hour despite the fact i was the only person checking-in at 12:20AM.\n\nJoseph (-) treated me with extreme apathy and disrespect. Expressing all of it in this review only brings back the experience which i wish to forget. He showed no concern for the fact that i was exhausted, struggling to carry my suitcase- My right hand is broken and in a cast, or even offered to help sort out issues with my card to secure the incidentals because the hotel processed credit cards that don't use Chips which is strange because  technology has migrated to cards with chips. So note: if your card has no chip, 11 Howard Hotel's obsolete system cannot process your card. It is too advanced for them.\n\nAfter the fiasco, i made it to the room and the climate control wasn't functioning, and there were 2 double beds. So i went back down and informed the receptionist; his name is Joseph (-) and his response was and I quote \"Hotwire booked you this room so that's what we have. As for the Climate Control, i'll send engineering so go back to your room\". Then he pulled his laptop closer to his face as he sat on his desk and never looked up to my face as i stood there in disbelief. \n\nThat was the last straw. So i called Hotwire and expressed my displeasure. The lady from hotwire was very helpful, and she called the hotel to complain on my behalf. After 5 min, she called me back, and told me that Joseph (-) informed her that I, the guest, declined a room with a single bed, and preferred a room with a double bed. He also said the room with a single bed was on a lower floor and that's why I declined the single bed. The audacity of such a blatant LIE is beyond despicable. \n\nThere and then, I realised that the bad service, the rudeness, the disrespect, and the LIES from Joe (-) directed at me was all on purpose. I couldn't believe it. i was later moved from my room on the 4th floor to the alleged single room on the lower floor and to my surprise, the alleged single room was just next to my previous room on the same 4th floor! NOT on a lower floor. All in All from check-in to calling hotwire to getting the right room to dealing with Joe [--] lies and disrespect took an Hour. To say I'm disappointed is a vast understatement.\n\nWORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE and this coming from myself who has lived on 5 Continents, speaks 4 languages, educated in 3 Countries, is a level 2 reviewer and always has 1 positive thing to say EXCEPT IN THIS SITUATION must mean a lot. Such a shame that Joseph (-) official title is \"Creator of Guest Experiences\". Utterly Shameful.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

I had breakfast in the Library (which is a bit of an odd space, but I think I could come to appreciate it) and had an Acai bowl which was ridiculously tasty if a bit expensive. \n\nOverall I was really happy with my stay. I've been bouncing around different SPG properties in NYC without finding any that I would strongly recommend. 11 Howard is the first one I'd look to book first on my next trip to NYC.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I chose it based on the design and the beautiful common areas. Firstly the hotel is by no means a 5 star hotel, much more like 3*. The room was tiny, particularly the shower room. We couldn't even fit our suitcases in the wardrobe as they aren't full size. The minibar is empty, and you are meant to order things to fill it which seems a bit of a faff. Every time I needed something I had to order it (no dressing gown\/slipper etc in room) Just felt very basic for the price. \nThe reception is also extremely uninviting and we found the staff a bit stand-offish. One guy tried to have a go at us as we hadn't told them the wrong name was displayed on the iPad in the room! I also left an item in the room and when I called to arrange to collect it they said housekeeping hadn't handed it in...?\nIts certainly beautifully designed and in a great location but everything else is pretty lackluster sadly.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The reservation assistant mentioned that they could book me at their \u201csister hotel\u201d - 11 Howard. After having had many good stays at the Gramercy, I (mistakenly) assumed that their 11 Howard location would be just as great.  Well, it wasn\u2019t. First, the location: 11 Howard is on an alley-like street just north of Canal Street. For those unfamiliar with the location - it\u2019s dirty with bags of garbage lining the street. Second, the hotel: 11 Howard has no lobby, just a dark vacant room, no check-in desk, no obvious security - just a girl in a sweatshirt, an empty table (hidden by a large pillar). Once \u201cchecked-in\u201d the elevator (which has no security feature) takes anyone to any floor. Third, the club: Yes, that\u2019s right - the hotel is attached to a Club. A thumping, \u2018ungst-ungst\u2019 raging Club. Noise.All.Night.Long. The worst part, is that the club noise doesn\u2019t start until a little after 11pm...just about the time you close your eyes and just in time for you to be jarred awake and kept awake - all - night - long. Finally, the rooms and hallways are dark - creepy and basically dimmed just enough for you not be to able to see the grit. Let\u2019s just say - I will never go back and I am so disappointed in the Gramercy Park Management for having recommended the 11 Howard Property. In fact, it was such a bad experience, I would never go back and I would think twice before going back to the Gramercy Park.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room itself was fine, small but that was ok. It was a clean room with a nice comfy bed. The only problem was the subway, you heard and felt the trains every 5-10 minutes in the room. I knew we were given this room because we booked through Hotwire and saved money. They must save these room just for Hotwire customers. We were on the 4th floor, probably higher rooms aren't bothered by the trains. So for me this is not a 5 star hotel and should not be listed as one because of the subway noise.

The hotel is in a good place if exploring downtown is what you want to do.  It is between Lafayette and Broadway so good shops and restaurants abound.  One block South and you are on Canal Street, though, so beware!  \n\nThe bed was extremely comfortable with lovely linen.

Check in takes place on an iPad. The vibe of the hotel is contemporary and trendy, yet you are made to feel completely at home and welcomed.

You can tell that every design detail was well thought out from the sculpture-like cactus in the bathroom, to the mini bar built into the credenza, to the iPad instead of a conventional telephone to order room service or get information.\nThe hotel is in the perfect location for walking around and shopping in Soho. After a long day, we came back and relaxed in the Library on the second floor. This was a perfect spot to unwind and as an extra bonus, they were offering complimentary wine.

The minimalist aesthetic is very chic, but what I really like is that, unlike some other design-focussed hotels, they don't skimp on the service. To the contrary: the service from everyone I've interacted with at the front and throughout the hotel has been friendly, helpful, and professional.\n\nAmong my favorite little touches of this hotel: you can schedule the time when they will clean your room on the in-room tablet, so that cleaning doesn't interfere with your day; excellent, fast, free wi-fi that only takes one quick login per stay; terrific showers and bath amenities for a Manhattan hotel; and the second-floor library, which is a great space for having breakfast or doing some work. Combine those with their participation in the SPG program, nice rooms, and comfortable beds, and you've really got a great property.\n\nOverall, this is really the perfect version of a hip, boutique design hotel. If you want huge rooms, a full-service spa, and five restaurants in the hotel, go elsewhere. But if you want a quintessential SoHo experience, stay here.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Additionally, I needed late checkout on 3 of the 4 rooms I had booked and it was a 30 minute debate with the manager.  Even though the hotel wasn't sold out, he needed those rooms and 1 hour was just more than he could do. He finally conceded when i told him i needed the delay due to the hurricane in Houston. It just shouldn't have been this difficult. They were very accommodating in holding my shipments and making sure they got shipped back to me, so their customer service did have some redeeming qualities. Overall, would i stay again?

As an SPG Preferred Guest, I usually just find the best deal across the many Starwood options and rotate around the different neighborhoods.  But I recently gave 11 Howard (part of Design Hotels, participates in the SPG program) a try and realized what I've been missing everywhere else.  \n\nDon't get me wrong - most Starwood hotels are perfectly adequate and often very, very nice.  But this place was different.  It has a special level of sophistication in its sleek lobby and 2nd floor Library.  The SoHo location is straight out of the idyllic version of New York you see in the movies.  Rooms are sparingly decorated without any clutter, hardwood floors are more like an apartment versus a hotel room, and the beds are cushy and ultra-comfortable.  The bathrooms are good-sized for a New York hotel and very well appointed.  The shower has great water pressure and the toiletries all smell and feel fantastic.\n\nBut I have to say one of the most significant differences here is the service.  Everyone is so incredibly friendly, but not in an overzealous way that can sometimes be uncomfortable.  More like a friend would treat you - just really caring and warm.  During my two visits so far, the staff in the lobby addressed me by my name each time they saw me.  Again, like they've known me for years.  It's a really nice intangible that I've found to be so meaningful.\n\n11 Howard is not an inexpensive option, but I am a believer in value.  Sometimes you get a lot when you spend a little more.  New York is a magical place, and that experience is deserving of a hotel on this level.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

How wrong can you be. \nHoward street is a scruffy street on the bottom edge of Soho and far removed from the cool and trendy core Soho streets like Mercer. \nThe hotel is on a busy junction of roads including Lafayette and Canal which are noisy and full of poor quality shops like 7 11 and other low level food stores. \nThe traffic noise was loud in our room and also in the communal library and bar areas. In fact that's an understatement, the noise level kept us awake or woke us early each morning. The windows are double glazed and closed but the noise level is so loud you could convince yourself they are wide open. In addition the hotel is close to Canal subway station which is very convenient but every few minutes you hear rumbling and feel vibrations as a train goes by.\nTo make things worse the air conditioning in the room was affective in controlling the temperature but sounded like a jet was taking off when the fan started. The walls between the rooms must be paper thin as we heard the tv in the adjacent room and even the alarm ringing on a mobile phone. \nThe corridors are narrow and dark with numerous rooms leading off them meaning you hear other guests coming and going and the noise of doors slamming shut. \nThis hotel has a noise issue which no amount of background music is going to cure. I know this city never sleeps but I need to and didn't. \nOur room was very small best described as tiny and really not big enough to accommodate two people. As a result the double bed is small ,there is also a desk and a chair but nothing else would fit in.  The decor is plain,simple ,somewhat boring and more like a budget hotel rather than a well designed Scandinavian concept. \nThe room has a small bathroom which is functional but one at a time please as the space is very tight. Both the room and bathroom were clean and well maintained. \nI initially didn't like the thought of using the iPad in the room to order room service, housekeeping, laundry etc but the system is intuitive and easy to use and the hotel staff reacted quickly and efficiently to requests. \nThe hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and many of them went beyond what I might expect to help us. We went to the US open by subway and one of the guys on reception helped me plan the trip and printed off copies of the route. \nNoise is the big problem with this hotel but the staff and service go some way to compensate. \nI raised my noise complaint with a manager who listened politely and offered compensation. However, there is little he can do as the noise is a structural issue he can't resolve. ","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":10040329,"title":"Superficial and weak","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-08-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I stayed at 11 Howard for 14 nights and what a disappointment it has been. \n\nAfter this trip, I am left with the understanding that this establishment and the majority of its team are superficial and weak. \n\nPrior to arriving, I was refused a price match for my stay (a price match which was AUD$2,300 less than the original rate) which lead me to book outside of the hotel. Evidently the Global Poverty Project isn't that important. A bonus for me was earning 28,250 miles on my stay which I would not have earned if the hotel had matched the rate booking direct. Had I not been earning these miles on my stay, I would have checked out early due to the plethora of failures during my stay. \n\nDue to my poor booking experience, the GM promised to upgrade my room to at least a King Room. The director of revenue promised to send up an amenity when I arrived for the trouble throughout my booking experience. On arrival, my room was not upgraded and I was not provided an amenity. Great start. \n\nI was put into a tiny Queen room above the subway. Upon discovering that there was no tub in the room I went down to concierge to see whether there was a room with a tub available (a tub is not the biggest deal breaker, but it is certainly nice to have after a day out in the city. I wouldn't consider my request unreasonable), I was then put into another room, with no tub... went to see concierge again and then after a lengthy wait was then given keys to an occupied room full of another guests belongings - WTF? Major security concern. How can a hotel give a guest access to another guests room?\n\nThen was put into the 4th room for the evening, which was said to have a tub... and did not have a tub. By this stage I was over it and could not be bothered dealing with a team who evidently did not know what they were doing. All this after travelling 24 hours? Thanks. That's conscious hospitality at its best. \n\nThe following day, I called the front desk to have my AppleTV set up as there are no streaming services in this hotel and was flatly told NO, that it was not possible. Then I had a call back from someone else on the front desk advising that they were finding a work around for this. In the end it was possible, so why tell me no in the first place? \n\nThe food and beverage manager promised to send up a couple of juices for my trouble, as he became involved in getting my AppleTV set up. The juices never arrived. \n\nHaving had so much trouble, I contacted the GM to express my disappointment with the service received. The GM tried to make it up to me by providing a $100 voucher to a nearby store and advised me that he would have juices sent up daily for the duration of my stay. He also offered a session at HigherDose which I did not use. The GM also arranged for me to be moved to a 5th room for the stay, which finally had a tub and a view uptown. \n\nUnsuprisingly, the juices stopped coming, more emails were exchanged with further disappointment. While I appreciate his efforts to look after me and reach out multiple times, it was disappointing that my experience continued to decline. \n\nI don't understand how there can be so many elements of failure in this hotel. The hotel claims to be 'conscious hospitality' however the team in the lobby are hard pressed to speak to you when you come and go... too busy engaged in personal conversations with each other. Too cool to speak to guests... in a hotel... conscious hospitality?\n\nThere are maybe 2 team members who actually make the effort to engage with guests.\n\nOverall, 11 Howard has been a complete disappointment on my 3rd stay here. After my second stay in December 2016, I was sure that I had found a place to call home in New York City but unfortunately that has been totally and utterly shattered by this experience.\n\nThis hotel fails to deliver on so many levels. 11 Howard is cheaper than the other 'go to' hotels around the area... but unfortunately the service matches. \n\nI may stay here again, for an ordinary experience if I am in the city for a short time, as I do enjoy the space, but I would not recommend anyone to this hotel who values service.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

Seku (sorry if I misspelled) was extremely professional and on top of it. His sense of calm urgency is something that is often lacking in young service workers (I know because I was in service until about 2 years ago). Others were very friendly as well. When I was running late to get back to check-out, I was able to have the hotel kindly grabbed my bag from my room and check me out so I didn't have to worry about anything.\n- Water bottles provided when checking in and returning to hotel. As much as I hate waste, it's a nice touch for when it's hot and you are walking around all day.  \n-Bed: very comfortable with perfect pillows.\n-Bath: luxurious and clean.\n\nCons: \n- Room service could be stepped up a bit. Would love some actual plates and glassware\/flatware. It may not be possible for them, but would be appreciated when you just don't want to be out. But the menu looked more full than last time, so I think it's getting better. \n- Beware of some corner room floor plans, which can be a little tight for claustrophobic people.\n\nDefinitely worth the stay!","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Then at 5 A.M., our phone rang asking if there was an emergency. 5 A? It was some sort of a prank call, but really unreasonable.\nSO, in the morning, I told one of the two ladies in the lobby about what happened, and she offered to send up a bottle of wine or champagne.

As soon as we pull up a young lady was out the door like magic and asks are we checking in .

The room was neat and clean , there is a safe and a fridge but you have to order in drinks and snacks.  The view we had was the only draw back.

There are a pair of subway stops within two blocks of the hotel so finding it wasn't a problem especially since the hotel's name is it's address on Howard Street. \n\nStepping in to the hotel's little lobby I wasn't sure at first glance who was a guest and who was staff as there isn't a traditional front desk but I was warmly greeted within a moment or two by a staff member who checked me in by tablet. The staff uniforms are very casual with high pant cuffs and leather loafers so are suitably hip to match the whole hotel's cool vibe. \n\nMy reservation had been for a Howard Queen room but was informed upon check-in I'd been upgraded to an accessible King room on a higher floor. Room #618 has a cool colour scheme, light brown oak floors, a high ceiling and modern Danish design that provided an oasis from the heat wave New York was experiencing during my mid-June stay. The furnishing work well together and the king bed doesn't feel outsized in the room as is sometimes the case with smaller boutique hotel rooms. The desk isn't large but had a handy shelf above it for books and maps and smartphone while recharging. The night stand is a recued square chunk of a large beam with a crack running from top to bottom standing about 2 foot high and holds a phone and tablet for ordering hotel services or surfing the web. I very much appreciated the tablet and used several times a day to check subway routes, weather reports or stay in touch with friends, family and work while on holiday. The accessible bathroom is larger than in other rooms and with handles on all walls but lacked room a vanity for toiletries. There is a small stand for towels and complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body wash next to the tub with shower and hooks on the back of the bathroom door so some useful bathroom space. Instead of modern the brass tub & shower knobs had a more retro feel and it took some time to figure out the way to work the controls but should you be unable to manager there's an instructional video on the tablet. The closet just opposite the bathroom was enough for a few clothes to hang up but guests with large wardrobes may find it too small. The mini-fridge comes empty but worked to cool the free water bottles provided and you may order other items through the tablet. A laptop size safe, large window with Howard Street roof top view and easy chair round out what is a bright, airy feeling space.\n\nThe hotel's location is an easy amble to so many neighborhoods such as Little Italy and Chinatown and a bit further to the East Village or Tribeca. Make sure to try local food landmarks Katz's Deli and Lombardi's pizza both of which are over a century in business. I loved the location as luxury New York hotels have traditionally been clustered further uptown between Times Square and Central Park so having upscale alternative accommodations downtown earns high marks from me. \n\nI looked in on The Library, the second floor space that felt to me more like a living room with comfy couches and chairs to relax over a cocktail or catch up on some work but as it was fairly full and didn't spot any seats for solos. The adjacent \"the blond\" (written in lowercase on purpose) is more of a traditional bar and lounge with winding plush velour seats and long bar with high bar stools to perch for cocktails. \n\n On the last day I ran short of time before packing and leaving for the airport so asked the lobby staff where the closest post office was to mail some postcards I'd addressed but hadn't bought stamps and happily learned the hotel would mail them for me and charge the few dollars postage to my room account. This service was greatly appreciated and was in keeping with the overall accommodating and friendly service I encountered from all staff. \n\nIf there are some nitpicky things I would share about 11 Howard it would be a few things like the dim hallway corridors, small room closet, lack of a vanity, and low tub although the last two are likely due to the room being accessible for wheelchair guests. The room upgrade to a higher floor likely helped minimize the sound from subways running underneath the hotel others have reported as the sleep quality was good for this very light sleeper. Noise from adjoining rooms also wasn't an issue.\n\nWhile I would've liked to have stayed longer I very much enjoyed my short stay and hope to return as 11 Howard offers a chic retreat in an amazing location.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

The value for price is also among the best in Manhattan and I've tried many dozens of places over the decades!\n\nThe location in SoHo is away from the tourist mobs around Times Square in a fun neighborhood only a couple of blocks from Little Italy and China Town.  You enter through two large swinging glass doors which an alert staffer opens for you.  Check in is right in the main lobby at a sleek round table with bright, friendly staff.  Rob was our guy and for the next three days and nights, he took the best care of us along with all the rest of the staff.   \n\nA massive beautifully designed spiral staircase takes you up to sitting area lobby and bar on the 2nd floor.  Lots of folks make calls, work laptops, have drinks or just relax in this chic area designed just so.  The bar is fabulous after dark with plush couches, music dialed in perfectly, and good cocktails.  Make sure you spend time on this 2nd floor during your stay.  It's fun and relaxing and the hotel concierge is here as well.\n\nWe were given a corner room on the 8th floor with views of Howard Street and also down Lafayette.  The King bed was exceedingly comfortable.  The sitting area was spacious and included an inviting couch and chairs with table.  The bathroom was marble and the large shower had great water pressure.  The design was cool, fun - felt Scandinanvian.  Each room has a tablet\\Ipad for ordering food or asking for literally anything.  It was a fun touch and every easy to use.  \n\nYes, there is a subway train tunnel below and you can occasionally hear\\feel it but we barely noticed and the hotel more than makes up for it.  My wife is a light sleeper but she had no trouble at all from the train.  Many hotels in Manhattan (especially in the busiest tourist areas) are much louder because of car and truck traffic and this hotel has little of that.  \n\nThis hotel is affiliated with SPG\\Starwood and that's how I found it though it's an actual member of the worldwide Design Hotel Network which is top flight.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was comfortable and a nice size and housekeeping did a good job on keeping it clean.  Security was great as the elevator required a card key and there was usually staff at the front door to greet you so I always felt safe.  And the staff was very accommodating and friendly - we asked for bottles and bottles of water because it was hot outdoors and they always welcomed us back when we returned to the hotel.

Our room on the top floor was excessively loud (underneath ventilation ducts). We had two separate visits from their maintenance team that finally acknowledged there was a problem. We changed rooms at 3:30am. No one helped us move.\n\n- Room #2: bigger bathroom, smaller room. There seem to be clear issues with spatial proportions. There was half eaten tic tacs in our bed (under the sheets); housekeeping not only didn't clean it, they tried to hide it. WTF??

We had a Howard deluxe room and although we didnt feel claustrophobic we did both react to the diminutive size (although the bathroom, hallway and closet were nicely sized!). Minor quibbles would be that the big closet only held maybe 4 hangers and no iron (tho staff were very prompt in bringing it to us on request). There's a really nice sitting area (the library) with light service (dont need to buy anything) where you can hang out and read\/work. It's one floor up which seems to help it stay less busy (i.e. you can get somewhere to sit easily).\n\nSo, would we stay here again? We didnt find much else that we liked when searching for a place in this area, however I think we'd look around to see if there's anything else we could try. With that said, overall it's a nice place to stay and partly dependent on what the going rate is (NYC can get quite pricey).","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They do try do their best to accommodate your requests. There is a very small \"fitness\" centre, but they also give you a pass if you really need to use a real gym.  The Blond bar is ok, but nothing really to be desperate to go in.  The mezzanine area is also nicely done, but it can get crowed.

Guests are greeted at the door by helpful staff members.  The front 'desk' is a round table with a small computer for check-in.    Rooms were quiet and nicely appointed with modernist furniture.  Low light throughout the hotel and the minimalist approach is a soothing respite from the wonderful overload that is NYC.\n\nThe Canal St. subway station is a block away.  It was an easy walk to Greenwich Village, the East Village,  the 9\/11 Memorial and other Lower Manhattan sites. The surrounding Chinatown and Little Italy neighborhoods are just out the front door.

There is an electronic tablet on the nightstand that guests can use to order room service or ask for the usual things one needs in a room, which was a new thing to we Midwestern oldsters.  An extra pillow or room service at the touch of a button.  The staff was helpful and pleasant and each very good at their job.

There's definitely a more chilled out vibe in this area, whilst you are still only 10 minutes walk from the Hudson (where I like to run), and 25 minutes walk to the hustle and bustle of the main Manhattan shopping and office district.\nThe walk up to Washington Square and up 5th is lovely, and you can really enjoy and wonder how the single street can morph from an urban residential street into such a shopping and business mecca, in just a few block. Anyway I digress....\nThe hotel itself is large and minimalist. The fact that you haven;t got a traditional \"reception desk\" but rather a round table, with the staff with tablets ready to check you in in seconds, not only takes the rigmarole of checking in right away, but also stets you up for how this hotel is run.\nIt's very informal. It's very casual. But in no way does that mean you don;t get wonderful service and with a genuine smile. The staff, every one of them, were super helpful whether it was just giving directions, putting water in your hands (even if you didn't ask for it), through to enquiring about your day. It's classy and honest as opposed to stiff and fake, and it makes your stay more welcoming for that.\nI got a room on the 8th floor, and whilst my view wasn't the best, the room was very comfortable and was well laid out. \nEverything you needed to know was on the tablet next to the bed which was really handy.\nThe bar is really a very nice place to have a drink and on certain nights turns in to a nightclub which can be lively, so make sure you ask for a higher floor room if you are a light sleeper.\nOverall 11 Howard will become my stay of choice when I visit New York.

This in only the second review I have ever written\n\nIn NY, i usually use hoteltonight as I book whatever location is closest to my first meeting.  As I usually only stay one night, almost anything is acceptable.  Given that I am paying a relatively low rate, I assume that I will be in one of the worst rooms.  But you can tell a lot about a hotel from one of the worst rooms.\n\n11 Howard is quite simply lipstick on a pig.  The issues cannot be fixed as they are environmental or built in from the core.\n\n1) You can't change the subway.  Other reviews have mentioned, but you do really hear every subway every few minutes.  The entire room shakes.  The glasses clink, the furniture vibrates.  If you are a heavy sleeper, you probably wont mind.  But it is definitely there and not going anywhere.  Now, in the room, they place the drinking glasses on a marble slab on the desk.  This is not a good idea.  I found that placing one of the washcloths below the glasses minimized the rattle of the glasses quite significantly.  Hint to management: try coasters.\n\n2) The room is small.  Small is often ok, but the arrangement is poor, at least in the room I had.  I took a picture which I will try to upload.  The distance between the end of the bed and the chair for the desk (which only protrudes about 2 inches from the desk is less than 12 inches.  Therefore in order to get to the bed you have to walk a path that is less than 12 inches wide.  You WILL stub your toe, bang your shin on the back of the chair etc.  Hence the bruises.  \n\n3) The walls are very badly insulated.  You can hear a light sneeze easily from the next room along with everything else.\n\n4) The bathroom is a strong point.  well appointed.  The size precludes a bath, which is good for those who hate bath\/showers as I do.  One small peeve is that it is a poor shower design.  You have to reach\/step in to turn the water on.  i.e. You will get cold water on at least some part of you in order to turn the water on.  Well designed showers in good hotels do not do this.  \n\n5) When checking in I asked if there were rooms that were quieter than others.  They checked availability and told me that because I was checking in so late, this was the only room available. It was 6:30 pm.  Usually not considered late to check in at a NY hotel.  Other small issues like forgetting to write down the wifi password, one staff member in casual conversation referred to the person who checked me in as \"not very good,\" etc.  small things but signs of not generally well run hotels.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"NONE"}

We found the hotel to be in a good location and the room to be clean, comfortable, and a decent size for New York City.  We really liked the in room IPADs that we used to request anything we needed, including extra towels as well as robes and slippers.  I have to say, though, what really stood out was the absolutely exceptional service provided by the hotel staff.  I wish I would have written down a few more names, but I can say anyone at 11Howard who was working Easter weekend when I was there provided impeccable service.  \n\nThe hotel itself is a quiet boutique hotel on a quieter street, so getting dropped off and picked up was easier with no traffic to impede us.  We were greeted and assisted on the sidewalk the day we arrived with staff handling our luggage and offering us bottled water.  Hotel staff recognized us during the weekend when we came back to the hotel, coming out to greet us, open the door and offer us bottled water.  11Howard had a second floor library with comfortable furniture, complementary coffee and tea in the morning hours and cold lemon water all day.  The concierge desk was also staffed in the library throughout the day where they assisted in our airline check in and printed out boarding passes, offered assistance with places to see, providing maps and directions as well as helped with restaurant suggestions and reservations.  We never had to wait long for service from the concierge, often walking up and getting what we needed immediately.\n\nI did manage to get a few names of the phenomenal staff.  Nef was working the concierge desk and called around for us to find a place that sold canes to help out one of our group who was having difficulty getting around.  She even had the place set aside what we needed so we could get it quickly.  Rodriguez was on security detail and was very friendly and welcoming to us.

There's a nice restaurant adjoining the hotel that's more traditional - good service\/food there.  There's an \"interesting\" 2nd floor library\/bar where you can get drinks, light food and just hang out on your laptop. It's like stumbling into an Internet cafe or WeWork during the day.  At night, it's a little different as it's all about the beats and bass pumping, club-like.  The location is excellent and the streets nearby are full of neat boutiques, restaurants, etc.  The integration w\/ Starwood is not quite there - you can book via SPG but they didn't have my Platinum # upon check in and despite me giving it to them, I still haven't seen credit for this stay a week later.  Looks like I will have to call it in - drag.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The service is very friendly and efficient.  The second floor lounge is enormous.  It is on all four sides of the hotel around the center utilities (elevators, kitchen, stairs, etc.)  Wonderful bar.  Comfortable seating for eating, working, or relaxing.  The food looked very good although I did not try it. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms are quiet.  There are some rather strange design decisions in the rooms however.  Our corner room had two large flat screen televisions but neither was particularly comfortable to watch.  One was on a wall parallel to the bed.  It could be adjusted to stick away about three inches from the wall on one end so was not comfortable for watching from the bed.  The other television could only be watched by turning the desk chairs 90 degrees but could not really be seen from the sofa.  The closet contains a storage chest so that there is not really room to hang a long jacket without it hitting the top of the chest of drawers.  There is a small amount of space to the side but it is filled by a ironing board.  The storage drawers are designed so that each drawer has the side facing out forming a perfect square -- very lovely to look at.  But this results in a narrow drawer that isn't very useful unless you are only putting rolled or small items into it.  Folded shirts do not fit without a lot of refolding.  Watch out for the lovely hanging lamp over the desk lest you hit your head on it -- it swings easily so you will not be hurt but it is a strange design.  And the bathrooms, as mentioned by others, are reminiscent of those on a very upscale first class airplane.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Close to many cool neighbourhoods with the train (Canal St) just steps away.  I think there's a lot of positive things, but having stayed in many amazing NYC hotels over the years I do have some comments.  The non-existent front desk is becoming a common theme but it doesn't work that well when you're checking in late at night - no one is around and you walk into an open space with a bit of confusion.  The empty mini bar has its pros and cons - I liked having the fridge empty as I hit WholeFoods and stocked up on my own food.  Would have been nice to have a couple minibar options available in the room however.  When I arrived to check in it was close to midnight and absolutely nothing was explained to me - ie. how to use the tablet in the room, when and where breakfast is served, whether there was a gym on site etc.  The rooms seemed very dark to me and a little too industrial\/ minimalist for their own good but I thought the bed was exceptional.  If you don't want to hear the constant rumble of the subway day and night you MUST request a high floor to avoid that.  The bathroom was very, very tiny even for NYC standards (and I had a corner studio which was supposed to be a larger room).  The Library has complimentary coffee (La Colombe) which is a nice touch, but while I was there they had a list of smoothies for breakfast on the menu yet NONE of them were available (??).  My biggest complaint is the way they deliver room service:  in a brown paper bag with plastic forks and knives.  This simply does not work for the calibre of food they are serving. You cannot cut food with a plastic fork, LOL.  Some of the features of this hotel are too cool or too hipster for anyone's good.  If I'm paying $600+ a night for a room don't give me my food in a paper bag with plastic utensils!!!  Also, I called down one day to ask if a couple bottles of water could be brought up to the room and a nice gentleman said no problem.  The next day I called and requested the same thing and a woman told me no and said a \"special exception must have been made the day before\".  ?????  There are bottles of water sitting in the lobby free for the taking but they can't run a couple up to my room?  Ok.... all in all I think it's a good hotel but there is plenty of room for improvement and they might be trying a little too hard with the whole hipster vibe.

Except NYC rooms are tiny, loud, and very expensive.  Value in a NYC hotel room is hard to find.\n\nI found 11 Howard in a search through the SPG website for a room for a business trip.  I hadn't stayed there before, but the rate was at least $100 cheaper than any other reasonable SPG room in the city for the night.  It's in a good SoHo location, and there was good taxi presence in the area.  The check in is sort of modern pretentious.  There's no desk, per se.  There's a round table where airily-dressed staff sweep in and check you in via tablet.  They make a big deal about not having food (minibar) in the rooms, so they give you a bottle of water in the lobby.  So, in addition to your bags and your room key, you also have to juggle the bottle of water.  How about stop trying so hard to be chic\/different and just put the water in the room.\n\nThe place has a warm vibe.  Wood floors in the elevator, and the room.  Earthy tones.  The room was small. I couldn't get the door to the \"closet\" open at the same time as the door to the bathroom.  It was one of those closets that is so shallow and partitioned that your shirt and pants can't hang without hitting the shelf that's midway down.  Plus, they only have the tiny ironing board with the four-inch legs.  This drives me crazy.  If you're going to go to the trouble to give me a board and an iron, give me a full-size board.  \n\nAll that being said, the room was comfortable,had everything I needed (except the full-size board), and was clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  The shower smelled musty, but everything worked.  \n\nThey have tablets in the room through which you contact the concierge service and order room service AND....minibar packages.  Whatever.\n\nI liked this hotel.  It is in a good location for access to downtown, without having to stay downtown.  I ended up walking down to World Financial Center.  The staff are nice enough - you can't blame them for the weird check in\/water bottle situations.  \n\nAnd again it was a decent value for NYC.  \n\nThe little things were annoying, but not enough to diminish my rating.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Amazing concierge service and a modern hotel with a touch of luxury without any pr\u00e9tention ! \nThanks to 11 Howard's team for our stay, we will definitely repeat the experience in our next trip In Nyc. \nA big thanks to Rob, Brian, Mike and Anis who made our holidays very special with their precious tips.

We enjoyed a room on the 15th floor which was quite, albeit on the cozy side, but at the price point we expected nothing larger in scale. Furnishings were very much of minimal scandinavian sensibility which added little in the way of luxury but did have a clean and sleek feel. The room was secure and clean, and the bed was excellent and that is always our biggest concerns when getting a room.\n\nWhat stands out more than anything else in this hotel is the endless efforts of the staff to make their guests feel welcome. I was a little jarred from their break from tradition with a deskless reception but found that their regard for hospital truly traditional. All staff were exceptionally cheery and greeted us all with a smile at every opportunity.\n\nWe found this to be great value in a location was well placed to access Little Italy, Tribeca, SOHO, and was only a $15 cab ride from the Theater district. Without question, if you can walk a few blocks, a solid NYC experience is there for the taking, all in walking distance.\n\nAlso great is their free wine in the excellent lounge room on the second floor on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.\n\nNo place is flawless. I suppose if I were to point out any things that could have been slightly more satisfying it is the following. 1)  The bar is terrific but is leased to a nightclub after 10PM and guests have no guaranteed access 2) No coffee makers\/machines in the rooms 3) Breakfast was served in paper bags and cups. I got what they were going for but on a vacation and in a hotel, this just doesn't work. The food is not worth ordering unless you really can't get out. Better is available across the street. 4) Their bathrooms are clean but the glass shower guard in the rooms with traditional bathtubs (this used to be a Holiday Inn) is hopelessly undersized and it is virtually impossible to take a shower without leaving the bathroom floor dangerously soaked in a film of water. WATCH YOUR STEP.\n\nWith the exception of this point, which in my view should be properly addressed or they will find themselves with a lawsuit sooner or later, all other 'cons' are minor.\n\nThis really was a very satisfying visit. I would happily recommend it to those looking for a clean, comfortable and welcome place to stay downtown!","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I received email messages leading up to my stay, including one asking me how I wanted my minibar configured--different packages or just empty for use as a refrigerator. My room was smartly configured and nicely furnished, and had a great shower. The 2nd floor has a large common space for working with different types of sitting configurations--and waiters to bring food and drink without the spending and timing expectations of a restaurant. The restaurant and bar are great too. But my favorite thing about the hotel was the staff. Many team members play multiple roles, so I didn't get passed off to someone else when I asked a question. For example, Brian helped me find a room for my entire next visit during a busy week at the hotel, and Michael helped me try to ship a package during my second stay when a snowstorm shut down the shipping place around the corner.

If we had a criticism, it would be that the bathroom was too cool for its own good - the eco friendly toilet didn't flush all that well and the super cool floor to ceiling glass shower enclosure tended to leak to the bathroom floor - truly minor first world problems. The bar was very good, drinks were great, but it converts to a club by 10 on a Saturday and you have to be on some special list. The bar isn't open on Sunday night, which was a mild frustration. In sum, this is a really friendly, well located, responsibly priced place and was a great home base for a weekend jaunt to NYC!!!","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

They were incredibly accommodating and the staff were amazingly helpful at all times! Loved the rooms - I stayed in a corner Studio, which was great, with plenty of space! The other rooms were a little more tight, but still gorgeous.\nIf there was one slight grumble, it would be that it was a touch expensive for things likee beverages etc. - but I guess that's just New York! In terms of location, it was perfect for me - easily accessible to a ton of different amenities, parks, shops, bars, restaurants etc. we were situated right by Mercer, Green Street and Broadway which are great for food and SHOPPING!

There is a small gym and a small dining area but if you are in NYC it is likely that you are not there to sit in breakfast or in your room.

This really made it feel less like a typical hotel and more like a home away from home, which I loved! \n\nWe stayed on the 4th floor in what they call the Night Owl because the sound from The Blond (the club connected to the hotel) goes through the walls. Kenny informed us of their policy with these rooms and made sure that we were going to be happy with that & to tell the truth I was up in the room through many different points in the night & I could only sometimes make out a little background noise from the club. It wasn't bothersome one bit.\n\nWalking into the room was an absolute dream. Light wood flooring, Beautiful navy blue black out curtains complimenting the creme colored walls. We had a corner room with an entire two walls that were windows. such. an amazing view (even from the 4th floor) and lighting.\n\nThe space was perfect.

Rooms are quite small and nice, but not as stylish as the lobby slick design would suggest. The Minibar service is supposed to be via an Ipad system..honestly i would still prefer the old fashion way. Also the fact that to get to a gymn you need to get around the block and train in a boying\/fighting club is a bit of a put off.\n\nThe restaurant Coucou (if you are lucky enough to get table...) is worth an extra and separate review, the B'fast\/Brunch though is definitely a thumbs up.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The location was  convenient to many shops and restaurants and you can easily walk to many of the other surrounding neighborhoods.  One semi negative thing would be that the hotel bar closes around 9 to hotel patrons as it turns into a night club.  It's not a deal breaker as there are many other places to have a drink, but it was very cold while we were there and it would have been nice to be able to stay in the hotel and not brave the elements.  \n\nMy only complaint about the hotel, and this is for any light sleepers, is it sits very close to a subway and beginning around 5-6 am the room sounds like you're in the middle of a mild earthquake.  It roars for about 10 seconds and then stops, but then repeats every 10ish minutes or so.  Needless to say I was up early most days, but it didn't seem to bother my boyfriend as he can sleep through most anything!  Overall, it was a nice stay.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":10040329,"title":"Great Boutique Hotel with Very Unusual Service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-11-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I arrived earlier than my son was going to, but had bundled his flight from Denver with our hotel so I called the Front Desk and spoke to Michael, who as incredibly helpful in ensuring my name was associated with the reservation so I could check in and wait for my son after my train ride from Providence, RI. I also asked Michael if he could order me an amenity basket or some fruit so we could grab it and go, with the odd hours we were going to be running around at. The parade requires a very early start to the day, as well as other things we had planned. Michael said he would take care of it, no problem.\n\nUpon my arrival my check in was really seamless. I loved the vibe the hotel had and the unassuming round table instead of the normal Front Desk counter start you off on a very different experience than other hotels. Really did feel great. I did not remember the girl's name who helped me but she was very friendly, helpful, provided details about the bar, etc. and made check in seamless.\n\nI had reserved a Deluxe King bed since there were no Double Doubles left in the city and I knew we would at least have a few upgrades to help with the bed issue. When I got to the room, it was simple, yet elegant. The fruit was a little odd, as there was only 1 pair, 1 orange, 1 tangerine and 3 strawberries. Usually you get 2 of each since he was aware that I was being joined by my son. And if you can put some plastic wrap around them, they stay fresh longer. We were staying 4 days so I knew we just needed to keep them covered. They came in very handy, though, and having worked in hospitality, I always found that was a very helpful thing to put in people's rooms. \n\nI always unpack everything and had no problem with the number of hangars or the one pull drawer for my stuff. I did have table, a bench seat and a single chair as well. There is a tablet that should be used for ordering things inside of the hotel as well as locator service, but the map would never render. We also were not in checked into that room so the tablet showed that we coudn't order food without calling down to the Front Desk (per the Tablet) and then they transferred me over to Room Service. I ordered the Angus burger with all of the fixings and french fries. It was delivered fast, hot and in a really cute box and in a handled bag, instead of on a tray. Again, this was a really great tough and very \"folksie\". \n\nI did go to the bar the first night and waited for my son to arrive. Frank was my bartender. He wasn't having the greatest night after his uncle became ill, but he rallied and was so helpful to us. He directed us where we could go have dinner (Blue Bonnett) and we made reservations there. The Manager of that restaurant waited on us personally and the food was incredibly good. Frank was really just a fun and helpful bartender. \n\nThe next day I needed to print out tickets for the Knicks game. I think it was Kenny? who was at Concierge \/ Guest Services. He was also very helpful. Unfortunately we could not get the tickets to print and had to call in Mark from IT to help. Eventually he just had to print the tickets down in the General Manager's office. There was no disc space left on the computer and had multiple errors. The laptop definitely needed some TLC to reimage or remove some of the items from the laptop. Eventually we got it fixed and we were off on our travels. \n\nMy son and I LOVED the bed as it was so soft and inviting. I liked that I could warm up the room with my own thermostat after freezing at the Macy's Day Parade. We definitely needed some warmth and a nap. The only other thing that was odd was the door man wasn't ever at the door, but eventually he would come running as we were already through the door. The other fun thing was we ran into Kenny? the last night, who was working the door for a private party and he gave us both a big hug like we were long lost friends. I love that kind of service and I felt like I was staying in my own building with Concierge in Providence. I really love good and personalized service. Mark also came to my aid and remembered my name and I just loved how different this hotel felt. Everyone was able to communicate via headsets and it seemed like you were able to do a lot with not as many people. It also helped if they were cross trained so they could fill in at multiple roles. All in all I would give them an A-plus on just about everything. I especially loved that housekeeping didn't pound on our door each morning. We were able to come and go as WE needed to without being woken up because of our strange hours. But our room was impeccably cleaned everytime we returned. They asked late in the day if there was anything else we needed. The only other recommendation I would make is you must have more electrical outlets in the room. If two people are staying in there the only charger is on one side of the bed. You need to have access for both sides of the bed to charge phones, computers, etc. without getting in each other's space. We ended up with piles of phone cases charging, charger boxes, computer, etc. all on one side of the bed, which was a pain if I didn't want to wake my son up in the morning. I would also move the outlet in the bathroom up 1\/2\" so you can plug in both the hair dryer and a curling iron at the same time. Lastly, the shower was very nice, but needed to be hotter. Also with the European style glass, if you use the hand held sprayer you run the risk of getting it outside of the shower and the floor mat soaked. The toiletries were amazing though and we loved the lava rocks\/oil and smells that permeated in the halls of the hotel.\n\nWe truly cannot wait to go back!","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As I already stated, storage of any kind is a huge challenge. The bed and linens are killer.  The bedside tablet is terrific and makes getting and ordering anything super easy.  Foam pillows were exchanged for feather within 5 minutes of the window timeframe I had requested.  I couldn't find the ice machine (for reference, it's on 10, we were on 15) and it showed up within 15 minutes of ordering it on the tablet.  You forgot the hallways that are either hip, dark and romantic or dark, shadowy, and straight out of The Shining, depending on your outlook.\n\nThe Library Bar is fun.  We ordered drinks in there several times.  The library itself is mostly wine and beer, but it connects to a bar\/club called The Blond and mixed drinks come from there.  This bar is evidently the place to be and had a roped off-guestl-list only nightly line in front of it all weekend.  It is on the second floor with the concierge and the Library, and gets really loud at night.  Any rooms on floors 3-5 heard it until around 3am.\n\nAs expected in NYC, traffic noise and sirens are hard to escape at night.  Higher floors always get less.

Overall the design is fantastic with an ultra mod feeling. Good use of tech in the rooms with basically a tablet to order anything without having to talk to anyone. Lobby folks were very helpful and pleasant with one gentleman remembering my name every time. A far difference for some reason with the morning staff on the second floor who seemed to be a little pretentious\/un welcoming. Just a guy and gal at a desk and the guy mumbled good morning while the gal just gave me a dismissive death stare with no greeting. Service in the lounge area was pretty decent but the hotel does lack a lot with no spa, no access to the blonde bar in the evening (because it turns into some b level euro dance scene-which you get no access to even as a guest) and there is no gym which was something I use while on business travel. Here's the catch, rooms are really small and the room service menu is limited with food coming to your room in cardboard to go bags. I love design and modern style but come now, all your food in paper bags\/boxes like you have left overs? Lastly I must say the beds are fantastic though but the walls are super thin. My last night I struggled to sleep because I could hear the train run under the building which shook my room every 15 mins and the walls to the hallway\/ btwn rooms are paper thin.  You could hear everything from people cozying up next door to people walking and simply talking while heading into their rooms. Sadly a very unkind night before early meetings.  Overall not terrible but not what was expected falling short. I WANT to love this hotel SO much but its just making it really hard to do so but may\/may not be worth another try?

The hotel lobby feels understaffed. I usually see only one desk person there. And they are always busy with people. In the first few years of a hotel they should over staff to make guests' experience totally pleasurable. A few times i stopped at the front for help (not really a front but table and staff uses a tablet) and i had to wait while they helped a few people. i gave up once. \n\nThen in the library room they serve stuff in the morning. my business associate had to ask twice for tea. Just tea. It took forever and then they forgot the milk. She had to ask twice again. \n\nIt just feels like it's lacking that aspect of where staff trips over themselves to make your stay pleasurable.

Not only did I wake to doors closing and people talking in the hallway in the morning but I could tell which channel my next door neighbor was watching on TV... until midnight...\n- There was sand in my bed... what?!\n- I requested a comb on the hotel iPad. My request was cancelled without an explanation. When I called the front desk they informed me they didn't know what had happened as another department was in charge of such requests. They eventually brought me a comb, which furthered my lack of understanding...\n- I ordered breakfast in the room, again through the hotel iPad (which is the only way you can do it). An hour later, it still hadn't arrived. When I called to inquire, they informed me they never got the order and that they were no longer serving breakfast (it was 10:30 AM) but that they could send coffee over. Which I still had to pay 7 USD for.\n\nThe one saving grace was the manager who was very accommodating upon learning about the details of my stay. The staff here are extremely helpful and empathetic. I'm only hoping since the hotel is new, this is just an adaptation period and they will adjust the logistics of it all as the rooms are very pleasant overall.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Hard to ask for a better location than this. Check-in is a little unorthodox, with staff walking around the lobby with Android tablets and no \"front desk\" to speak of - but it was very quick check-in. In every room, there's a Nexus 7 tablet with your name and a few apps pre-installed to help orient you to the hotel and surrounding neighborhood. Very nice touch. Although it's perhaps trivial, can tell a lot about a place by small things like the quality of light switches and fixtures. 11Howard has really high quality Lutron switches, for example, which are many times what they need to spend on a light switch, but indicate the care to detail and quality.\n\nThe hotel bar is very nice and chic, and you get a free drink per person with your stay. Drinks are hilariously overpriced (e.g., over $10 for a boring mainstream beer, $25 for a glass of wine from a $10 store-bought bottle), but with the freebie it's not so bad. And it's worth it for the atmosphere and location.\n\nDuring our stay, someone in a nearby room was smoking pot and it was smelling up our room - like full-on in-your-face smoke smell. My wife is pregnant so we called the \"front desk\" (wherever that is) to see what they could do. They weren't able to find the source of the smoke so instead moved us to another room, which turned out to be nicer and on a higher floor. They also gave us a free breakfast in the morning as a sort of apology.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The entire hotel is overly electronic which could work for young travelers.  Personally I didn't like the fact that when I asked for a wake up call, that they said to program the iPad in my room.  When I asked for a bar menu - they said to review what is shown on the ipad in my room.  The employees who worked there were all very young, but like a previous reviewer states - they are eager to please.  At 5am on our departure date a young woman who was hanging out at the table in the lobby ran a few blocks to find us a cab.  It was nice but just odd - couldn't we just have called one?   The location is superb - one block from Little Italy and Chinatown.   The rooms were tiny, no view, but what we would expect in a downtown hotel.

The standard room is reasonably sized for NY and well-appointed. The personal service device had lots of good stuff loaded on it. The tub-less bathroom was grown-up sized.  We appreciated the serene d\u00e9cor of the room and common areas and the capable, courteous staff. We did have some minor glitches (a jammed closet door) and AC that lurched on and off noisily that staff responded to quickly.  The downside is that if you catch the subway (the 6 train) the closest entrance is on Canal - a horrid street unless you are here for fake bags and watches. There is a gym which we didn't use - since there are great running options - take a right down Lafayette to zoom  across the Brooklyn Bridge or go West to enjoy the parks along the waterfront. You can walk  to Little Italy, China town, SoHo, NoHo and Tribeca and the 6 takes you all the way up the East side. You may hear the subway at night - but this noise gets less frequent later in the evening and didn't bother us  as we are ex-New Yorkers. Not everyone may feel the same.

Perfect execution (thank you Marc)!\n\nIf that wasn't enough, there were some chocolate covered strawberries as well which she loved.\n\nThe room itself, had a massive terrace with great views.

Everything was so plush.\n\nOn the way out to dinner we saw Marc and he asked how everything was and if things were set up as I imagined. I told him it was actually perfect!!!

The rooms follow a beautiful Scandinavian design that brings simplicity but a nice home like feeling. The bathrooms provide plenty of space, especially for a hotel in the city. \n\nThe Blonde which is on the 2nd floor is a great bar to relax during the mid afternoon \/ early evening and during the later hours has a good mixed crowd. The Library is a great space to kick back and enjoy a coffee or two before your morning. \n\nThe hotel is a mix of traditional hospitality and modern touches. Each room has a tablet and a phone. If you prefer, you can use the tablet to interact with the room service and housekeeping or use a more traditional method and use the phone. \n\nThe 11 Howard is my go to hotel for my regular stays in Manhattan, and I always recommend this hotel to my family and friends. I always have a great experience and never a complaint. The hotel staff is very accommodating to any request, and I very much appreciate that.  \n\nThe lower floors do get small vibrations from the subway that runs under the hotel, and so I always request a room on a high floor. \n\nThe hotel has opened a lovely restaurant, Le Coucou. I hope to try it out during my next stay.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

While probably not an ideal location for the first time visitor to New York, it feels very non touristy (a plus in my book) and provided easy access to a number of different places we wanted to visit.  \nMy adult daughter and I stayed 3 nights in a double room.  Yes, the rooms are small, but are well appointed and cleverly designed.  There's a large flat screen TV that seems almost too big for the space; requests for services are made through a tablet in the room which is also loaded with information about stores, restaurants, and other businesses in the area.   We both loved the beds and the bedding; with the black out curtains drawn it was easy to sleep later into the morning than we planned.  I appreciated that the hotel honored a request for a higher floor (we were on 10) away from the elevator (good call since the elevator announces its arrival on the floor while opening the door).  We heard no noise from adjoining rooms nor in the hallway and since our room faced the rear the street noise was minimal.  The only problematic noise was from the air conditioning which cycled on and off at pretty continuous intervals.\nThe staff were young, friendly, and helpful though the one time I needed assistance getting a cab no one was to be found.  The first level is where you check-in which involves a quick process on an tablet device.  The second level houses what would be considered the lobby though it also serves as a dining spot and a business gathering place.  Complimentary coffee is served in the morning and  \"grab and go breakfasts\" (really a misnomer since they are served by a waiter) are available at a reasonable cost though it would be nice to see a gluten free bakery option added to the small menu.  The lobby is thoughtfully set up in a number of different conversation areas with small tables.  There's also a larger conference table in one area which seemed to be used by business people for meetings or in one case a loud conference call that could be heard by everyone in the room.\nI would definitely stay here again, particularly in light of the high level of friendly service, the quietness of the room, the quality and cleanliness of the room, and the interesting surrounding neighborhood.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We came back to a room with dirty rags left on the TV shelf, the floor clearly had not been vacuumed, everything was left untouched, only our bed was made & toiletries were replenished. \n\nThe staff arranged for a janitor to collect the dirty rags & offered us free drinks at the bar while they cleaned the room again but it was late & we were tired. 2 minutes later we could hear the TV blasting in the room next door (our room was connected to another room separated by a thin door) so we requested to change rooms.\n\nWe were moved to a smaller room on the Penthouse floor. Just as we closed the door we realised the AC unit was really loud. We turned it off but there was still a continuous rumbling noise. We tried to ignore it but we really couldn't stand it. We could hear a woman opposite our room complaining about the same thing. She soon moved out so we called reception again. They sent an engineer up to teach us how to switch off the AC unit. When we told him it's not that he quickly said Oh you mean that rumbling sound? Nothing can be done, all the central AC units are operating above this floor. Why don't I tell reception to move you to another floor?\n\nSo off we went AGAIN 3rd time lucky! We were given a disable friendly room with super low bath tub but it was past mid night by then, we were so exhausted we just thought whatever! Please just give us a quiet clean room!\n\nWe could see the staff tried their best to remediate the problems but the sound proofing of the rooms is literally non existent. The staff also told us they try to keep the bottom few floors unoccupied because the bar\/club on the 2nd floor is really loud & they often have complaints from guests staying on those floors?! \n\nBesides that no slippers or toothbrushes were provided. No kettle, no coffee or tea. Water is provided but you had to help yourself at reception downstairs.\n\nSo our stay wasn't the most relaxing or comfortable but we did enjoy our dinner at Le Cou Cou. The atmosphere is a bit too posh for our liking but the food was amazing. We also enjoyed having drinks at their bar, great music selection!\n\nOverall 11 Howard is an ok if you're not going to spend much time in the hotel. Just make sure you get a quiet room not on lower floors or the top floor! Its location really is a winner.

My room was simply chic, with a minimalist touch. Designed to give you exactly what you need with no unnecessary elements. And \"The Blond\" (lounge\/club) is a must see!

The hotel has a very different lobby setup than you're used to - there's a round table with free-floating staff to assist you with anything you need, including check-in\/-out, bag storage, etc.\n\nThe hotel (and the staff) is very modern chic - it looks and feels new, and the rooms are great. If you're looking at the design, you can definitely see what they're referring to when the 11 Howard mentions their \"Scandinavian design\" influences - it's all very nice, and it's distinct from other hotels you've been to (not in a better or worse way - just a different design style way). I love the tablet in the rooms used to do everything from scheduling cleanings to room service to exploring the nearby area - it's very convenient!\n\nIf you're sensitive to sound, request a high floor or quiet room. Certain rooms in the hotel are subject to the \"subway shakes\" - think of those as subtle deep bass tones. You won't feel the room vibrate or anything, but you can hear the deep vibration of the subway trains passing somewhere underneath about every hour. It won't distract or bother a heavy sleeper, but some people might be more sensitive to it.\n\nAs for the staff, every single person I interacted with was excellent, friendly, and fun. Well above your stereotypical service. Note though that they can blend in with any normal person you would see staying at the hotel. There's no standard outfit per se, though you can see the uniform\/pattern in the trendy style each of them sports. Just another unique feature of the 11 Howard.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'm usually staying in SOHO and I know almost all the hotels there. \n11 Howard is a new great addition and from now on will be my preferred choice for my frequent visits in NY. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the hotel room are a good size, luminous and I love the clear wood flooring and the pure design. The rooms are decorated in a neutral palettes of colours which is very relaxing. Everything is new and clean, which is very pleasant. The bathroom is fine and I appreciate to have a bath tube. The library (a lounge space where you can relax, and have a bite), is beautiful.\nWhat I missed is a kettle in the room, or a place where to have some hot water on the floor (coming from Asia, with 12h jet lag, I usually wake up in the middle of the night and do not want to have a room service for a herbal infusion). I would have love to have a dinner at Le COUCOU, or a drink at Le Blond the trendy restaurant and bar annexed, but apparently is a totally different management, so the team could not find a place for me which is a pity. Book at the same time you are booking the hotel room if you are interested. \nAs a side note, there is a reformer Pilates studio few steps away from the door of the hotel, where I went for a class. Very convenient. I did not tested the gym as I enjoyed running (I loved doing the Manhattan bridge which is only 15 min away).","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They had thought through all the details to make a guest feel at home.  The rooms are tastefully decorated, with beds and pillows to die for. The library on the second floor is a great place for morning coffee and reading the paper, as I did, or if you are there on business, as many of the guests seemed to be, a relaxed setting to conduct business.  All the staff seemed to be well trained to answer all our questions and needs.  They also have a great restaurant called LeCooCoo, where the food is beyond good.  And all of this is located in the heart of SoHo district and just a short walk to Little Italy and China Town.

I'm a loyal Starwood hotels member, and when I have them visit me in New York I typically have them stay uptown at Le Parker Meridien. However since the recent tie-up with Design Hotels for SPG members to take further advantage of the loyalty program I decided to book a room at 11 Howard, about which I've heard good things (it also happens to be a mere few blocks from where I live in SoHo).\n\nMy parents expressed having a wonderful stay at 11 Howard, thanks in particular to Cristian on the 11 Howard \"Creators\" team who was able to get them on the penthouse floor away from any ground floor noise. I checked on my parents' behalf to inspect the room and make sure it was fit for them; upon doing so I mentioned to the attendant at check-in that they were celebrating their anniversary. When my parents finally got in, they found a bottle of Prosecco from the hotel for them to celebrate their special occasion. At the end of their stay they shared that all the staff they interacted with during their stay at 11 Howard were courteous, professional and always willing to offer their assistance.\n\nBased on my own interactions at 11 Howard, the establishment appears to be a well-run hotel with decent sized rooms (for NY especially) whose sparse design and decor make it highly economical in space. The lack of a \"front desk\" was actually a surprisingly nice touch, removing the hassle and wait from the typical hotel check-in process. The staff - both the attendants on the ground floor and the custodial staff - were always welcoming and pleasant, always offering their service and assistance. The location is another great benefit of staying at 11 Howard: while fairly centrally located in SoHo, it still feels removed enough from the activity of Little Italy, the craziness of Broadway, and the bustle of Chinatown (but entirely accessible at the same time).\n\nI've seen reviews here that call the hotel trendy, and while to a degree that may be true, I actually consider 11 Howard a very minimalistic boutique hotel. It's a no frills no fuss hotel that still maintains a higher level of sophistication and design. Couple that with the excellent service and you have a top notch hotel that's sure to cover all basic needs of a designer hotel while also exceeding expectations.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It just opened this year, so everything is brand new and shiny. The staff and management are welcoming, very professional and eager to help. The hotel has a distinctive design theme (minimalist, Nordic, ...) which might take a bit of getting used to, but does not affect things that really matter for comfort. Our room had two super-comfortable queen-size beds. Bathroom amenities and toiletries were excellent. We were on the 9th floor, there is some amount of noise coming in from the street and the subway line below, but not much by NYC standards (certainly much more quiet than most Midtown locations!) Wi-fi is free and fast. There's plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars within a few blocks of the hotel, and there's a subway station two blocks away. Highly recommended. My only suggestion would be to make espresso machine(s) available for guests inside the hotel.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

However, it is always a challenge looking for lodging here, as you never know what you;re going to get in the same hotel - and I continually try out new places as there are so many choices, \nThis place looked promising as it came up at a fair price on a website and appears to be offering what appears to be a promotional rate.  \nThe location is nice, being near subways, Little Italy, and SoHo.  \nThe door people and staff are well trained and polite.\nHowever, first bad thing - my brother is visiting me, and I requested two beds well in advance, but I didn't get what I asked for, and there are no rollaways, no couch, no way to not sleep in the same bed, and thus we are sharing a bed, something I haven't done since we were kids. \nSecond bad thing is that I tried to check in early and I sat in the library, a second floor common room which is quite nice, and I asked them to inform me when my room was ready and.....they forgot.  So I sat around for three hours, one of them unnecessarily since my room was ready which I was sitting around.  \nTHe bump in the road after that was that they hadn't brought my luggage to the room either, so there's that. \nHowever, I was ready to forgive all that because everyone here is so nice but - there's an additional part to this narrative that is a failure of the hotel that ruined my trip.  Call me sensitive, but I guess I'm not used to being insulted my a hotel., \n\nSpecifically, this evening, I  had a lovely meal outin the neighborhood with my brother, and part of the hotel experience that is advertised by 11 Howard in its promotional literature  is that there is a trendy bar attached, called \"The Blond\", and which I was looking forward to as part of closing out the evening visit with my brother. \nExcept, when we waited at the velvet ropes, hello, the bouncers didn't even bother to look up at me. \nNow, I know I'm just a simple person from a small provincial town (San Francisco) and not trendy or important  (I manage money)  and was just looking for a night cap at a trendy new york bar that's attached to the hotel who was refused service but the bar is advertised in all of the hotel literature as being an amenity of the hotel, which makes it downright deceptive and fraudulent. Perhaps discriminatory too, since I'm an old person who is a member of a racial minority,\nIt's insulting to all guests if the hotel is good enough to take your money but not gracious enough to let you in for a drink. \nMy company has offices in NYC and I'm responsible for a budget and a staff who does business here regularly, but this is on my \"NOT RECOMMENDED\" list - how can a hotel insult its guests in this manner?  It's inexcusable, embarrassed me in front of my brother, and ruined my stay,\nI'm fuming as I write this but this place gets what it deserves. \nI'm being generous by giving it two stars, since the water in the shower is hot and the sheets are clean. \nOh, and the gym?  A joke.  My home gym is better equipped.  Don't believe everything you read.\nLesson learned.\nThanks for the education in how NOT to treat your guests, 11 Howard.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On check in I was given the wrong room due to trying to check in customers too quickly, and not being able to clearly see who is with whom.  On check out they still had not cleared the account of the last gentlemen that had checked out, and had to make me wait whilst they ran after him. Water is available in reception to take on your days out. A tablet is ion the room to make calls and order room service etc.\n\nRoom 310 is a double bedded room and has very little space between the end of the beds and the table.  I bruised my legs 7 times in 3 days.  My very slim daughter also banged her knees due to lack of space. No tea facilities in the room, and although the hotel has room service expect high end 5 star prices.  The hotel bar closes early as it becomes a night club and in room 310 you could hear the music in the bathroom and the heavy vibration from the early subway trains which lessens but continues throughout the day.  Lovely robes and toiletries in the room and it was clean.  The room does not have enough electrical sockets, 2 only and these are located in the alarm clock. The room on arrival was quite dark and the staff member was not aware that all lights have a separate dimmer switch.\n\nThe hotel is located with an easy 10 minute walk to Little Italy that has some great Italian restaurants that have sensible and lower than average prices. \n\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, but when I moved to another 5 star hotel I then realised how much work the Howard need to take on board to improve and provide value for money. as the Howard was more expensive and delivered less than some other great 5 star options. On the last day the fire alarm was on test for over 2 hours with flashing lights and we only got a letter to advise after it had happened and after a tanoy announcement. Hopefully the check in and other issues will be resolved as this is early days for a new hotel, and a reduction in prices due to lack of facilities.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The bathroom was larger then we expected and sported sleek brass fixtures - brass is back!  Rustic chic 'logs' served as side tables, however my side lacked an outlet so I either abandoned my phone waaay over on the desk or ran down the battery having it close to me.  The concierge level provides an elegant subdued retreat from the bustle of the city and it was always stocked with newspapers and lovely orange scented water.  Apparently they offer breakfast too, but I never partake.  The location is super if you're into SoHo\/West Village like we are.  Down Lafayette a few blocks and you'll find some of NYC's best restaurants.  The real hit however, was the super service.  We aren't exactly chic: I'm 54 and my husband's disability lead us to use a scooter.

We found the property by way of our Starwood Ambassador.  \n    I give 11 Howard the highest ranking for Hotels, especially in the City. There are many choices to stay in SoHo, but this is by far one of THE BEST!!  I normally have some kind of constructive criticism to offer as a suggestion, but in this case I find nothing to make better.  The Hotel fit our needs perfectly.  From the moment we checked in until after our stay, the staff went ABOVE AND BEYOND to make sure we were happy.  From remembering our name each time we walked through the Lobby or the Library, they certainly made us feel special; as if we were the only VIP's in the Hotel, even though I knew the Hotel was quite busy.   Brian at Reception is a STAR, hands down!!  Seamless, personable, and just plain kind, whether we saw him passing on the street or in the Reception area, he always had time for us.  Jessica and Will at Reception also handled our needs very well, and always had time to make sure our stay was going well.  Fannie was also quite fun...I looked forward to her dazzling smile every time I came through.  Michael was also a true professional, handling the staff up front with ease and kindness.  Quite an accommodating crew at Reception!!  There were also a few other faces that I didn't get their names, but it was a friendly team for sure.\n   We had lunch and a quick drink at the Library, and were again impressed by their speed and professionalism.  Santiago took excellent care of us, and was always charming and pleasant, each day remembering our names effortlessly.  In the evening, we brought back a few work colleagues for a drink at Blond, and Roxy took great care our needy group as well.\n   Last, but CERTAINLY not least, the General Manager Anis....OUTSTANDING does not even come close to articulating how well this man interacts and leads his staff.  A true and born leader, Anis was there to oversee it all, and you could feel and see the respect his team has for Anis and their property.  Since we travel so much for work and pleasure,  it was refreshing to see the sense of pride the 11 Howard staff had for their jobs and management.  Anis was kind, helpful, and made sure he personally interacted with as many employees and guests as he could while we visited.  We felt like royalty!! Other Executive Management should take a page (or three) from this man's book on Leadership.  Thank you, Anis.\n    I will be recommending many future guests to stay at 11 Howard.  The staff and Anis are true assets to the Company and to the SPG program.  Future travelers will be amazed at the Service levels at the Hotel.  Do yourself a favor and let the staff give you a little History of the Hotel.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for a fantastic week at 11 Howard!!  The service is extraordinary!! We will return and bring friends...","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Michael was incredibly friendly and made us feel at home, Zina directed us to some of the most incredible culinary experiences, Rob searched tirelessly for a taxi for us, and Will was happy to help us at all times!\n\nEveryone there - including the housekeeping and wait staff - was willing to go above and beyond - and was always beaming happiness.

Well, stayed in 413 and woke up at 1.30 am and realized that my room was just above a nightclub that went all out to 3 am. So very little sleep that night. Next day asked to move, and after threatening to cancel rest of the stay the suddenly were able to accommodate my request. Went to the acclaimed \"state of the art\" gym, which consisted of 3 cardio and some dumbbells in 2 hotel rooms, where you could not have 2 people training at the same time as we would not fit. The fridge contained no water, actually no water whatsoever in the gym. The alarm in my room went off in the middle of the nigh, and I was in three rooms and none of the clocks were set at the correct time. Funny example of the lack of detail at this hotel. Put my laundry bag on the bed, with filled out form, as I normally do during my 100 hotel night a year, but for the first time ever, they did not take the laundry, so it was still in the plastic bag when I got home late at night and really needed the clothes the next day. Rooms are super spartan and a bit hostel like in its feel with better quality. The most positive thing is the staff, they are really friendly and trying their best, but honestly - I spend 1\/3 of my life in a hotel and this was a truly interesting experience that I will forever avoid and I chose this hotel as I love trying new ones and this is a bit like \"the emperors new clothes\" type of hotel. New York has so many great hotels, this is not one of them.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Can't believe more hotels aren't doing this.  Seems like a no-brainer.  \n- Awesome charging dock (charges four devices at once) and doubles as an alarm clock. \n- Almost ZERO hallway noise\n- The food\/coffee options nearby were excellent (highly recommend a place across the street called Smile).  Unfortunately there is no coffeemaker in the room.\n- Excellent water pressure in the shower\n\nCONS:\n- The A\/C unit is loud.  Woke me up at night when it turned on; and when it's on you need to raise the TV volume\n- Very small bathroom -- primarily because the door opens into the bathroom.  \n- The shower leaks onto the floor because they have adopted one of those European \"half a window to cover half the bath\" things that only cover half the bathtub.  Less tacky and more sanitary than a curtain, but less effective.\n- Poor views from the room, but that's the norm in NYC\n- Shampoos and body washes were too small, which is consistent with the trend in most hotels now \n- No door stop on the wall next to the front door, so front door hits the wall when it opens\n- Library is a little bit of a wasted opportunity.  Should be more pods\/tables for individuals to work from.  Probably would be a good place to add a coffee shop, too.  \n\nOverall, I really liked it and will definitely return.   \n","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

An unexpected little treasure nicely situated between Chinatown\/Little Italy and Soho. Also very close to lots of trains. I am from NYC so staying in the city is a treat usually saved for a special occasion. The staff here were super nice and we got a chance to meet one of the managers, Marc, I think, when we were checking in which was fast and easy. He looked like he was on his way somewhere, but he took the time to show us to our room and give us a mini tour before he was on his way. So nice!\n\nThe room was nice and intimate with fragrant organic amenities and a tablet to do (almost) everything! We were able to order snacks from room service and even get a chance to decide when we wanted it to be delivered! You can call housekeeping from there and request whatever you need! They also had a phone in the room so you could call direct just in case. We also found out there was a parking lot on Elizabeth street where you could park your car (for a fee), but if you do get to park there through the hotel, they can even pick it up for you! I'm also a sucker for robes so I loved the spa robes and they even had hoods! The bed was super comfy and the towels were plush.\n\nOne of the days we were there, it was a bit rainy so we were able to get an umbrella from the front desk before we went out. They also have their own private bar area which we didn't get to because we're not really drinkers, but it's nice to have access to something exclusive ;) \n\nOverall 11 Howard is in a great location with great staff and great rooms!

Big mistake.  Though it was bright and sunny outside when we arrived, we entered a dark lobby that was depressing as hell.  The staff was nice and courteous, but nothing could prepare us for our room.  The room was too small for one guest, let alone a couple.  What the hell were they thinking? I'm quite familiar with \"New York small\", but this was ridiculous! The space between the edge of our bed and the dresser would only fit our medium size suitcase ONLY if we turned it sideways.  The room was truly claustrophobic.  And though we were up on the 6th floor, forget about getting any sleep whatsoever.  Sirens blaring so loudly throughout the entire night.  I guess the hotel never heard of insulation.  I cannot warn you enough to stay away from this place.  While the location was good, this had to be one of the worst hotels I have EVER stayed.

The rooms are small but perfectly formed. Everything is clean and fresh. The towels, pillows, bedding are perfect. So comfortable. One of the best nights sleep I have had away from home. You have to request an ironing board and iron but that's OK. We did blow the electrics by drying hair and ironing at the same time but this was sorted out very quickly.\n\nThe breakfast is excellent. Not the massive heavy fry up but light and healthy. Granola, yoghurt, fresh fruit salad, pastries, selection of teas and coffee. Everything was very fresh and tasted sublime.\n\nThe location is brilliant- near Little Italy and China Town. Near the metro. A very trendy part of the New York.\n\nWhen the staff found out we were celebrating a 70th, they were really sweet and put a few nibbles and drinks out in the room with a lovely little note- very thoughtful.\n\nThe only downside is that there is no where in the hotel to have a quiet drink in the evening if you don't want to go outside. The bar area in the hotel is used by the nightclub next door. (You can't hear it from your rooms.)\n\nOur 69 year old found the staff uniform rather upsetting as their trousers did not meet the floor. Once we explained that this was the trendy thing to do (show your ankles off), she seemed a little more accepting.\n\nOn the whole, I would whole heartedly recommended this little bit of luxury in a beautiful clean and comfy and trendy hotel!

I advised her, that i had pre checked in and as if by magic she found me and gave me my keys to my room on the 11th Floor.\n\nThe room is small, even by New York standards and considering that I had especially emailed the General Manager ahead of my arrival, I was, I must confess not impressed.  The decor is nice and clean and contemporary but is not amazing.  The bathroom is a decent size with lovely fittings and a good spacious shower, but i still have a problem with the toilet and shower being in the same room in a luxury hotel - at least at The Conservatorium they have got that right.\n\nI couldn't be bothered to complain so after dinner locally, decided to have an early night.  Imagine then my horror when at 12:15 i was awoken twice by someone using a master key to enter my room, the first occasion allegedly a mistake and the second because my door was apparently open? Suffice to say, I didn't go back to sleep.\n\nDespite being allocated a high floor the room was extremely badly sound proofed and i spent most of the night being woken by banging doors in adjacent rooms or the noise from the street below.  This is New York but a good nights sleep should be the least new hotels can offer in this day and age - comfort over design and all that. \n\nWhilst the interior of the Library is welcoming and in keeping with the Scandic theme, another thing that has been sorely overlooked by the design team is a lack of plug sockets for electric toothbrushes snd laptop computers, both of which i never leave home without.  You shouldn't have to hear the noise of fellow guests making out next door either.\n\nThe place is well situated but alas needs some serious work to address the basics and whilst i endorse the concept of conscious hospitality, there is no excuse for any of the shortcomings i experienced during my recent stay so it is highly unlikely that ai will return.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Aside from one minor service gaff - which the hotel took care of - I highly recommend this beautiful and ideally situated hotel!  The physical space - rooms, library, entry lobby - are all beautiful with many subtle details that set this hotel apart from a W or a JW Marriott, such as the leather wrapped handles on the entry doors.  The staff was young, and eager to please, always there to open a door, hail a cab or ask if you were being helped. The rooms are small - but, hey, this is a NY hotel - but are attractive with clean lines and light wood interiors.  Bed was very comfortable!  The workout area is split it into three small rooms on the 3rd floor - one each for yoga, weights and aerobic exercise.  Each room is very small, so if you would like to get a real workout in, probably better to just go for a run outside.  Also, the aerobic room had two treadmills and one elliptical machine, but no stationery bike and the room barely has space for these three side-by-side.  The weight room was essentially a rack of dumbbells and one weight bench, nothing else.  The minor service gaff I mentioned was due to a recent change in policy from offering complimentary conti breakfast in the library to a \"charge to your room\" policy.  When I entered the library, I was told it was complimentary, only to have another employee rush up to me when I left to ask me my room number, so I could be charged.  The staff downstairs removed the breakfast charge from my bill, when I mentioned it to them.  Overall, I highly recommend this hotel!","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Some places like this try to be too cool, especially in that neighborhood. And sometimes, part of being cool is being cold or standoffish. Not at all here. Really nice bar where we had a very friendly waitress. Really nice staff all around.

Fortunately i didn't have to look ar at all, as right across the street was this new gem, 11 Howard. It's a very new hotel, having been opneed just a week when I checked in, but the rooms were all done and ready. \nStaff were in the ground floor lobby with iPads waiting to greet you and check you in, but oddly there are no seats so you all stand while they tap away and register you. It's  fast process though and you're then up to the room. \nThe room is not large but well laid out\u2014it actually is smaller than the room I had at NoMo SoHo, but that room could not even fit in an armchair, while the one in 11 Howard had a desk, chair and armchair. And more importantly, unlike the absurd design of Nomo SoHo where the sink is outside the bathroom (!!), the bathroom at 11 Howard is a proper one with a sink, lots of counter space, a beautiful spacious shower, etc. \nAnd they even provide bedroom slippers!\nThey have a small but well-equipped gym.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Where to start ? 11H is the quintessential trendy boutique hotel in NYC. Idealy located in Soho, the place is stunning, decorated with a lot of taste, feeling like it has been here for ever but at the same time like no other. The main entrance doesn't have the typical reception counter, you're greeted by the friendly staff in a modern space that makes you feel like you are entering your home building. The front desk is smartly located on the second floor in a very loungy space they call the library. The staff is the friendliest and coolest I even met, considering the place opened so recently, I wasn't expecting so much professionalism and reactivity to all our requests. I got the chance to meet the General Manager during breakfast, we was very nice to us and making sure we had everything we wanted. The rooms have everything we needed, very clean, bright, quiet and confortable (important detail: very accessible power plugs for charging phones next to beds). Last but not least, we enjoyed a few nights at le blond, the bar\/club located on the second floor. The crowd and atmosphere was excellent.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I'm 5 months pregnant and she's 4. I was a little worried that the hotel might not be right for us but I have to say we had the best stay!!!\n\nThe pros:\nThe ENTIRE staff is extremely friendly. They called my daughter by name the whole weekend and were so accommodating. They even sent us up a little treat and a sweet note wishing us well for the weekend which was so very sweet.\nThe hotel (is new.....) and extremely clean and very well kept. The decor is simple and calming. \nThe beds are extremely comfy and the linens soft and plush\nLocation is AWESOME. It's on a quiet corner but just a block away in one direction to Chinatown and a block away in another direction to Soho! \nThe Subway lines are RIGHT THERE. (NQR is the closest, and is about 15-20 mins to Herald Square\/Times Square)\nGood food options nearby\nThe 2nd floor \"Library\" space is really nice to hang out\nComplimentary breakfast is tasty!\nAnd - it is very quiet - meaning, i've stayed in many hotels in NY and i can always hear street noise - almost no matter what floor i'm on. I was on the top floor for our visit and could not hear a PEEP all night. It was SO peaceful.\nWe are SPG members -(Gold) they were very good about honoring SPG benefits (even though the website said it would be limited) but we got upgraded and an early check-in and late check-out - that was nice!\n\nCons:\nThe rooms are small - it's boutique! It didn't bother us, but if you're used to big hotel rooms, this is not it, the closet space is pretty tiny and not many drawers for your clothes.\nThe bathroom is really nice and tastefully decorated but it's a shower - no tub.\n\nProns (Pros or Cons depending on how you look at it!)\nThe staff was extremely fantastic to my kid, but... the guests are more of the soho-ish type. i.e. not that into kids...! Could have just been the weekend I was there, but a few shi-shi guests eyeballed us a bit (and i have an extremely well behaved child!) \n\nOverall:\nI would definitely come back (and probably will). We were there 2nd week of opening, so... will be interesting to see if they can keep up appearances and friendliness in a years time - which I think everyone was extremely genuine so i have no doubt but you never know!\nBeing able to use points here was nice (we usually do the Westin or the W - this was a much more relaxing and quieter visit so a big plus). \n\nThanks to the 11 Howard Staff for a great weekend!

After our complimentary room upgrade to a King Howard, the friendly staff escorted us to our rooms. Shortly after, they delivered our bags along with complimentary bottled waters and artesian chocolates. \n\nOn top of the absolutely stunning and comfortable room, the hotel's amenities including the \"Library\" which serves as the front desk\/guest work area and lively bar, The Blond, were top notch. Note that The Blond is open to the public until 9\/10pm when entrance becomes exclusively guest list only (hotel guests are not guaranteed).\n\nGiven that our stay happened to be over 11Howard's opening weekend, the service and overall quality of the hotel may have been at its peak. If the hotel management can continue to perform at this caliber, 11Howard will be a name to be reckoned with in the New York boutique hotel space. Definitely did not look forward to checking out.
