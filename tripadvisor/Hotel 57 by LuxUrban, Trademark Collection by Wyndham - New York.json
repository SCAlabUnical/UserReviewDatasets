The wooden panels next to the A\/C vent look like they were just placed on and if you sat on it for a second you could have easily broken it. The room definitely feels like it was pieced together last minute, but I didn't care because of the price\/location and we didn't plan on spending much time in the room anyways.\n\nMy main issue is that I booked this hotel with credit card points and was told by the initial front desk staff that it was pre-paid and nothing else had to be paid besides a $150 refundable deposit for potential damages. I stayed for 2 nights total and checked my credit card statement and found a charge for $311.xx and the $150 deposit still pending. First off, if you're going to charge additional fees there should be some sort of communication or invoice with the customer. This is a horrible business practice to randomly charge someone's card with ZERO communication. Secondly, what would I potentially be getting charged for? We were barely in the room and I was already informed everything was pre-paid by the initial receptionist and that the only thing was a $150 refundable deposit.\n\nI called the front desk to bring up this issue today and was put on hold 3 TIMES after getting in one sentence in between each hold by Jennifer for a total of 20 minutes. If you need to handle other customers that's fine, but the fact that she was not helpful and rude while constantly putting me on hold gives me a sense of how this hotel operates. After finally looking into my situation that should have only taken a few minutes I was told to \"reach out to my bank\" as an initial response like she didn't want to help at all. After pushing for a direct answer because your hotel charged my card, so there should be some paper trail or invoice to refer to, not my credit card company as some generic response to get me your back, she finally replied \"The refund should take 2-3 weeks, let me email the GM for further help.\" This tells it all, that she had the ability to help me from the beginning, but told me to reach out to my credit card company like it was their fault that their hotel charged my card as some cop out answer really leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I don't expect to get a refund for the 311.xx charge and deposit in 2-3 weeks and I expect that I'll have to reach out to my credit card company to dispute the charges, but we'll see.\n\nOverall, thanks to the initial hotel workers, but everything after has been absolutely horrible.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

He had left the premises and finally arrived to book us in, with no apologies.

All communal areas on room levels are old and tired - like going back to the 70\u2019s! Then it gets worse - the rooms are awful! Very old - loads of wooden panelling and hardly any storage. For a family of 4 we had to live out of our cases for 4 days. We had to get the next days clothes out of cases and put them over chairs or on the window ledge. Just enough room to walk around the beds and that was it! Cases had to be placed in the bathroom as nowhere else to put them! Only saving grace is the beds are comfortable! But don\u2019t look under them - filthy and haven\u2019t been cleaned in a very long time!\nThe only positive is the location on 57th - 5 mins to Bloomingdales, Tiffany\u2019s or Subway at 59th.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

During our stay there was an issue with our room that led to a burst pipe and flooding of our room. As we were checking out (2 days after the incident occured) I was informed that the $1,000 damages charge on my credit card had been declined and asked to provide alternative payment.\nUpon asking to the manager he rudely asserted that the damage was our fault as we had not noticed a small sign written in English only to refrain from placing items on a vent as they *may* cause damage. Even in the case it was agreed the damage was our fault we were not informed of the charge or given an invoice whilst we were there and still able to discuss it, instead the hotel tried to place an arbitrary charge with informing us. Furthermore we agreed to discuss this further once an itemised invoice has been sent to us but the manager saw fit to place the charge on the credit card again (without my authorisation) which has no gone through. Since then we have received no communication and the hotel is ignoring our attempts to get in contact with them. As mentioned, even if we did not dispute that the damage was our fault, it is not acceptable to place the charges without communication or explanation, nor is it proper business practice to lie and ignore communications requesting information we are legally entitled to.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting behaviour and customer service.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

But my god the lifts were slow and full quite often. \nThere was a water and ice machine on the 12th floor which was great but annoying when you needed to fill your bottle up in the night. \nThere was no fridge in the room which was sad. We had a coffee machine which we used for hot water, they gave us coffee but no English breakfast tea so we made a note to ask. \nBed was comfy and air con worked fine. Shower gel was empty and wasn\u2019t filled up the entire time we were there (5 nights).  \n\u2018Breakfast\u2019 is advertised as \u2018grab & go\u2019 and it consisted of 2 water dispensers and paper cups, loads of green tea teabags, hot water and paper cups and the same 3 varieties of pastries\/ muffins. When I asked somebody if there was any fruit or English breakfast tea I was told \u2018no\u2019. One of the staff said they were going through a change of management, but I read somebody said that on a review about a month ago. Like I said we stayed here 5 nights and there are only so many muffins and pastries you can eat. \nOne member of staff was quite rude to me in the breakfast room and snatched my water bottle out of my hand. Wasn\u2019t greatly impressed with that. \nThe location was really great, we were up and out most days so really only needed a place to crash.

Preguntamos si ten\u00edan informaci\u00f3n para hacer excursiones, y no tenian contacto con ninguna agencia ni supieron asesorarnos a donde consultar ( nos dijeron busquen en internet). Otro punto a tener en cuenta que creo que lo aclara pero es importante considerar, es que las hab no tienen frigobar ni heladera. Por \u00faltimo y lo que mas nos disgust\u00f3, es que el dia que haciamos el check out quisimos dejar unas horas las valijas antes de irnos al aeropuerto, y nos dijeron que nos tenian que cobrar 5 usd por valija ( cosa que de entrada cuando llegamos las dejamos tambien hasta que nos dieran la habitacion y nos nos cobraron nada). Es la primera vez que nos pasa tanto a nosotros como a familiares y conocidos que cobren por dejar la valija unas horas el mismo dia que estas dejando el hotel. Pedi libro de quejas, y no ten\u00edan...... la gente de la recepci\u00f3n muy amablemente me dio el mail del gerente a quien le escrib\u00ed, me respondi\u00f3 con mucha celeridad y segun \u00e9l esto estaba aclarado cuando uno reserva ( cosa que cuando nosotros reservamos no lo decia). Y segun el gerente, lo cobran en todos los hoteles, cosa que tampoco nos paso ni a nosotros ni a ning\u00fan conocido. Por \u00faltimo, como nos cobraron 15 usd por las 3 valijas que dejamos en guarda, ped\u00ed una factura por los cargos que nos iban a cobrar, y aun estoy esperando que me la manden..... en s\u00edntesis, no volver\u00eda a elegir el hotel. Seg\u00fan los empleados de recepci\u00f3n, hab\u00edan cambiado justo los due\u00f1os y estaban modificando algunas pol\u00edticas del hotel, no se si eso tendr\u00e1 que ver.

Location - absolutely fantastic. Hardly used the subway, so easy to walk anywhere (weather was on our side). Brilliant\n2. View - we were on the top floor. While not quite suitable for my fear of heights, the view was fantastic and a nice spot to sit with a beer after walking around town the whole day.\n3. Daniel from concierge - lovely guy, very helpful and always smiling. Thanks buddy. \n4. Also the team member who helped us set the sofa bed on the first night, sorry for not getting your name but you made us feel straight at home. Thank you.\n\nWhat could be done to improve:\n1. Bar staff - could show more compassion and respect to the young generation. When a child is getting herself a glass of water, it is advised not to mutter how glass and ice usage are only for paying customers (btw - we were). This was already discussed with the relevant team at the hotel and am certain it was handled correctly by them.\n2. Bar in general, would have been nice if it was open every night but I guess this is based on experience and actual usage of the bar.\n3. Sofa bed - looks fantastic as a sofa but quite hard as a sofa bed, even for a young child.\n\nOverall, would recommend this hotel, for its location most of all.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

With tiny rooms, blocked public areas, and outrageous charges, it is unlikely we\u2019d ever stay here again.\n\nRooms -- The rooms were not nearly as shown on the website.  Our room, one of the few with a terrace, was substantially smaller than the terrace room shown on the website.  The website showed multiple flat surfaces (vital for travelers.)  Our had only a small desk.  No other accessible flat surfaces.  The only storage drawers were three tiny drawers in the nightstands.  Lighting was inadequate or non-existent except in the bathroom.  Windows were inadequately insulated, so, even up at the 15th floor, we were awakened by sirens at all times of the night.  There was only one chair, at the desk.  With two people, one had to sit on the bed.  While the room was adequate for sleeping, it was totally inadequate for spending much waking time.\n\nPublic Area -- With such minimal furnishing in the rooms, you would think they would provide public areas to relax and congregate.  There were two small seating areas, holding perhaps 6 people total, in the lobby.  There was also a lounge that could accommodate 20-30 people, and did so for continental breakfast until 11AM. However, access to the lounge was blocked all afternoons, and most evenings.  This area should have remained accessible to guests at all times.\n\nValue for Money -- Hotel 57 is not a good value for the money.  Our rate for a week-long stay was $445 per night, including an outrageous $40 \u201cresort.\u201d fee and tax.  Friends, this is not a resort.  The fee covers a never used \u201cgym,\u201d business center, the above mentioned breakfast (which cost $6.00 around the corner at Matto) and internet access.  That comes to more than $30 per day for internet, more than it costs on most cruise ships.  There are many hotels with better amenities for much less money.

Also, the classic NYC old-fashioned feeling restaurant next door had a surprising gluten free menu filled with yummy options, and as a celiac that was a wonderful surprise. The hotel location is great too. Cons were basically similar to what other visitors have mentioned. After I posted an initial negative review here because I had no luck getting someone to contact me regarding issues and questions I had, management then was very responsive and I appreciate their efforts. I would consider staying at Hotel 57 again.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Kind, friendly, responsive staff.  But I am so sad about this hotel where I\u2019ve been staying since it was a Marriott and had a restaurant and coffee\/cocktail area (at least 8 years).  The rooms are so deteriorated and dated.  Painted an old, faded pinky beige.  We had a junior suite this time, with an old, hard futon (\u201cpull out couch\u201d) and a couple of pleather footrests for a table.  The bathroom is a real problem.  The walls Surrounding the bathroom are topped with opaque glass, meaning that if you have to get up in the night you can\u2019t turn on the light without waking everyone else up.  We navigated with our phones.  The little lobby is filled with flight attendants and pilots who have contracted to stay in between flights.  Tiny rooms, which is why we took a jr suite this time.  There was a $40 amenity fee!  For what?  The one pathetic bottle of body lotion was old and rancid.  I recognized it from the Marriott days.  Not from the same line as in the shower (attached to the wall). There was an oldish keurig coffee maker hidden in the closet, but no one refreshed the plastic cups or coffee.  The pictures look nothing like the rooms.  Old, old.  I wish they would fix this up, because it\u2019s getting seedy.  I\u2019m somehow attached to this little hotel, but it could be a very lovely boutique hotel. The new owners don\u2019t seem to care anymore.  Too bad.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

I love the location and the overall vibe of the hotel. I have NEVER been so disappointed with a hotel in general, never mind the service and cleanliness. After an 8 hour flight delay I was excited to check into a hotel I have always adored. Arriving to the hotel, I noticed they have moved the lobby and consolidated it making it much smaller with no public space. When I arrived to the front desk, the gentleman who assisted me seemed to  rush the process (something I usually want to happen) but to the extent that I had no idea what was going on. I heard \"upgrade\" something I was hoping would happen as I'm a Gold Bonvoy member, but wasn't informed of the room category\/type. Pleased with this news, I was excited to get into my room and relax briefly before heading to our reservations for dinner. Turning the lights on, the room was much smaller than the room I originally reserved (300SF superior queen room) this room was 260 SF, which was confirmed by the hotel manager Joyce. Aside from the room size and being downgraded from the room I originally booked was the issue of cleanliness. While the majority of the public spaces are clean, the room was NOT. The shower head was infested with mold, the tub had standing water in it and the floor seemed grimy. The bed skirt also had mold and marks, it seems as though they haven't changed out or cleaned the bedskirt in a decent amount of time. The sheets had small black specs that could be brushed off and the headboard was falling apart, I even had the nails\/hardware on top of my pillow. The next morning I met with Joyce, to see if my original room was available to move to, and she noted that the hotel was fully booked and nothing could be done. The customer service isn't how I remembered it- employees would go out of their way to please you and make your stay memorable and enjoyable- not this time. Even the smallest request of asking for a pint glass from the lounge to use for iced water in the morning was declined. \nThis stay was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend. A visit New York, a special place for us and visit all things we miss. I am extremely disappointed and saddend with this visit, something that I thought would be a surefire gift with outstanding service and was everything but.

Location of the hotel was also great for the Lexington Ave, 59th St and 53rd St Metro, as well as Bloomingdales, Tiffanys and Central Park. Not as busy as Times Sq, which worked for us. Also, great for Marathon route as two blocks up from part of the route. Managed to access all the City visitor spots when required with ease as well.

Despite being in an historic building, the hotel was over-modernized and stripped of all its character.

There was only one nightstand, but lots of less-than-useful cabinetry.  Lighting in the bedroom area is via small low-voltage spotlights and very dim.  And you need two keys here, a white one (NFC) for the room and a black one (magnetic stripe) for the elevator.  The black key demagnetizes itself just from looking at it.   In four days, I had to have it reprogrammed three times, just to ride the elevator!

HOWEVER, this hotel which I DID stay in before was not up to par.  \n\nThe ONLY person I would exempt from this is Raymond.  Check in was quick and easy and as my handicapped cousin was joining me for one night I had requested a larger bed even though I had booked a queen.  Unfortunately it was downhill from there.\n\nThe room was fine but the tub was slow to drain, no robes in the rooms that needed two trips from housekeeping.  Hairs found on the bed.  And Ive visited nyc frequently so Im aware of the noise level but it was unbearably loud.  I could not get ANY sleep as there was construction and drilling right outside.  The windows do not filter ANY noise.  Diane from the front desk said there were NO rooms until 3pm which was fine so down we go at 3pm and waited for the room we were reassigned to be ready.  \n\nWe go up and its a queen bed.  So back down we go and Im told \"sorry, the construction is the city, its not our fault.\" I asked if there were any king beds on a higher floor and got \"sorry, you should have actually been charged for a bigger bed.\" As Im about to reach in my bag for my wallet, I get \"We have no king beds available as theyre all booked. Theres one other but its the same floor and still likely loud\" Sorry but what a load of crap.  So Im told I have to pay, which I was readily able to do and even if I was, there was no availability? \n\nThis hotels standards are NOT up to par and with the supply of nice hotels in midtown youre better picking a different one. My stays at Warwick, Intercontinental, and Lex were are superior to Ren57.\n\nIm sure the usual response of \"we apologize and hope to make your stay better next time\" is what Ill get but listen to me and the other reviewers here, there is no accountability and no effort to make your stay comfortable except condescension. I leave two stars instead of one because of Raymond who was nothing short of courteous and professional.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I booked the highest category room, a skyloft suite, on the Marriott website at a regular rate.   I arrived today with my family and was told at checkin that I was \u201cupgraded\u201d to a carriage house suite.  \n\nWhen I arrived in the 5th floor room I found a small two room suite with no Terrasse or view and small windows.   I called the front desk, and the agent there assured me that my suite was the same category and same size as the sky loft suite. I asked to be changed to the room that I had booked, and she kept me on hold for about five minutes until the manager came on. He then explained to me that there had been a pipe break in the sky loft suite and that it was not possible to put anyone there.\n\nI wonder whether there is only one. I doubt it.\n\nHe assured me that the carriage house suite and skyloft suite are the same size, and the only differences is no Terrace.  He offered me 35,000 points compensation for the circumstances and apologized that the front desk people didn\u2019t tell the truth. I had little time today and was with my wife and daughter so had no other choice but to accept.\n\nTonight I looked at the website and it turns out, unsurprisingly, that the carriage house suite is 36 m\u00b2 and the skyloft suite is 51 m\u00b2.\n\nBottom line, I was downgraded, will be charged the same amount for the higher category room, and misled twice. First at the front desk who tried to pitch this to me as an upgrade. And then by the manager who assured me the suites were the same size.\n\nThe room decor is decent and location fine, but that does not remotely make up for this treatment.\n\n","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very kind, professional, efficient staff at front desk, door, and the lounge. Everyone with whom I interacted was wonderful and service-oriented. Also, everything in my room was functioning, clean, and relatively modern. They don't have room service, but I actually didn't mind going to their little lounge to get my glass of wine - it was cheaper and they were fine with either staying there or making me feel welcome to take it back to my room. My room was noisy with street noise, and I was on the first guest room floor, so there was a lot machine noise from below, but I get it - I booked my room late; it's NYC; etc.\n\nNow. I know that I booked my room 2 days before my stay. I know that it's mid-town Manhattan, and 2 blocks from Central Park. I know that with those factors, I might expect to pay a premium. And I know space is valuable in NYC and rooms can be on the smaller side compared to other cities. So please don't think I'm naive about what's reasonable. That's not my complaint. My objection is that the hotel even sells the room I had (and I have to assume many others the same size). It was MINISCULE. My room was a double bed, with literally ONLY room to walk around the bed on all sides. Maybe 2 feet on each side - maybe. (Plus a tiny bathroom, where you had to climb around the sink to get in the tub\/shower.) I am not exaggerating. I like to do yoga when I travel, and the only place I had any room was from the room door to the bed (which was just the depth of the bathroom), and in that space, there was not sufficient room to extend my arms. \n\nA room like this should not exist to stay in....AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR OVER $700\/NIGHT.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Overall, we felt that it did not measure up to the standard that we have come to expect at a Renaissance property.\n\nOur first room looked tired. There were no curtains just simple Venetian blinds, no pictures or wall decorations, and most importantly, no drawers and very limited storage space at all. The lighting was not very effective, especially for reading in bed. The bathroom had been renovated, but still had limitations. The sink had no stopper and the bath\/shower no grab bars and a smooth tub bottom. The staff did, however, provide, upon request, a bath mat to mitigate the danger. The toilet had to be replaced as it did not evacuate even after multiple flushes. Finally, the room was very noisy, with street noise and sirens throughout the night. These noises were not diminished as there were only Venetian blinds on the windows.\n\nNow, the good. Firstly, the staff. They were friendly and accommodating to our requests. They offered useful advice for dining and transportation to the airport on departure. They also accommodated our request for a change of room to a quieter location, which they effected efficiently. The room was on a higher floor on a quieter side and the windows had noise dampening curtains. Unlike the initial room, there was sufficient storage space, including drawers and effective lighting, a great improvement. For our visit, we found the location to be excellent, central to the attractions that we wanted to visit from Broadway, to Fifth Avenue, to the \"Museum Mile\".\n\nThe hotel was under some renovations, which we hope will extend to the rooms and return it to the Renaissance class.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Disappointed i headed to my room but decided to check the app where there wasn\u2019t a single notification of this in the booking process.  Nothing I love better than a customer service LIE.  I went back down figuring I could walk to get a snack but stopped by the desk pretty irate and hangry at this point.  Front desk guy continues lying who called his manager over who was completely dismissive of the situation saying it was on the site, completely forgetting the app lie.  When i said your company encourages people to book on the app, she could care less and told me to call customer service .  I asked to use the phone and she told me that\u2019s for customers (I guess Lifetime titanium elite doesn\u2019t make me one).   When I mentioned there\u2019s no minibars and I\u2019d like A soda I was told the bar has them but closed 5 mins earlier so no dice.  Great information and effort.  \n\nRudeness up and down and when I called the 800 # was put on a 20 minute hold  - all this time missing food and my chance to work in the my room.  30 minutes later I returned with food from another hotel (not that they would offer to go get for me).\n\nHands down - THE WORST 4-star experience I have ever had.

In NY with so many choices who wants to eat in a hotel.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet even on the 8th floor.   But then hotel is definitely tired and rooms are in need of renovation.  Our room had virtually no lighting.   We had one small lamp, and limited light in the closet area.   Literally had to use the flashlight on the cell phone to see things in the closet or safe.   There were no working entrance hall lights and none of the switches alongside the bed controlled anything.  For a king superior  room it was very small.  There was no recognition of my platinum status or was any of my preferences even noted or recognized.

The bathroom was a big and stocked with a decent amount of toiletries and plenty of towels- we had a half bath which was perfect for when you've spent all day on your feet.\nThe gym was great for a small hotel and got a big thumbs up from my son and husband. Although weather was too chilly for sitting out on roof terrace but we did pop up for a look and take in the great view, I imagine in warmer weather it would be lovely.\nThe location of this hotel is perfect, close to the hub of things but quiet enough to be relaxing and escape some of the hustle and bustle.\nLastly I want to give 5* to the staff, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left they we friendly and super helpful. On our last day after check out our luggage was safely stowed away while we had a last day exploring the city before catching a late flight.

Great neighborhood with lots of food and shopping options outside the hotel.  The hotel is dated and in need of an overhaul.  It's very clean and my room was spacious, but it was the little things that matter.  The lounge for premium guests was big and located just past the lobby on the first floor.  It had bottled water and a great coffee\/espresso machine for all day use.  \n\nI had a queen room with a terrace (I specifically booked the terrace room to enjoy a little bit of the city from my hotel room).  The terrace door between my room and the patio was locked.  I tried to call the front desk to ask them to unlock it (it was a deadbolt with a key) only to find the phone in my room did not work.  I did speak with someone in person at the front desk and they promised to get it unlocked (the front desk staff were surprised it was even locked in the first place).  Despite two separate requests to get the door unlocked during my stay, it never happened.  The phone was also never fixed so I could not call a third time to ask.  The room description online indicates there were robes in the room, however, there were none.  Overall, this is a fine hotel but the lack of attention to detail and outdated decor would make me pick another property next time I'm in this area.

Now, the lobby is on street level with a tiny lounge in the back only open M-F.  The restaurant closed a year or so ago I was told and there were no dining options .. as a Lifetime Marriott Plat, I honestly thought full service props were required to have an onsite restaurant and likely will write corporate to ask them.     The rooms haven't been updated at all since the prop I think converted to a Renaissance around 2010 .. carpet is dirty, tired - furniture is old, no USB or anything modern.    \n\nI really considered a 2 for the rating but the staff still tries.

And there was lots of space in the room (especially for New York) \u2014 so this tells me that there used to be furniture but probably got tossed out when it got old, and has not been replaced.\n\nThe window coverings also seemed to be slapped in there, but not really designed for the windows.

Although the hotel itself did not have a restaurant, there was a small bar in the lobby, but the hours never seemed to line up with ours (that may have been more on us than on them).  However, we discovered several little restaurants within a block or two that were fabulous venues (one has a Cabaret show every Sunday night starting at 9:00!).

From the moment I walked in -- every time I walked in over the course of a three-night stay -- I was made to feel so welcome that I couldn't help but smile. Every bellman (I wish I'd gotten their names) went out of their way to look me in the eye and greet me, and it wasn't the off-putting, cynical, expecting a tip kind of friendliness that often mars the experience at many hotels.\n\nHousekeeping was similarly gracious, and more importantly, did a stunning job of keeping this older property not only clean, but fresh.\n\nThe stars, however, were Lucy and Serena (I hope I spelled her name right) at the front desk. They were pure joy, and had me laughing every time I saw them, while also being remarkably efficient with guest after guest. Even when I had a complaint (I was given a terrible room -- dark, stark, depressing -- for the first night. It was an upgrade from the one I'd booked, thanks to platinum status, but still pretty awful...details below) there was no way to be upset, because these two lovely humans softened the blow with warmth and kindness. Though the hotel was booked the night I arrived, but Lucy found me a much nicer room for the remainder of my stay, and I was truly grateful.\n\nThe biggest problem this hotel has, is the room decor. The first room I had (310, near the small business center and the gym) was larger than some, but was so bare-bones that I actually laughed. Not just dated, which can happen, but so terribly designed and haphazardly slapped together, that the underlying message is that guests simply aren't important enough to be given a pleasant experience. Tons of random outlets scarring the walls, the cheapest-looking\/feeling desk I've seen since the 1970s (seriously, Motel 6 wouldn't be caught with something of this quality) awkwardly set against a wall that was way too big for it, and harsh, compact fluorescent lighting...and not enough of it, at that. I can make allowances for the fact that there was only one small window -- I knew this was an older NY building when I booked the stay -- but the tiny, single-panel, horizontally sliding, supposedly decorative blackout shade was absurd, a random piece of fabric that had nothing to do with the rest of the room. The same can be said for the artwork -- really nice black-and-white NYC photographs -- seemed to be just thrown on the walls. It was like someone said, \"we're supposed to put decorative art in our rooms,\" but had no idea that it's supposed to make the room feel better to guests. Even the placement of drinking glasses (I didn't see them until the second morning..they were in the closet?!?) screamed that the designer couldn't care less about the guest experience. The apparently new thermostat was placed in the same spot as the old one, but it had a smaller footprint, and no could be bothered to paint the wall so we couldn't tell. The only things that saved the room were the incredibly comfortable bed -- mattress, pillows, and sheets -- pleasant carpet design, bathroom, and the aforementioned brilliant housekeeping.\n\nThe second room (1405) was much better -- including more windows, better placed furniture, and a comfy, stylish couch -- but many of the same absurdities remained. Also, while the first room had a tub, this one didn't, even though there was clearly enough space for one (in fact, I am guessing they removed the tub when they redesigned the bathroom.) I'll never understand why some hotels seem to think that limiting our options in that way is somehow a good thing. \n\nFinally, there was a cold snap in NY this weekend, and the heat in the second room wouldn't kick on, regardless of how high I set the thermostat. The front desk said that they would send someone up to fix it, but I never found the right moment to ask for it, so that's on me.\n\nBottom line: this physical property has a staff that is much better than it is. I can only hope that management brings the physical experience up to the same level as the personal one.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

This was one of those hotels.  I was greeted at the door kindly enough by the sincere bellman, but that is where the service stopped.  Immediately as I walked up to the front desk, it was if I was one of the minions who dare to stay at this hotel.  (Mind you, I am an Elite member of Marriott, but clearly that does not matter here).  I booked what was available on the app whilst I was at the airport, getting bumped off a flight.  I was happy to find a room despite the last minute booking.  I kindly asked if I could have my usual upgrade and a tub to soak my aching body.  The front desk attendant coldly replied \"Well, we've been oversold forever.  So, I highly doubt it.\"  I quickly told him I booked the room an hour ago, so please look and he just rolled his eyes with disdain like \"Do I have to?\"  He looked over the the other female attendant and pointed to my room reservation muttering something of the like \"she booked our smallest room.\"  Honestly, that was my only choice given and who really cares?  I do not expect to be treated like royalty, but I do think loyal members - no ANY human being - should be treated respectfully, regardless of room size.  She noticed my status and smiled and said \"give her this room.\"  He looks up and says \"You'll get your tub, but not an upgrade\" coldly in my face.  Sheesh.  Now the room.  Small - let's just say I haven't seen something so small in years.  The distance between the door and the bed was about 5 feet and the bed to the window, well, that was mere inches (let alone my carry on bag actually couldn't fold out completely on the floor...anywhere).  The tiny bathroom was renovated and the bed was comfortable enough.  But, shangri-la it wasn't.  So, if you book the lowest rate, know that you're getting a cracker box and do not be surprised.  Beyond sleeping and bathing, I barely used the room to prevent from feeling claustrophobic.  Congrats to other reviewers who were elite members that got huge rooms and balconies.  I wasn't one of them.  There are NO services for Elite members on the weekend....no food, happy hour, nothing.  Now I know you travelers who think this is a complete first class complaint.  But, when you spend quite a bit of money to stay loyal, you want the perks.  The perks make the difference to your stay and to your wallet.  I was told Elite members would get extra points for this inconvenience.  I got ZERO extra points.  i just got credit for the stay, that is it...oh, and a bottle of water.  They'll get points for location, but that's it.  The construction and the service was enough to never want to come here again.  Save your money - there are hundreds of other 3-4 star hotels better than this one, which tarnishes the Renaissance name.  Skip this one.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The system in order to show me a better rate changed it after I put in the correct date I assume to show me a better rate.  Well I didn't notice and booked the room and saw that it said that my reservation was in 29 days.  I called WITHIN 30 SECONDS to Priceline who called the hotel and BOTH CLAIM its the other companies responsibility to cancel the reservation.  I then had the choice through the hotel to either pay 150 more for the night or lose the money due to the fact that I do not want, need and cannot use the date a month from now due to the fact that I am staying at the hotel because my husband is in the hospital for BRAIN CANCER. I have gone back and forth with both companies for the last hour and no one will take responsibility so I had to suck it up so so I do not lose 130 bucks I have to pay an additional 150 so I can have the room for tomorrow for a total of maybe 5 hours to shower and close my eyes while my husband rests after a procedure on his BRAIN.  I do not believe that this cannot be fixed by the hotel.  I informed them I have stayed there 11 times since Feb\/18 (whether booked under my name or my fathers name) and they do not care.  I am letting Renaissance know right now that due to this I will never stay there after Monday.  I have no choice on Monday but after that....that is it.

You are screwing people who are fighting brain cancer with a brand new baby, and a new house to pay for.  \nI will make sure everyone that can know about this will know about this.

We are Marriott rewards members and stay pretty loyally at Marriott hotels for both leisure and business travel. Generally we are able to check-in early with advanced notice if needed. An advanced notice was given in this scenario (2 mos) and it was confirmed that we could check-in at 10 AM when we arrived. We arrived around 10:30AM and were told that check in was not until 3PM. My account was noted, but the front desk employee let me know that an early check-in would not be possible. This was slightly upsetting as we had planned to get to the room, freshen up and then explore the city for the rest of the day. We went to lunch, meandered and then arrived back at 3PM on the dot ready to check-in. Surprise! Our room wouldn't be ready for another hour. Back out into the city for an hour. 4PM, room still not ready due to some \"late checkouts.\" We did not get into our room until almost 5PM, and no apologies were made. The staff were not accommodating at all, and honestly they were at this point annoyed with our requests to check into our room. \n\nOnce we got into the room everything was nice. The rooms are larger than they appear on the website. We found the entire place to be clean, well decorated, the doorman was incredibly nice and helpful!

The location is great and the staff is friendly, the rooms are always clean and the prices surprisingly reasonable for the location.  Great for a 1-2 night business trip.\n\nThat said, I've never gotten a good night's sleep here.  They have the HVAC controls preprogrammed to a heat setting of 73\u00b0F and an AC setting of 75\u00b0F.\n\nI sleep in 68-69\u00b0F, and realize this is unusual.  At most properties (I'm on the road more than I'm \"home\") it's just a simple matter of turning the temperature down.  I actually can't sleep above about 71\u00b0F.\n\nThese thermostats are preprogrammed in a way that makes it impossible to manually alter the temperature for more than about 2 hours. After that it returns to the pre-programmed settings above, including turning on the heat until it reaches 73 degrees.\n\nKnowing this had been a problem before, I spoke with the front desk about the temperature and they assured me that maintenance would come up and fix it. When I returned I checked in at the front desk again and they told me maintenance had fixed the problem.\n\nI don't know whether or not maintenance actually went in, and I don't know whether or not maintenance understood my request or somehow it was Lost in Translation between the front desk. However the net result was that a couple hours after I went to sleep, the heat turned on and I woke up shortly thereafter on able to fall back asleep again.\n\nAfter several hours, I finally figured out how to reprogram the thermostat myself, which involves a complicated process of changing approximately 5 presets stored in the thermostat.  This is an unreasonably difficult process for a guest to go through at a purportedly upscale Marriott property.\n\nThe worst part, however, was being told by the front desk not only that it would be fixed, but having it later confirmed that it was fixed, when in fact it was not.  I realize that these new thermostats are more complicated and may pose challenges for maintenance technicians who are just becoming familiar with them. However I would expect that for a Marriott property they would take this into account, and take steps to ensure that guests can set the temperature overnight to their desired level which allows them to sleep.\n\nRegrettably, I will not be staying at this property again until the problem is fixed. This is unfortunate, because as I said, it is otherwise an excellent property for business purposes in that part of the city, which is a frequent destination of mine.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The Met is about a 25 minute walk to give you a frame of reference (MOMA is much closer).\n\nThe building doesn't quite have the flare that the Algonquin or Lexington have, but still has plenty of early 20th century charm, down to the small elevators and oddly-shaped rooms. The corner rooms will be the most likely to have good views out over the city, but at under 20 stories tall, don't expect to see much besides street views and the balconies and terraces of nearby condos.\n\nThe rooms are up to typical Marriott standards. The beds are comfortable, there's plenty of linens, and it's not too noisy, though the walls are a bit on the thin side. You can and will hear people talking in the hallway, but that's to be expected in older buildings. The bathrooms have a combination tub\/shower.\n\nWhen we stayed (March 2018), the lounge is only open on weekdays and there's no in-building restaurant due to renovation, but the full menu from the restaurants are available for room service.\n\nParking is $55 a day and is valet-only. Park by the entrance on 57th Street and a valet will come out to take your keys. It can take some time to get your car back so plan ahead when needing it. There are subway stops 2-3 blocks away so take you to further destinations if needed.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My stay at the Renaissance Hotel 57 was horrible. I would like to emphasize the word horrible. I stayed  at the Renaissance Hotel 57 the weekend of St. Patrick's Day 2018 which was my wife's birthday weekend. I booked room 1504 for two nights well and then I had to get switched to another room because we found a bed bug crawling on the pillow the morning after our first night. While laying in bed talking to my wife, I saw a bug on my wife's pillow above her head. I freaked out and jumped up and googled the picture of a bedbug and to my surprise the exact same copper colored bug was on the pillow. I was furious because of the amount of money I spent on the room and the amount of time I spent on my wife's birthday trying to surprise her with a weekend in Manhattan at the high-end hotel.  When I called the manager to come she had the housekeeping manager remove the bedbug with a credit and inspect the headboards. tomorrow her in one of the security guards didn't really take it as serious as I expected. The housekeeping manager put our clothes in a bag and washed them in the hotel laundry. My wife was the calm one but as you could imagine I was the angry one with all right. The only good thing that they did was take $100 off the night rate. I personally would never recommend anyone to stay at the Renaissance Hotel 57 because that hotel has bedbugs.  I'm not sure if it was in every room but it definitely was in room 1504. I'm not sure if it was something that just started but I would never recommend anyone to stay there. Do yourself a favor you're better off sleeping in your car off the Westside Highway  or something. I'm not giving this review to try to get attention or anything but I  really want to inform everyone about this place. I don't complain I don't like to bother people I don't even like to give the reviews but in this case I definitely had to because of what I have experienced.  My wife took pictures of the bug and  and made a 311 complaint to the city. Please do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. The bad thing is we all look at Manhattan and look forward to staying in a four-star hotels but who knows what might be lurking inside of those walls I learned a valuable lesson.

Unless you flush the toilet 3-4 times, you'd end up with disintegrated paper floating around. Yuck.\nThird, the windows are incredibly small - I believe this might be a New York thing or maybe something specific to the neighborhood. However, they could at least make sure they're clean: besides the fact that they were small, it was highly disappointing not to be able to look out the window because of the large and old dust stains.\nWe eventually tried to upgrade to a suite or a superior because we were unhappy with the room and bed size too (no, even as Europeans, the bed was just too small to be comfortable for two persons), but that wasn't possible since we apparently were in a Junior Suite and the more spacious rooms were unavailable during our 6 nights stay.\nSince we were informed there's no breakfast available (which is incorrect - it's only available for Gold Marriot Rewards members - or higher), we decided to buy some fruit to have for breakfast in our room. Unfortunately though, there's no fridge in the room. On top of that, even a lousy half-liter bottle of water is being charged for $5.00.\nI hoped there'd be a desk in the room as I was told. However, the desk is literally a small table embedded right within the wall-large closet, designed in the corner of the room. As you sit down at it, the chair's legs get blocked by the corner of the bed - that's how large the room was. Everything is just impossibly tight and narrow around the bed, and trying to get some work done at the desk is helpless.\nLast but certainly not least, we were disappointed by the Internet connectivity. On one hand, it's only available to Marriot Rewards members - you could register for free, but still. Unless you do so, you have to pay $16 + tax per day. Second, if you are a Marriot Rewards member or choose to pay the aforementioned amount, the provided connectivity is extremely poor, almost useless. They even had a network outlet in the room, but that didn't work.\nAll in all, the hotel requires some absolutely necessary renovation - in its current state, it's far from being a four-star hotel.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

So the next morning we added more funds into my daughters account so that she could finally get something to eat. Not once did the hotel staff offer any type of solution to the problem that THEY created. No offer of even a gift card to a Starbucks, or the concierge sending her to a local restaurant (they all have connections and I've been comped more times than I can remember by the concierges in various Boston hotels)  - nothing but rude and unethical dealings at this one.

I am Lifetime Platinum with Marriott. At about 10:00PM the night I stayed, the fire alarm went off. Often these alarms are false, and as there was no sign of smoke, I called the front desk using the room phone. Unfortunately, no one at the front desk answered my call. I called multiple times, still no answer. \n\nI consider the fact that a guest cannot communicate with the front desk during a time of potential risk is a safety concern, a violation of the tacit contract between hotel and guest for our safety, and therefore unacceptable. I doubt the Marriott brand standards accept this condition. Ultimately I learned from a staff person I tracked down in the hallway that it was a false alarm.\n\nThe next day at 7:00AM, I called the front desk. Again no-one answered.\n\nI went to the front desk about 7:15 and spoke with a front desk agent. I asked her to have the GM of the hotel call me regarding my guest safety concern. I did not receive the courtesy of a response from the GM.\n\nAt 11:30 that morning, as I was departing the hotel, I again asked to have the GM call me. I was told by the front desk manager that he \"was too busy in construction meetings\" to call. The front desk manager asked me \"how can I make this right\" which I interpreted as him being ready to put extra points in my Marriott account. I declined as my concern was the safety of guests in the hotel. Besides, I have more points than I can use.\n\nI again left my contact info, and again did not receive the courtesy of a call from the GM.

I'm a big user of hotel irons and had the best Sunbeam iron which happened to be brand new without any iron scorch marks (the cord still had the plastic twist on it).

I often stay in NYC and usually love the hotels and rooms I have stayed at in the past. This was the first time staying at this hotel and it will be the last. \n\nLet's start with the room. I was told that all rooms are the same when I tried asking to be moved to a different room. Assuming this is true then that means all the rooms at this hotel are TINY and i mean tiny!  It is a closet space room. The bed was only a queen and has no box spring. It was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in at any hotel. The TV sits inside a cabinet making it impossible to see if you were working at the tiny desk. The bathroom is a tub and extremely small with a small (modern) sink and no place to put any of your toiletries. This was seriously the most uncomfortable and smallest room I have ever stayed in and certainly should not carry the Marriott name let alone the Renaissance name.  \n\nThere is currently no restaurant on site. They are remodeling or building a restaurant which should be open by the Spring of 2018. \n\nThe concierge lounge for reward members is a tiny make-shift place and is only open for breakfast. At night it turns into a make-shift bar. The \"breakfast\" is the absolute worst that I have ever encountered at a Marriott. There was no bacon or meats just cold powered eggs, some fruit and some other small items. The coffee was the worst I have ever tasted and I ended up just going to the Starbucks across the street. \n\nThe service was exactly the same. The simple task of combining two reservations together (4 days paid, two days on points) became a nightmare where we had to get new keys and when we went down to get new keys on the day the reservations switched to points, she could not do it without our ID which we left in the room but had our current keys with us. It was just an attitude of not wanting to assist in any way. \n\nNo news paper under my door, no bill under my door. On the check-out when we finally were able to get a copy of the bill they charged us $5 for a water we never took. She clerk said she could not do anything and we would have to call the next day to talk to a manager. \n\nJust everything about this hotel was .. dark, depressing, small, claustrophobic, with not much in the way of customer service. This could and did leave a bad impression of the  whole stay in NYC. \n\nI will say the location is great. I like staying a away from the Times Square tourist area and there are some great restaurants and bars within walking distance.

MUCH MUCH MUCH cheaper. You get a lot of space, and friendly service.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We had trouble booking a room for that length of stay during the time we wanted.  We found that the Renaissance 57 had rooms available for the 8 nights that we needed.  We found that it was a nice, old hotel with a lot of character.  Upon check in, we were upgraded to a room with a terrace on the 15th floor.  It was a nice room in the corner overlooking Lexington and 57th.  The location of the hotel could not be better.  We attended an Opera at the Met, went to Central Park, were close by to the subway station on Lexington and 59th.  We were able to get all around the city with ease from this location.  One issue with having a room in the corner overlooking a busy intersection was the noise.  When they say that NYC is the \"City that never Sleeps,\" they are not kidding.  There was street construction going on all night for 5 nights.  There was jackhammering, backhoes ripping up the street, and dump trucks taking all the debris away.  We arrived on a Monday and did not get a decent nights sleep until the Saturday night when the workers were not jackhammering.  Even though the windows on the room were double pane, the noise was coming through the AC unit which was right next to the bed.  The views from the terrace made the noise a little bearable.  The is not a restaurant in this hotel yet, it reopens in the Spring of 2018; but there are a lot of good places to eat nearby.  The staff were exceptional in this hotel.  They were helpful for all our needs.  If it were not for the noise at night, this would have been a great place to stay.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Firstly it's a bizarre property - you take an elevator (or stairs) up one floor to the tiniest elevators that ever existed to access the rest of the property.  This is not ideal when an elevator (or two!) are out of commission and people are trying to leave for work meetings \/ tourist attractions \/ checking out at heavy traffic times in the morning.  \n\nSeparately my room in particular had drawers that would not close which was aggravating and my next door neighbors were extremely loud.  Can't fault the hotel for loud guests but be advised the rooms do not do much for soundproofing.  Rooms also do not have coffee makers which is an inconvenience when the hotel does not have an operating restaurant.\n\nAlso from a service standpoint, I forgot my phone charger (my fault completely).  I checked in relatively late and asked the concierge if there was a nearby bodega where I could pick up a charger.  He said that he could do better since there was a 24 hour Apple Store 2 blocks away.  Now if you are sending a petite female guest out to run an errand in the 11pm hour of the night you might want to disclose that the Apple Store is not just two blocks up but four very long midtown blocks over.  I was dressed in athletic gear and wound up running the whole way because it was much too far for a quick pop over walk two blocks situation.  \n\nRenaissance 57 fell short on lots of fronts for me, I will not be staying here again in the future.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Quality control?  There isn't any anymore.  Our first room had issues in the bathroom, the sink drain clogged.  They moved us to another room. The new room had no fridge.  I complained and they brought us an old bulky noisy little fridge but it did the job.  Later, when I opened the faucett water poured out of the handle and made a mess.  I called and they fixed it.  That night, I took a shower and noticed the shower wasn't cleaned all the way through, there was long women hair and soap scum from a previous guest stuck on the wall.  They sent cleaners that day to clean the shower again.  On my last day as I was leaving and doing a last inspection, I noticed something bulky behind the mattress and the headboard.  I moved the mattress a bit and noticed a bottle of soda left there by a previous guest!  Oh my, I can't believe I slept 3 nights with soda behind my head.  Terrible.

I searched Marriott brand hotels only as we are Platinum Elite members so we are loyal to Marriott brand hotels. The Renaissance 57 was certainly not the cheapest option, or the most centrally convenient choice given our touristy itinerary but it appeared unique from the website photos so I opted to pay a little more for the memorable experience. I am admitting that a portion of our not so great experience is my fault. \n\nUpon check-in we were told that hotel was at full capacity so there was no upgrade available. Not a big deal but as we absorbed the weirdness of the hotel, I immediately regretted my decision to stay someplace \"different.\" This place is truly very weird. From the super dark entrance, to the \"take the elevator up ONE floor, walk across the hall and wait for another elevator to go up another two whole floors,\" to the yucky weird carpet, and the halls so narrow to our room that I had to pull my bag BEHIND me, not beside me; this place was really bizarre. Even the elevator call buttons looked like some creepy Alice in Wonderland creature things. It was just outside of my comfort zone. \n\nOur room was disappointingly spartan. Very basic and lacking anything other than the most basic amenities. We were told that the restaurant was being remodeled but we were not told that the rooftop was closed for renovation so that was a real bummer. We also noted that other floors appeared nicer than the third floor, where our room was, so perhaps the rest of the hotel is nicer than the third floor? It's possible. \n\nThe real disappointment came on day two when we arrived back to our room at 1 am (after being gone all day) to find that our room hadn't been cleaned leaving us with no fresh towels, no coffee for the morning, and no fresh products. I called the front desk and an associate arrived immediately with fresh towels, coffee, and products but in the meantime, we had discovered that there were hair pins all over the carpet that we hadn't noticed the night before. Clearly, not only was our room not cleaned on our second day, it had not been vacuumed before we arrived. That's just GROSS. \n\nUpon checkout, I informed the desk clerk that I was very disappointed that our room hadn't been cleaned and even more unhappy that it hadn't been vacuumed BEFORE WE ARRIVED. He told me he would have Catherine, the manager, contact me to discuss. Catherine called me almost immediately and was most apologetic. She said that had I spoken to her the night before, she would have moved us to another room. I truly appreciate how responsive she was and that she would have corrected the issue had I contacted her sooner but, I really don't think we wanted to change rooms at 1 am. So again, I'll share part of the blame for our less than great stay. \n\nI will say this... all of the staff was extremely friendly and I am very impressed with Catherine's speedy response to my complaint and genuine willingness to correct the issue. That being said, do your homework before booking a room here. Read the reviews and ask yourself if you like dark, weird, places with no restaurant and no rooftop and paying more money than you could book a Courtyard down the road. If that sounds appealing to you - go for it because the staff and management are really nice - but this place just wasn't for me. \n\n","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Elevators are old, Executive lodge breakfast is quite poor and so are the hors d'oeuvres in the evening. Corridors are dark, card readers in elevators not working. At least lounge provided unlimited supply of bottled water. There was no restaurant in the hotel - sign said it will reopen soon, but as such at the weekend where lounge was closed too there was absolutely nothing to be had. There is however a Starbucks across the street and Subway around the corner. \n\nRooms are quite small, but this is New York. Bathroom small but reasonable and reasonably clean. The biggest headache was a\/c unit in the room which produced 65db noise (average conversation) and was so loud I had to use earplugs.\n\nTV has netflix which is a benefit if one have time to watch TV.\n\nOverall, I have nothing serious against this hotel, it is just not at the level of Renaissance brand and have nothing exceptional for the price we paid - just average.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The amenities are non existent with only water in the lounge. The management are in denial that this is the most basic amenity when other comparable hotels including all full service branded hotels have juice, sodas and coffee. Also was told that no one else has complained about lack of amenities but upon looking at hotel reviews on Marriott.com there are a number of complaints on this very issue and most coming from gold and platinum members. There is no follow up (this was also reported by many other guests in reviews), I asked for a mattress topper that should have come as standard, was told housekeeping would take care of it and never did. As a boutique hotel, they justify calling standard size rooms suites which is ridiculous. Gave 2 drinks coupons at check in but the restaurant was closed for renovation so you could only redeem if you happen to be in lounge between 5-7pm. Staff were friendly but put simply the hotel lacks the basic level a Marriott should be. First main job, sort out the lounge. Simply having water and chips is not good enough for a full service property and this has been highly commented on in reviews and yet management remain in denial and committed to cost cutting on providing an acceptable lounge to elite members.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is DARK and the d\u00e9cor is a bit unusual and could use some updating.  The service was great but don't expect this to be a Renaissance to have large rooms or new features.  It is a bizarre setup with the check in desk on the ground floor and then you take an elevator to the lobby, cross the lobby area to another set of elevators that will take you to your floor.  The elevators are small, dark and appear to be a bit rickety.  The motif is something out of the movie Beetlejuice and could be what makes this a boutique hotel. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are clean although they are a bit small and could use a makeover.  All in all I was there to sleep and not there to enjoy the scenery.  There is a small bar off the lobby area and there is no restaurant until January 2018.  Since I was there on the weekend the concierge room was not available although I was compensated in Marriot points for this.  To get to any of the midtown tourist sites you should bring your walking shoes or count on taking an Uber for about $8 to $9 or a taxi   There are a variety of restaurants and bars in the area of the hotel if you plan on staying close by.  If you have a car do not park in the garage next to Renaissance.  Pull up directly in front of the Hotel and they will valet it for you.  Its less expensive and you don't have to worry about it until you leave.  Be aware that there is a very small loading and unloading area in front of the hotel.  Its New York what do you expect.  Its much better than what I saw in midtown where people were trying to negotiate there luggage while walking through Time Square.

I am a long-time Marriott hotel guest at many properties world wide with prior high levels of satisfaction.  My stay was a surprising disappointment. I could not believe that this was a Marriott property! It seemed like a budget hotel (although not the price).  The rooms are extremely small and cramped.  My room was missing a lamp when first entered.  The room was near the ice machine which ran all night - very noisy.  A request for a different room was denied (I was told that the hotel was solidly booked and someone would get back to me the next day to see if something could be arranged when the hotel was less booked - no one ever contacted me and at that point I was too busy with my reason for being in NYC to change hotels).  In addition to the guest room, the hotel common areas are shabby and worn. The elevator shakes when going aloft.    The hotel is under construction but this was not clear when my reservation was made.   Many times there was no one in the lobby to assist with needs - the hotel seemed understaffed and deserted. The guest services are limited - many aspects were closed off.  It was quite noteworthy that although I was not satisfied upon check-in no one ever followed up with me during my stay.    I will continue to book Marriott properties but not this one.  I have never posted an online review - I wanted to spare others my experience.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My check in experience was fantastic with William and he was very informative of the activities for 4th of July. However here is my issue. I wasn't leaving for the airport until 1.30 I called reception and asked if I could have a late checkout. The woman on the phone was rude and wouldn't even hear me out. On my way back that same evening I spoke to another person at reception and they were happy to accommodate my request and said it wouldn't be an issue. So my question is how is it acceptable for one staff member to be rude and not even hear out a request whereas another staff member accommodates the same. The other issue is about the $5 Bottled water. I got my own water and didn't touch any of those bottles in the room. When my bill was slipped under the door I was charged for the bottle of water and I called reception and was told it would be taken off. While checking out another lady at reception asked me if everything was settled and I brought up the issue of the water bottle charge and she said it would be taken care off. I looked at my statement today and the charge for the $5.44 has gone through and it's showing on my statement. It's not a matter about the $5 it's a matter of principle and the fact that they committed to twice fixing this mistake and yet it has not been done. Would I stay here again nope there are better hotels for the money. ","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

I forgot his name but he was quite delightful and offered us some recommendations since it was our first time in New York. This hotel is located conveniently in Midtown Manhattan which makes it walkable to some of the bigger attractions in NY and if it something isn't in walking distance, the subway is a great option! Some recommendations for things near this hotel: There is an amazing pizza place right next to the hotel outside. Delicious and can easily be taken back to your hotel to eat. There's also a 24-hour bagel place about 10 minutes away that serves amazing fresh bagels. Want some dessert? Go to Bloomingdale's and get you some banana pudding from Magnolia Bakery inside. \nNow on to the hotel itself! There are two \"lobby\" levels. The first one is where you check in but you need to go up (either by stairs or elevator) to the next floor where you can access your rooms by a different set of elevators. The hallways and interior were dated and kind of bleh. The room was actually really nice but also equally small (it's New York, what do you expect?). The bathrooms appeared to be renovated and was the best part of the room. One big problem that we experienced with this hotel (we came here in December when it was cold) was that there was a lack of hot water in the mornings. This was an issue for me because I'm a morning showerer and it's fortunate that I was here on leisure instead of business. \nOverall, we got a really good rate on this hotel during peak Christmas time so I'm not complaining. It's a solid mid-range hotel that doesn't really stick out in any way. I hope the water heating issue is fixed, and if not, at least it's probably a seasonal thing. But it's a nice hotel, updated rooms, is in a good location, and the staff is wonderful.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The food is really nothing to rave about, it is just standard bland fare.  There is a caf\u00e9 next door which has a superb breakfast, just as an FYI.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful.  We were immediately given directions to local places to eat and things to check out in the area.\n\nOur room was well appointed, clean, and the bed was oh so comfortable.  We really enjoyed the deep, wide bath tub.  \n\nHonestly for the price and the amenities in NYC this hotel is not only a bargain but a place that I would never have a problem calling my home away form home in NY.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

(Not much variety).\n\nFrom the minute we sat down our waiter ignored us.  He came by to give us the menu and take drinks orders.  Some one brought our tea and orange juice.  The waiter was all over the restaurant like a butterfly stopping everywhere except our table.  Finally had to go to the bar to get sweetner for my tea.

We did not see our waiter again until he came to give us the bill.  He told us we would not be getting our dessert because there were too many people in the restaurant.

The location is ok - but since it was raining, I was looking for some place )non hotel to eat) and I was stunned by the lack of quality options in a 3 block radius - BLT was booked, others didn't suit my fancy.  The entry is odd - you enter from the street to a cramped room with 2 check in folks and then have to go up a level to the lobby.  So elevator up a floor and then another elevator to you room.  Just created extra for an exhausted traveler.  The decor tries to be trendy and I guess succeeds.  It just seemed dark and loud.  The music playing at 4am when I departed to get to LGA for a flight was so loud in the lobby that it was stunning.  Rooms are simple, small (but average for NYC standards).  The sink gave me problems as the drain was slow and backed up when brushing teeth which meant spittle just sat in there for a hour before draining.  Yuck.  The toilet has a push wall flush (like on a plane) and creates a vacuum that could swallow a small man if caught in it.  Bed was ok.

The toilet is worth mentioning, it has exceptionally strong flushing power that you literately feel like on a plane when you hit that flush button.

For a recent business trip to Manhattan, I went through the ritualistic balancing of cost versus comfort. In this case, I voted for cost, selecting this property at a nightly rate of $199 before tax. My thought process balanced a cost savings, the Marriott brand and a good location. After all, I had upgraded frequent guest status with Marriott. My fallback was the frequently traveler's rationalization, \"how bad can it be . . . it is only one night.\" Read on, gentle reader.\n\nThe hotel is in a great location -- East 57th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues and in a historic structure. Sometimes this makes for a quirky but interesting layout (say, like the Westin on Union Square in Manhattan). Here? No charm and hallways and lobbies that are dark, seemingly from the 1980s.. I arrived at the property early and I was told there were no rooms ready. Fair enough. The front desk promised to call when my room was available. Perhaps a place where I might change for a business meeting? You guessed it -- the men's room. Strike one.\n\nI returned to the hotel at 4 pm -- no call, no text. My request for a high floor far from the elevator? 6th floor, behind the elevators. This is a 20+ story hotel. The desk clerk wouldn't budge . . .\n\nAny my room? The walk-in closet in our master bedroom is larger. Truly, this is smaller than my dorm room as a freshman in college. I hit the bed corners with my shins half a dozen times. Oh, and the bed was just slightly larger than that freshman dorm bed . . .  The \"closet\" was so small I couldn't hand a suit jacket.\n\nThe \"desk\" area literally is a cubby hole under the TV. Not a flat screen -- an old-style full size television. The \"desk\" is about 30 inches long and 24 inches wide. Very cozy -- not. \n\nI couldn't find the TV remote, which is a bid weird. On my way out for a dinner meeting at 5:30 pm, I asked the front desk to put one in my room. When I returned some 3 hours later, no remote, In defense of housekeeping, when I called again, the remote arrived very quickly. \n\nAll in all, a night that tested the road warrior mantra, \"It's only one night.\"","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'm a frequent business\/personal traveler to NYC so I know the city fairly well.  I've always wanted to stay at Hotel 57 since they opened several years ago.  When I saw a great rate for this weekend, I jumped on it.  I should of known things were off to a shaky start when I checked in around midnight on Friday.  The reason I opt for mobile check-in is so I can run into the reception area, grab my room key and get to my room to drop off my luggage.  At check-in it was very slow and the front desk staff insisted on handing me every brochure and suggestion for a place to eat every meal.  All great and everything, but not at midnight.  \n\nIt appears I was upgraded to a corner room with a little extra space.  It was nice to have the couch and a spacious bathroom.  The room itself seems to be in need of a refresh, the bathroom seemed updated.\n\nAs for the rest of my experience it was disappointing not having a fully stocked executive lounge.  Every time I went into the lounge it was often picked over and only had a few bottles of water.  It would be nice if this were fully stocked all day with drinks and snacks.  Also, I don't understand why they shut down the coffee machine in the late morning.  We tried to grab coffee around 10:30 or 11 on Sun morning and the machine was already shut down.  Doesn't make sense to me.  I guess it's their way of forcing you to use their restaurant or leave the hotel.  I also want to point out the attitude of the bar staff.  We wanted to grab drinks Sunday night (3 of us) and the bar tender had a major attitude with us.  She was more interested in explaining their whiskey selection to one individual who arrived at the bar after us than taking our drink orders.  She would start and stop making our drinks in order to appease and flirt with this individual.  Some extra training could be used with the bar staff.\n\nAll in all, I probably wouldn't stay here again.  I feel there are better Marriott\/Starwood properties in the NYC that would provide better executive lounge and service experience while staying in NYC.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I wanted to be within walking distance of Central Park, Bryant Park, all the major museums etc-and it was.  Although, on the last day of our stay, we did take cabs to and from the Natural History Museum because it was pouring rain and it was the farthest attraction we were visiting.  The surrounding area of this hotel is mostly high end boutiques so at night, there isn't much going on.  This is good because that means it's quiet at night so you can bank of a good night's rest.  This is not so good because it is a 10 minute walk before you come across any interesting nightlife.\nThe positive reviews about the staff are absolutely true.  Every person I encountered was friendly and enthusiastic about helping me with anything that i needed.\nOur room was on the 12th floor.  It was small like i had read in the reviews-but it was big enough for us so we didn't mind.  The bed was very comfortable and we had a nice view from our windows.

The property is fine; it has some interesting boutique\/artsy design elements, which was cool. But overall the building probably needs some overall work. But it works. The bar was great, live music at night was excellent and a cool addition. The breakfast was okay, but weekend breakfast would be appreciated (weekdays only).

Why they call it superior is beyond me and I am afraid to see what the cozy room is like. We were wondering if we were actually put in the cozy double room by mistake but after asking front desk we were told point blank that it was in fact the queen room. The lady at the front desk was very dismissive and it seem like they weren't interested in what we had to say at all and mostly annoyed by the fact that we wanted to check. The room we got was tiny, nothing like the photos on their website. It was so small that they could only fit one bedside table on one side of the room. I had the luxury of having to charge my phone on the floor next to the bed. \n\nThe bathroom is nicely renovated but the flush on the toilet sounds like a small jet aircraft taking off. Ok if you are staying on your own but when you are with your partner and you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night you will wake them unless they are a deep sleeper. \n\nThe air con wasn't much better. The first two night when we turned on the heating it made so much noise we couldn't leave it on. Sound like you have a generator on in your room. When it is off it blows cold air. I think the room next door was having the same issue since we could hear it turning on from our room. After two night however it seemed to fix itself and we were able to use it with some peace. Not next door though unfortunately. \n\nThey are also doing some renovations in the hotel, we received a letter in our room advising of the potential noise. This might have been good to know before we booked and it might be worth while calling if you are looking to stay to see if this is complete. I can't say this was the most comfortable stay we have ever had in a hotel. We were glad to be leaving. In the end I probably should have gone with the other hotel I was tossing up between.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The front desk staff, Raymond and Serge and the Manageress Kim were all first class and thanks especially to Maggie in the Concierge Lounge who looked after our two teenage boys every morning at breakfast, we had an exceptional hotel experience. \nWe had surprises at our room on arrival and during our stay when we had a small problem this was addressed with a \"no problem' attitude and was sorted with haste, thanks to Kim. Staff have to be complimented and this goes throughout the hotel even down to the room cleaning staff and porters- all first class.\nThe hotel itself is perfectly located on a corner near Bloomingdales, a subway, a chemist and the Pig and Whistle Irish bar is just around the corner for a quick beer. To be honest its hard to fault the hotel. Many and varied TV channels on the large wall mounted movable screen and extra room space in the double queen bedroom we occupied. There are 3 Lifts which work perfectly and the whole place, while in an old New York building is spotlessly clean.\n \nA few words of advice to the hotel regarding our experience and which may benefit other guests - Copious amounts of hair Shampoo and body lotion\/moisturizers are  provided free of charge but for some reason no shower gel in the hotel, we did ask but they dont supply it. The only complaints I have and it annoys me to find fault is that there is a charge of 5 dollars per bottle of water in the room (plus tax), these are small plastic bottles and although as was pointed out to me (afterwards) that the charge is written on the bottle it is so small that it it is almost indistinguishable. Now you have been warned- its free in the Concierge Lounge or for a dollar in nearby shops. Also, although wifi was listed at 15 dollars per day, our teenagers seemed happy enough with the free wifi that reached our 15th floor room, so cant complain. These complaints are beyond the scope of the local hotel staff and cannot be blamed on them. Finally the transport provided on departure by the hotel was perfect, cheaper than the local cabs, more modern and on time. Well done all around. So in conclusion, would i visit again....absolutely, without a doubt.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Renaissance 57 is listed on MSKCC\u2019s website as having special rates for patients. Because MSKCC rates aren\u2019t on the hotel\u2019s website, I called reservations to ask for the rate for a room with two beds. The rate quoted was good, and I booked the room. I never got a confirmation email but had the confirmation number. When we arrived, we were given a \u201ccozy\u201d room with only one double bed. I explained that I had booked a room with two beds, and the woman at the desk insisted that I had booked a room with one bed. She told me I was lucky that they had a room with two beds, but then she lectured me on how to book the correct room in the future. \n \nThe room was tiny and dim, but clean. There was no information about the hotel in the room. The vent in the bathroom didn\u2019t work. After we both took showers in the morning, we discovered that the hair dryer did not work. We asked if they could send one up within 15 minutes so that we could make our appointment. It did not arrive so we went to MSKCC with wet hair. A hair dryer was hanging on the door when we returned. \n\nWhen I attempted to print our boarding passes in the business center, they did not print. I did find copies of the hotel\u2019s spreadsheet of revenues for the previous day in the printer. I took these down to the concierge and asked if she wanted them and she said, \u201cNo.\u201d I asked how I could print boarding passes and she said she\u2019d send the engineer to the business center. He said that the computer set up for boarding passes was broken and I should use one of the computers that had a per minute charge. So far, not a single friendly word or smile from any staff member.\n\nThe evening before our departure, we asked the bellhop to arrange for a car to take us to JFK the next day at noon. He called at 11:30 a.m. and said our car was there. So, we threw our things into the suitcases and dashed downstairs, where there was no car waiting. Ten minutes later, a car arrived, but the driver said he was there to take a party to LaGuardia. We had to wait a half hour in the lobby for our car.  \n\nWorst hotel experience in many years.

The hotel was in a great location, was comfortable and well-maintained, and more than served our needs for our 3 day weekend in New York.\n\nWe arrived around 9:00 at night and were quickly checked in.  The check-in set up is a little odd in that the front desk is on the ground level of the hotel, but you need to take an elevator up to the lobby, and then transfer to another elevator to get to the guest rooms.  Our room was probably the largest we've seen in New York.  There was plenty of room to move around, which is not always the case, and there were two large closets, one with hangers and one with shelves, for clothes storage.  In addition to the bed, there was a small night table and a desk that was built into the wall.  Like the room, the bathroom was large and offered ample counter and shelf space.  One complaint about the bathroom is that much of the wall between it and the rest of the room was translucent glass.  While this gives a nice effect during the day, it leads to waking anyone else in the room up if the bathroom is used at night.  The climate control system in the room seems to run either a little too cool or too warm, but worked well enough on a pleasant fall weekend.  The room's soundproofing could be better.  We could easliy hear doors slamming in the hallway and people walking around.  That being said, very little street noise made its way through and we were easily able to sleep through the night.  The hotel does have a restaurant\/bar, fitness center, and business center, but we didn't use any of those.\n\nThe hotel's location is great.  There are 3 subway stations within an easy walk (59th and Lexington, 63rd and Lexington, and 51st and Lexington).  From these, we were able to get anywhere we wanted to go in Manhattan and Brooklyn with a maximum of one transfer.  The theater district and Central Park are both a pleasant 20 minute walk away.  There aren't a ton of food and drink options in the area, but with so much within easy reach, it really wasn't an issue.  \n\nThe staff at the hotel were universally friendly and helpful.  When I called about an issue with our climate control, the engineer was up in fewer than 5 minutes.  The front desk and bell staff were also constantly asking about our stay and what they could do to make it better.\n\nWith its combination of location, cleanliness, and comfort, we found this to be a perfect hotel for our 3 day weekend and we would happily stay there again when we return to New York.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":575732,"title":"Excellent location.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-10-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Excellent location, friendly staff and great amenities. With that being said, below are some things you have to remember when staying in Manhattan, which will help manage expectations:\n1. Noise level. Typically, if your preference is to stay in walking distance to most attractions, the place will be noisy, unless you get to highest floors. I think above 20 or so is where it gets better. If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs, choose a hotel with soundproof rooms, or a hotel on a quiet street - yes, those do exist in NYC! :)\n2. Room size. Manhattan is a densely populated area, and most \"standard\" level rooms will be VERY small and basic. I stayed in Superior room, and it was great.\n3. Room service. Quite a few nice hotels do not offer that, and encourage you to use their restaurant instead. While somewhat of an inconvenience, i imagine it helps with pest control issues. This hotel does not offer a room service, but does have a decent restaurant downstairs. They also have excellent espresso machine there.\n4. These guys have two elevators. First one takes you from reception area to the lobby, second from the lobby to your room. Not ideal, but I have seen it more than once in New York. It has to do with limited space. I personally took stairs up to the lobby during my stay.\n5. If you call uber or Lyft, make sure you are already downstairs. Doormen typically have their own car service handy, and get paid on that. In most cases when there is no parking or waiting area upfront, they will not allow the driver to wait. That's relatively common too.\n6. NYC hotels have A LOT of people going through annually.  Expect minor wear and tear in most mid-range hotels, unless the place just re-opened after renovation. I stayed at the Hilton Midown just a few months ago, and it was borderline gross for a superior room at about the same price i paid at the Renaissance. This hotel was superb in comparison.\nLastly, there was scaffolding outside the building, I'm not sure how long it will stay there. Minor inconvenience, as if you don't know exactly where the hotel is (closer to Lexington Ave) you may miss it. I have been there before, so it was not an issue for me, but my driver did get confused.\nOverall I highly recommend this place, and would stay there again.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

Also do not mistake the great rates on offer for a promo - the hotel is trading at discounted rates vs. other full-service properties because it shows all signs of a slow death and is not on par.\n\nWhat the hotel has going for it is the absolutely great location at the corner of 57th and Lexington, which makes all your Midtown business and attractions walking distance. Couple this with rates few can match and you have a winner for a quick business trip when you'd rather spend your free time enjoying Manhattan than patronizing Uber (or the subway).\n\nThe ugly side of the truth about the hotel is that it was built in 1923 and now sits on a slightly forgotten block for which \"chopping\" is the first immediate association. It has small windows, corridors out of a horror movie, rooms facing nothing but solid brick walls and the building appears to be under \"renovation\" which upon closer inspection looks more like preparations for demolition.\n\nThe rooms are small by American standards but absolutely sufficient, with enough room to unpack for a few days, work and unwind at single occupancy. The work desk and premium chair helped me do my daily emails in comfort and the ample electric outlets (including the radio clock with USB outlet) set an example to many hotel rooms I've seen.\n\nThe bed is really comfortable and is absolutely fit for a Marriott property. The little closet is both stylish, cute and practical. The bathroom is quite large compared to the room, but the baths and showers miss out on handsets, leaving you at the mercy of the fixed shower head. Oh, and you cannot regulate water pressure, just the temperature. And they say British bathroom mountings are impractical and weird.\n\nRenaissance makes sure guests will not pilfer extra amounts of bathroom toiletries by providing premium-branded yet absolutely unspectacular amenities, including large bars of brown soap (which housekeeping kept piling in my bathroom for some reason during my stay).\n\nRooms have a coffeemaker - but not an espresso machine, but rather a drip one making the usual American brownish liquid, incidentally very similar to how tap water looked in my tub every morning. For some reason they had only coffee and no tea bags for the percolator machine.\n\nThe entire room looked quite tired, even if apparently renovated in this millennium, and the air conditioning had effectively one mode - NOISY. It did a good job of quickly cooling the room and stirring the stale air inside, as the windows do not really open. Despite facing a large intersection, my room was very quiet (once I turned off the air conditioning). There are some noisy live events on the lobby floor on some nights though.\n\nThe two-level lobby and restaurant are very stylish and add the much-needed 1920s flair and some modern feel to the tired hotel, yet are extremely small. For some reason, the tired elevators seem to have a life of their own. The top-level terrace is officially closed, but one can get out on it and take some of the best photos in NYC. \n\nService was friendly and efficient at all times and that was just what I needed. Marriott Rewards members, even with no status or stays to their account, get free \"basic\" WiFi, which is more than enough even for YouTube or music streaming. Make sure to book directly with Marriott as they pretty much always have the lowest rate - and you get points you can now transfer to SPG!\n\nThe on-site restaurant deserves a separate review, but basically most Marriott rates do not include breakfast and you will serve yourself well having it offsite.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Then a short walk away, you have Bloomingdales (which also houses the famous magnolia bakery), Urban Outfitters, Dylan's candy store, NY & Co., Zara, H&M, VS, Serendipity etc!

There are often times I\u2019m stuck in my room on calls for hours at a time, or I get in late and haven\u2019t eaten, and it\u2019s imperative I can order food to my room. \n\nWell, after years of staying here with very good room service, there now is NONE. How do i find out? When I call down at 6am before an early meeting and am told there is no more room service. They do have a lobby breakfast bar that starts at 7, but I had calls starting at 6:30 for a few hours so that did not help. I had to run outside in my sweatpants in the dark and wander the streets using my Starbucks app to find one that was open early with food. \n\nMy room did not have a clock, and there was no robe which i thought they used to offer? (I may be wrong on that one\u2026 can\u2019t remember.) The windowsill in my shower had not been cleaned and there was a black hair in the tub. (Not mine for sure.) \n\nAnd when I was ready to check out, i called down for help with my bags. I waited 10 minutes and no one came up. So i lugged my bag down and the bellman Pernell said no one told him I had called for help with bags. Honestly he is the only staff member there at this point that I feel goes above and beyond for the customers. He\u2019s a gem and really cares.

However, if i stepped outside my room, I had great service.  2nd issue...The high speed option on wifi was very slow and went in and out most of the week.  3rd issue...Business Center is a joke.  Do not use it.  I was charged for a fax that never went and copies that were never produced.  I called and asked for help and the \"Tech\" was useless.  Referred me to a 800 number and they were just as bad.  Still no resolution.  The room was ok and the rest of my customer service was great.  ","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It's not far from Central Park and is on busy streets but since they are double windowed (and double paned as well) it's actually surprisingly quiet and you can't hear any street noise at all if you have the AC on. It could use some upgrades in the main room but the bathroom is up to date. If you want more room get the junior suite.

It feels like this is a very poor man's W.  I hesitate to make the comparison because it doesn't come close to a W, but you get the sense that it wants to go after a similar demographic.  From the lobby you have to take an elevator up a floor, then walk across to different elevators to go up to your room.

I popped down to the bar where the gentleman advised quite curtly, he could only provide me with a paper cup & I wasn't permitted to have a flute. I mean seriously?!!!!\nFinally, be aware, if you pay extra for the deluxe room, be prepared for the noise that comes through the door. I don't know if it's double glazed, but it's loud!

Buried beneath scaffolding at the corner of Lexington and 57th, the building was easy to miss, and its unimpressive entrance gave  you reason to question your booking.  Once inside, the staff were friendly enough.  Inside a very small, dark entrance lobby, you are checked in, then directed upstairs to the larger lobby where a restaurant and what looked like a conference room were located.  You walk across this second lobby to the elevators that take you to your floor.  If your favorite color is brown, you will love this hotel's lobby decor--the floors, the walls, the curtains, and the chairs are all brown and for a lobby that doesn't get much natural light, you have to question the color choice.  Once in your room, things get better.  The room, though slightly dated, does look like someone worked a bit harder in making it more sophisticated in appearance.  It was small, but had everything you'd want, including a good room entertainment system that allowed you to access Netflix on TV.  The negative, and the reason I would never stay here again, is the cost of Wifi, a staggering $16.95 a night, the highest I have seen anywhere.  Charging guests for use of Wifi is the biggest rip-off in the hotel industry and it looks like Marriott is not concerned at all about this.  All you have to do to avoid the charge is to become a Marriott Platinum Elite member and you're good to go.  Although asked politely, none of the staff was empowered with the ability to hit a button on a computer that would allow you free Wifi access in your room.  So, if you are not special in Marriott's eyes, and a $16.95 charge for Wifi access appalls you as much as it does me, go instead to any number of hotels along Lexington Avenue that will treat you more like a welcome guest.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

So we booked a 3-night stay. When we got there, late at night (after a haul from Vancouver, BC) they could not find our reservation and the attendant decided my husband\u00b4s name was not on the confirmation slip! Deep apologies came soon but some damage was done. \nA shock: our room was 9 square meters. Did that come with the offer? I don\u00b4t think so....there was nothing on the add. We had to take turns walking. Isn\u00b4t it against city codes or something? A room so tiny? (the bathroom was OK). Beware everyone - do not take rooms with the ending '09'....Notwithstanding, 'free' internet did not materialize as expected on my cell phone, computer or iPad. A 'technician' was called twice to 'fix' the problem - which persisted for the duration of our stay. I gave up trying to connect!!! Maybe there was a trade-off with the offer - which we were not privy to.

One room was a decent sized (by NYC standards) double on the 13th floor. First time I have seen a 13th floor in a building. Second room was closer to my size expectations in NYC - a queen with enough room to walk around the bed. There was a balcony on the room that had a clear view of the Chrysler building - very nice.\n\nBoth rooms were very clean, we had drinks in the bar and the staff was quite friendly. Front desk staff was very professional and polite. The bellman was great - super friendly and personable. This hotel is a great location for walking just about anywhere from Times Square north to Central park. The only less than desirable thing was the room elevators stopping on the 2nd floor outside of the bar and restaurant. From there you could take another elevator down one flight or the stairs.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I'm glad to report that I am extremely satisfied with my stay so far (checking out tomorrow).  At check-in, i was immediately greeted by a very friendly person at the front desk! Her name is Denise (hope I didn't get her name wrong) and not only was she super helpful but she wanted to make sure that I truly enjoyed my stay and offered that I could reach out to her directly if I needed anything.  That was a great start! The property itself was very trendy (and smelled really nice)!  It's true that you have to take an elevator up to the \"Lobby\" then take another set of elevators to the room, but it wasn't that bad in my opinion.  I only did that when I had luggage but opted to use the stairs (immediately to the right when you walk in) to get to the Lobby area when I was going out and coming back.  I also read in other reviews that the rooms were super small so I was a little wary; however, I didn't find the room to be small at all for NYC.  Generally speaking, hotel rooms in NYC are smaller than other cities so the size was just fine and very comfortable.  I travel to NYC for business a lot and have stayed at truly small rooms where the bathroom was practically next to the bed, so this was just fine.\n\nThe only feedback that I have for the hotel is to have a dedicated Concierge Lounge for Platinum\/Gold guests.  At most other Marriott properties the lounge is only for Elite members, but it was open to all guests at this hotel.  I am not trying to be exclusive or anything and I don't really care if the lounge is open to everyone, but this particular lounge is super small.  The breakfast left a lot to be desired and the area where the breakfast was offered was so small you couldn't really fit two people in the space.  I guess I was disappointed since my Concierge lounge expectations were for a typical Marriott property and this fell short.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The Renaissance New York Hotel provided all those requirements with added value the attentive service that the staff provides!\n\nAt time of arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome by Slovik, followed with an attentive guest service agent Oksana, who was very accommodating when we checked-in. We had some changes to our reservations and Oksana made those changes and added our Marriott Rewards information expeditiously.\n\nWe found the accommodations to be large, modern, clean and just perfect. The best part was they offered Aveno toiletries which was a perfect treat. This was first time that I had slept 10 hours away from home. The sheets, bed and comforter coupled with the quietness was just perfect for a weekend getaway. The HVAC was quite and warmed the room perfectly with no effort or noise.\n\nWe had breakfast in the restaurant Opius, service was good and personable and the coffee hit the spot. We were excited to see New York City, we had inquired with the Navigator Carla, who provided clear directions with the subway which made the day perfect. We came back to the hotel at about 7 only to find Carla again, therefore we asked if she could recommend a restaurant nearby, she referred us to a local Italian restaurant Felidia which was excellent! Great recommendations, and directions really made our weekend stay amazing!\n\nMake sure to go the Empire State Building first where you can get a good sense of where everything is at in addition you can purchase the attractions tickets at a huge discount. If your staying for multiple stays purchase a subway card it's much easier to get in and out instead of paying $3.00 for each way but it also avoids having multiple bills and allows you to enter at any location. \n\nThe location offers plenty of high end shopping, our favorite was Nike, Bloomingdale's SuperDry, and Brietling.\n\nAdditional staff that made our stay amazing; Dani, Daniel, the housekeeper on the 15th floor, blond hair and Arleen in Sales.\n\nAgain thank you for making our stay memorable!

The location is excellent, walkable distance to Grand Central, Central Park and many Uoper East side amenities.\n\nThe hotel itself fancies itself as a chic, boutique style hotel, and it fits the bill.  Upon arrival, the mini-lobby on the first floor has two check in desks and a door man.  The door \"men\" were helpful, cordial and attentive.  The front desk associates were solid and friendly, but not memorable.  \n\nGoing to the second floor, there is an in house cafe\/restaurant\/bar that is congruent with NYC hotel restaurants, but does not have an identity from what I could tell.  \n\nThe concierge who was parked in front of the converge lounge seemed to be cold and not thrilled to be there.  This was not my experience during my previous visit and not consistent with my experience at Marriott properties.\n\nThe concierge lounge was nice, well decorated, and offered snacks and a light breakfast.  The evening choices were not available while I was there, which I was not sure why.  Usually, there would be light hors d'oevres and soft drinks.\n\nMy room was a simple NYC room, with nice appointments, upgraded TV, modern bathroom and a small couch.  I really liked the design and space of the room.\n\nThe exercise room was above average for a NYC hotel with newer equipment, ample cardio and space to stretch and workout.\n\nOverall, my evaluation is that for this location, it is 1\/4 the price of the Four Seasons, and an excellent choice for a business traveler, couples and small families.  Again - proximity to desired areas is strong with this hotel.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Originally booked for 27 nights and then for an additional 3 due to the blizzard. The staff are awesome particularly the security. The two rooms we stayed in were always cleaned to a high standard particularly when Monica did it. The breakfast was included for the last 3 nights and had a limited selection but was fresh. The lady who hosts breakfast was lovely and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine. We requested a small fridge which wasn't a problem at the start of our stay. One of the bartenders at opia makes a great espresso martini and would happily accomodate our cocktail requests which were not on the menu. We had a slight problem at opia as one of the staff members made some comments we found rude. Turned out it was his first day and upon telling the manager he compensated us with desert, cocktails, drinks and cheese. The situation was dealt with well. We also received complimentary shots from one of the other mangers on another occasion. By the end of our stay we felt like vip guests. There was some dog fur on the floor of the room when we first checked in but when we bought it to the attention of the front desk it was quickly corrected. I would recommend and return!

The staff is very helpful and we had no problems with any requests we had. What can I say it's a little old but having travelled to Newport many times that is what is expected but is is still a nice place. In saying that there is a couple of negatives when we arrived the floor in our room was covered in (cat, dog) hair I expected more from the hotel especially to have clean rooms for guests on arrival. But the thing that troubled is the most was the bed. It is old and very uncomfortable. Now to me when one has to put a mattress topper on a bed it means the mattress has seen its days and it's time for a new one so this is something they need to address as not sleeping well is a massive let down on a trip. As for the restaurant the food is great and cocktails are fantastic. The concierge are very sweet girls and always willing to help although they lack allot of knowledge of the area so that is one of the main differences to some of the better hotels. All in all still a perfect stay!!!! Would suggest staying here as the location is enough to make u happy!!!!","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"NONE"}
