After letting it run in hopes it would clear, they called the front desk to ask for help. The engineer said he could do nothing about it, and other rooms also had this problem.  My room was okay, and my other son\u2019s room was okay, but when I asked to move my son, his wife, and 2 kids to another room, they were told that wasn\u2019t possible. The front desk said they could do nothing because the manager was not on duty, and we would have to take it up with her in the morning.  And the engineer will work on it all night because the whole wing is like that. So, the family went to bed without baths after a long day of travel.  \n\nThe following day, I talked with Anna, the manager, and was told no report had been made from the night clerk or engineer, but she would give me credit for the room for the night and move my family to a different room. 609 on the other side of the building. I assumed the credit would be for the one-room one-night stay.  But when checking out I discovered the credit was only $50.00.  The irony is that when I called the booking.com number to report the problem, I was charged a 54.00 fee for an out-of-the-country call:(. So the credit I received wasn\u2019t even enough to cover the call.  \nThis was a rare family holiday for us, and this was a big disappointment after a full day of travel.  I want to receive the full credit for the one room for the first night.  That is only fair for the inconvenience and terrible Brown water problem.\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

If your standards are the  Ritz and you never leave your hotel on vacations, I could maybe understand \u2026. Anyway here\u2019s my honest review, I\u2019d have given 3.5 if I could but Tripadvisor won\u2019t let me and I didn\u2019t want to underscore. This hotel is in a great location, with a number of restaurants in the surrounding area. Subway stations within easy reach. Our room was on the 6th floor and easily reached by two banks of lifts. Size of the room was pretty decent given NYC standards, good bathroom with lots of hot water. Bed comfy.  It would\u2019ve been nice to have been able to sit propped up in bed of an evening, however the boxed headboard\/ in built bed thing (if you know you know) kind of prevented that. TV remote was intermittent in when\/where it was used in the room. As for cleanliness, when we asked for our room to be serviced I have no argument. If we felt we didn\u2019t need it, our do not disturb sign was recognised and no one came in our room. Nice to have a little shop in the reception for drinks and snacks. Didn\u2019t try the White Olive so can\u2019t comment. Our main complaint was the loud banging in the early mornings, but was never bad enough to warrant a grumble at reception. All in all would stay again as it\u2019s a place to crash after a tiring busy day in NYC, would stay again.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This time a rather brusk front desk manager said that it had to be done with through reservations - I told him that I had called them three times and left two messages and could never reach anyone. I asked to speak with reservations - he said - \"she's off on Fridays and Saturdays\" and walked away to pick up a phone. I think the other front desk check-in guy was embarrassed by his unfriendly and unhelpful behavior and tried to make up for it by \"upgrading\" my room. \n\nI'll just ditto all the other one and two star reviews. This place is now quite dirty and poorly maintained - the elevators are terrible and there is no certificate that they have even been inspected recently.

I wasn't going into this with \"budget stay\" in mind. Let me also preface all this by saying that the front desk people were very nice during my check in.  Having gotten that out of the way, I'll proceed with my feedback on Shoreham Hotel.\n\nI got to the elevator area where there were some mirrors embedded within the walls and pillars. Some of the mirrors were cracked. Understandable that mirrors can crack sometimes. As long as it doesn't fall on me, it doesn't impact me. I get up to my floor and find that the hallways feel cramped. It's ok since there isn't much traffic in the hallways. I get into my room, and it feels warm, so I go to turn on the A\/C. The A\/C unit (pic included) looks like something I had in my apartment back in the 80's. I go to open the curtains (pic included) for some light, but it's just the fire escape and the wall of the adjacent building. Yeah, this can happen in NYC. I look for a mini fridge to put my water bottles in, but then I find an awkwardly placed outlet (pic included). I go to hang my clothes, but the entire closet (pic included)  is about 18 inches wide. I turn the TV on and get only static for more than half the channels. I got one of the best looking channels and took a picture of it (pic included). I go to the bathroom and find that the shower floor and base (pic included) are damaged. The ceiling (pic included) in the bathroom looks unfinished. \n\nThe wifi wasn't working, so I called the operator. They said they would look into it and get back to me. Two hours later, I decide it's probably faster if I just go to a nearby cafe to use the wifi. \n\nIf I were reviewing Shoreham hotel only on the front desk reception, I would give them a 4.5 star review.

My Husband and I have just returned to the UK following a week stay at the Shoreham, we checked in at approx 23.00 following a long flight from the UK and my instant reaction was \"what the hell have we done?\" Having visited New York five years earlier, this is definitely not a 4 star hotel...the room was small, dated and dingy...I hardly slept that first night such was my disappointment...so much so I made enquiries the following morning at another hotel for room availability as I was adamant I \"would not be staying here\"... long story short, we decided to 'suck it up' and I'm honestly glad we did! The bed was comfortable, the shower was great and we didn't experience any noise from neighbouring rooms. We came and went as we pleased and the location was excellent. If you do find yourself staying here, once you get over the initial disappointment, you too will hopefully see past the tired and dated interior and have an enjoyable trip as much as we did...would I return? Really difficult to say...55th street was perfect for us, a couple of great bars and at least four restaurants worth checking out, area felt safe and right next to 5th area and central park was a real plus...so if you can look past the initial first impression you will most definitely have a great stay here...just arrive with an open mind and don't focus on the FALSE 4 star rating and you will be fine.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":93612,"title":"Temper Your Expectations","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-05-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"This hotel is listed as a 4-star hotel and it absolutely is not. Once you have that in mind then your experience won't be as appalling. As an American (b\/c a friend told me that expectations of a 4-star hotel varies across the globe), I was initially very uncomfortable staying in this hotel because my room felt like a rundown motel and I was expecting a 4-star hotel. The positives are that the staff were very friendly and the location is very accessible.\n\nThe hotel appears to be going through renovations, where one wing of the hotel is more \"updated\" and the other side is equivalent to a 1-2 star motel (not hotel). The decor is a mix of metal finishings and a mossy\/vomity green color, overall a rundown and dingy feel. On the Motel wing of the hotel (if you're using the elevator on the right of the concierge desk be ready to ask to change your room), my room was at the end of a hall where there was a door that could isolate my room and the adjacent room, I found that to be a bit sketchy. When I entered the room, it was the typical size of any other NYC hotel, small, but the bedding and furniture were very worn. The bed had some kind of canopy, again in this same green color, so it made the room feel dark and cramped. The padded bench and arm chair had stains. The bed skirt was the dirtiest white I've ever seen, with stains, it didn't look like they ever replaced it. The book case had dents and scrapes all over. The bathroom had a metal toilet and sink, reminding me of bathrooms you see in prisons. I got in super late\/early in the morning and didn't want to make a fuss, but I felt so unbelievably uncomfortable. I didn't even want my luggage to touch the carpet b\/c it looked dirty, I also didn't want to take my shoes off, and that says a lot after walking around on NYC streets. The WiFi on this side was almost like dial-up to sign on\n\nI called the front desk and told the concierge that I was disappointed with the condition of my room and if there were any other rooms available. She was kind and told me I could switch my room. I was then placed in a larger room that was in the \"Updated\" wing of the hotel (via the elevators on the left of the concierge desk, if facing the desk, and directly ahead when entering from the main entrance). This new room was like a 3-star motel. There was a massage chair...an inflatable massage chair, in the room... \n\nI don't know what this building was before, but the size of the room was unusually large with a weird use of space and the same mossy\/vomity green couch and bedding. For the size of the room, the bathroom was miniscule but had less metal furnishings and a porcelain\/ceramic toilet, so it felt like a palace. I only had two nights at the Shoreham and my reservation was non-refundable so I stayed. I was on a work trip so I was barely in the room during the day. Don't expect bottled water, mini fridge, or anything like that. I believe there was a safe, iron, and ironing board. I think there is also a restaurant in or connected to the hotel. The WiFi on this side was more of the typical high-speed WiFi\n\nI'm giving the hotel 2 stars b\/c the staff was friendly and accommodating. Also, maybe there are other floors on the Motel wing that are updated and I just got a bad room. But overall, that initial room shook me and I didn't fully feel comfortable\/safe afterwards; I kept my room deadbolted the entire time. I really don't like to write bad reviews, if I'm writing a review it's to offer praise and thanks, very positive reviews, but I was so thrown off based on the other reviews that I had to provide a bit of balance. I, unfortunately, don't have photos from the first room, I was so uncomfortable that I left without photos. I finally took photos of the second room right before I checked out. Also, I have no clue why they are charging a resort fee, granted it was lower than most hotels, but I don't think it's warranted\n\nI don't know if this is true, but after sharing my experience with a friend, they reminded me that during COVID a lot of midtown hotels were used to house the homeless and it felt as if my first room was still being used for that reason.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We walked a lot to take in the city and there\u2019s tonnes of iconic areas nearby you can get to on foot - you can walk to Times Square from the hotel in 15 mins!\n\nThe hotel itself has a really modern feel to its lobby but its hallway areas and rooms are a little less glamorous - they\u2019re not bad AT ALL, they\u2019re just more basic than the hotel entrance would have you believe, but the room was fantastic and had everything you need - wardrobe storage, iron & travel ironing board, digital safe, hairdryer, complementary shampoo\/conditioner\/body wash\/moisturiser and a fantastic power-shower. The bed was really comfy and rooms were also spotlessly cleaned every single day which was an absolute blessing. I was in a back-facing room, which meant my view was simply a few brick walls and some fire escapes - it didn\u2019t really bother me, as I came to NYC to see the city and not sit in the hotel looking out the window! The benefit of the back room was there was zero noise in the evening which made for a fantastic night sleep - my parents where in the room next to me, which was street-facing, and my dad had a hard time sleeping because the windows simply couldn\u2019t keep out all of the street noise so I think he was slightly less happy with his room, but it\u2019s NYC, it\u2019s a noisy city!\n\nThe staff were always really friendly and helpful too. Check in took a little longer than expected, not sure if the attendant was new, but he was never rude, just needed some time to find out bookings. The cleaning staff were always so upbeat and said hello when we passed them, and there\u2019s a little shop in the hotel lobby where you can get any snacks and\/or Starbucks coffee if you like - the attendant there was always really friendly when I grabbed my morning latte!\n\nThere\u2019s a restaurant attached to the hotel which, if you fancy a slightly more upscale dining experience without straying too far, then it might be something you enjoy - we preferred to eat whilst we were out and about and sample as much street food as possible. If you\u2019re looking for something cheap and cheerful, walk along from the hotel towards 8th Avenue, there\u2019s a pizza shop there you can\u2019t miss which sells slices for 99c each or 2 slices + 1 drink can for $3! The pizza was exceptional, I would highly recommend, especially at that price!\n\nOverall I\u2019m absolutely delighted with our stay and had the time of my life while in NYC - it\u2019s my first time visiting after years of wanting to, and when I come back I\u2019ll 100% be checking out Shoreham again as my go-to hotel!","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It made exploring NYC so much easier. \n\nPros\nThe staff are lovely and the reception guys (Edward V & Hector R) were welcoming upon arrival  and sorted an issue out.\nLinen was clean.\nBathroom in double room was fab - 5 jets in shower!!\nAbility to leave luggage in storage room\nIce machine\nTwin room - huge!!\n\nCons\nSadly the hotel had not checked the booking correctly. We were given 2 (fab looking) double rooms next door to each other but we needed one to be a twin for teens.  We were given a couple of options so went for the other side of the hotel with rooms a few doors apart. \nObviously cleaning the outside of windows in NYC must be tricky but they looked like they had not been touched for many months or longer. \nCarpet in double room had seen better days and there were chips on some of the furniture (having been originally allocated rooms at the other side of the hotel, I wondered if the rooms are being gradually updated).\nMain issue I had was that there were no tea\/coffee making or fridge facilities in room. \nI don't understand hotels becoming more and more room only (no breakfast!) but to also remove any tea\/coffee\/hot choc etc and fridges is just unwelcoming, esp for first time visitors.\n\nTip to visitors\nThis is a great location for waking to loads of places ! But beware the room only and lack of facilities. \n\nTip to management\nCheck bookings to ensure you know the guests arriving and their room requests\nConsider hot drink facilities in rooms\nProvide even just a basic breakfast such as croissant, fruit and hot\/soft drink. \n\nOverall this is a great location so if you only need a room and no facilities, this would be a great choice. \n\nWould we stay here again? Sadly not unless they were to introduce tea\/coffee\/fridge in room and\/or a basic breakfast. \n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

To be honest, we booked The Shoreham because we wanted to be near Central Park and it was the best deal we could find on Kayak.  I would happily book this place again without a deal, in fact I made a trip advisor account just to leave a review for this hotel.\n\nThe pros:\n*It is basically on top of everything we wanted to do.  The longest walk we had was still under 20 minutes and that was to get to a Broadway show, the other Broadway theatre we went to was an 8 minute walk.\n*The rooms are clean, this should be a given but I've found some boutique hotels seem to just spot clean. This was not the case.\n*The fitness center is small, but has a bench and actual selection of dumbbells so my partner and I could still get our workout programs completed.\n*The front desk is both incredibly helpful and nice, I was actually able to have a conversation with Edward Ali as he checked us in which is a customer service touch I absolutely love.\n*Our King Room was big for a NYC hotel, its bathroom was massive for a hotel bathroom regardless of city.\n\nThe cons:\n*While big for a NYC hotel, it\u2019s still a small room compared to some random Hilton is suburban America.  So know what you\u2019re getting, but also know there was enough space for two suitcases to be open, the bed, a couple of chairs, and two people comfortably playing a board game.\n\nThe okay:\n*The coffee they serve at the little market in the lobby is just Starbucks. But there is a Blue Bottle about a 1\/4 block away which is a standout coffee chain based out of NYC (especially if you love pour overs as much as I do).\n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We booked a 3 night stay in Manhattan and had  nothing but problems.  Right off the bat, there was no hot water.  Despite reporting the issue to the Shoreham, nothing was done.  Next day, after returning to the unit, water was pouring from the sealing.  Our luggage and clothes were soaked, my computer was sitting in a puddle of water, and the bathroom area was flooded.  So what does the Shoreham do?  They tell us we must leave the hotel ... at 11:30p ... with nowhere to go, and they did not even make ANY effort at all to help us find alternative accommodations.  At that late hour, in December, and being so close to Christmas, there were no decently priced hotels.  So we had to pay a premium for that night, and unfortunately, cut our trip short because we couldn't afford to continue staying at a luxury hotel.  AirBnb, who we booked the room through, was holding the entire amount we paid for the three nights, so there was no alternative but to change our flight and leave the next morning - all the while losing all our pre-paid activity tickets.  Unfortunately, through all this AirBnb was  not very helpful either.  They also continued to charge us a cleaning fee and service  fee even though we were kicked out after one night.  The lack of ethics and morals of the Shoreham Hotel is something to be very weary of.  AirBnb needs to also fix their policies to support the customers better by protecting them in such situations where the host is fully at fault and should be responsible for doing what's right.  Both of them failed to do so.  So I hope anyone reading this will take heed and forego on even pursing this hotel as a potential accommodation.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Seconds from 5th Ave and also so close to Central Park and Times Square - can't fault this.\nI thought our room was very spacious for NYC (superior queen), but bathroom was a tight squeeze! However this was fine for us.\n\nFew issues with room: could really do with a complimentary mini fridge and kettle! We came in some evenings longing for a cup of tea... also a mirror is needed above the desk for ladies getting ready, very odd there isn't one there. Lastly, we couldn't open any windows in our room?! This was annoying when showering, as there was nowhere for steam to escape and the room theretore got very humid - strange. (Our TV also didn't work, but we never needed it personally)\n\nI found the front desk staff to be very cold, said maybe three words to us when we were checking in - not very NYC style. Our cleaner however was so friendly and a credit to herself, always checked up on us and wanted a chat - she was Croatian but didn't catch her name. She deserved the tip we left for her :)\n\nAll in all, I would consider staying here again when comparing hotels for my next trip to NYC, some small things could really improve the place, but it's great value for money!!!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was there on business, the hotel was quite new and hip and centrally located.  I remember getting out of the taxi and Tori Spelling was exiting her limo with her first husband, so I knew the hotel was going to be great.   Well, forward to 20 years later, and this hotel is definitely not what it use to be.  Still centrally located to all the fun things in Manhattan, the hotel needs a FULL Renovation.  We had asked for a quiet room with two double beds on a high floor.  We got the high floor, but the room was right beside the elevator.  Noisy.  The room looks old, stains everywhere, can't open the windows and the rooms smell musty from the bathrooms.  Bathrooms are not well ventillated and smell like old urine.  We had complained about the noise one night as they were renovating at 9 pm the room next door.   If the hotel would invest in a complete renovation, perhaps I would give it a second chance.  It explains why the rate was good for this hotel.  You pay for what you get.  i would spend the extra money to stay at the 1 hotel around the corner next time.   Some of the staff at the front desk also could use an attitude check, like the one woman that worked the evening shift during our stay.   ","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93612,"title":"Catfished","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-11-19","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I'm going to just start by saying the good. I'm giving this hotel 1 star for the the amazing location. It's just 4 blocks from central park and right off fifth Avenue. It's a dream location. I'm giving 1 more star for the size of the room. It's huge and not just by nyc standard. And that's it. That's all the positive things I have to say. \n\nCheck in was a nightmare. Landed early after a redeye and was very much in the mindset that we wouldn't be able to get an early check in so I wasn't shocked or upset when we didn't. The fact that the front desk guy didn't say hello or even look at us or ask us the reservation name was what got me. Not a great start. What was even worse though was coming back at 320 for our 3pm check in and watching the 3 staff members behind the counter talk with one another about where they were going after work and ignore customers in line. When I finally got someone to talk to me I was told they weren't sure if my room was ready and would have to check. At this point it's 330pm so 30 minutes past check in time. I watch as they pull put their cell phone and call \"housekeeping\" to check. All the while my patience is completely dissipated. \n\nWhen we finally get into our room we find what we thought was a nice place. I was annoyed like other reviews I've seen that there is clearly a spot where a fridge use to be but no fridge in its place. Next thing that caught my attention is there is no plugs by the bed. So there's no way to charge your phone and keep it near you. My friend left her plugged into the wall on the floor near the closet and I had to sleep using my portable charger that yes I did need to have fully charged in the morning to use as I ran around the city. \n\nNext up is the shower. This was the most demented shower I have ever experienced. It was like pellets being rained down on me and was downright painful. And there was no way to change the pressure only the temperature. At one point I just ran the bath portion to wash my body because I couldn't deal with the welts it was leaving on me. Also if you shower in the morning there's no hot water. Ant morning either of us had to shower we were screwed because it was Luke warm to cold. So night showers were the only safe bet. \n\nThe appliances this room did come with were all a joke. The tiny TV didn't work once the 5 days we were there. We'd select \"Live TV\" from the menu and it would say \"service unavailable\". We'd select \"On Demand\" and it'd go to a gray screen and nothing else. Also they advertised wifi and gave a code but the code didn't work on any of the networks that popped up as available. So no TV and no wifi which meant we had to use our dying phones with no chargers to watch anything in bed at night since we couldn't get our tablets or the TV to work. But don't worry cuz the hotel phone was the entertainment. That phone would flash a bright white light on and off all night long. It'd never ring but the light was so bright it'd wake us up. I finally got over it and unplugged it. Also the heater was horrible. If you set it to 63 it'd be freezing on the room but set it to 64 and it was a sauna. All night I'm dealing with the flashing phone and the room either being too hot or too cold. And it's an older heater so it is loud and clanking. At one point we thought there must be a mouse inside of it. Really would've helped of we could've drowned out those horrible sounds with a working TV. \n\nFinal issues (yes there's a lot). This old hotel is so deceiving in their pics and their price is outrageous for what you get. The elevator holds 3 people max and the whole thing looks like it should be taken down with a wrecking ball. But the staff\/people who run this place really takes the cake. The day of check out I'm looking at the paper they gave us and notice it says check out is 11am. I go check my confirmation email and their website and they both say noon. So I go downstairs and ask about it and am told check out is 11. I bring up my email and I'm told \"Third partie sites are wrong.\" OK that's cool but I booked directly through the actual hotels website and not a third party. The front desk lady tells me it's 11 and my email has an error. As I stare blankly at her she eventually huffs and tells me even though it's 11 she can allow us to check out at noon. Oh gee, thanks for letting us check out at the time of contract said we could check out. Then as we check out we aren't given a receipt just told thank you. After 2 days I finally had to call and ask for a receipt because nothing was even emailed to me. I finally received it and see there's an added $11.48 charge to every day entitled \"miscellaneous.\" Have yet to get an answer to what those charges are. \n\nSeriously my worst hotel experience in my life. Please don't let the photos deceive you like I did and book elsewhere. ","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Extremely noisy, we were on floor 7 at the front of the hotel and the noise was unbelievable, all night trucks going up and down the street, honking the horn it was unbearable, I resorted to ear plugs but my partner did not as he cannot wear them and had no sleep for a week,  not great when you're running a marathon.  Room really shabby, tired, worn, stained carpets, no coffee maker or fridge,  water for a bath or shower either cold or luke warm - this is unacceptable, a hotel not having hot water!

Pillows were quite thin. \n\nAmenities: shower is good. But bathroom a bit old and bathtub a bit worn out and dirty. Could do with a fix up. Wifi is working. TV also is OK with pleny of channels.

We were looking for a great bed, hot shower, and central location in midtown, and we were looking to SAVE money instead of overpaying for \"extras\" we weren't going to use. Shoreham was exactly what we were looking for (hence the 5 stars). \n\nThe location was ideal for us. Shoreham is a short walk to either Midtown or Central Park, without the high prices. It is located on a midtown street thick with neighborhood restaurants - it feels more like a neighborhood with a distinct lack of tourist crowds or random lurkers. In the morning, we liked hitting the nearby bakery for a coffee and pastry (Le Pain Quotidien), and then heading down the stairs of the subway station next door. Be real easy! \n\nOur room had a spacious (for New York) feel, with all the necessary amenities - bed, nightstands, air conditioner, bathroom, closet, desk\/dresser, and space for your suitcases.  We requested a quiet room, away from street and elevator, and were given the room on the other side of the stairs, with the window overlooking the empty inside courtyard - perfect - quiet with no one able to see in. It was perfectly quiet for our whole stay and had a blackout shade over the window - quiet and dark. The fabric decorations in the room have gotten a tad shabby, but overall we were pleased.\n\nThe hotel staff was friendly during every interaction and were able to answer any questions we had. They had room to store our luggage in the morning between our check-out and our flight; all we had to do was ask. \n\nI think this is a great place to stay if bang-for-your-buck is what you're looking for.

This showed as a 4 star hotel, and was only slightly cheaper than other area hotels. Booked for two friends, we shared a queen. We arrived an hour early and I called to inquire about their website Valet parking, was told that they no longer offer valet and that they don't have any contracts with any of the parking garages, but good luck finding a place. Okay good thing i downloaded ParkWhiz and was able to locate parking and pay on that app pretty quickly. We checked into the hotel, the lobby is dark and poorly lit (lights on the floors were blinding and kind of stupid). The elevators literally shocked me at how tiny they were. I understand the building is probably old and in NYC, but 3 adults was a tight fit. The room was really simple. Bed, desk, lamp and deskchair. No mini fridge unless you want to pay, no coffee machine, and only an outlet next to the bed (one side) and an outlet falling off the wall near the doorway. The worst feature was the bathroom door. Entirely made of opaque glass and this terrible metal hook to hook the door shut. The light filtered into the entire room and no privacy for noises (cant poop in private). The room was clean, however our AC was broken when we first arrived and the views were of a dark brick alley looking directly into another room across the way. Not bad if you are not staying in the room long. don't recommend and wont be back.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

One morning even that elevator didn't work.\n-  The room itself could use some serious retouches (especially the carpet, curtains and bed sheets, old A\/Cs, windows, many old towels that have stains, but not only), quite old and worn out room and furniture. The bathroom is great, though.\n- Windows are not sound proof, there's A LOT of noise from the street even on higher floors, especially from garbage trucks and supply trucks for all the restaurants in the street, all night long (the only good part- on Tuesday night you can hear the live music from the nearby restaurant, La Bonne Soup).\n- They don't enforce masks.

We woke up, went to mass at Saint Patricks which was only 2 blocks away, then ate a great breakfast spot before going for a walk through Central Park, which is also only 2-3 blocks away. There's no need to stay at large chain hotels when visiting NYC just to be close to the tourist attractions -- stay at The Shoreham and you'll get the same access to everything NYC offers while being able to enjoy one of the best boutique hotels in Manhattan -- for a nightly rate equal to or less than other large chain hotels!

I am taking into account that the hotel is in an absolutely excellent location, we felt the staff was INCREDIBLE, and the beds were comfortable. What else do you need? Our description of the hotel room was \"basic\"....sure the carpets didn't appear new, nor the walls newly painted. But the bathroom was clean, the price was right, we felt safe there, and we were only there for a couple of nights. To me, that makes a 4 star. We felt like we were in a 5 star with the attention the staff paid us. Temel at the front desk was SO amazing. He answered every question we had, recommended restaurants to eat, and truly tried to help in anyway he could to make our stay a great one. The doormen, right to the housekeeping staff were lovely and also very helpful. We were situated on the second floor right beside the elevators however (they said they were the only rooms with 2 double beds) but we were right BEHIND the elevators...which meant our heads shared a wall with the elevator wall. Not ideal, but we were only there 2 nights so it wasn't a deal breaker...it would have been, had we stayed longer.

Let's start with the lack of storage space to unload our clothes.  There were 3 adults staying for 5 days and no dresser drawers except for the small 2-drawer next to the furthest bed.  The desk had no storage.  There was no mini fridge.  You knew there were 3 adults checking in and only 2 bath towels were provided.  We had to call at least twice in the 5 day stay for the extra towel.  What was most disturbing was the lack of cleanliness of the carpet and headboard.  The entire rim of the the headboard was noticibly dirty and there were areas of the headboard that was torn.  And on top of all that we were next to the elevator.  I do understand someone had to get that room but at least give the guest(s) dresser drawers, mini fridge and a clean room with appropriate amount of toiletries.  I've never used a discounted vacation website and I assumed JetBlue would only refer hotels that stood behind their reputation that was marketed on JetBlue\/Tripadvisor's website.  After this experience I will not return to this hotel nor will I use any websites for discounted rates and I will inform Jetblue about my family's experience.

She assured me that yes it would and I packed up and moved only to find it had no bath!!I asked reception to find me the phone no. for Virgin Atlantic and when I called it the operator said that the number was not in service which I told the receptionist and she said it was the only number they had. Then when I received my bill they actually charged me 2 dollars for dialling the wrong number!Ordered a coffee one evening in the bar\/restaurant and when I still hadn\u2019t \u2019 got it after 20 minutes, asked where it was and the young lady said I\u2019ve made it i\u2019ll go and get it - it arrived in a disposable cup and was lukewarm! This is supposed to be a 4* hotel.I could go on but I found the staff totally lacking in any efficiency and needing a lot more training in customer service so I shan\u2019t be staying there ever again.

Era imposible estar dos personas dentro a la vez. Hasta el papel higi\u00e9nico estaba rozando la taza\nEl wifi, si lo quieres en la habitaci\u00f3n (que normalmente solo vas a usarlo por la ma\u00f1ana y por la noche)..... 14 d\u00f3lares !!! Me parece una verdadera estafa ese precio.\nLas habitaciones que nos tocaron daban al exterior y el ruido a motores durante toda la noche era insoportable.\nEn cuanto a la facturaci\u00f3n, un aut\u00e9ntico caos. Te retienen primero una noche en tu cuenta. Te la devuleven un tiempo despu\u00e9s. Te retienen una cantidad diaria por noche, pero todas las noches de una vez. Al pagar, te retienen el dinero total, luego te lo devuelven y finalmente te lo cobran definitivamente.\nLavar y planchar una prenda (cualquiera) son 10 d\u00f3lares. \nEl personal muy correcto y amable.\nEste hotel tiene cosas buenas, pero otras muchas para mejorar","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Far too many hotels offer 2 double beds in a single room , but this comprised of 2 seperate double bedrooms with a small sitting room in the middle. A total of 3 large screen TV's. made everyone happy when winding down for the night.

No fridge in room - however free ice machine in lobby which was good.\n2. No free WiFi in room (essential with teenage kids) Had to connect in lobby as I thought the in room wifi charge was excessive.\n3. Poor TV signal \/ picture - some channels had poor reception.\n4. Grubby \/ tired decor in some areas - some of the green fabric must have looked great and stylish when new - but its past its 'sell by date' and needs either removing or replacing. Some areas are not as 'polished' and well finished as say Hilton or other chain hotels - but did not bother me.\n5. Light switches a bit fiddly.

La chambre donnait sur l'arri\u00e8re et nous avons gard\u00e9 le store ferm\u00e9 pendant tout le s\u00e9jour: d'abord parce que la vue \u00e9tait horrible avec les murs des autres immeubles tr\u00e8s proches, cr\u00e9ant une impression claustrophobes et ensuite parce qu'il y avait des travaux et des ouvriers se baladait sur les \u00e9chafaudages avec vue plongeante dans les chambres.  Un jour pendant l'heure de pointe du matin, ils ont jug\u00e9 utile de descendre des anciens matelas et remonter des nouveaux; deux camions pleins!!! C'est bien de savoir qu'ils renouvellent la literie mais il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile d'utiliser un seul ascenseur au lieu de les monopoliser tous ou, encore mieux, effectuer ce d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement lors des heures creuses de la journ\u00e9e.  Autre point tr\u00e8s d\u00e9cevant: le wifi est gratuit dans le hall de l'h\u00f4tel (o\u00f9 il y a une demi-douzaine de fauteuils tr\u00e8s d\u00e9fraichis en guise de \"salon\") mais si on veut le wifi en chambre il fallait payer 15$.... De nos jours, et dans un h\u00f4tel soi-disant 4 \u00e9toiles, ce n'est pas acceptable \u00e0 mon avis.... Petit-d\u00e9jeuner d\u00e9cevant au bar, mais raisonnable en chambre (mais cher pour ce que c'est).\nA part tout \u00e7a, les membres du personnel auxquels j'ai eu \u00e0 faire, \u00e9taient professionnels et serviables. \n\n-------------\nThe first room that was given to us had a lot of problems: very noisy aircon, impossible to modulate the temperature, the room door did not close properly, the phone was not working, the whole impression of the room was \u00ab old \u00bb\u2026 I told the front desk about all these issues and they offered to change rooms the next day as the other room was occupied. We were given the same room, two floors higher. This time around, the aircon unit was a more recent model and the room seemed a bit \u201cfresher\u201d. However, the bathroom was tiny \u2013 especially compared to the room that was very big \u2013 the sink was very small, no space to put toiletries, one hook for 4 towels (2 people x 1 small and 1 large towel). In the room, one chair for a double room. We had to take turns to sit and eat breakfast in the morning. The safe was on a shelf high up in the closet; I had to stand on the chair to be able to see what i was putting in\/taking out). The view from the room was horrible; i did not expect a view of Central Park but having building walls a few meters away from the window was not appealing. In addition, there were workers going up and down on a scaffolding\u2026. \nOne day there was a delivery of new mattresses. Although it\u2019s nice to know that the bedding is being renewed, this could have been done after the morning rush hour. We had to wait a good 10 minutes before we could get an elevator to go downstairs\u2026 \nAnother disappointing point was that in room wifi was available at a 15$\/day price tag. Free wifi was available in the lobby area where people have about half a dozen old armchairs to sit in while guests are checking in or out\u2026  Nowadays, this is not acceptable from a supposedly 4-star hotel\u2026 Breakfast was disappointing at the bar but Ok in the room (even though i thought it was pretty expensive for what we got).\nOn a positive note, all staff that I dealt with was professional and helpful.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our room was perfect size, tidy, big comfy bed and a shower you dont want to get out off. We had fresh bedding everyday too, which was very welcome after a tiring day of sightseeing. The staff were all very nice and accommodating too. The only drawbacks werr the wifi charges ($18 a day if i remember right) and prices for food, which we didnt get as we had restaurants and bars only a few steps away. \n\nThis was my first visit to New York and i loved every minute of it. I definately recommend the Shoreham for any visit and would try to book again in the future.

There are thousands of places to eat but finding one you agree on is hard. We ate twice in Connollys Irish pub on 54th i think, very nice food. Also if you want a real New York breakfast like you see in the movies then head to 57th Streets Brooklyn Diner. I was starstruck when i looked to the side and Jerry Seinfeld was sat there.

I had very moderate expectations, because the hotel was chosen primarily for its location (which would be expensive) and it was offering the lowest price, which is often not a good sign. The location was as good as I had expected: close to all of the places that I needed to be near, and close to a number of subway stations, including a line towards the JFK AirTrain. Most of the staff I came across were very friendly and cheerful, and everyone without exception was happy to help with questions and requests throughout my stay - including room allocations for other friends who came and went during my stay.\n\nBecause of a special offer through an online agent, I had booked a \"premium king\", which was surprisingly spacious for NYC. (During my stay, I did briefly see a standard room, the size of which was more in line with what I would have expected for that kind of room, but far from the worst shockers that I have seen in NYC.) However, the shower room was equally surprisingly tiny; it wasn't a problem as I didn't plan to spend much time in there, but it was a room in which I needed to move carefully. Everything was, however, in good condition - including a very powerful shower and plenty of hot water.\n\nThe facilities in the room were generally very good. Unusually for a hotel, there was a bright light over the desk and another one over the bed, so that it was possible to read with ease. A Bose clock radio\/CD player was another unexpected pleasure, and left me wishing I'd known in advance so that I could have brought some CDs with me. The air conditioning unit was the only real disappointment about the room: it was noisy, and for some reason a moderate room temperature could only be selected as a \"temporary override\" which would clear after a while, leaving the unit to target a much higher temperature. Fortunately, outside temperatures meant that this posed no real difficulty - but if it had been during hotter weather, I would have been complaining about this.\n\nThe only other niggle was the internet arrangements. To avoid a $15-a-day charge, you have to go down to the lobby and use the free internet in the public areas, into which a lot of cigarette smoke drifts from the smokers congregating in the street right outside the doors. This seemed unfriendly when compared to the all of the other ways in which the hotel tried to make my stay easy.\n\nI'm not much bothered by the size of the hotel's front door. It's what's inside that matters, and what was inside means that this hotel will definitely be on the shortlist again for future trips to NYC.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

First off, we called from the airport about two hours before arriving at the hotel, asking for a crib to be in the room when we got there and they said it would be. We arrive and there is no crib in the room and we had to call the front desk again about the crib being delivered. The room was extremely small, nothing like any of the pictures shown on the website. The bathroom was tiny and it was hard to close and open the door because the toilet was so close. The bathroom looked like they had taken the decor from a local jail. The shower was gross and nasty. The bathroom door was not able to close due to a weak magnet being the only thing that held it closed. We called maintenance about it and all he said was that we should close the door very slowly to get the magnet to latch. Needless to say, you have no privacy when you're in the bathroom. The television looked like they plugged their cable into a neighbors cable box. It was absolutely terrible, all channels had a \"snow\" on them and the remote worked only occasionally. We also pointed this out to maintenance and he said that they'd check it out. It never got better. The bed was curved in the middle, so you were perpetually sleeping in an inclined position, rendering it impossible to sleep on your side or stomach. The windows were so thin that you could hear people on the street talking from 6 floors up, and hear the rowdy hotel bar crowd screaming. They were painting the building while we were there and the smell of paint inside the room was nauseating. The building is quite old, and not in the cool way. My husband went downstairs to get some plastic cups because they were never replenished when the room was cleaned and they told him they would send some up, it never happened so i called down and they had someone bring some up and he basically threw the cups at me. No coffee pot, but you could order a pot for like 9 or 10 bucks, no microwave, no fridge. We ended up checking out early, forfeiting money that we'd paid for the whole week because it was so terrible.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The cocktails were excellent  apparently created by the waitress serving us Naomi Shap I believe, it was some type of citrus mix, and it got my light weight friend tipsy. It tasted so truly fresh I asked ms. Naomi and she said she hand squeezed all the juices for her drinks at the beginning of her shift. We ordered a few light things from the menu; I got a Margarita pizza while one of my pals got a burger, we decided to split an order of truffle fries. OH. MY. GOD. The food was AMAZING the truffle fries were simply addictive. Our server ms. Naomi was also such a pleasant gal to have there. she informed us of the awesome things that were new and interesting in Manhattan. There were only a few things that bothered me. When i went upstairs to my friends room I immediately was freezing all over the rooms are just plain cold. Maybe the manager is suffering from severe menopause or something but it feels like the arctic north when you go upstairs. Another thing that bothered me was the green lounge chairs all over the lobby. At first they are comfortable, but you end up sinking into the material. Other seats in the far hall are just long couches in neutral pallets that are stiff as a board. Overall it was a delightful experience in the lounge and a lacking experience it comfy seating.

After explaining to the hotel that i was pregnant, and that this was unacceptable, they were able to find me a room for the night and would move me to my original suite the next day. Throughout my stay, i had overheard MANY guests that were actually bumped and had to stay at a hotel a few blocks away that was very gross!\n\nThe hotel:\nThe hotel is very small, and the best thing about it is the location. The first room that i stayed in was very tiny (typical for NYC), but also very dirty. There was a HUGE stain on the carpet that was over 5 feet long. The AC in the room was so loud, it sounded like sleeping next to an engine. The second room i stayed in was the suite tha ti had originally booked, much better in terms of quality.  \n\nThe staff:\nI encountered two staff members that really went above and beyond to help me with everything. Tim and Dany really went all out to make sure that i felt very welcomed and didn't have any issues. They understood how frustrated and exhausted i was, and did everything to make sure that i didn't have any issues. They provided me with comped breakfast everyday and free wifi. Dany also helped me with some charge errors on my bill involving the wifi. If anything, Tim and Dany deserve a raise! \n\nI had a brief experience with a staff member who was somewhat rude and abrasive, she was not helpful and was very abrupt in her responses, her name was Gina. When she told me that my room was ready to be moved, i had explained to her that Tim & Dany had said they would have a bellman assist with the move of my luggage and boxes (i had a lot of luggage and boxes due to being in NYC for a business trip and events). She told me that it was the guests responsibility to move their own luggage, in a rude tone. Once i had told her that i was pregnant, she literally looked over the counter in what seemed to confirm that i was telling the truth! The nerve! I told her that i was 3 months, but still needed help. She then said okay, thats fine someone will help. When it came time to move my luggage, there was no bellman to help, the cleaning lady offered to help after i once again had to explain that i was pregnant. \n\nThe wifi:\nI was given a passcode for the wifi, but in my first room the code wasn't working. When i called down to the front desk, the lady told me that she would have my 3rd part company would call my room directly to help me figure it out. I was on the phone with Natural Wireless for over 10 minutes and it was concluded that it wouldn't work...When i got into my new room it was working fine. BUT, when i went to check out, they tried to charge me for a 10 minute long distant phone call!??!?! WTF! It was your wifi network calling ME to help trouble shoot for the wifi?!?!?! Luckily, Dany was able to help me resolve that at checkout and had it removed from my bill. (again, so thankful that the Shoreham has employees like Dany & Tim. Shoreham management should have these 2 employees rewarded and show the other staff what it means to truly provide great customer service.\n\nOverall, my original rating was going to be terrible, as there were some other bumps that didn't make it to this review, but due to two A-plus staffers, my review was able to get back up to average.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

En outre, la salle de bain \u00e9tait minuscule .... tout juste la place pour poser le vanity !\n\nNous \u00e9tions venu en groupe. Nous sommes redescendus pour en faire part \u00e0 notre guide. Impossible de changer de chambre, il fallait attendre le lendemain.\n\nPremi\u00e8re nuit chaotique : impossible de dormir ! Notre fils s'est lev\u00e9 \u00e0 4 h du mat en demandant s'il pouvait aller dormir sur le canap\u00e9 dans le hall d'entr\u00e9e !!!!!!!\n\nPremi\u00e8re douche ... pas mieux ... l'eau stagnait dans la baignoire .... oblig\u00e9 d'attendre un peu entre deux douches !\n\nBref, le matin nous sommes all\u00e9s demander \u00e0 changer de chambre.

Ce n'\u00e9tait pas possible de faire le transfert car les chambres n'\u00e9taient pas pr\u00eates. Il fallait regrouper tout dans la chambre et c'est le personnel qui ferait le transfert. Nous avons rendus les cl\u00e9s et sommes partis soulag\u00e9s \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de pouvoir dormir le soir. ....\n\nEn rentrant nous avons r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 notre ancienne chambre. Nous avons fait un scandale. Le r\u00e9ceptionniste, qui ne parlait pas fran\u00e7ais, restait implacable. Bref, il s'en foutait ! Inutile de vous dire que nous n'avons pas beaucoup dormi et m\u00eame avec des boules quies.\n\nLe lendemain matin, nous avons revu la r\u00e9ceptionniste fran\u00e7ais (Diane nous semble-t-il).

Incomparable : situ\u00e9e c\u00f4t\u00e9 Ouest, au 7\u00e8me \u00e9tage, elle donnait toujours dans la cours int\u00e9rieure mais le bruit \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s supportable. La salle de bain \u00e9tait deux fois plus grande !\n\nCette chambre disponible d\u00e8s 9 h du matin semble indiquer que l'h\u00f4tel aurait pu nous donner cette chambre la veille au soir ..... on nous avait pourtant signifi\u00e9 que l'h\u00f4tel \u00e9tait complet !\n\nUne autre famille du groupe (au deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tage) s'\u00e9tait \u00e9galement plaint du bruit et qu'elle ne pouvait pas dormir mais comme elle n'a pas fait un scandale elle a d\u00fb subir le bruit jusqu'au bout puisqu'elle n'a pas chang\u00e9 de chambre.\n\nBref un sentiment d'avoir eu les chambres les plus pourries de l'h\u00f4tel comme le commentaire de Ernesty 78. Faut-il \u00e9viter cet h\u00f4tel d\u00e8s que nous arrivons en groupe ? Plusieurs familles ont eu effectivement la colonne \u00e0 \u00e9viter : 209 - 309 (notre chambre) - 409.\n\nPour terminer, le petit d\u00e9jeuner n'\u00e9tait pas digne d'un 4 \u00e9toiles. Pas de pain, juste des tranches de pain de mie. La viennoiserie \u00e9tait molle, les fruits de la salade de fruit \u00e9taient durs.\n\nBref, si vous allez dans cet h\u00f4tel \u00e9vitez le c\u00f4t\u00e9 Est et surtout les chambres 209, 309 et 409. \n\nMerci \u00e0 cette r\u00e9ceptionniste qui \u00e9tait vraiment au petit soin pour nous.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

If noise at night is a concern, this may not be the hotel for you.  Also, the area around the Shoreham is appallingly congested.

Our junior suite featured a spacious living room and spacious bedroom.  The bathroom, on the other hand, was tiny and difficult to use.  We liked the Shoreham\u2019s minimalist, shades-of-grey d\u00e9cor, though the furniture in our living room was uncomfortable.\n\nThe Shoreham offers virtually no free amenities.

Inexpensive for a large two bedroom suite with sitting area and tub with separate shower.  All other hotels in the same area were WAY more expensive.  Pros are its location, price, friendly staff, and strong water pressure and hot water for showering.  Really great shower.  Cons are our room showing some wear and tear and no fridge or coffee maker.  This is a no frills hotel.  You won't walk in and go \"wow!!!\".  Also the beds were broken.  The mattresses on both beds sank so much in the middle it was ridiculous.  They are definitely in need of replacing.  If I wasn't already unpacked and it was late at night when I got into bed I would have insisted on being moved.  The beds are that bad.

Wow, was I wrong about anything I had been worried about!! We have stayed in probably 15 other hotels in Midtown and this hotel is really good...even better than some other \"higher star\" hotels.  Nice rooms, quiet. Great location. Excellent staff.\n\nFirst, we stayed in two different rooms. The first, was just a \"standard\" room with queen bed. Very clean, comfortable bed, large bathroom (good water pressure). For 2 people it was fine. It was super quiet, as well.   The second room, a one bedroom suite was HUGE.  King sized bed. Separate sitting area with a combo sofa\/bed (NOT a pull out..more like a pull down, to make the bed).  Bathroom was tiny, however.  Again, very clean and quiet.  Loved having the extra room and you could have easily fit 3 people in this room (with roll out beds). \n\nShoreham Bar and Grill is excellent. Breakfast is a bit pricey but was included in our package. Very, very good breakfast options. Ate dinner at the restaurant one evening. Found the food to be good and prices more reasonable.  Usually don't eat at hotel restaurants (its NYC after all...many, many, many options to choose from) but am glad I did.\n\nTim at the front desk is AMAZING. Such a nice guy and willing to help in any way he can. Was able to easily get us the room upgrade the second day, minimizing any down time when switching rooms.  Fully explained all the hotel policies, charges, location of things.  Very professional all around.  The housekeeping staff was great, the front door bellhop was very nice, as well. Keep it up Shoreham!\n\nAll public areas were very clean, including carpeting in hallways. Wifi in lobby was super fast. Hotel was very quiet.  Great location. Within 2 blocks of subway, close to all Midtown attractions. \n\nOverall, I would book here again with 100% confidence.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When I started to tell her what was happening the manager told me \"'Sir I will take care of this OK\"\" go do your things and when you get back everything will be fine....so I left and came back around 4pm...got my new room key and to my surprise they put me in the Penthouse....Wow..Wow...Wow...they had even moved my belongings I could not believe they put me in this massive room...its was like being in a movie...so what can I say from a bad start to a great finish...I cant wait to go back to the Shoreham...","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Deixamos a mala no guarda volumes e a atendente nos disse que enviaria uma SMS para meu celular assim que nosso quarto estivesse pronto. Voltamos por volta das 14:30, nosso quarto estava pronto e nada de SMS.

In the reception area Anna Castano was great, took my number to let me know if my room was ready earlier, kept our luggage from before checking in and after check out making it ultra convenient for sightseeing.
