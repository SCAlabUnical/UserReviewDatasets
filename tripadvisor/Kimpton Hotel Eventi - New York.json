We had no complaints from our stay. The hotel appeared as fairly clean throughout. We had a room on the 12th floor and although we requested a room away from elevators we took room 1208. It was not directly next to elevators and we did not encounter any noise. We had two queen beds in the room, access to a large TV, a walk in shower, a closet, and a clean sink and toilet. Plenty of space in the bathroom. There was also some bits and bobs if you forgot them. A good range of clean towels were also provided. I did notice some staining on some of the bedding one night when I got into it but it was not a major issue. On a morning you could access free coffee which we did to get us going. This was nice but would have been great to have a differing option suitable for children. We never really made the wine hours as we were often out sightseeing. The hotel stored our cases on the last day so we could explore Central Park. It has a great location this hotel with good access to subways and Penn Station. Plenty of things round about also. We dined in Skirt one evening and had a set steak meal and this was good also.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Several other hotels we had contacted were unresponsive, barely offered us any discount for our courtesy block, and wanted us to agree to strange indemnification terms.   We were pretty put off, but our call to the Eventi was a welcome relief.  Elliot in sales was incredibly responsive, offered us a very reasonable rate, and sent a straightforward contract.  In the weeks leading up to the wedding, the reservations desk sent us regular updates of the reserved guests in our block for planning\/gift purposes.  And everything we heard from our guests was extremely positive.  The rooms are very comfortable and more spacious than others in the area.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  And everybody loved the restaurant (L'Amico).  We are so glad we  got in touch with the Eventi and thankful to the team for making it such a seamless and positive experience for everyone.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Just had 5 days in NYC and we are so glad we chose this hotel. The location is great, far enough away from the chaos of Times Sq, but close to the subway and PATH, 5th Ave shopping, Hudson Yards, and ESB, not to mention the Sixth Ave Gourmet Garden Deli a block away - a great spot for a breakfast BEC). The rooms were a good size for Manhattan, and were spotlessly clean. The bed was the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever slept on in a hotel. We had lunch at L\u2019Amico and that was delicious, and the Back Bar is a comfortable, stylish and chilled place for evening drinks - thanks to whoever put together the playlist in there too. \n\nHowever, the real stars of the hotel are, as always, the staff. You are guaranteed a friendly welcome, but they recognise the value in getting tired travellers checked in and to their room quickly and efficiently. On the day we were leaving, I asked if they could store our bags until we left, but they told us to just keep the room until we were ready. It\u2019s little things like that which make a stay so much more than standard. They also offered a luxury transfer to JFK for a better price than I had seen it anywhere. Finally, the biggest shoutout has to go to the housekeeping guys. We came back to our room each day and it looked like it did when we checked in. That is so welcome when you come back tired after a day of exploring. \n\nThank you, Team Kimpton Eventi, you made our stay in NYC very special. \n\nThe Johnson family.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As I reflect on my experiences, I find myself at a loss for where to begin, so let me simply proclaim: this is, unequivocally, my favorite haven in the heart of the Big Apple!\n\nThis place has become my go-to spot in the city, and let me tell you why.\n\nFirst off, the location is unbeatable. You're smack dab near all the good stuff: Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Koreatown, Macy's, Penn Station, Herald Square, Madison Square Park\u2014you name it, it's close by. Convenience level? A solid 10\/10.\n\nBut let's talk about what really makes the Eventi shine: the people. Shoutout to Victoria and the whole crew for making every stay feel like coming home. Seriously, these folks go above and beyond to make sure you're comfy and happy. They possess an innate ability to anticipate your needs, surpass your expectations, and make you feel cherished, valued, and most importantly, at home. Service and hospitality is an 11\/10. (yes, 11\/10)\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the views and the rooms.  Super luxurious, clean and incredible views. Rooms and views, a solid 10\/10! \n\nLong story short, my loyalty to the Eventi is not merely a product of its opulent amenities or enviable location\u2014it is a testament to the incomparable warmth and hospitality that permeates every corner of this extraordinary establishment. For anyone seeking an unforgettable sojourn in the heart of New York City, look no further than the Kimpton Eventi. Your journey begins here, and I promise you, it will be nothing short of extraordinary.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My husband and I stayed at the Kimpton Hotel Eventi in January to attend his father's memorial service. The bellman had our luggage, including our carry ons on his cart when they were stolen -- someone grabbed them and ran. The hotel has the entire incident on video. Legally, the hotel is 200% responsible for the replacement of all of our stolen items (2 laptops, an iPad, all of my good jewelry including my engagement ring and marriage band, diamond earrings, etc.). The manager of the hotel never even had the courtesy to come down or apologize to us for our loss. The Kimpton insurance representative, Broadspire, has acknowledged that the hotel is absolutely responsible for our loss, but they've made us jump through hoops to document everything that was stolen (try documenting family heirloom jewelry -- but we did solely because my mother kept fabulous records and appraisals). It's now been 7-months since the theft and despite documenting *everything,* that was stolen, we've yet to receive a check or any communication from the hotel at all. It's clear that they're dragging their feet because they think we'll go away -- but we won't! Do not stay here! There are plenty of hotels in NYC. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere that respects and treats their guests properly and with respect in times of trouble. To try and get out of reimbursing us what they legally owe us is slimy and shameful. We've already told our Forbes Top 25 travel agent about this and she's removed the Kimpton brand from her list of recommended hotels. Really people -- cross this chain off your list. This is no way to treat people who were robbed during broad daylight while their luggage and personal belongings were in possession of the hotel bellman. Stay somewhere else. If something bad or unfortunate should happen to you while you're a guest at a Kimpton, don't expect them to stand behind you or help you in any way. Again -- buyer beware!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had windows that gave us a view of the top part of the Empire State Building and the gold top of the New York Life building. (see photos). The room was a decent size by Manhattan standards and had a super luxurious, large shower with rain head + strong hand-held sprays. There was also a large desk, a mini-fridge, a safe and robes. Oddly, the safe could not fit my 15\" Mac Air laptop.\n\nThe hotel offered a complimentary wine happy hour from 5-6 pm on a rooftop terrace. Very nice. The staff were competent and helpful throughout.\n\nOne of the advantages of the Kimpton's location for us was that it was an easy walk with rolling luggage from Penn Station, an easy walk to various subway stations, and is adjacent to Koreatown which, of us, was really fun, with tons of tasty dining and dessert options.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Had high expectation from these reviews and thus was very disappointed in my stay. \n\nTHE GOOD\n-Upon request, we were kindly upgrade to a suite  which was available when we checked in. \n-Room had a safe and bathrobes, no slippers. But bathrobes were not in plastic and given our negative feelings about the hotel we chose not to use them as there was no indication they had actually been cleaned. \n-Windows opened albeit just a bit. better than nothing but very noisy from the skateboarders in the park below.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD\n-Suite didn't have a coffee pot or tea kettle. I requested a tea kettle which was delivered along with 2 brown mugs but I was told they have no tea. Apparently, you need to know to bring your own tea or go out shopping which is what we did. Really??? \n-Couldn't connect to wifi. luckily my cell service worked. \n-No complementary water in room (diamond and platinum members)\n-One Reading light broken. \n-Tablet was missing. When we notified hotel they said there was no-one there to program a new tablet so we didn't have use of one. \n-Minibar price list is on the tablet. We called front desk twice to request an email of price list as we had a choice of $15 credit for Platinum amenity, finally we went downstairs and asked them to print it. \n-Phone was broken. Buttons don't work and they know that. You need to dial zero for operator. No sign indicating that procedure. (hey, just give us a hint)\n-Huge chunks of brown paint peeling (and hanging) from the ceiling. White wall underneath. Housekeeper never noticed this??\n-Shower made a thunderous thumping noise when in use, could hear it in the living room. \n-Asked for a list of local restaurant recommendations (again asked twice and then went to front desk for printing). List had 75 names on it. Only one had an address. They were located all over the city. Hey, is it so hard to include addresses so we can choose location?\n-This was not that important but on my reservation I noted that it was a birthday celebration. No recognition of this. (I'm diamond) Wasn't expecting a gift but a simple \"Happy Birthday\" would have been nice. \n-They charged me for a minibar item which we did not take. Upon complaint, they say they have taken it off my credit card. So far credit has not shown up but it likely will. \n---More... but I'm tired of typing...plastic cups for happy hour, no food happy hour not even signature truffle popcorn, silly half drawers in room.................\n\nThere are a lot of great hotels in NYC. Needless to say, this is not one we will be returning to. I've only been to a few Kimpton's but recently to the Tokyo Kimpton and Philadelphia Palomar which both make Eventi seem like a Day's inn.

Despite the fact it was Christmas and the hotel had many available rooms left, the upgrade was the minimum they could give.\n\nThe hotel bar and restaurants feel very separate, meaning the public areas of this large hotel are very restrictive.  The wine hour, a feature of all Kimptons during our stay was in a corridor outside function rooms on an upper floor.  Wine was terrible, and there was no atmosphere.  Not worth having at all.\n\nThere was no water in the room, even for Diamond members.  There was a large bottle with a price tag and then 2 small bottles in the fridge without a price tag.  We assumed these were free but we were charged for them.\n\nAs a Diamond member we were entitled to free breakfast, however at Eventi we were made feel like second class citizens.  We were given a menu which looked interesting, however when we said we were Diamond members it was taken way from us and we were offered very limited options - no meat or fish options.  Even though it was free we didn\u2019t return as it was so poor.  Service at breakfast was terrible also.\n\nSo overall a great disappointment,and the worst offer for an IHG member I have seen in any Kimpton.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Managers also attentive and responsive. \n- Beautiful interiors, marble bathroom. \n- Views from the room were beautiful too. \n- Tech in room was great. \n- Beds comfortable. \n- Good extra resources like umbrellas, coffee machine etc. \n\nCon\u2019s\n- There were no teabags in the room. We had to go to a local shop and buy some ourselves. They brought us a kettle to the room and milk (after 7am) but I found it odd there wasn\u2019t any tea as every hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in has it! \n- There was a continuous smell of cannabis in our room (17th floor) on multiple nights, coming from another room. Although this was somewhat out of the hotels control, we chose to sleep down in the lobby a couple of nights due to our personal circumstances. The hotel sent security up to try and find the culprit as this was against their non smoking policy in the hotel (cannabis is now legal in NYC). This unfortunately didn\u2019t deter the culprit as it continued throughout our stay. The hotel did reimburse us for the inconvenience, it\u2019s just a shame that they couldn\u2019t resolve the issue sooner. \n\nBy the way - the steak restaurant next door is phenomenal! Best steak I\u2019ve had. And the desserts are wonderful. Long queues each night (not just hotel guests) so get there early if you don\u2019t want to wait. \n\nThank you Kimpton Eventi.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Got a low floor, back of the building view. Asked if they could move us the next day when a room became available. They said yes but \u2014 you need to call us before noon tomorrow, we can\u2019t tell you what room you will move to, bring all your stuff downstairs, fully check out and then wait and we can check you back in at 3 PM. Silly. Eventually we escalated to a manger who helped move us once a room was available directly to the new room (like is normal). \n\n2) Got sick during my stay and wanted to order food over the phone. FYI - despite what it says on their website and it being 2023 they do not do room service, or bring uber eats \/ caviar orders to the room. It\u2019s like a dorm - you need to go downstairs and pick it up from a random table in the lobby. Anyways, I called the restaurant to place the order for pick up over the phone. They said they are unable to take orders over the phone and all orders must be placed in person. Again, why? Foolish. Intentionally wanted to minimize the time I spent in any common space because I was sick. The restaurant staff in person was clueless until a manager jumped in and helped get a basic order placed. \n\nIn both instances \u2014 basic normal requests were made more difficult and required manager escalation to resolve.

Hotel Eventi does what all others claim, but can't pull off.  The location is perfect no matter where you are coming from.  The hotel staff is stellar and the suites are fabulous.  It has a Vegas vibe without being pretentious.  Everything here was on point.  I have been in my share of NYC hotels, and they are often a pain, because they advertise one thing, and always fall short.  Hotel Eventi is the antidote.  First, the staff greets you with a warm welcome, as you enter this very cool lobby.  Check-in was easy and up to my floor.  Most floors are keycard access only, so safety is key.  They suite was a great respite from a trip that had a lot of twists and turns.  The room was immaculate, with a generous bathroom\/shower.  The bed was wonderful and peaceful.  The windows are super insulated, so you barely hear any outside noise, including sirens.  Yes, you can actually get sleep here.  \n\nAnother thing is that if you know the Kimpton brand, you know they always deliver.  I was checked in by the wonderful Emily!  What I also loved is that everyone was truly enjoying themselves.  Everyone, including other patrons, were personable and respectful.  It was like one big party, but subdued like in a James Bond movie.  They have a restaurant on property, that although I did not have the opportunity to drop in due to other engagements, the aroma's coming out of there were incredible.  \n\nEverything here is about treating you like family and showing that they care.  I asked for extra towels when I booked, and they left me plenty.  It was easy to relax and kick my feet up.  Whether you are visiting from another state, country or close-by and just want a place to stay in the city, you cannot go wrong here.  This place serves every purpose.  The General Services Manager, Victoria, was so extremely personable and attentive.  Anything they can do to help you have a great stay, they will.  NYC was really cold when I arrived, but my room got me away from all of that. \n\nI have found THE hotel I will now be reserving anytime I am flying into NYC.  The price point is great and you cannot beat the location.  I cannot say enough about my stay, as I have had so many bad experiences with hotels previously.  This has entirely changed my outlook  and I am so very thankful to all the staff for a wonderful stay.  I cannot wait to see you all on my return.  Do yourself a favor, book here!  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. \n\nThe photo I took of the Empire State Building was taken right from within my room!\n\nThank you!","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our flight has been late and our kids pre-arrived an hour earlier at the hotel but where not allowed to check in initially (same name and one kid above 18) .

I'm a huge fan of Kimpton Hotels and am beyond thrilled whenever I travel for work and find the Eventi is an approved option in our travel tool. My company is frugal and the options are generally limited. The Eventi however, is by far, my FAVORITE NYC hotel. The location is ideal. It is also beautiful, quiet, and makes me feel like I'm at my home away from home. \n\nNow. It's literally been years since I was able to secure a work-approved rate at the Eventi. [I'm still surprised I was able to get it for this trip!] The minute I walked into the lobby at 9:45pm EST on Monday, 10\/18\/22, it was clear that the Eventi had only gotten better with age. It had been a FULL DAY of cross-country travel that felt like it started a week ago but in reality was really just 5am PST. Either way, I was beyond exhausted when Yaya began the check-in process. She was kind and her positivity immediately shifted my mood. Yaya seemed genuinely interested in identifying what she could do to make me comfortable as soon as possible -- before I was in the elevator she had ordered a Nespresso machine to the room along with some toiletries I had forgotten. Yaya's customer focus and devotion to creating a seamless customer experience was refreshing. I realized how much of a standout the Eventi and Kimpton experience is.

Jennifer assisted us with our check in and was very attentive throughout our stay, definitely ask for her when you book your next stay. The best part was they do ask for a key card to enter the hotel after a certain time which made us feel very safe by the security, book the Kimpton Eventi for your next stay!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room is also staying blissfully cool during a record heat wave in NYC- a little but incredibly important detail. \n\nEmily M was also sure to point out additional features such as cocktail hours, coffee and tea bars and such which give this hotel an added boost in my opinion.

They left a sweet note for us after we left a tip for them. Kyle was an excellent host in the bar area, he was very sweet and answered all of our questions about the area and gave us ideas of places to go. We had complimentary wine at the bar and ordered the wood oven pizza for an appetizer! It was the best pizza I've ever had. The glass of wine was a French red and was very good as well. The second night we sat next to the fireplace on a comfortable couch in the library and had our nightly complimentary wine. Beautiful and sweet room! We ate at Skirt Steak and the steak was good, but the unlimited fries were even better. It is a bistro so we didn't linger because we new there was a long line outside.  Unfortunately, we felt a bit rushed by the staff. They were pulling plates off the table while some were still eating. It kind of ruined the ambiance and feeling of the place. The third restaurant at Eveni is L'amico. We had several meals that were very delicious! We discovered that the cook is french even though it is an Italian restaurant. But he really knows what he is doing. I want to steal him and bring him back to Chicago!! The staff was great, and Kennito was our waiter and had wonderful suggestions and treated us to a dessert called Italian Meringue. We came back and had it again the next day! It was so good!

The location is outstanding - very walkable to many sights including Broadway shows and well-connected with both subway stations and Penn Station within a very short distance. Although there was the typical big-city panhandling and regular sirens, we felt safe walking in the neighborhood both day and night. \nI had emailed ahead of time to let them know we would be arriving early. We were even earlier than planned after taking public transit from LaGuardia so we left our luggage, went for lunch and when we came back, our room was ready. \nI had booked a \"Deluxe\" category room which are the corner rooms. We were assigned a room on the 11th floor (#1101) and had an absolutely outstanding view of the Empire State Building and the skyline. It was a real treat to have such a great view! \nThe room was very comfortable with a good-sized closet to put everything away. There was no seating other than a desk chair but the views made up for that. The bathroom is very large with lots of counter space and a huge walk-in shower. We were pleased that we were able to request daily housekeeping. After several Covid-era stays at other hotels with no housekeeping, it was a treat to come back to a fully made-up room after a busy day of sightseeing. Many compliments to the housekeeping staff!! \nI was very impressed with the ability to receive a quick response by text from the concierge. They set up our housekeeping time each day, recommended restaurants and answered questions within minutes every time. \nWe always enjoy the evening wine reception when we stay at Kimptons. It's a nice chance to wind, review the day and decide on dinner. There was no information about it in the welcome letter nor did the front desk staff mention it so it was hard to know what to do as it wasn't in the lobby as other Kimptons do. The wine was available at the regular bar so it seemed awkward to ask for the complimentary wine while others were ordering expensive cocktails and snacks from the bar. The night the bar was closed, there was no wine reception which was a little disappointing. It was the same situation for the morning coffee. Instead of a carafe in the lobby for free use by guests, we had to get paper cups from the coffee bar barista and then pour our own coffee at the bar. \nWe didn't utilize the hotel restaurant or bar other than for the above-mentioned services but they both seemed to have a lively atmosphere and looked inviting. We walked around the corner to Essa Bagel every morning and visited several neighborhood restaurants in the evenings. Don't miss a chance to visit Korea town! \nThere was a problem with our bill on check-out but it was handled quickly, politely and in our favor by the front desk manager. Since we booked directly with Kimpton, I would have expected the \"estimated charges\" would have been closer than they were (around $75). This is a Kimpton problem, not a local hotel problem and it sounds like others had run into this previously. Be aware there is a $20\/night \"resort fee\". \nWe would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in a great location.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Because there were so many things WRONG!!! \nI stayed here here beginning of November for two nights. I feel bad complaining since I got the room at a discounted Annual sale price. But over $800 for two nights is a big chunk of money to me and the One Bedroom \"Premium\" suite was definitely not premium. \nI communicated with multiple staff that this was a birthday trip for myself. NO mention of my birthday upon check in, no note in the room, nothing. \n\nIn the room: First thing I noticed was the couch had a big rip in it (see photo) about 3 inches long. Hello Eventi!! Fix it - this is supposed to be \"premium\"and this is an easy fix!!!\n well now its down a few notches.....THEN I go into the bedroom, and the TV in the bedroom had all these wires hanging down from the back of it- definitely NOT PREMIUM, Hello Eventi!! FIX IT!! How hard can that be?? Really??\nI tried to use the safe - BROKEN!! They send someone up to fix it. He says it can't be fixed and leaves. Seriously?????\n\nThen I go into the bathroom. The doors and trim are supposed to be dark brown - well see the accompanying photos. I can not believe how badly the paint was chipped and PEELING off the door trim. GROSS!! and the trim near the floor was covered in crud. (I freaked out once the daylight came and I could see the crud on it) There is absolutely NO EXCUSE for this. touching up the paint is an easy fix Hello Eventi!! FIX IT\n\nThere was also marks on the door to the toilet that were drips from steam accumulated during a shower. How long has it been since that door was cleaned...maybe never??? Sorry didnt get a photo of that. \n\n!! getting way down there several notches BELOW \"premium\" My first morning I looked for the hairdryer...it was in a bag under the sink...(see photo) it was covered in dust!! I mean thick dust...obviously the area under the sink had not been cleaned in a very very long time.\nThe second shower head  was also broken- it would not stay up, it kept falling down . Hello Eventi FIX IT!! \nThe lobby is nice  - but what good is a nice lobby?? You have to have the bedrooms up to snuff THAT'S where people are spending their time!!! This is supposed to be a luxury hotel and that was supposed to be a \"Premium\" room. NOT!! very disappointing. what's worse is they are easy fixes but Eventi does not seem to care.\nThe wifi , even for an IGH and Kimpton member was basically non existent is was so slow. I stopped using it.\n\nGood things? I was able to text them with questions, I liked that. I am hearing impaired and the lobby acoustics are bad so texting was great for me.\nYes the ice machine is on the 5th floor with a giant scoop to get the ice in a big plastic bag they provide there but there is also hand sanitizer right by the ice machine and frankly that did not bother me at all.\nThey provide free coffee in the mornings, and they do still have a wine hour 5-6, which I missed both days but that's OK.\nAlso there was housekeeping everyday which surprised me. That was nice. I liked the location, close to Penn Station, I took the train so its a three block walk. It's also a few minutes to the Flat Iron district which I like. And its just a block from Herald Square if you are into that. There is a great Fairway Grocery store a couple blocks down...DON'T use the bogus store Sunsweet Fresh Market across the street - the cashier tried to rip me off!! and the food was awful. Fairway is much better!\nSo all in all - I give the actual room I stayed in 2 stars (the bed was nice but otherwise disappointing) and the hotel 3 stars. I should have spent my money at The Hotel Giraffe (AND for $100 LESS!!) . There you are guaranteed everything is always in tip top shape. I'll remember that next time.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

You have to travel to the 5th floor and fill up a bag (not even a bucket) of ice from a machine that is not sanitary.  While this is obviously a first-world problem, it's not acceptable for a luxury hotel.  I've been traveling during covid and never seen this.  In addition to having to go the 5th floor for ice, the ice is not a dispenser it is a machine and you have to use the same scoop that all customers use.

I'll be honest, the main reason I selected this hotel was because my wife asked for a soaking tub. The Kimpton has them! I'm IHG and booked with points. Check-in was early, so they stored our luggage and recommended a lunch place. All the staff were helpful and pleasant. Options for daily service, just have to tell them.

My stay was mixed; I liked the room but service was more in line with select service hotels, not full service.  \n\nSuite upgrades for loyalty program elite guests at various hotel chains in NYC are not common but Kimpton surprised me at check-in with a wonderful upgrade to a suite as Spire Ambassador guest.\n\nThe suite was not huge but 500 square feet is not bad at all for NYC standards especially considering the numerous hotels with small entry level rooms who do not upgrade generously.  The bathroom was well done with marble everywhere and a spacious walk-in shower with good water pressure.  I also liked that the room had minimal use of carpet to give a clean feeling.  They also had Atelier Bloem bathroom amenities and Frette bathrobes.  \n\nService is where the hotel came up short in my opinion.  First of all due to covid there was no room service, however the restaurant was open so it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have food, and the covid excuse would be more suitable if they suspended dinner in the restaurant instead of  room service.  It was more a matter that they didn\u2019t want to send their staff to guest rooms.  This theme repeated itself when I needed documents to be printed.  When I stay at a limited service hotel like a Holiday Inn, I go to the business center and I do everything myself, but if I am staying at a full service hotel I do not hesitate to send a document by e-mail to front desk and ask them to bring it to my room when I am busy.  I do not recall any full service hotel ever refusing such demands so I was surprised when they told me I had to pick up my printout myself at reception.  No big deal but it does not give a feeling of a service-oriented hotel and to make matters worse, guests are charged a 20 USD amenity fee which is supposed to include business services so one more reason to feel their refusal was a bit awkward.\n\nUnfortunately this topic did not end there.  I had the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d light on while I was in my room on various days but housekeeping came knocking on my door at least once a day \u2013 the complete opposite attitude than their colleagues at reception: coming to my room when I did not want them to.  To make matters worse, one day there was even someone from security who came knocking on my door not long after housekeeping did and said it was because I had the DND light on the last couple of days so it was a health check.  Never mind that if they had accepted to bring my printed documents to my room they could have seen themselves that I was doing just fine, plus the fact that staff at front desk saw me alive and kicking when I picked up my documents.  So obviously they do not intend to respect DND signs and also do not communicate with front desk either. \n\nOverall I would say Kimpton Eventi can be a good fit or a bad fit depending on what guests value the most.  If someone wants a room and nothing else, I thought the value for the money was excellent; I stayed last month at Hyatt Herald Square for about the same price and the room was far inferior to Kimpton.  However if people expect top service from Kimpton then forget about it.  In the end what matters most is whether they deliver in line with price and they do, even if they might fall short relative to what the brand is supposed to be.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Our tablet didn't work which is how you use the TV, contact the desk etc. The bed, THE BED is horrible. Nothing more than what you would get at a Motel 6. We were not allowed access to the outdoor veranda where supposedly there is a large screen area. Only place to go outside was in the street or the front of the building. For $365 you would expect at least a bottle of water available to you in the room. Plan to go to the desk and request this where they will give you a tiny bottle of warm water. They do give you coffee in the morning, but absolutely nothing else without paying for it. Not a muffin, not a banana, not a yogurt. And to think we are charged a $20 resort fee (amenity fee for local and long distance calling as well as the gym use).

It's worth noting the pet policy because when you bring dogs, this is literally something you talk with other people about in the elevator!  Everyone staying here with their dogs knows its the best place to stay.\n\nAside from the pets, this would still be a great place to stay in New York.  I don't think we quite saw all the hotel typically has to offer, as there were some restrictions\/changes still in place at the tail end of the pandemic, but they were doing a great job under challenging circumstances.  The food options in the hotel are a bit more limited than they otherwise would be, but you've got a million options within walking distance, so you'll be fine.  The room was spacious and comfortable, more so than many other New York hotels we've stayed in previously.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1456560,"title":"A Nice Stay and a Good Value","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-02-20","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"From some of the mixed reviews here I was bracing myself for disappointment, but I was pleasantly surprised during our recent stay at the Hotel Eventi.  \n\nFirst, I paid about $330 a night for three nights in an executive one bedroom.  This room has a small, separate living room with a sofa bed perfect for sleeping two kids, but not big enough for an adult couple.  I thought this was a good deal, for a well-located hotel in midtown Manhattan.  There were some similar deals at other hotels available, but I think this one offered the most convenient location for bopping around manhattan.  \n\nThe room is not big, but it was comfortable.  This hotel is the tallest building within a couple of blocks, so I think a majority of the rooms would enjoy good views as we did.  While not big, the room functioned very well.  There is a long hallway from the front entrance into the living room.  This was a good place to put the kids luggage on a luggage rack.  It would be more helpful if this hallway had some hanging hooks installed where you could hang coats, bathrobes, etc.  There was a sofa bed, chair, desk, desk chair, mini-fridge, large tv and floor lamp in the living room.  There was also a large window framing rooftop views of Manhattan.  We were on the 19th floor.  \n\nThe bedroom featured a queen-sized bed, two night stands each with one drawer, a small closet with a safe and iron\/ironing board, and another large tv.   The bathroom was large with a big shower area, large sink vanity and separate toilet area.  There was also a Japanese-style bench in the shower.  \n\nThe room could probably use a refurbishing as things were pretty nicked-up and getting rundown.  The closet was also way too small and there were not enough drawers to be able to put your clothes away if you don\u2019t want to live out of a suitcase.  Also, because the closet was so small, and the bed sat on a platform, there was nowhere to store empty luggage.  There was also no way to make coffee or tea in the room.  Really ubiquitous oversights that many hipster hotels unfortunately suffer from.  \n\nI was also not impressed with the check-in experience.  First, there\u2019s no signage outside the hotel regarding valet parking or where to pull up.  Your only option is to double-park and run into the lobby to let someone know you need a valet.  Also the gentleman who checked us in could not have been less friendly.  He never looked up from his screen or made any effort to be welcoming as he checked us in.  Not a great start.  \n\nAlso as soon as I got to the room, I got like 4 or 5 of the same text welcoming me to the hotel and asking if I needed anything.  Technology is great, but if you can\u2019t get it right it can simply become an another annoyance...\n\nAside from the fairly minor complaints above, I was actually pretty happy with our stay.  We never waited in a long line while there, which in NYC is rare.  The room overall functioned very well for the four of us, and best of all featured great views of the city.  The bed linens and towels were all of good quality and seemed clean and newish.  The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows.  The ac\/heat system did a good job of keeping the room comfortable and the industrial-strength, double-paned windows did a good job of insulating us from the city\u2019s soundtrack.  \n\nOur housekeeper - Li Li - was excellent and was very observant of and attentive to our needs.  \n\nWe enjoyed a very nice dinner at L\u2019Amica off the lobby, and got a quickly delivered and plentiful room-service breakfast one morning.  We used the in-room tablet to order the breakfast which seemed to work well.  \n\nI think valet parking at $50 a night is a good deal.  Most garages in the area wanted $70 a night for parking - so much easier to just let the hotel take care of it all...\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of hip hotels.  I tend to like the older, classic, larger hotels.  With that said, I was very happy at Hotel Eventi.  I think we got a nice room, in a convenient location, with great views, and a generally nice staff for a very reasonable price for NYC.   ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Being on then 16th floor this wasn't ideal for us although luckily we were able to walk down if needed.

And Mrs. Electric knew that I had a certain birthday coming up so she became very busy behind my back and booked some flights. And so ( to my intense surprise ! ) I found that we were going to spend my special birthday in New York for 8 nights. We flew out on 24th December and flew back to Blighty on the evening of 01\/01\/2020, arriving rather reluctantly at London Heathrow at around 07.25 a.m.\nWe both researched where to stay in New York very carefully. We have been in bed ( so to speak!) with the IHG brand since , I think, 1991 and I am currently a Spire Elite Ambassador, without the attitude that some seem to adopt when they get there. Indeed, I refer to myself as being a 'Spire Elite Ambassador Thingy Whatsit Whatever'. Because life is too short to take this sort of thing seriously!! And also it gives the management and staff a clue that they can joke with us. \nKimpton became part of IHG approximately 3 years ago. And of all the IHG properties in New York, our Intuition kept us returning to look at the Kimpton Eventi. And so we hit those buttons and booked 8 nights here. \n...and we absolutely 100% ADORED it!!! It was the darker colours of the lobby area that enticed us here initially. Neither of us are particularly formal. We love our music and arty things and casual is the way that we feel most comfortable. \nAnd this hotel can adapt to casual or formal at the drop of a hat. They do it all!\nWe were greeted on checking in by Malek who was informative, welcoming and immaculately presented. We looked around as he did his thing and it was like coming home.Everything was so...comfortable. We were escorted to our room by a great guy named Kirk , who also brought our suitcases to the room. We got along so well, it was like we had known him for ages.And we hope that the things we spoke of get sorted. This was, in actual fact, a preview of how great the rest of the staff were going to be. We had a corner room and we had a view of the Empire State Building out of the side window. Incredible! \nThe Room.... we loved our room too. If you want a gleaming neon lit vibrating bed in an over the top 21st century monstrosity of a room, then you will not find it here. What you WILL find is a good relaxing room in calm colours. There is also a tablet ( No, not medicinal ones, I have plenty of those, sadly!) next to your bed where you can order food etc. There ARE a few signs of wear and tear and so there should be. It IS a hotel room after all!! The shower was a big walk in job and even I managed to put away my heavy rock persona and showered every day. It was nice!!\nBreakfast is available at extra cost. We sampled it one morning and it was fine. It didn't wow us, to be honest, but the breakfast room was quite full each morning. We are not really breakfast people. So usually we opted for complimentary coffee in the lobby area every morning which is served with a variety of types of milk. There is also hot chocolate and squirty cream. My doctor would kill me if he saw what I did to my body each morning...lol. And that gorgeous half and half milk? To a guy who has to have skimmed milk here in the U.K., it tasted like Christmas, birthday, and New Year rolled into one. Oh, hang on...it was....haha.\nLocation of the Hotel is superb. It is also pet friendly so you get the chance to meet other animal lovers and their pets too. Excellent.The on site restaurants are The Vine, and L'Amico. L' Amico was our choice for New Years Eve and the food was superb.\nWine. You will have to suspend belief on this , but every day between 17.00 and 18.00 complimentary wine is served. Yup. You read that correctly!!! It isn't always served in the same location within the hotel and I note that other reviewers found this to be a problem. We thought that it was great fun!! It's nice quality too. If wine is not your thing, there is a lovely alternative which is a sort of warm cider with a shot of bourbon.Or water if you respect your livers more than we do...haha.( in actual fact i only drink on holiday or at concerts).\n\nThe manager and staff. Collectively and individually superb. These are the ones who looked after us so wonderfully.....Malek of course on reception. Kerry, our room attendant (lovely!) Tatiana, who although she didn't service our room personally, has to be one of THE funniest Russian ladies I have ever met, Amanda ( manager of rooms), Anastasia at breakfast ( more edible than even the food!), Ana ( general cleaning duties. A lovely lady),Jeannie( room servicer). On reception , and in no particular order...Diane, Jennifer, who became more and more funny as the stay progressed.( I still want her hair!!!), Paulina( those wonderful nails and rings...), Jennifer ( South Korea),, Celine and Mary Lyn, and the wonderful Dallin who served wine a couple of times. Rafaela, Stephenson, The two managers who hosted the wine session on New Years Eve were also fantastic.\nAnd finally...Kevin from concierge. What a remarkable man. Mrs.Electric and I shared so many conversations with this Gentleman. An incredible man. Talented too.\nWithout these wonderful people the Eventi would be just a building. Everyone who works here is instrumental in bringing the hotel to life every day. \nAnd New York? Adorable. It was only our second time here ( the first being in March 1993 when I was younger, healthier and slimmer, and the whole world was a different place....). People had told  me that New York isn't a friendly place. \n\nRUBBISH. We found everyone to be very warm and friendly and funny too. I think that you reap what you sow. If you walk around with a spindle in a personal place, then that is how you will be treated. We loved our time here and we loved the Eventi. Take a chance with people. Plant a little humour seed when you engage with them. And you will be astonished at the humour tree that will grow before your very eyes. Will we return to the Kimpton Eventi? YES. Of course we will. Because there are no bad apples here either. Be nice to the staff. Their job is brutally hard. And why not join the IHG rewards club while you are at it! Well done!!","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

This was my first stay at this property and brand.  I probably won\u2019t be back.  I choose to stay at the Kimpton Hotel Event based on reviews and its 5 star rating.  This hotel is very average 4 star hotel at best.  There are better 4 stars hotels in NYC\n\nOverall:  Average quality hotel and rooms with inattentive staff\n\nThe good:  \n- Room was clean.  \n- Hotel is conveniently located for midtown.\n\nThe bad: \n\n- Plumbing is an issue.  The pipes bang when hot water is requested for a shower.  The banging or knocking is loud enough that you can hear it happening in other bathrooms besides your own.  Bathroom sinks drain slowly, so you have to turn off water and wait for the accumulated water to drain. \n\n- Basic amenities missing such as a coffee maker or shower cap.  You can request a coffee maker and will get one if you are lucky.  I think there is 1 coffee maker for every 4-5 rooms or fewer.\n\n- Poor communication and service considerations.  I requested a coffee maker and was told that one would be brought right up.  It never arrived, so I went to the nearby Starbucks.  When I returned, I addressed it with the front desk and was again told that they would bring it right up\u2026. they never brought a coffee maker nor did they ever follow up to let me know that they didn\u2019t have any coffee makers.  I eventually went the the director of housekeeping, who is curt, rude, and clearly inexperienced with customer service.  She told me that they were out of coffee machines.  Also, they don\u2019t carry shower caps\u2026 so plan ahead if you or your significant other needs one for any reason.\n\n-  Door men are missing\u2026. the bell hops stand around and do not open doors for arriving\/departing guests with bags.\n\nTHE UGLY:  \n- The elevators were out of order.  The hotel has 3 small\/medium sized elevators in the lobby, which every guest must use to get to their room.  Almost every day of our stay there was a problem with the elevators.  The wait for an elevator was particularly painful when large groups of people were checking in or checking out of the hotel.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Well, turns out I made the right choice because my husband loved the hotel from the minute we arrived and he's not easy to please as we are used to staying in 5 Star resorts whenever we travel, so his expectations are hard to meet, to put it mildly.  \n\nTo add to this, my mother also booked the hotel and had arrived before us. She is elderly and the staff at the hotel restaurant doted on her like she was the only guest in the building.  She was waited on hand and foot and brought 3 different kinds of gelato after lunch which she adored. During her entire stay, the hotel staff went above and beyond to make her feel welcome, comfortable and cared for. \n\nAs for myself and my husband, we were put on a high floor in a suite and a bottle of champagne arrived from management because they discovered that we were there on business and to celebrate our 25th Anniversary. But even without the thoughtfulness of sending up champagne, the staff at this hotel are genuine and friendly and seem happy to be there.  The doorman is genuinely kind and helpful, the front desk staff is upbeat and friendly, the my mother said room service was flawless. And we loved the location - right in the middle of everything!\n\nAs for the rooms, the white marble bathrooms are huge which is very rare in NYC - plenty of space to place cosmetics, hairspray etc. and having the toilet in a separate closet is appreciated. The floor to ceiling windows throughout are a great feature and one of the main reasons I chose to book this hotel along with the location which is within walking distance to just about everything. Some have criticized the scraped up wood flooring in the rooms, however, I believe this was an error made when the interior designer suggested bamboo flooring which is upscale and expensive but sadly does not hold up well with wear and tear.  I would suggest that when the hotel decides to replace the flooring, they use a sturdy synthetic wood that can withstand dings from suitcases and heavy traffic. Anyway, the scratches on the wood flooring really didn't pain us and if we were going to nit pick I'd say a coffee maker in the room would be welcome but really, we absolutely loved our suite. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet at night, so we got a good nights sleep each night. \n\nIn closing, I cannot say enough about the hotel. We loved out stay.

This \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 is not for you.\n\nIt is said that good hotels and good restaurants prefer that any complaints be aired in real time on the spot rather than allowing them to fester into scathing critiques on Yelp or Trip Advisor. And it it precisely because my respect for this consideration that I share the following.\n\nFor several years now, my wife and I have stayed at the Eventi every time we we have come to New York. It\u2019s a pretty good hotel within easy walking distance of Penn Station. I\u2019ve given them favorable reviews in the past. Let this one serve as a codicil. Overall, though none of our stays has been perfect, we\u2019ve always been pleased enough to return and probably will again.\n\nOn this particular occasion, a three night stay in December of 2019, we arrived just before 4:00 PM on a Friday only to be told that, in spite of a posted check-in time of 3:00, our room was not ready. This had occurred on our previous stay at the Eventi, at which time we were offered drink vouchers to soothe any potential friction. We accepted and minutes later our room was ready. This time, we were not going to be bought off so easily. Remembering the unreadiness of the room of the previous visit, we had taken a later train secure in the belief that, of course, our room would be ready by 4:00. As we had uptown commitments at 4:30 we had to postpone, we were not happy campers. The room took a seemingly interminable 15-20 minutes to ready. The clerk handed over the keys with apologies and the happy news that for our troubles, we had been upgraded! Upon arrival, the room appeared to be exactly the one bedroom executive suite we had booked and paid for. Any upgrade was not in evidence. I called down to the desk clerk, who by now had clearly branded me as trouble, and passed the call on to Jennifer, the on-duty manager, who assured me that, yes, the room WAS an upgrade as it had a view of the Empire State Building and a Jacuzzi. Well, even though neither is a perk I would have willingly paid extra for, if that is the Eventi\u2019s idea of a PREMIUM one bedroom executive suite, so be it. Except for one \u2014 no two, things. The room \u2014604, for the record \u2014 had neither a view of the Empire State Building nor a Jacuzzi. \n\nIt was time to talk to a manager face to face. To minimize any potential disruption, I went down to the lobby the next morning at 6:00 where I voiced my concern to Fran\u00e7ois, the manager on duty. I made it clear that my concern was that I had been told I had been given an upgrade when I clearly had not. In fact, I had been brushed off with a clear untruth. Fran\u00e7ois suggested that he would talk to his colleagues to see what they could do. I returned to my room after suggesting that ANY gesture would be appreciated as acknowledgement of the late check-in compounded by a blatant, if perhaps unintended, falsehood. \n\nFast forward to 9:00 AM Monday. We checked out, awaiting any sign that even the slightest note of our unresolved concerns had been taken. \n\nCrickets. \n\nWe once spent an awful weekend at a resort on the  eastern shore of Maryland. I wasn\u2019t going to say a thing until the checkout clerk asked me about my stay. I answered her honestly, paid the bill and left. Two days later I got an email from the manager who was upset that the clerk had not brought me directly to him so he could address my complaints. At the end of the month, there appeared on my credit card statement an entirely unsolicited refund of every penny we had spent on our stay. Now that\u2019s extreme and WAY beyond any expectation. We\u2019re home now after a nice weekend in NYC. We managed to adjust our schedule to accommodate the very late check-in, but I\u2019ve gotta tell ya, being told we had been upgraded when I hadn\u2019t still sticks in my craw. But not as much as the utter failure to make up for it.\n\nAs I said at the outset, the Eventi is a pretty good hotel, one that\u2019s very convenient for us. I\u2019ll probably simmer down and on the occasion of our next visit to NYC book a room at the Eventi. But I\u2019ll call from the train to make sure the room is ready. This stay has shattered any misguided sense of loyalty I had to this hotel, but in spite of this, I\u2019m more than likely to give in grudgingly to the convenience of an Eventi stay, if with lowered expectations.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

They have a free evening wine hour ,although it\u2019s on the third floor,in a weird area.It was not a comfy warm space . We got a glass and took it to our room as there was really no sitting area.\n  Cons- check in was a nightmare. We arrived at 11am, dropped off our luggage and went on our merry way. We arrived back at 4:45 and were greeted by a 30 minute wait to see if our room was ready. No excuse for this kind of line. The couple in front of us were very upset as their room was still not ready at 4:45. Our room was a suite- room 804. The furniture was very nicked up, and the suite could use a good cleaning. It\u2019s time for a room renovation!! The couch was very worn and the pull out mattress was horribly uncomfortable!\n   The bathroom was nice, but had wrapped plastic cups!! Seriously this is not a motel 6!! Toiletries in tiny plastic bottles. Large dispensers of high end toiletries and real glasses in the bathroom would provide a better experience and would be better for the environment.\n   The restaurant has a 28 dollar breakfast buffet, which did not look very appealing, so went around the corner to Brown Bagels( great)!! The hotel does offer free coffee and hot chocolate in the lobby every morning which was a nice touch.\n  After you check in you will get a text checking to see if everything is ok. I did not respond.

A couple of times after failing to get a phone call through to housekeeping right after checking in, I texted back and the minor issues (request for robe, chair removed, and extra towels) were handled. \nAfter check out I sent the following text and to this day, no response. So I am posting it here:\n1). Notification of a failed NY City legionnaires inspection was given only a few days prior to my visit (too late to switch accommodations to a different hotel or Airbnb). I grew up with \u201cwater insecurity\u201d so any potential water issues screw with my head (I get a little PTSD). I called ahead of time with many questions and was reassured. I asked if bottled water was being provided to all guests and was told no, which is odd since other hotels (in New York, Vegas, Dubai, Bahamas, Austin, etc) will supply guests with free bottled water in fitness rooms, at hotel front counters, at pools, etc.\n2). First room I was given had multiple carpet tripping hazard issues (needed stretching), and an extremely strong air freshener smell (couldn\u2019t even breathe). I asked to switch & also requested higher room- agreed to pay $50 more per night for view but when I got to the second room, the only difference was no gagging smell. Carpets still had multiple tripping hazards and desperately in need of stretching, unsightly leather chair had areas of the polyurethane finish worn off, wooden shower chair was a biohazard, and there was hair on bathroom floor. \nRolls in the carpet are a serious tripping hazard for guests and I\u2019m shocked this is being ignored. It\u2019s also unsightly. But after seeing the same problems in both rooms, I could only surmise all rooms are like this and I didn\u2019t ask again to switch. \n3). I did immediately ask for the heavy large white leather chair (with scratched up wood finishing and peeling off polyurethane) to be removed since it was unsightly, blocked my view, and took up too much space. It looked like something your found by the curb that someone else was trying to throw away and I am surprised no one is noticing how distressed & unsightly the chair is.\n4). Having a wood stool in the bathroom is extremely unsanitary. I had to hide it behind the curtains so I didn\u2019t have to look at for 4 days. The wood shower stool had polyurethane peeling off, wood rot on the legs, and was discolored from water staining. There\u2019s no way to sanitize something like this between guests. And, just like the other chair, it looked like something picked up from a discarded furniture pile on the street.\n4). The flooring in your fitness center is also a major tripping hazard. It needs to be corrected immediately. You also need to replace the dirty yoga mats, provide free bottled water, and have an attendant full time wiping down equipment after each use OR provide wipes and a sign to remind guests to wipe off. Staph happens all the time in fitness rooms and it\u2019s usually a requirement to wipe off after each guest\u2019s use. The fitness room is a serious biohazard and tripping hazard.\n5). This was the final straw: the water completely shut off while I was in the shower covered in soap. I was likely the first person to notify staff, but the first person I spoke with was rude (wanted to send someone to my room, she didn\u2019t like that I said it was inconvenient since I was naked, wet, covered in soap- she snarkily replied to me \u2018can\u2019t you put on a robe?, I replied, \u2018how about I wait until you get more complaints since in my opinion this appears to be a system wide problem\u2019). The manager follow up was better: Francois called back shortly to tell me technicians were allowed in another guests room to check and they subsequently discovered it was system wide: a water pump. I was offered $50 deduction on bill which I accepted. \nConsidering my inconvenience when the water shut off on me (wet w soap, made me late for a 4:00, had to dry off getting ready w\/ soap on me, have a rash now from where the soap was still on my skin), the late notification of legionnaires, the failure to provide free bottled water during this time, the tripping hazard carpets, distressed chairs, the fitness room problems, the snarky comment and rude demeanor when I initially notified someone, (especially since my room didn\u2019t come with a robe, AND the robe I had requested the first day was in my dirty laundry pile), are all issues that make me feel like I did not get the value I normally get at other hotels. \nThese problems lead me to believe not only is there a systemic problem with maintenance and training, but since the hotel is not investing in upkeep or staff training, that the hotel cares more profits than anything else. Otherwise they would be spending the money required to maintain basic standards and be more willing to comp guests things like free nights or free bottled water. \nThere\u2019s a lot of hotels in NY to choose from. For the price I paid, I absolutely did not get the value I deserved. \nThis Kimpton hotel needs to pay the money to supply free bottled water during this legionnaires water problem, free water to people who LOST water (even after the legionnaires thing gets resolved), get rid of the disgusting furniture and biohazard shower chairs, pay for carpet stretching, pay to get the fitness room flooring properly secured, provide free bottled water in fitness room, install sanitary equipment wipes in fitness room with a sign (maybe it\u2019s there and I didn\u2019t see it- in which case they need to install more), and instruct staff to be more sensitive when guests are in peril. \nManagement needs to offer more than $50 credit when a guest gets as inconvenienced as I was- I spent the remainder of my stay afraid to use any water for brushing teeth or drinking. \nThe follow up inconvenience subsequent to my water shutting off are as follows: \n1). I didn\u2019t want to pay the $10 for each minibar water bottle so hauled myself across the street to get water at the minimart to cover the remainder of my stay, \n2). A painful rash,\n3). I looked like crap for my 4:00 date, \n4). The time I spent standing around, on the phone talking, hauling water, (my time is valuable) and the money it cost for me to buy & haul bottled water, the inconveniences, easily negated the $50 credit. \n5). The childhood water insecurity PTSD mentioned above was super triggered when the water shut off, when the fitness room had no water, and when free bottled water was not provided.\n6). For something like water shutting off while covered in soap, I should have been comped the last night.\nThe fact that easy and simple solutions (offer free bottled water, stretch carpets, repair fitness floors, install wipes, discard old furniture, train staff, offer better comps to distressed guests) have not been implemented, makes me wonder about all Kimpton hotels being in distress and unwilling to spend $ on basic upkeep. \nAfter this, I don\u2019t don\u2019t think I will ever be staying at a Kimpton property ever again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Starting with the down side:  \n\nWe only ate here twice, as we were put of by the additional costs, of 18% gratuity and tax oF 8.5%. I fail to understand why I should expect to pay $18 gratuity on a $100 bottle of wine? Does the sever do something diferent to buying a $30 bottle? We had the buffet breakfast, which was $28. Unfortunately, we aked if it was possible to have eggs, sunnyside up, instead of scrambled. The answer was yes, but then we were charged $22, obviously a \"golden chicken\" laid these eggs. So having been, I think, overcharged for four eggs, at $5.5 each, so in proper money \u00a34.40 per egg. Average free range egg, 28p, so a mark up of 1500%. I was asked if I wanted to include a tip, but declined as I didn't feel that \u00a382 for breakfast was good value or money. The rest of the breakfast was top draw though and I would have been happy to tip the sever the $10 or 18%. So I hope the sever got his $10 rom the hotel??\n\nIn the evening I had Calamari for two, which was \"massive\" and I couldn't finish it all. The bar staff were very attentive and the service was very good. The reception staff were fabulous and certainly made you feel most welcome and appreciated. \n\nIt was my wife's birthday while we were there and they surpriced us with cake and fizz. The room we had was comortable, clean and well appointed,\nThe other little touches included a glass or two of wine between 5 and 6pm in a quiet annex on the 5th floor and coffee to take out in the mornings. \n\nOverall we enjoyed our stay and would seriously consider staying again. I appreciate that in the US tips are expected. However, my view is that expensive food and wine, should be served with high levels of service from staff, and tips on top must be earned through exceptional service, not just standard service.

When I opened the bottle for first time, it was obvious that the lotion was used before. I requested new and they brought up quickly. \nI stayed in room 2103. The view was great. But I still heard traffic noise from the street down (6th ave). I think this is the same wherever you stay in Manhattan. There was strange noise coming from ceiling at night for both days I stayed there. It started around midnight and continued throughout the night. It repeats every 10-15 min. That kept me up. It sounds like someone was using a plunger in the toilet. But I didn\u2019t hear the noise during daytime. \nThey don\u2019t have a coffee maker but you can request and they deliver pretty quickly.

On one of the days (day 6) I was feeling very tired and unwell and utilise the room service for breakfast as well as dinner on the same night. I was disappointed that initially when I ordered room service for dinner at 9:30pm, the wait time was scheduled for half an hour (this would be 10pm) however after calling the front desk at 10:22pm realised my order did not come through at all.. The lady at the front desk went to find out what happened and apologise many times about the order. She asked if I still require dinner, a rush order would be put through. At this point I was quite distressed I was on my own, didn\u2019t feel I could go out, I was feeling unwell all day (which is why room service was called for breakfast the same morning), I went to sleep whilst my husband went to meet his friend in the city - all I wanted was food and as I was pregnant And needed to eat immediately.

I was in a city 1000 miles from home, couldn\u2019t explore it as my body was exhausted, my husband wasn\u2019t here and I was hungry). Did I have hormones running through my body perhaps but I just wanted food and I requested it through the iPad which I think is a brilliant idea and it didn\u2019t work and so instead of waiting half an hour for food the food actually came out at about 1040 which was an hour and 10 minutes after I ordered. Jeff the food and beverage manager at the Eventi called right after the front desk lady calls again and apologise. He also asked if there was something he could do to make my night better.He also wanted to call back in half an hour to see if I was Ok. As I just wanted to be left alone I said thanks but no thanks and all I wanted was water. \n\nWhen the food arrived it was two people at the door- one who dropped the food tray and Jeff with a large jug of water and two glasses. Jeff also explained that perhaps there was a glitch in the system when guests ordered the steak. I am ok with mistakes but only if it is followed up with a genuine apology, reason and a fix that satisfies my concern. Both genuinely apologies in person and said the meal was complimentary.\n\nI work in HR back home in Australia that is my profession. I am also a former travel agent. The level of service that I received after something didn\u2019t work out, was what I expected. Without the modcons of having a kettle in the room, I would expect to fully utilise the food in the kitchen and mini bars. I have been privy to eat and stay in very fine hotels and Kimptom hotels is definitely up there. The food in Eventi far exceeds the taste and selection at the Everly. However the Everly surprised us with A bottle of sparkling, chocolate\u2019s, a cookie and note of well wishes to celebrate our honeymoon. Both are different and trendy in their own ways. The front desk people at both hotels were also very friendly so positive feedback must also be given to them. Please upgrade your telephone service so that all Kimpton hotels can dial international numbers or at least text them so if a guests can check in earlier a text would be sent to their international mobile and that would be an advantage. \n\nWould I stay at Kimptom Hotels again?  absolutely and would spread my feedback where I can. What came out of an order not being placed came a story that I have recounted to you, service that was rectified and recommendations to our family, friends and other future travellers.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is a beautiful hotel with good restaurants and comfortable, contemporary rooms.

The views, depending on the location of the rooms, are pretty good from the 23rd floor.\n     Other posters rant about getting rides to the airport via shuttles or Uber.   Unless one has a huge amount of luggage, I don't see why people bother.   It is less than a ten minute walk to Penn Station for the train to Newark Airport.   Penn Station itself wins no prizes, but the train is frequent and fast, connecting to the monorail to the airport terminals for a fraction of the cost a ride in a taxi would be.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

This was probably the nicest hotel in NYC I\u2019ve stayed in and can\u2019t recommend it enough, especially for couples. \n\nThe room was very large for New York standards, the bathroom was massive with an oversized walk in shower. Upon arrival, valet was quick to take our car and help with our bags. Valet costs $65\/night for an SUV, which is actually cheaper than any neighbouring parking spots.\n\nThe front desk was very helpful as well as the gentlemen who helped carried our bags to our room. I wish I remembered their names to thank them. The hospitality was just amazing.\n\nSome interesting noteworthy items as well, although the room doesn\u2019t have an in room coffee they offer coffee down in the lobby from 6-9am everyday, as an added bonus they have wine hour from 5-6pm. The room also comes equipped with a tablet which shows hotel information as well as dining and in room options. The TV connects to the wifi and you can stream videos from your phone to the TV as well.\n\nThe bar downstairs had a pretty good cocktail and local beer list, although it\u2019s a bit more on the expensive side.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about my stay is I wish the rooftop balcony\/ patio was opened. From the pictures I saw it looked like a great space and I wish there was a bar up there to take advantage of that great space. Either way, there are a lot of options within walking distance of the hotel, because it\u2019s located in such a great spot. \n\nAssuming the price point remains the same, I will definitely be staying here again and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. \n\nThanks again to the awesome staff at the Kimpton and keep up the great work!\n\n","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Walking distance from Penn station (less than 10 min walk), and in the middle of Manhattan. Easy to get on subway to go virtually anywhere.\n(2) As usual for Kimption, cool interior. Both the room, and the hotel common area.\n(3) Maybe this is not the most expensive area, but the price is reasonable for a good hotel in the middle of NYC.\n(4) Bar \/ Cafe (they serve La Colombe coffee) seem pretty good.\n(5) Free wifi (maybe you need to have a membership of Kimption (free))\n\nCons:\n(1) I paid extra for a higher floor (and hopefully better view), but the room I was assigned did not have a great view. Yes, it was on a high floor, but compared with other hotels in NYC which offers nice view on an upper floor, it was disappointing. I think the (extra) money was totally not worth it.\n(2) Attitude of the people at the hotel.\n(3) What is the $19.06 that they charged me?\n\nOverall, this is the first time I decided I never stay in a Kimption again.Too bad it is at a convenient location for me, who often comes to NYC with a train.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We enjoyed our stay from beginning to end.  The staff was wonderful and attentive even when we requested additional pillows at 11:00 PM. The pillows were brought to us within 10 minutes even at that late hour.  The room was modern and clean.  I had two complaints with the room; first, the leather chair in the room was worn and dirty.  Before I sat down, I wiped it down.  Second, not really a problem but the bathroom door was a wooden door that slides closed. It was very heavy and was difficult to pull closed.  Other than that - the room was very comfortable and very quiet.  We slept soundly and heard no noise in the hotel.  We were on the 16th floor and we heard no traffic noise either. We had a room with two queen beds as there were three of us. The bathroom was a very good size with a very large shower.  Many reviews mentioned that there were no USB plugs in the room; however, there were two attached to the IPAD station so we were able to use the USB ports as well as plugs at the same time. While there was a minibar and water bottles in the room, the prices were excessive.\nUpon check in, we were greeted by Johnny at the front desk,We saw him numerous times during our stay and he was very helpful.  He gave us information about the amenities in the hotel and made our stay enjoyable and made an effort to get to know us. We valet parked our car.

But the management is just atrociously bad. \n\nThe room had a sink that did not drain (see attached picture).  We notified the front-desk and they told us someone would come fix it. Hotel claims that someone came to look at it while we were out but could not fix it. They will have to wait until the next day. While I do not understand why, but did not have much of a choice. We were not offered a chance to move to a different room.  The sink blockage is so obvious, the hotel should not have given the room to anyone.  \n\nNo one shows up the next day. When I called the front-desk, they just said sorry we do not know what happened and will have a manager reach out to me. \n\nThe manager emails--not call--email me. He said sorry we dropped the ball on this one. We will give you better service next time you stay with us. When i told him that I was still at the hotel, I wanted him to walk up to my room and apologize face-to-face and offer how can we make this right.  Other top hotels i have visited have done this. Instead, he emails me back saying---oh great, come see me when you have time. Of course I did not waste my time finding him.  So he said I am adding 10,000 points for the inconvenience. Only one sink in the room that does not drain is not a just an inconvenience. And by the way, no points were ever added to my account. \n\nWhile check-in was a breeze, I had booked a two bed room because I was travelling with a baby. We were offered a king bed instead because two bed rooms were unavailable. I understand and was okay with it. The manager claims that I should be happy I was given an upgrade. When you have to accommodate a baby in your bed--a safety concern--having a couch in your room is not an upgrade. \n\nI am platinum IHG member. IHG gives a preferential treatment to me whenever i stay at one of their properties. I usually like Kimpton hotels and get a decent treatment. .  This was just such a bad experience that made me rethink about staying at any Kimpton property ever again.  Hotel industry provides us with a lot of choices. Consider another property.  They all charge about the same for the same level of hotel. Why risk ruining your vacation.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I guess the winning streak was not to continue. Our stay at this NYC Kimpton was disappointing to say the least.\n\n1) My partner encountered an extremely rude, outright hostile server at the bar in the Vine restaurant inside the hotel. The hotel manager basically said there was little to be done as the restaurant is managed by an outside party. \n\n2) We were offered turndown service at checkin. It never happened. Again, the manager replied that our IHG status was not high enough for turndown and we shouldn't have been offered it.\n\n3) Housekeeping came to clean the suite very early, often before 9, even on the weekend. They left a note asking us to call when we were ready for the room to be cleaned. When we called and said we were ready, they replied the staff 'has a routine' and would 'get to it later'.\n\n4) Rooms are noisy, especially due to what I suspect are groaning hot water pipes and which would would randomly become noisy at strange hours.\n\n5) We stored our luggage at check-in as we arrived on a red-eye. When I called to have our bags sent up later, I was told to come down with the ticket and then they could be sent up. I gave the ticket to the bellhop and asked to have them brought up. He replied he was 'busy watching the door' and couldn't do it. I brought them myself.\n\nWe were staying in a premier suite and spent nearly $3K for four nights, as we usually do at Kimptons we stay at. We expected better service than we got for this expense. Our normal experience at Kimpton is a laid back, helpful vibe. This experience was anything but. It's almost as if this location is striving for that aloof, \"too hip to care\" vibe common in many NYC hotels of a certain class. It fails miserably. For what we spent, we expected better. Unfortunately, this will give us pause before staying with any Kimpton again. \n\nFinally, one bright spot. \"Jillian\" who always answered the Guest Services line, was cheerful and helpful consistently every time. The rest of the place could take a lesson from her.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have stayed at the Kimpton Muse a couple of times, so I assumed the stay would be a pleasant one. I was correct. The service was excellent. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and the hotel sent up Champagne and cupcakes, which was very thoughtful. The staff in the lobby were very nice. The room was very clean and always made up by the time we returned. We had a double queen because we traveled with our teenage children. The room was not enormous but we managed without any issues. There was some space in front of one of the beds and the window was floor to ceiling so that helps make the room seem larger. The space between the closet and bed is tight. The bathroom was large and spacious. The entrance of the room is a long aisle the length of the bathroom so you do not walk right into the beds. My biggest complaint is the amount of storage space. My husband was the only one that unpacked. The rest of us lived out of our luggage because there are only a few shelves in the closet and two drawers. The closet was an ok size but since the space between the closet and the bed is tight, it wasn't worth unpacking completely. The hotel is a short walk away from Herald Square and all the subways that service that area, so that was very convenient. The neighborhood is not very touristy, it's in Chelsea. I liked that it was away from large groups of tourists. I will probably stay here again, and I recommend it.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I did look at upgrading from the basic room but a few more sq ft of room was a lot of dollars which I felt could be spent elsewhere.  \n\nThe room, though small, was very well appointed and clean, as was the bathroom.  There was a card listing extras one could request and we asked for, and received, a coffee maker with coffee.  The hotel breakfast (not included in price) was expensive but very nice.  Due to ongoing health problems I wasn't well enough to do a lot so we ate in the hotel restaurants several times, can highly recommend The Vine (super Manager) but found L'Amico pretentious without any reason to be. There was a lot of noise from passing traffic and we were a fairway up not near ground level, but this is part of the fun of New York.  \n\nTwo criticisms. Firstly they allow pets in rooms.  The occupants of the room opposite us had a dog, but they rarely seemed to be in their room.  The room was close to the elevator and each time the dog heard even the tiniest noise it went mental.  The barking went on forever and we did speak to the front desk about this.  Perhaps if dogs are allowed in rooms they should be at the end of corridors where there will be  less footfall going past, it's not the animal's fault, they're in a strange room and hearing noises and doing what dogs do.  I do wonder what goes through the owners' minds \"let's go to a strange hotel and leave the dog in the room all day and just hope for the best\".  \n\nSecondly, and this was our fault, we were persuaded on check out by the doorman to let him book a town car rather than a yellow cab to take us to the airport.  We were quoted a price + tolls.  When we arrived at JFK after a hugely circuitous route (there were delays on the freeway allegedly), the price was much more than we had been quoted and the tolls were double what we had been told, on top of the taxi fare. The total fare was almost double the quote.  Our fault, you live and learn.\n\nA very nice hotel, helpful and polite staff in general, a buzzy, trendy hotel which we liked.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They have always proved to be trendy boutique hotels with devoted staff.  I was excited when IHG purchased the brand for the opportunity of a vehicle to collect points and earn free nights and upgrades.  \n\nFirst off, the Kimpton Eventi is not in Chelsea, it is in Korea Town.  This is a common marketing ploy to make a location seem more desirable -- but this is not Chelsea.\n\nThe hotel has a trendy lobby with hip type restaurants and bars, but the room was somewhat tired.  The carpet in the room was stretched and buckling.  \n\nWe stayed in room 1702 on a chilly January night for my wife's birthday.  The room was cold when we left for dinner so we raised the thermostat.  When we returned later that night it was even colder.  By morning we were freezing -- no heat!  I told the woman at the front desk, she apologized and said she'd \" take care of us\" at checkout.  I assumed this was a one-off and had faith in Kimpton to make things right. \n\nA maintenance man came up shortly and proceeded to stand on the bathroom counter with his dirty boots and worked for about 20 minutes.  He finally informed us that the compressor was broken.  Upon check-out, nothing was offered to us.\n\nI wrote numerous emails to IHG which were answered promising at least a call back from the Kimpton Eventi, but the hotel never felt it important enough to contact us.  Unfortunately, it appears as though the brand has regressed towards the mean and is now simply another Holiday Inn...typical mediocrity.

This particular property isn't my favorite in terms of the adjoining restaurant and bar but as always, I appreciated the wine happy hour and other small touches.

I actually had to move twice because it was an extended stay and I didn't want to be cold during the entire time I was in my room. The second time it occurred I was very upset. At this point I had been traveling for over a week, was exhausted, and just wanted to relax. I explained this to them and noted I had never had this many problems at any other Kimpton properties. Johnny, the front office manager, promised to make it right to ensure I would visit again. He went above and beyond what I imagined, putting me in a huge suite with an amazing view. At this point I only had two more days in the hotel, but they were definitely relaxing and I actually looked forward to coming back.

My spouse and I decided to stay at the property for New Years Eve, and we had a great experience.  \n\nAccommodations- Excellent.  We were assigned a One Bedroom Suite at check-in, and the room was spacious and thoughtfully designed. The bed was comfortable; the bathroom had a shower (no tub).  The bedroom closet was small but met our needs. Wine hour was paired with NYE hats and noise makers, and the guests were very happy.\nIHG Rewards Club Recognition- Excellent. We were acknowledged for our loyalty, and our Reward Night room was upgraded. At around 7p, an Inner Circle amenity containing 3 small cupcakes, a box of chocolates, and both a still and a sparkling water arrived at our room. We were disappointed to learn that no Complementary Chef\u2019s Taste was offered for IC members, as the Kimpton website states, but the restaurant food was very good. The Newspaper was not delivered but was instead available in the lobby.\nStaff- Very good.  The hotel and staff were very busy, as was the lobby with many guests, but the staff handled the volume effectively.\nHousekeeping- Excellent.  The room and bathroom were very clean in appearance.  Adequate toiletry quantities were provided (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, tissues, & toilet paper), and the floor and baseboards were clean. \nPool\/Gym- not evaluated\nBreakfast\/Meal Options- Very good.  At The Vine restaurant, we ordered the cod and the hangar steak meals, along with some appetizer cocktail shrimps & fried octopus; it was very tasty.  My one complaint for the hotel staff is that the complementary morning coffee and tea in the lobby was promptly taken away at 9a.  While this may be appropriate for most other weekdays, as I sipped mine, I watched from the lobby as many guests were rendered displeased. Some resorted to the hotel \u201cCoffee bar;\u201d many chose nearby coffee shops instead.\nLaundry- not evaluated\nComputer\/Printer\/WiFi- WiFi was strong throughout the hotel.\nProperty Appearance- Excellent.\n\tExterior- From the outside looking inward, this hotel is a bustling, yet inviting, mecca of activity.  The entrance was clean, and the property was appropriately branded.\n\tInterior- The lobby was very pleasant, but frequently busy enough for guests to be struggling as they attempted to bring luggage through the crowd, especially for those arriving in the evening.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

At time of booking I advised I needed a twin room however when we got there it was a double room and it was going to be 2 days before they could do anything about it so we decided that we didn\u2019t want to be bothered moving rooms in 2 days, after all I was travelling with a best friend who I have known for 30 years and is more like a sister to me so for us, no major issue but this could have been an issue for someone else in different circumstances. The next day we returned to the hotel at 4pm having left at 9am to discover the room not made up etc - staff did not seem to see this as an issue so in effect my friend did the room and someone got round to bringing us towels. There was also an incident where my friend was called crazy (and not in a funny, oh how we laughed kind of way) when the trainee Barista made her coffee with cold water and she asked for it to be remade with hot water - imagine that.

The Manager said great no problem and I'll send up some cheese and fruit as well, tomorrow between 2-3pm when we usually send out amenities.  Great, my friends arrived, we waited in our hotel room, no delivery, we went out for lunch returned, no delivery.  We called, they had to check and get back to us, no delivery.

The parlor had a small sofa, one chair, a table and a wall mounted TV. The mini-bar was also located in the parlor. The bedroom sported a king sized bed, another wall mounted TV, two side tables and a small closet. The bath had a stand-alone shower (no tub), a single vanity and a semi-enclosed toilet.\n\nHard product wise (e.g. water pressure, towels, quality of the toiletries, etc.), except as noted below, the Eventi lived up to expectations. Overall, the hotel\/room was an agreeable place to start and end one's day in New York City.\n\nPluses\/ Over-delivery: \n\n1\/ The TVs had full (or almost full) cable. I had multiple flavors of HBO, for example. AMC and other staples were also on there. \n\n2\/ Unlike some other hotels in New York City, the Eventi doesn't charge a fee for receiving and safe keeping packages for guests. While I don't usually receive packages at hotels, I did this time and the absence of a fee is appreciated.\n\nNegatives:\n\n3\/ I found the in-room safe, which is located inside the closet, to be placed quite high-up. You'd have to be at least 5'10 or taller to be able to fully reach into the bowels of the safe to retrieve your stuff.\n\n4\/ Speaking of the closet, I found it a bit small. The closet's okay for hanging jackets and what not. But I had to use the built-in drawers in the \"working\" table to store clothes.  \n\n5\/ The cotton buds on offer as part of the toiletries are flimsy.\n\n6\/ The big negative was the visible wear and tear in the room. \n\nThe wooden floor had multiple visible scuff marks, the table also had scruff marks, a lower portion of the bathroom door frame had been sheared right off and had not been fully repaired (it had been repainted however), and a seam in one of the sofa cushions had burst. \n\nNotes:\n\n7\/ I wish breakfast packages were available. When I booked thru IHG, breakfast packages were not on offer.\n\n8\/ Newspapers are provided in the lobby.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

They seem to hire the very best people and just know how to take care of guests. That being said, the hotel Kimpton Eventi in Midtown is ths best of all of them. From the moment we checked in I was immediately impressed. We came in SO early just to drop our bags & were greeeted so warmly they offered to get our room ready early and asked what they could do in the meantime for us. Mind you, none of this was necessary...we were there hours before check in and had no expectation of early check in. We actually had lunch reservations and tickets to a matinee show. The Kimpton did not stop there. Later my husband and I were asking for a recommendation for an anniversary dinner, were given an amazing recommendation but Marilyn and Vanessa who work at the frint desk had wine and cupcakes sent to our room with the absolute sweetest note. I could literally list several other times the employees at the Eventi went above and beyond...during a 3 night stay bit would run out of spaces. Here is what you need to know. Rooms are immaculate, spacious by NYC standards, the perfect location for visiting the city especially for an event at MSG, or a home base for exploring all that NY has to offer.

Kevin; a Brooklyn local, is not only the concierge, he is also the amazing artist in resident. Check out Kevin's fabulous drawings in a diary in the lobby which posts the daily location for 'the hour of power' aka 'wine hour' 5-6pm. This complimentary wine hour can be on 3,4 or 5th floor. Allan often hosts 'the hour of power' he is also known to rock out the hula hoops and gives us quick demonstration. He's actually quite good. \n\nThe hotel is centrally located. We walked almost everywhere. The rooms were spotlessly clean. The Eventi hotel has exceptional maids, always thoroughly clean. The room service was swift and delicious. \n\nL'Amico restaurant turns out great Italian food.

Though I've loved it in the past, it seems the Eventi is not up to what it once was.\n\nThe location is outstanding, and the hotel itself is attractive and in solid shape. There are good restaurants in the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The service is a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nI reserved the executive suite, and though I arrived after 3pm my room was not ready. I was offered a temporary room with the promise that the next day I could swap out for an upgraded suite, even better than the one I reserved. I was promised many more treats to make up for the inconvenience.\n\nSounds like not a bad deal, right?\n\nBut the next day at 3pm my upgrade suite was still not ready. So that's the second day in a row of my room not being ready on time. Worse still, I'd checked out of the temp room that morning as asked to, so I've gone half a day without any room at all.\n\nWe had to remind staff more than once that we'd requested a coffee maker in room. We also needed sheets for the pullout for our daughter, and despite being told on 3 occasions that housecleaning would make the pullout bed, in the end someone unceremoniously dumped the linens off. (I was fine making the bed - it was only that the staff insisted repeatedly that housecleaning would.) \n\nThe reception staff was lovely. They said all the right things to make up for some reasonable errors. The execution is where things fell apart. How things repeatedly fell through the cracks between what was said and what happened, I don't know.\n\nThis is not my first stay at the Eventi, but I'll consider other options on my next trip.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

First, why this hotel was such a pleasant surprise!\nMy husband and I have been to Manhattan several times, but this was the first trip with our daughter (10). We had originally booked the Cambria around the corner in Chelsea (important that it be in this area to be close to Penn Station this trip), but the week before our trip, we decided to look for something more...interesting? Exciting? Granted, we wanted a door that closed off our room from our daughter - hard to find and more $ - and decided to book the executive junior suite at Kimpton.\nWe stayed 5 nights, and I liked the hotel more and more as the days went on. We had asked for an extra empty fridge so we could bring food to our room - free of charge. Never felt like we were being nickelled and dimed to death, as one does in so many places. Water and\/or coffee were on hand in the lobby - also nice.\nWe happened to mention we were going to Frozen on Broadway; waiting for us when we returned that night were celebratory cupcakes and a Frozen-themed Lego set! Wha? \nWine hour - 5 to 6pm nightly, we only took advantage of it twice, but the locations, wine, and chance to meet other guests were all excellent! \nThe one night we returned to the hotel before 10pm, we found the staff hula-hooping in the front hall. This sort of sums up the feel of this place: the staff, the other guests, the bustling atmosphere in the front area and the two restaurants (ate at L'Amico - this is one of those places people passing by want to stop at) - it all just felt GOOD. Positive. No one seemed stressed, unhappy, or negative. The good vibes were everywhere from the doorman to the fellow guests in the elevator.\nOK, so why 4.5? I admit, if it had been a one-night stay, my first impression of the room being a little tired, a little dark, may have been what I took away from the place. That, and the pullout bed we made our daughter sleep on every night - sorry, Kimpton, but it was the worst pullout I've ever seen. So thin that I felt guilt putting my child to bed in it every night, but we're not really the 'family bed' type, so it was what it was.\nSpeaking of family, there were few kids other than mine - I kind of liked that - but still felt that it was kid-friendly enough for families.\nThat said, I'd stay here again. Way too cool to be a chain hotel, yet it sort of is - there are a few of these around, although all distinct I believe, and they just joined up with Holiday Inn megagroup, IHG. A plus is that we were IHG members, and that meant free wifi - yay! And Kimpton staff - Shawn, Victoria, Leilani, and everyone we were in contact with - thanks.\n","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"NONE"}

As usual, a very comfortable Kimpton bed.  Shout out to the spacious shower with rain head and separate hand shower.  Always appreciate Kimpton providing bathrobes.   The only reason I didn't give the hotel a complete 5 star was that towels were starting to be a little threadbare and should be replaced and there was no bathmat when we first checked in.

Great balance with the sort of midtown-upscale\/chelsea-hip atmosphere that we love. \n\nOur stay was great. The room was huge with floor to ceiling windows as promised. When my parents came to sit with us in the hotel for a bit, it was very convenient to have that additional seating area away from the bedroom. We borrowed the bikes they offer on the property and spend a few hours biking through central park as well. (The bike to the park is a little daunting up 6th avenue, definitely not for the inexperienced, but we didn't have any issue on the road).\n\nThe staff was also great. Vanessa made me feel extremely welcomed on my birthday. We both checked-in and checked out with her and she remembered exactly who we were! It was such a simple but kind gesture and lovely experience with customer service. While we have stayed at many Kimptons and expect the service to be one of the best, Vanessa  went above and beyond and send up birthday treats to the room.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Well, fast forward to June 2018, I selected this hotel for a trip with my Mom, sister and niece for her 16th birthday. Kimpton did not disappoint! In fact, we happened to mention off-the-cuff to Hannah (the manager) when we checked in that we were in NYC to celebrate the Sweet 16. A few hours later, Hannah delivered a stylish, sparkling Steven Madden handbag filled with nail polish, lip gloss, perfume and candy for the birthday girl. Wow -- talk about a surprise and delight moment. They mastered it! Then, one day as we left for sightseeing, my Mom accidentally turned on the \"do not disturb\" sign so our room hadn't been cleaned when we got home. At 5:30, as we were going out to dinner, she mentioned it to the front desk. When we returned, we had beds made, fresh towels, etc. \nThe room had two queen beds and there was actually decent space for four women\/girls. The location is good...close to some sights, but also easy to take the subway or Lyft. Both restaurants downstairs were really good, especially the one in front with the sidewalk patio. \nI would definitely stay here again and would recommend it anyone traveling to NYC.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was assisted at check in by Selena, I believe, and she was very helpful in providing recommendations and even gave me a complimentary upgrade.\n\nI ordered room service a few times and the quality was outstanding. The property has two restaurants, L'Amico and The Vine. I tried them both as well as both bars, and service and quality both were great. I even got free beer with one of my room service orders and a nice handwritten note (Thanks Yolanda!)\n\nI was out most nights and slept a lot during the day, so I missed housekeeping service, but they were quick to service the room whenever I requested. Speaking of the room, ask for one with views of the Empire State Building. It was amazing to wake up to every day.\n\nI had one treatment in the spa which I feel was not worth what I paid, but that's literally my only downside. When I arrived for my appointment, the spa was silent (not even background music) and it felt kinda awkward, like I had just interrupted a lunch break or something. In their defense, I did show up almost 30 minutes before my appointment time, but I figured there would be some kind of relaxation room, as most spas at hotels of this caliber have. The massage itself was fine but I did feel kind of unwanted.

One hour early check-in was granted with no questions asked. \n3 hotel elevators handle the job right, virtually eliminating waiting times, even during the peak hours. Our standard room was decent, had a deposit safe, a fridge, a desk, an umbrella and everything else needed for your stay. The room's size was even a bit larger than what one usually sees in NYC hotels. \nThe bathroom was super spacious, with an oversized shower stall featuring a convenient wooden stool. The choice of toiletries more than adequate. \nThe view, from our 20th floor, to 6th Ave, a part of Broadway and the Empire State Building was superb. \nThe sleep quality was good, even though the soundproofing could have been better. \nThe WiFi was good, no glitches.\nThe Vine NYC restaurant offered a perfect and affordable breakfast (refer to our dedicated review). \nThe fitness center features several treadmills, ellipticals, and a few exercise machines.   \nThe lobby is comfortable; it gets quite lively at the evening hours.  \nThere is an affordable Icon parking, right around the corner, on 29 W St, less than 2 minutes' walk to the hotel. \nDefinitely recommended.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It didn't seem to have the edge I expect,  and service wasn't as friendly as usual. On the positive side, the room was a nice size, especially for New York. The bathroom was large and comfortable as well. The bed was comfortable and my room on the 9th floor was very quiet. The hotel is close to the subway (less than 2 blocks) and within a 10 minute walk to the Empire State Building. I arrived about an hour before check-in, and my room was ready. I was very happy about this as there were others waiting for their room. After getting settled I went downstairs for lunch. The food was good, but overpriced. \nSaturday evening I tried to have dinner at the Italian restaurant in the hotel, but I was told a reservation was required, The person who checked me in at the hotel should have stated this when he mentioned the restaurant. When I was walking away, the host said I could sit outside and they could serve me there. I was very tired, so I accepted. The pasta dish I wanted wasn't on the menu that night, so I ordered the filet. It was cooked as ordered, but $90 for a small steak, one glass of wine and the tip was more than I had planned to spend.\nDespite the room size, overall I was underwhelmed. There was no real sense of service that I would have expected. I also had to call housekeep for soap because it wasn't replaced after my first or second of three nights. Would I stay at this hotel again? Probably not.  ","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Check in was a breeze when we came back later in the afternoon. \n\nThe room had a great view of the Empire State Building from the 15th floor. Lucked out with the smallest room on the floor, wished I had a little more space. Housekeeping was wonderful and did a beautiful job, they were also very friendly when we saw them in the halls. A friend dropped off a gift and note for us at the front desk on Friday - it was in our room Saturday but without the note, instead we found a note from housekeeping. So we assumed the gift was from them, and didn\u2019t figure out it was a friend till they asked about it days later! Made us laugh. \n\nRoom was pretty, well appointed. Nothing super fancy. Bed was ridiculously comfortable. Could definitely hear street noise, but it didn\u2019t bother us.\n\nTried to eat at the restaurant in the lobby Friday and Saturday night and was greeted with an hour and a half wait.

Awesome decor and the L'Amico restaurant was delicious.  There are a lot of great hotels in NYC but the front desk staff at the Eventi is what puts this hotel above the rest.  If you have the pleasure of interacting with CELINE or SAMANTHA you wont be disappointed.  I was lucky enough to see their smiling faces multiple times.  From the moment I checked in I felt like I was talking to a great friend I hadn't seen in years.  I was celebrating my honeymoon and these two ladies helped kick it off to a great start!  Samantha challenged me a hula hoop contest...yeah, you can hula hoop for an upgrade (I suggest you practice before, she's good).  Celine and Samantha gave us great recommendations for NYC, ask them, they know what's up!  I could go on and on and on and on and on about these two but I hope you get to meet them on your trip and see for yourself.

Food and drinks in both restaurants are really good, and many people enjoyed the wine hour, which is a bunch of free wine on the third floor.  What's not to like? The rooms are comfortable and larger than a lot of rooms in the city, and the floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch.  The bathrooms are very large and the hotel was a nice place to return to after a long day out.  \n\nThen we met Alex, who I guess is a doorman, but really he does it all.  We spoke for a while at the door after I walked my dog, and he seemed genuinely interested in the fact that my wife and I were at the hotel to celebrate.  The next thing we knew, Alex had upgraded us to a suite and delivered some wine, beer, and snacks to the room.  He said he figured we needed more space since we had our dog with us, and wanted to help us celebrate with a gift.  We were very surprised, my wife was thrilled that she now had a tub in the room, and the dog was grateful for all the space to wander around.  \n\nToday my wife texted me a link to an article and in all caps she wrote, \"ALEX SAVED CHRISSY TEIGEN AND HER UNBORN CHILD!\" And, she was right.  Is this guy NYC's real Superhero??  Hotel Eventi, please tell Alex \"The Lang's\" say thank you for our wonderful stay.  And for saving Chrissy Teigen.

My husband and I arrived around 4:30 and we were worried about making it to our 5:00 massages in midtown.  The valet parking was very convenient, and from the moment we met the hotel staff, we knew we had discovered a special place.  The service was perfection.  Alex, the doorman, helped us with our bags and led us to the front desk. Alex is a great guy and made us feel very welcome. The lobby is decorated really well and is a cool hang out. The front desk staff checked us in fast once we told them we were in a bit of a hurry, and we were in our beautiful corner room with a king size bed in no time.  \nWe soon realized I had misplaced our suitcase (it was a little hectic because we brought our dog lol) and my husband went down to the lobby.  Again, Alex took great care of him.  The suitcase was soon located and all was well.  Alex then knocked on our door, and because we had mentioned we were in town for our anniversary, the front desk had sent up champagne and cupcakes! (Is there anything better?)  We left for our massages and when we returned, Alex greeted us at the door and asked if we would like to move to a larger room since it was a special occasion and we had our dog.  Before we knew it, we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite!  It was a fantastic room with a view of the Empire State Building, and the bathroom was amazing.  (I soon found myself sipping champagne while in the jetted tub!!!) \nThey also provided bowls for our dog's food and water, and offered a dog bed, but we had brought our own.  This hotel is very pet friendly! No charge for pets, no weight limit, you can even bring more than one pet.  You just have to sign a form saying if the pet causes any damage, or the room is soiled, you pay for it.  I think it is a great policy because I hate having to pay high fees for my well behaved dog.  \nWe had drinks at the bar and my Moscow Mule was of the best I have ever had.  In the morning, we enjoyed breakfast in the on site restaurant The Vine. Our waiter, An Tazul, was fantastic and made sure our meal was perfect.  I had the Ruby Grapefruit Brulee and a blueberry muffin, while my husband enjoyed the oatmeal with fresh berries. They also had a breakfast buffet option that looked very tempting and if I had a larger appetite I definitely would have tried it.\nThis is the kind of hotel where every staff member is very professional and good at what they do.  It is a great deal for the price. They actually care enough to personalize your experience and make sure you enjoy your time at the hotel.

Across many stays over 10+ years, Eventi has always been my GoTo hotel in NY. This last experience, due to a totally non-responsive customer service ECHO CHAMBER at the front desk and the management levels, made my experience unpleasant in the extreme.\n\n1. I noted in my reservation that I would like a room away from the elevator, housekeeping closets, and other noise sources.\n\n2. Upon reserving a room online, I was offered a $12 upgrade. I accepted. Because I lurve the Eventi.\n\n3. Two days later I got an email invitation for a second, $45 upgrade. Of course I accepted. BECAUSE I LURVE THE EVENTI!\n\nSo what room did they give me? A room right next to the housekeeping closet, which the maid banged open and closed two dozen times between 6am and 9am. The room was also on the noisy construction side of the hotel, and the backup BEEP BEEP BEEPING started at 7am and never stopped. Being from the west coast, I ended up with 4-5 hours sleep per night throughout the conference.\n\nUpon checkout, I told the desk staff about the problem and requested that the second upgrade of $45 be removed from my bill - since they had effectively upgraded me into a room that was the antithesis of what I wanted, and had failed to provide the most basic service any hotel can provide (a good night's sleep). Given that this partial refund was about 10% of my spend per day, it would have been a good compromise. Front desk guy said his boss was on the phone, but he'd speak with him to get the ok on this partial refund as soon as possible. He also handed me the boss's card - it said Bill [-].\n\nTwo days pass. Nothing happens. No Bill [-]. No one calls or emails.\n\nOne more day passes and I get an email from Hannah [-], Guest Services Manager, asking how my stay was. I replied courteously with the info above. No response from Hannah [-], nada. Probably a robot.\n\nOne more day passes and the Eventi sends me a SURVEY asking me how my stay was. I courteously write all of the above into the survey. No response, nada.\n\nSo why was the front desk unable to address my problem?  And why is Eventi sending me a phony \"we care\" email from a phony Guest Services Manager Bot and a 10-page survey that nobody at Eventi ever bothers reading?\n\nI am so disappointed. I really enjoyed the amenities at this hotel, from the bedding to the view, room service to the restaurant at breakfast, through several stays over the years. And I really liked the location - just far enough away from the Times Square madness yet walk-able to so many things, including Javitz. But being ripped off by \"upgrade\" after \"upgrade\", and being completely ignored through FOUR SEPARATE ATTEMPTS to get a resolution to a problem is the worst customer service ever.\n\nKimpton: if you're not going to actually read any responses from all your robotic inquires, you're better off not sending them at all. This is a black mark on the entire Kimpton chain.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location is perfect, only a couple of blocks from Union Station and really within walking distance of Times Square if one were to choose that route. \n\nThe design of the hotel and adjacent restaurants are really cool and modern, with a lot of details in its design that are beautiful. The rooms are standard small for New York. \n\nAfter a request upon arrival, we were upgraded to a room with a partial view of the Empire State Building, which was cool at night although the bed should have been placed on the opposite side of the room to fully enjoy it. We asked for two bed covers upon check in, which did not arrive until I had called several times to remind them. And instead of making the bed, they just gave me the sheets. I requested for housekeeping to please make the bed with the two covers separately for the rest of our stay but they did not one time remember to do so. \n\nThey pride themselves in being animal-friendly. I love dogs but not barking dogs in adjacent room while I'm on vacation to relax, especially not late at night. I called numerous times about this and instead of moving the owners with the dogs, they told us we could move and that we had to accept the fact that this is an animal-friendly hotel. Strike one.\n\nMy sister and I went to the spa, which is extremely small. The massage treatment was divine. The masseuse was so good and really took her time. The scrub treatment felt extremely rushed and was not relaxing at all. When going to the showers to rinse off after the scrub, there was no shampoo. I asked for it and although they looked, they could not find any and did not arrange to have any brought there. Strike two. \n\nOn three occasions, the room key was demagnetized. This happens. Sometimes. Usually not three times. I had all my identification in the room and was thus not able to provide that upon their request, which brought on a lengthy interrogation to verify my identity. It happened again, very shortly thereafter with the same front desk staff. And without recalling me or the incident that had happened within an hour prior, they proceeded with the same interrogation methods, without a smile or attempt to ease the situation. Strike three. \n\nThis property is beautiful but I'm not impressed by the service. They make no attempt to get to know their customers. I would have gladly stayed here again upon first glance but don't think I will. There are plenty more excellent choices where feeling valuable as a client is important to the hotel.  \n\n","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I thought this splurge would be a treat but honestly, I've stayed in nicer hotels that are half this price in NYC.  I will say they the front desk did send up an apology bottle of wine and treats.

This hotel is located on the edge of the Chelsea neighborhood and just below Herald Square. Its location makes many parts of NYC easily reached by foot and due to Herald Square, it has easy connections to many subway lines. The entire staff we encountered from doormen to front desk to housekeeping were bright-eyed, friendly and genuinely seemed well-matched for jobs in hospitality. This is a lively hotel, but not too \"club like\". The lobby has two restaurants connected to it, and both are high quality. Our room was fantastic (we booked a Cityview room, more $ but worth it for the stunning eastward view of the Empire State and the Metropolitan Building (the one adorned with the golden pyramid on top). The bed was truly comfortable and clean, and the bathroom was really nice with plenty of room and good lighting. We enjoy room-service breakfasts and plan for the ridiculous expense incurred. However, when the food is delicious and arrives hot, we do not mind the extravagance. I have been to many NYC hotels that serve Lender's bagels and as a native to this City, it has always offended me greatly. So, I was pleasantly surprised to find out they serve true NYC made bagels and the lox platter was fresh and delicious. You really should start a NYC with a good old real bagel with a schmeer and some fresh lox! And just try not to dwell on what it just cost you, enjoy the sunrise view if you're on the east side of the building and plan your day. We would stay here again and are pleased we took a chance on a new (for us) hotel chain.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The complimentary wine hour is great and very much appreciated! Hotel staff members were friendly and helpful at all times! I would definitely recommend the hotel if you like this area of the city. There is plenty of shopping nearby and a short walk to the subway station. it's not the area where we normally stay in NYC. We decided to try something new this trip and enjoyed it but I do prefer our other location closer to Central Park and other shopping areas.

The hotel restaurants were always buzzing and busy but we didn't try them. \n\nI'm a little disappointed to read that so many guests were offered upgrades. I'm a rewards member and was not offered one at all. Also, just so you know....queen\/queen rooms do not have a view of the Empire State Bldg and do not have bathtubs. Our shower was huge and had a bench to sit on after walking all day though, so that was nice! Our view was the roof of another building:(\n\nThe only problems we had while here were with housekeeping. We returned one day to find a housekeeping \"key\" left in our door. The key said our room was being serviced. We entered and no one was there. Then, on our last day, we left our DND sign on because we left our belongings out, our safe open, were in a hurry, and did NOT want housekeeping in our room that day. They came in anyway. I called the front desk to express my concern and was told a manager would contact me. No one ever called. Fortunately, we checked everything and all was well but I am not happy that they entered our room when we clearly left the do not disturb sign on. \n\nOverall, this is a really nice hotel with many amenities and we would definitely stay here again!!

It was a horrible experience, that the hotel did absolutely nothing to try to improve.\n\nWe arrived around 3pm (check-in time) on the 27th and were told one of our rooms wasn\u2019t ready. Ok, fine, they\u2019re busy, it\u2019s the holidays, these things happen. But our room wasn\u2019t ready until 4:30pm and this is supposed to be a 5-star property. No offer of a drink at the bar? Nothing? Ok fine. Off on the wrong foot and a delay to the start of our family\u2019s one night together in NYC, but that\u2019s maybe a 3 or 4 star review at this point.\n\nThe next morning, I went down to a nearby coffee shop to grab coffees for my whole family. On the way back up, I got in an elevator with two ladies visiting from Europe. As soon as the doors closed, the elevator jerked violently. From that point, all the electronics were unresponsive and we couldn\u2019t open the doors. We thought we were still on or near the first floor, but weren\u2019t sure. Fortunately the two ladies were lovely about the whole situation, and none of us panicked. About an hour later (yes, an hour stuck in an elevator), they finally got us out from the elevator, which was not aligned with the ground floor and had indeed jerked down about a foot and a half, so we had to climb up and out. It appeared to be stuck there. Not fun.\n\nMy family had been wondering where I was since our phones didn\u2019t work in the stuck elevator. The hotel hadn\u2019t bothered to tell them anything.\n\nComing out of the elevator I now had $25 of cold coffees in my hands. The staff were apologetic and took our room numbers, but there was zero follow up. Nothing. Nada. Zip.\n\nHow does a five star hotel in New York City justify service like this? If guests are given the atrocious experience of literally getting stuck in an elevator, there is no attempt whatsoever to remedy that? The very minimum would be to offer to pay for those cold coffees, and really, they should be refunding our rooms for an experience like this.\n\nOn our way out a staff member asked how our stay was. I told him it was pretty awful due to our rooms not being ready and then getting stuck in the elevator for an hour. Really trimmed down our time together as a family in NYC.\n\n\u201cAt least you\u2019ve got a great story to tell now!\u201d he said cheerfully.\n\nI took his advice. \u201cGood point, I thought.

The suite was quite lovely, with an enormous master bath, large living\/dining room, well appointed bedroom, a half-bath near the entrance and of course a veranda. I even got a partial view of the Empire State building. The robes were comfortable, as was the bedding. Hotel provides various amenities for travellers, such as a toothbrush kit. There is a small bar area in the living room, with a mini fridge and a sink. There is a large TV in the living room and another one in the bedroom. \nTwo things to note.

Times Square and the theater district, Chelsea, and Flatiron are all within easy striking distance on foot, and midtown offices and shopping are also relatively close by.  The neighborhood is vibrant and safe, with plenty of restaurant options - including the Korean spots in \"Koreatown\" - nearby.\n\nRoom:  The Eventi is a newer, high-rise property.  To avoid noise, ask for a room on one of the upper floors.  We were on the 18th floor, on the back side of the building, and had an open view of the city. I believe that rooms at the front of the hotel would have a view of the Empire State Building, but also face busy Sixth Avenue - if you're on the front side, definitely ask for a higher floor so that noise isn't a problem.\n\nOur room was clean, spacious, and bright, with a large window, good lighting, and easy-to-use controls.  The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom had a simple, intuitive design with a great marble shower enclosure.  \n\nService:  We stayed at the hotel over Thanksgiving weekend, which I'm sure is especially hectic for the hotel staff.  We arrived by car and used valet parking, a format that I suspect isn't typical.  When we pulled up by car, there was almost nowhere to park in front of the hotel, and no hotel staff outside the building to answer questions or deal with bags.  I went into the hotel and eventually found a staff member who was able to help with parking, which costs $50\/day plus tax, with no in\/out privileges.  Your car is available within 30 minutes of making a request.\n\nWe arrived around lunch time, but check in is at 3.  The lobby was a zoo.  We eventually found someone to store our bags, and asked the front desk to alert us if a room became available before 3.  While eating lunch, we got a call to say that our room was ready, and went back to the hotel - only to be told by the front desk that no rooms were available until 3.  Obviously, there was poor communication between staff members.  In any case, we were finally  able to check in before 3.  Note that bags are not delivered to rooms - guests carry their luggage.  \n\nHousekeeping came to service our room at 10 AM one morning, a bit early for a weekend, and we had to request service for later in the day.  \n\nWe planned to leave the hotel at 7 AM.  Since the front desk was crowded earlier in the morning, I tried to check out at around 6:30, to take advantage of a window when the front desk wasn't busy. My partner was still in the room. The front desk said I couldn't settle the bill early, as the hotel would have to send housekeeping to prepare the room for the next guests right away.  I was surprised that I couldn't settle the bill less than an hour before I planned to leave the room, an arrangement that most hotels agree to without question.  \n\nThe service issues I mentioned are all minor, but they added up to an experience that wasn't quite up to par with the stays I've had at other Kimpton properties.        \n\nThe Eventi scores well on location, room comfort, and overall value.  While individual staff members are friendly, they often appear to be on auto-pilot - a small amount of sensitivity and flexibility would bring the service into line with the rest of the property.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was a last minute booking over Veterans Day and it simply was the best deal by far for what I needed. I actually wanted to stay in a boutique hotel in Chelsea, but this was the closest for the price & standard I could find.\n\nI arrived in a lobby that frankly looked like a train station full of people. I expected a long check in process but it was seamless and Jason was great - prompt yet informative. My room was large, modern & clean with a view of the Empire State Building. The bathroom is huge. I had a good work space. Over all the room was better & larger than most in this category of hotels in NY and for what I paid. It lacked tea\/coffee making facilities which was a bit annoying, but there is free coffee in the lobby. I ran into a cleaning ladies once or twice and they were extremely chatty & friendly, which seems like something small - but friendly\/happy staff reflects well on the hotel. They have a happy hour on the 3rd floor with free wine which is lovely. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel etc all great.\n\nThe drawbacks to watch out for : ask for a room away from 6th Ave (so basically no Empire State view) as the traffic noise & construction on other buildings are relentless and 24 hours - even with all windows closed - and the highest floor you can afford. Despite my request for a quiet room I ended up with an inter-leading room (voices and tv heard clearly) and next to the linen room (which frankly didn't bother me too much). Obviously room service, drinks etc are crazy expensive - this is Manhattan after all - but there is a 24 hr supermarker across the road (just don't get run over on 6th).\n\nI feel like my 3 star rating is perhaps a bit unfair and it really should be 4 stars - just that I wanted\/expected a quiet boutique hotel in Chelsea - which this definitely is not. It feels more like a Times Square\/Midtown type hotel. I've stayed at Kimpton in Pittsburgh which felt much more exclusive, but alas a very good hotel chain.\n\nHope my comments are fair and helpful to other guests.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

I've been a Kimpton rewards member for years and generally enjoy their hotels, and this was another excellent stay.\n\nOur room was a City View Deluxe room with views of the Empire State Building and Sixth Avenue. It was clean, quiet, well-appointed, and comfortable. The only foible was a slow internet connection that didn't reflect our price point or location. Other Kimpton hotels have had 100 Mbps connection in the room, but this was closer to 5. Legally it doesn't qualify for the FCC definition of high-speed internet. \n\nThe best was adequately comfortable with nice linens and pillows. We didn't eat from any of the restaurants, but did order room service a couple of times and were impressed each time. Our food was prompt and hot. \n\nParking is valet and about what I'd expect for New York. Our only issue was it took almost an hour for our car to arrive when it was time to leave, but the manager took some of the parking charge off our bill. It was inconvenient, but rectified to our satisfaction. \n\nI'd especially like to praise Aston during our check in. He managed our attempt to park in front with aplomb while ensuring our bags were handled with care and delivered to our room. He is an excellent representative of the Kimpton brand and made a wonderful first impression. \n\nI'd recommend the Eventi for couples looking to visit downtown New York in a convenient location. There is plenty of restaurants and sights nearby while having excellent access to taxis and the subway. Pets are welcome too. \n\nI'm sure we'll stay at the Eventi again.

Prior to the departure of my trip, I have already paid for the 2-weeks of hotel charges.\n\nMy experience with this hotel is it\u2019s (i) chaotic and non-transparency in charging customers, (ii) lacks of effective communication amongst staffs, and most important of all, (iii) fails to provide hospitalities up to expectations.\n\nWhen I checked in, I was told to have USD700 held up from my credit card as deposit to which I of course agreed.  But, few days later, without informing me or seeking my approval, a further USD1,600 was charged to my credit card with the reason that I am going to stay in the hotel for nearly 2 weeks.   If so, why I was not told that at the time when I checked in but rather having my credit card charged any time the hotel like? \n\nBesides, after having one breakfast and laundry in the hotel, I was immediately charged USD167 to my credit card despite I had told them before all those expenses should add to my final hotel bill and for which I will settle when check out.  When I called the front desk to get to the bottom of this, I was told the hotel was trying to take a \u2018proactive approach\u2019 to charge my credit card.  Seriously?  Anyway, at the end of the conversation, he agreed to have the amount to be refunded and will have the refund receipt be ready to send to me when it\u2019s ready.\n\nOn the next day, when I talked to the so-called Front-desk Manager \u2018ISHA\u2019, she told me the hotel had refunded the USD167 but for the refund receipt, I have to get it from the front desk.  When I told her to leave the receipt in my room, she told me the hotel will not do so.  When I heard that, I was astonished.  How come the hotel cannot entertain such a simple request made by a customer and if so, what kind of hospitality and services that is?\n\nOne more thing, I reserved the hotel restaurant \u201cL\u2019Amico\u201d at 9 pm on 27 Oct night.  Though I was there punctually, I had to wait for 45 minutes for a table for two.  Anyway, the foods were no surprise and I would compare that to a Bistro.  Disappointing enough.\n\nWorst of all, on the night of 28 Oct, when I was resting in my room with the Do-Not-Disturb light turned on, a guy kept locking on my door at around 10pm.  When I answered the door, he asked me did I smell any cigarette.  I told him that I couldn\u2019t and then he asked me to go out to smell. Supposing, he\u2019s accusing of me of smoking in the room which I hadn\u2019t caused I am not a smoker at all. He carried a bottle of air freshener in his hands and asked me, \u2018do you want to smell this\u201d? What is that supposed to mean? He then warned me, this is a non-smoking hotel and we do charge a cleaning fee the guest smokes. I am confident in telling him, \u2018yes, and how does that concern me\u2019? Anyway, what a great night to be disturbed on a Saturday relaxing night! \n\nLast but note least, as I have to stay in this hotel for few more days, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.  Perhaps you will hear the second part of my story a few days later.  I just hope the hotel can at least improve a little bit on its services \u2013 especially to a customer who had paid around USD6800 staying there for over 2 weeks!!! Not a cheap hotel, but up to this point, I am receiving cheap services!","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The bed\/pillows were comfortable although I could hear a bedspring pop in one spot on the bed.  The shower was fantastic (although the glass shower doesn't make it particularly practical if you're more than one to a room- there can really only be one person in the bathroom at any time \n-Lobby - the lobby, while small, was cheerful with close by access to coffee bar (excellent cappuccinos) or cocktails.  \n\nCons-the front desk staff wasn't as welcoming as I would have thought.  When I initially checked in, the girl didn't tell me anything about the wine reception (however, I already knew about it from other Kimpton stays)...I just happened to find the little note of the location by the water in the lobby.  She just rushed me through - taking my cc and gave me room key\n-there was no water in the lobby a couple of times we stopped by  - and it was a warm weekend\n-Often times it seemed like the front desk staff was busy chatting when they could have been more helpful to guests - that being said there were 1-2 staff that were quite helpful; it was just a mixed bag\nOverall a great stay - just not 5 star","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Negative for me was I didn't like pets being allowed in a hotel.

We had a couple of \"yappers\" across the hall during the day time, fortunately they did not play up at night avoiding us needing to complain. Maybe a dedicated floor for animals would at least be considerate to other guests. Lastly the hotel could be more proactive about marketing it's services and activities. They kept moving \"wine hour\" to various rooms and you only find out by turning up to where you think it is and then tracking down someone as to the actual location. As for other services didn't use spa as it wasn't promoted so I had no interest.  Don't know if I missed any other activities.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As I was looking to set up a nice trip for our 10th wedding anniversary, I wanted something better than a Holiday Inn.  When I narrowed my search to hotels in or near Times Square, the Kimptons popped up more prominently.  I read the reviews, looked at the pictures, checked the actual location - and decided to go for it.  I prepaid two nights and basically hoped for the best.\n\nThere's something to be said about hope (and my fellow Yelpers, lest I forget) - this hotel basically knocked my expectations out of the park.  Despite being from NY, I've never really stayed in any of the hotels...since I grew up and lived on Long Island, any sojourn into the city was always a day trip, no need for overnight accommodations so I expected the worst.  You know, space is a premium in NYC in general, and a lot of reviews I'd read of other hotels often brought up the rather minimal square footage with the caveat that it is NYC and thus to be expected. This was most certainly NOT the case at Kimpton Eventi.  I upgraded us to the Master\/King's Suite (I forget the exact moniker) so the room we got actually had a separate bedroom w\/a king size bed; there was also a living room, a hallway with a full size closet, flatscreens in the living and bed rooms and a well appointed marble bath, with a separate closet for the toilet and floor-to-ceiling windows in both rooms that offered excellent views of the city from the 17th floor.  Talk about a swanky hotel room, it also had hardwood floors throughout, nice appointments, modern fixtures with Wi-Fi and numerous USB hookups for all of your toys.  We were one block over from MSG and a few blocks over from the Empire State Building and some 16 blocks from Times Square (which works out to about 3\/4 of a mile from the hotel), ideally situated for the plans I'd put into motion.\n\nWhen we first arrived at the GPS location, I wasn't sure what I was looking at- I saw what looked like a couple of restaurants w\/outside seating, but no signs or indicators that there was a hotel on the premises.  I ended up circling around a few times looking for the hotel itself; my wife called the front desk and we were instructed to pull right up front and the valets would take care of the car and our bags and get us inside.

The hotel is in a good location, close to two subway lines, walking distance to NoMad and Madison Square Garden. It is on a busy street, and less of a neighborhood feel, but that is both a benefit and a drawback - it just depends on what you are looking for.\n\nThe lobby was warm, welcoming and trendy. Check-in was seamless and the front desk staff were accommodating. What I really like is that they honored my request for a quiet room away from the elevators. This is a simple request, but you'd be amazed by how many hotels either overlook or ignore it. There have been many times when I've been placed right next to an elevator. I'm an extremely light sleeper so this bothers me. The fact Eventi acknowledged and honored the request scored points with me. \n\nThe King room was a nice size and very well appointed. The carpet was plush, bed comfortable, and the contemporary decor was nice. The bathroom was a good size including the rain shower. My only complaints would be that the room didn't have a full-length mirror, and the connecting door to the neighboring room was not soundproof. This allowed me to hear the people next to me come in late and night and talk loudly. These are not reasons to not stay here again, but I will certainly request a non-adjoining room next time.\n\nIn a city full of a few great hotels, and lots of terrible properties, this is a great option for New York","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I didn't want to be far from the venue I was going to that evening, so initially found the Eventi based upon location. I was glad I did as I found the hotel terrific. \nCheck in was great, as the gentleman at was friendly, warm, and accommodating. I was informed of the \"happy hour\"\/reception that unfortunately I was unable to attend. As I only had a small bag I didn't need the service of the bellhop, though that was available if needed. I was given a high floor which resulted in a very nice view out of my large windows in the room. I was staying in an Executive one bedroom, as there was the possibility that friends would be coming back later and I wanted the sitting area. The room was spectacular, with everything appearing relatively new, fashionable and stylish, and top of the line. Both the sitting room with television, desk, and pull out sofabed and the bedroom and bathroom were spacious (especially for NY standards), and included a fridge with minibar and a large closet for my hanging clothes. Also included were two plush bathrobes. After traveling that morning I needed a shower to freshen up, and the large bathroom was extremely comfortable with all high end fixtures. The shower was huge and partially open, and the bathroom was stocked with very nice Atelier Bloem products. \nI had a great nights sleep as my room was very quiet and the blackout shades worked well. My three interactions with the staff were once again top notch the next day. Two different woman at the counter were extremely pleasant, friendly, and helpful. And I needed to leave a bag after checkout that I was going to retrieve before departing for the airport that afternoon, and the bellman too was friendly and courteous. The management and staff \"get it\" - by \"it\" I mean outstanding customer service. \nThe hotel was decorated beautifully, and the lobby had a vibrancy to it. I didn't get a chance to experience any of the amenities, like the outdoor plaza or veranda with \"sweeping \" views or complimentary bike or shoeshine, but did have an espresso in the attached coffee bar. Next time in town or for a longer visit I'll try to explore the hotel more and take advantage of all that it offers. \nOne minor complaint - though I got free wifi for joining the rewards program while I was there, guests don't get credit for their initial stay unless they sign up preceding their stay. I wish the website was more clear.\nOverall a great stay!","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

I stayed several times before they updated the hotel with the new restaurants\/lobby and have stayed a few times since. The hotel has gotten a lot more expensive since I discovered it.  I had to be in the city for business in the fashion district and it is very convenient for me.  I checked the rates and they were prohibitive for me, almost $500 a night which I prefer not to do.  Rooms were in the $300s when I first started staying.  I decided to look elsewhere and when I looked on Hotels.com the rates for the Eventi were much cheaper.  I am not a fan of Hotels.com but decided to go ahead and book the room since it was so much cheaper than the Eventi advertised rate.  I am eligible for a Kimpton upgrade so I asked about it as I checked in and told there was not an upgrade available.  When we arrived at our room, it was the way smaller than any room I had ever stayed in before at the Eventi.  I was shocked and very disappointed.  It had a good view of the Empire State Building but that is about as good as it got.  We were running late for dinner and I needed to quickly iron my top.  I tried the iron and it did not work.  I check a few plugs and they appeared to work so I called for another iron which came in about 10 minutes.  Tried it again with no luck.  I then called the front desk to ask them if there was a secret to the iron.  They sent another gentleman up with a brand new iron, still in the box.  While we were waiting on him to come, we tried all of the plugs in the room and I think only a few worked.  By this time, it was time to go, so we asked the man if he would stay and fix the plugs.  I went to dinner in the clothes that I had worn all day while traveling because I never got to iron my outfit, with all the chaos. The next day I went to my meetings and left my husband in the room while I was gone.  He had planned to do computer work and watch TV until I came back.  Much to his disappointment, the TV did not work all day since they were changing providers. The rest of our stay was pretty uneventful.  We stayed for just 3 nights, it was a quick trip.  I still think the hotel is a great place, but I was very disappointed about the size of our room and all the issues we had.  I am not sure if I will stay there again because I think they have priced themselves out of my market and there are no more loyalty perks for Kimpton Karma members. I am sick about it because the location it so perfect for me and I love all the positive changes they have made as far as the restaurants plus the exterior and lobby upgrades.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The beds are tiny and flat so even our 22 pound dog couldn't sleep on it and it was not even an option for our 70 pound dog. \n\nIt was a nice hotel but it's going downhill.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1456560,"title":"A Overall Great Choice","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-07-16","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"I'm an original NY'er returning back home for some quick biz and family mix for an extended few days before the 4th. And I had a few days in the city before visiting some family at their homes.\n\nI wanted a nice hotel away from the gawd awful crush of Times Square, yet uber cool and close enough to Penn Station  for my nieces to come in, and also to be centrally located to Chelsea and able to head to the museums and shopping\/ restaurants we'd be hitting.\n \nI'm also a bit of a snob about decent rooms so I wanted quality rooms for both myself and the girls. I was treating them as a gift and wanted a good hotel.\n\nThis is my first time with Kimpton. Both my husband and I are IHG members, but I understand that Kimpton and IHG are still separate despite the new merger. Since the hubs wasn't along this time, I felt it was important to find a hotel that met my needs first; quality; location; comfort; price. \n\nI Have to say, I was pleased with the pricing on Kimpton Eventi for NYC hotels ( which are by no means cheap) and joined their Karma rewards for the added perks, a nice bonus for the wifi and raid the mini bar, which the nieces loved! Just be prepared for a little sticker shock with the city hotel taxes, but that's any hotel you book!\n\nPros: Relatively newer hotel, in a great location at the top of Chelsea. Nice sized rooms (for NYC) with super views, comfy bed. I had reserved a king deluxe for myself with a city view; and a double queen deluxe for the nieces.\nMy room was very clean( and I do really check it) only saw a small old strange stain on one lampshade back by the bed ( not asking?!) but all else look new and clean. Bed was some kind of foam type bed, really comfy as said, linens clean, soft and nice too. I have no problems falling asleep here. Rainfall shower and bench in the bath, absolutely fabulous!\n\nAs said: pricing, very reasonable for Manhattan. Room well worth it. I also used their valet parking for my car which ran $50 a day, to garage it; but you have to remember it's NYC and yep everything costs. \n\nKarma rewards helped covered a bottle of water and some snacks for the nieces in the mini fridges in the rooms. A safe in the room, as well as a iron, ironing board, robes to use...\n\nReception staff and front desk ( even reservations) honestly all were genuinely friendly and great to work with. Everyone was sincere, always smiling :) I missed the wine reception at the evening. But it is very busy come evenings at the hotel so be forewarned on that. Always people in the lobby and lounge from early evening on.\n\nCons:\n\nNot much: only a few thing I can think of.\n\nNo coffee makers in room if that's your thing and must. But you can easily go downstairs to the restaurants to get one there or order up.\n\nThe hotel is very very busy in the evenings. The free wine reception, into the dinner hours on. So, if you do not like crowds avoid the lobby areas. Also the Italian restaurant, as a hotel guest if you expect any extra privilege for seating it won't happen. You'll have to wait, that was a bit disappointing.\n\nLastly, I did have one small incident where I left my phone charging cable out plugged into the outlet on the nightstand while out. I guess when the maid came in to clean she used either the vacuum or some type of Roto cleaning tool as my cable had been cut (actually like sliced) along with the hotel phone cord too, when I looked at that closely too, after noticing my own cable. The room had been totally cleaned, and my cable was still plugged in; I hadn't noticed it till next day. Anyway; I get it that they didn't want me to notice they cut my cable for fear of an incident; maybe losing their job or whatever, so I let it slide, w\/o making a big stink. However cleaning should have made note of that to the customer, it's appropriate to do that; and such a little thing like that can be replaced is all. By the time I had found out I was already packing to leave and it was more frustrating that it was kind of hidden, if you know what I mean. So the cleaning gets a demerit.\n\nOverall, the hotel Eventi has ranked really high on my list for excellent choices for hotels in Manhattan. Especially Chelsea\/midtown area where you are looking for independent distinctive comfort in a trendy environment; flushed with restaurants, shopping, and things to do nearby. Well worth a room if you are looking into that area of Manhattan. ","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

I got to try more of the restaurant options so that was nice and my room with a view was perfect. I will say that rushing to get your key card in the elevator to select your floor isn't always convenient but I appreciate the security measure. If only the rates were more affordable I would stay here when I visit for pleasure too. None the less, the hotel and staff are great!","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'm a huge fan of the hotel and the staff has been top notch, every single time. \n\nThe wine hour is a great perk, but the quality of the staff, and rooms are what set it apart from the pack. I find the location to be great and easy to get to anywhere walking\/ubering\/subway. I highly recommend this hotel, and hope that with the pending merger IHG doesn't take away from all that great Kimpton components.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I had in mind a premier inn type of stay, but I was very positively surprised. The rooms are a decent size (for NY), well equipped, free wifi, though annoyingly you have to register each device you want to use which means joining their loyalty scheme, in my case three time? (this has the reverse effect for me - makes me anti loyal!) Nonetheless, the choice of 3 good places to eat on site including a decent sports type bar serving food late was perfect for my needs. It's in a great location and relatively quiet for NY. This would be top of my list when I siting again - fair price for NY and everything you need for a day or two stay. Great if they sorted the wifi as totally free log on. Will certainly look at other Kimptons in future.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Check in with kevin has been quick, professional and very funny. Captain kirk stored my luggage cause I went to a knicks game. Relly funny guy and the type of person you want to have as a doorman. When i came back julia from the front desk handed out my room keys and spent some time for chat. Really nice girl. My room was located on the 19th floor. Which was great as the sunrise in the morning has been beautiful. The restaurant, the breakfast and all the staff has been great to us. When I have the chance to visit new york again, i would definitely stay there. Mainly because of the handsome and funny staff. You have been great to us.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1456560,"title":"Excellent location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-04-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Stayed for work for 5 nights, being upgraded to a king room on a high floor was really appreciated as it was actually quiet - a huge plus in a busy city - the room was plenty big enough and the floor to ceiling windows were great. Even on the 22nd floor being able to open the window so you can get \"fresh\" air was fantastic, so much better than blasting the aircon. Only very minor drawback would be the in-room dining menu - when you've got restaurants attached it would be good to be able to order from a reduced restaurant menu rather than the typical room service fair - especially when you're staying for a few nights the choices are pretty limited. That said, would definitely stay again. ","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
