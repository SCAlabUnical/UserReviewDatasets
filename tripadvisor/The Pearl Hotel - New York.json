The door and front desk staff were all super nice.  Room was clean.  Didn't try the restaurant, coffee, or bar so can't really speak to those amenities.  A couple of issues which keep me from bumping this up a star:\n\n1) The last night our room was cleaned and serviced but they left no towels, washcloths, or hand towels.  Quick call to housekeeping and we had those items within about 20 minutes so not anywhere near the end of the world, very minor inconvenience.\n\n2) I had my AirPods with me which I took out of my backpack and sat on the nightstand next to the bed.  Never once did I open them or use them during our week here.  I get on the plane home and open my AirPods case to find one of my pods missing.  My \"Find My\" feature shows my missing pods last location at the hotel, so I know it was\/is there.  We called the Front Desk to ask if it had somehow disappeared in the room (not wanting to be accusatory of a pod disappearing from a case which was never opened by us on property) and was under a bed, nightstand, etc.  They took the information and said they'd call us back.  It has been 6 days with no follow-up.  I've ordered a replacement pod and will write this off as a mystery disappearance and stay elsewhere next time.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The check- in staff were wonderful the rooms were large and  clean. Returning to the room after a long day of walking the city sightseeing and seeing a show.  We just wanted to take a shower and get in bed unfortunately there was no hot water.\n The front desk told us to run the water and it would probably get hot after way more than 45 minutes the water still was not even lukewarm We got assistance from somebody at the front desk who tried desperately to get it hot and then explained to us that because of the time of night most of the hot water was used on the upper floors because the water comes from the roof down.\nWe were told  nothing could be done until the next day. We were leaving the next day.\n There was no way I was getting into that clean bed after being out in the rain all day in New York.\n The man that was trying to help called to see if they could put us in another room.No luck. Finally after 11 o'clock at night the water did get hot.\n When we check out the next morning I brought it to the front desk's attention about the hot water issue. They gave us a 15% discount. I didn't think that was sufficient but my daughter did not want to make an issue out of it.\nI'm writing this review because I did put a complaint in on the Pearl's website back in December.

We had stayed in the area previously and were really looking forward to being back and having a \"boutique hotel\" experience. Check-in is at 4pm, but Keegan at the front desk was great and held our bags so we could explore while waiting for our room to be ready at 4pm. He was by far the most enjoyable desk staff and was very friendly and engaging. The location was also great as the hotel was in walking distance of all the events we had planned for our trip.\n\nWhile we wanted to enjoy our room experience, but did not. Despite the Pearl staff having five hours between check out and check in to clean our room between guests- we  discovered a large, smelly, yellow stain on our blanket when we turned down our bedding to climb in for bed. It smelled and appeared like a urine stain. It also appeared the blankets and sheets were not changed out from previous guests. The king bed we booked came with 3 old lumpy small pillows. When we called the front desk about the dirty bedding, the night desk attendant was rude and unhelpful and sounded annoyed we had disturbed him. The housekeeping staff was nice and came up with clean bedding and removed the dirty blankets after we informed them that our bedding was apparently dirty from the guests prior. They looked at the stain and then used gloves to touch the blanket and agreed it looked like urine.\n\nAfter having dirty bedding on check in, we felt extremely uncomfortable having house keeping clean our room afterwards and we requested no housekeeping service for our 3 night stay (instead we sanitized the room ourselves and kept the room tidy). There was no do not disturb sign in our room to use so we had to make this request with the front desk staff each morning. On day 2, we were told we were not allowed to request no housekeeping for more than 2 days (which is utterly bizarre) and the hotel manager would need to immediately inspect our room. We explained we did not want or need housekeeping and that they didnt clean our room before we checked in. This manager stated we checked in too early (at 4pm, which is the check in time) for her to personally confirm housekeeping did a good job and that no one urinated on our bed before our room was occupied and implied that we must be committing a crime in our room because we had requested no housekeeping service. She inspected our room and obviously it was fine, but this was still was a huge inconvenience that disrupted our romantic stay. She also claimed no one told her about our bed having urine on it and implied it was somehow our fault for not reporting the incident to her directly (even though we literally reported it immediately to the desk attendant working and housekeeping). It was a truly bizarre interaction and experience.\n\nFinally, the boutique experience overall was lacking. Breakfast was packaged grocery store pastries and bagels and a typical hotel coffee machine. The \"cafe\" advertised was a coffee machine with low fat Doritos and york peppermint patties despite it being advertised as a special amenity and us being charged extra for this \"service\". I would have enjoyed the offering of more local foods or coffees that exemplify NYC given the \"boutique\" title and extra fee charged for these amenities. I've had better breakfasts at chain hotels. \n\nWe would not choose to stay at this hotel again since the other nearby hotels we have stayed at were much more enjoyable and cleaner for a similar price. And no other hotel in the area has interrupted our anniversary stay with a mandatory room inspection as if we were committing some sort of crime or left pee sheets for us at check in!\n\n","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The mattress was comfy enough, but bedding was odd with undersized polyester sheets and small lumpy pillows. Climate control worked well and the windows can open. \n\nStaff were friendly and helpful, and the free WiFi was fast and reliable. The breakfast was basic but fine - a selection of small pastries bagels and toast, hard boiled eggs, fresh made fruit salad, coffee and tea. Only a limited number of tables to eat at so you may be sitting on a couch instead. Sometimes a long morning wait for the two elevators since they are shared with the cleaning staff. \n\nWe didn\u2019t try the daily afternoon wine, but they also always offered free small bags of one or two flavors of chips. \n\nIt was all good enough, but unless you really want to be practically in Times Square, stay someplace else in midtown.

Our flight arrived super early so we decided to drop our bags at the hotel and do a little sightseeing. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly greeted by a young lady and told we would we reached once our room was available. We went to lunch (Ellen's Stardust diner which was on our itinerary and literally right across the street). After leaving, we walked a few blocks and decided to head back to the hotel for chargers since our phone was dying...roughly about 2 hours prior to \"check-in\" time. The lady at front desk politely greeted us again and told us she was actually about to text us, which was great news to hear. Upon arrival to the room, it wasn't the room we booked. I paid for a double room superior and received a single bed. We were both too tired to care so we showered so we could rest. The bathroom was a nice size but with a small tv on the wall which was a great surprise. The shower was huge but neither of us could shower longer than 5 minutes because they drain must've been clogged and didn't drain. Within 2 minutes there was gross water nearly above our ankles. Disgusting. The beds were comfortable and the room included a microwave, coffee maker and mini fridge. There was also an umbrella in the closet which came in handy and robes and slippers for us. The lighting in the room and bathroom is horrible though and one of the lamps kept flickering. On the last day, the main room light would not come on but it was the last  day so I didn't bother calling the front desk. Breakfast was just ok. Bagels, an assortment of sweets, rubbery boiled eggs, fresh fruit, yogurt and packs of oatmeal. There was also orange juice, water and coffee. The eating area is a little cramped, located on the second floor but we did have a nice view of outside. There were about 6 tables with 4 chairs each on one side and the other had sofa chairs and tables. Also during the day they offered complimentary bags of chips and a vending machine on another level. Also there was complimentary wine daily (red or white) from 5pm to 6pm I believe. One other thing I noticed was we were the only POC during our entire stay, but those things don't generally bother me. I only felt a bit slighted at check out with that when speaking to a couple guys at front desk regarding transportation to the airport and a few stares during breakfast but hey, that's their issue, not  mine. As far as location, it was good. Very close to everything we were in town for. Minskoff Theater, Times Square, Ellen's Stardust Diner. We took an Uber & Lyft at other times. Would I stay again? Probably not. But it wasn't the absolute worst I've stayed in.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

The only negative is there was barely anything my husband could eat at breakfast as he was gluten free, so some more gluten free options would be appreciated by coeliacs.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff was courteous and helpful, the room (double queen) was spotless, safe, and more spacious than I had anticipated. The only change I would make is that we did not feel there was enough blankets on the beds and I didn\u2019t see any extras in the room. I should have asked for more at the front desk, because that was our only downside and probably was an easy fix, the beds were otherwise very comfortable and clean. The location was fantastic, we were able to walk to Times Square without being in the midst of chaos, we walked to\/from the subway, restaurants, Central Park, etc - it was great. We visited from MA over our February vacation week, and did not know if we would be able to make this trip until a few days before we came due to covid and weather, so the cancellation policy was important. We also did not make it to a Broadway show but this location clearly would have been perfect for that\u2026 next time. The continental breakfast had surprisingly good bagels and a couple other items, juice, etc, it wasn\u2019t much but it was fine for us to get started for the day, and included so no complaints. The coffee machine and tea off of the lobby was a very welcome feature, I love to go down and grab a hot cup of coffee while the rest of my family is getting ready in the morning, without having to leave the property, or even stand in line and pay for a basic cup of coffee. My husband and I also enjoyed the complimentary wine hour in the evening. We happened to come back to our room at that time both days; I wouldn\u2019t make special arrangements for this but if you happen to be there, it was very welcome. We left the kids up in the room to relax before dinner and just had a nice hour to ourselves with a couple glasses of wine.

If your going to eat whilst on the job, at least do it discreetly and clean up after yourself). \n\nThe only plus points were that the bedding and towels were changed daily so we were happy with that and appreciate the effort even on christmas day.\n\nLocation = 5*\n\n- Right next to Times Square, surrounded by restaurants and shops (both food and retail) so you will no doubt enjoy this part!\n\nOVERALL RATING = 3* At Best\n\n- Ideal location however I have stayed in much better hotels in New York so would recommend any future traveller to consider an alternative hotel for your stay!

I happened upon this hotel and the price and overall location was great. I'm a very firm believer in, \"You get what you pay for,\" so I was going for clean and safe, but not a whole lot more.  I'm on my 5th day here, and everyday, I'm more and more impressed.  The staff really cares. They've solved multiple little problems for me, especially when I realized I forgot my vaccination card at home, the gentleman at the front desk suggested where to go to get a digital confirmation on my phone. In 5 minutes catastrophe was averted!! The cleaning staff stopped by after I left the do not disturb sign on my room to make sure everything was ok. I've had multiple interactions with the staff daily and they have all been a pleasure. The continental breakfast is very good and high end. This ain't no crappy plastic wrapped danish\/instant coffee breakfast. My room is SUPER NICE with everything I need. The bed and pillows are very high quality.  The thermostat in the room is flawless. It's been horribly hot and ridiculously humid so yes, I set the room to 65degrees and you could hang meat in here.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate the large mirror in the room, so many times I've had to stand on a toilet to check my whole look out. The lobby is so beautiful. And I'm 2 blocks from Times Square. I literally couldn't have found a better hotel. I'll never stay anywhere else when I come to New York city.  Period.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

Okay, where to start? Location!!! This hotel is basically two blocks away from Times Square (Book of Mormons theater across the street and Chicago right beside the hotel); and is so close to everything and everywhere. We even walked to the Brooklyn Bridge and Little Italy which is an hour away and had an amazing time enjoying the walk.\nThe amenities of the hotel are unbeatable. Their \u201cContinental\u201d buffet breakfast is included, but it's really a full breakfast with oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, French toasts, croissants, pastries, juices and coffee, and it\u2019s really good and all-you-can-eat; it is served from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. (NOTE: every morning you have to ask for the breakfast vouchers at the hotel reception which you will deposit in a jar at Friedman\u2019s where it is served right next door \u2013 entrance through the hotel). The hotel also has a daily Wine and Cheese hour from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. with crackers, cheeses, and very good wine. In addition, it has a 24\/7 snack bar which was heaven sent upon our arrival at 1:30 in the morning; the bar has bananas, apples, cookies of all kinds, chips, coffee, variety of teas, and hot chocolate.\nWe were given Room 203 which was convenient, because, even though the elevators are fast, it was easier to take the two flights of stairs. The room was very clean and spacious; bathroom products are from L\u2019Occitane; the bed was super comfortable; some improvement can be made to the pillows although we slept like babies; the closet has bathrobes, slippers, an umbrella, a The Pearl small bag, laundry bag, safe; the room also had a nice terrace with a lounge and chairs, but the door had a please do not open sign which we imagined was due to the cold weather. The only problem we confronted was that the shower water took long to come out hot, but this was not a big deal; in the end, it came out veeeryyyy hot. The room was also beautifully decorated. When we say we slept like babies; we truly did, no sound whatsoever from nowhere.\nThe staff was super friendly as well as the butlers; always greeting guests and being attentive. We made the reservation through Orbitz and did not have any issues with hidden costs or daily fee which is $28.50; not bad for the many amenities and food provided.\nOverall, The Pearl is a keeper; we will definitely be back!!!!!","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The 24-hour snacks were great too, and we helped ourselves to a hot chocolate or tea plus snacks after a long day of sightseeing. For first time visitors to New York, the location was perfect. We went to several shows in the area, and all were within a 5-minute walk of the hotel. Subway stations were also convenient. The only downside is that the hotel is a little noisy. We could hear street traffic, which was to be expected. But we could also hear the whir of the elevator, creaks and knocks in the building, and on occasion, voices from other rooms.

I\u2019m a discerning consumer, and we usually stay at the Michelangelo on W 51st as it caters to families and offers spacious rooms at a decent price. However, I took a chance and booked here for a night with my daughter just before Christmas. I booked a \u2018deluxe\u2019 double room for a few hundred dollars for one night. Here is the lowdown...\n\nPositives:\n\nLocation....very important, and this fits the bill if you want to be in proximity to Rockefeller, Times Square or various Broadway shows. \n\nThe breakfast next door was a little different and we liked the variety....pastries, french toast and even avocado toast. Definitely a step up from the usual continental offerings. \n\nNegatives:\n\nThe room was standard, blah, nothing \u2018deluxe\u2019 about it to justify the pricing. We\u2019ve had better at the Holiday Inn. Sure, a mini fridge and microwave were included, but isn\u2019t that generally the standard at any hotel anymore? A bottle of Voss on the counter will set you back $8, and the main TV was small. The bathroom was a disaster and ill-conceived. Small counter, large toilet with 2 TP holders (one of which was right next to the bathtub). A small TV was in the bathroom, although it faced the toilet and made no sense for watching it anywhere else as the bathtub faucet was on the wrong side to view the TV while taking a bath.  Detail obviously was overlooked when designing these rooms. \n\nThe advertised \u201824-hr snack and drink\u2019 counter on 2nd floor is false advertising, as this was not open or stocked in the morning during our stay. Seems to be open at various times only. Or perhaps their staff just weren\u2019t attentive to this. \n\nThe staff was polite, yet curt. For a hotel that seems to get such accolades, the interactions with the front desk and valet personnel came across as apathetic, bored and perhaps overwhelmed. Not impressed. \n\nFor a night, we survived. Live and learn, I suppose.  Will be staying elsewhere next time.

The hotel was warm and welcoming.  Room looked out onto the street with the theatre that was showing Chicago.Spacious, fridge, coffee maker, plenty of towels , including face cloths,. Air con was good and changed very easily to heating the room.  One thing I was upset about they didn't have the christmas decorations up until the day we left which was the 1st December.   As most of the shops had their decorations in I would have expected the hotels to have them as well.\n\nconveniently on the 2nd floor there was food and beverages available 24\/7 and free.  Nice touch\n\nFantastic location, Times Square about 5 mins walk as was the Top of the Rock.  Subway was convenient too.  Met the coach for the Woodbury Outlet about 3 blocks down which was very convenient.\n\nUnfortunately when we went up to the Top of the Rock the floor was closed as the weather was bad.  Snow, never mind they still took us up to one of the lower floors and although you could image the view it was a bit disappointing but thats not their fault.\n\nWould I go again, most definately.  What has upset me more than anything is that I have tried to book this hotel for December 2020 and its FULL.  Oh No not fair.  Would most definately have booked again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}
{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1888977,"title":"Overall, a Great Hotel with Huge Potential...but Needs to Step it Up","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-12-31","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"My daughter and I stayed here from the 22nd to the 27th of December and overall we were happy, just a few things that make me question if I will stay here again and not check out other properties more closely in the area.\n\n1. The hotel has a 'resort' fee of $25 per night, and I am still not sure what for? Sure, the breakfast is included and so is the wine and cheese and desserts - more on that below - but it doesn't feel included when you have to pay an additional fee per night - it feels we are paying for it. I don't know what else the money is used for since it's not a resort. Even the water in the room was 8 bucks...maybe they could include some water?\n\n2. Wine and Cheese\/Desserts and Breakfast: It was nice coming home after a really long day to wine and cheese. However, the cheese cubes, hummus, crackers, and possibly the wine were definitely from Costco or a club like this...although nice to have the snack before a later dinner, it never felt like it was really worth the fee we paid per night. The Desserts were a sham...there were never enough and of what was offered, was clearly from a big box place like Costco. I recognized the red velvet cupcakes and the key lime pie bites immediately. And they always put out a carafe of hot apple cider or hot chocolate, but really? It was so small that maybe 2 people could pour a drink from it. If you are going to offer a dessert hour, offer it so there is enough for everyone in your hotel and offer it for more than 1 hour? I mean everytime we got back from our day everything was gone. And breakfast...I loved that avocado toast was offered - I don't remember the last time avocado anything was offered with a free breakfast. They offer hard boiled eggs so if you are looking for an eggs and bacon breakfast, you won't find it here. They do offer french toast for the kiddos, but sugar free syrup? Nope. They offer a nice mixed fruit and oatmeal, but again never enough...and they were slow to bring out refreshed food. Also - offering the breakfast only until 10am? I have never had a breakfast included that was offered only until 10am - 10:30 is the standard..so again we felt cheated because we always seemed to wake up too late and couldn't partake.But, if you can wake up early enough and partake it was all we needed and seemed fresh and again, avocado toast is a rarity on free breakfast deals - but come on...let's offer it until 1030am at least.\n\n3. Room: If anyone says the room was tight, sorry but you are in NYC - ALL rooms are tight. But honestly it was a much bigger room than I expected for NYC. It was clean and fairly updated. There was a Keurig machine and I liked that with a fridge in case you have medicine or leftovers, and although I didn't hear anything outside, the walls are VERY thin here...so I heard everything next door and you will have to keep your TV down because you can hear that too, so just note that if you need a room where you can make noise for whatever reason, don't stay here.\n\nOther than that, the bed was very comfortable, but the pillows need an urgent update, they are small, lumpy and not at all at the level that the hotel professes it to be. I did like the HVAC, it was quiet and the rooms were very stuffy so even it was only 40 degrees on the 8th floor it was HOT, so we had the aircon on! But it worked well and wasn't that loud. But the bathroom...although a nice size for a NYC hotel, and very nicely appointed with L'Occitane products (rare again for most hotels in this category)...they MUST update their shower heads pronto...ours was old, too high, didn't let out much water and we had an issue trying to maneuver the hand held so the water didn't leak out. And for those of us who hate handhelds, it was annoying...and the tubs need to be resurfaced too, ours was really old and looked dirty even it was just age. And although the cleaning staff kept the rooms really clean, we used lots of extra towels and rather than learning from this they never left extra towels and I had to consistently ask - not sure why? If you see day after day we are using extra towels why not leave clean ones? The housekeeper we talked to was very nice and the room always felt very clean, but just leave more towels.\n\n4. Staff: Very friendly all the time and very helpful. There is a young bellboy who works there, maybe Turkish? He gave us some great recommendations and was always very accommodating, as was the front desk staff. I never had an issue with any of the staff, they were all very good and I was impressed that it seemed to be the manager of the hotel who was at the wine and cheese hour pouring wine...\n\n5. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION - you know what they say, location is everything and if it wasn't for the things I have mentioned I would have given it an EXCELLENT rating as the location was absolutely PERFECT for Times Square, Broadway shows, getting to the subway...I could not have chosen a hotel in a better location i don't think...there was even a CVS on the corner where we got our water and other incidentals needed. \n\nOverall I would stay here again if I got a great rate.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We picked the Pearl for its location and in part based on its reviews here.  We weren\u2019t impressed and would rather have spent more for two rooms in a nicer hotel. Here are the good and bad points. \n\nFirst the good:\n\n- The bellman was very friendly and helpful\n\n- It\u2019s location is very good if you are staying to see a Broadway show. We were within a five minute walk. \n\n- The room had a refrigerator and microwave which some might like though we did not use them. \n\n- Street noise even in this area was minimal. We were on the 6th floor and the window soundproofing must be very good. \n\nThen the not so good:\n\n- The room wasn\u2019t ready until 4 pm. When we arrived they took our number and said they would call when it was ready.  The front desk never called. \n\n- The beds are small and the room is cramped.  The sofa bed is a love seat that folds out. \n\n- You could distinctly hear the voices of your neighbors in rooms next door. \n\n- The bathroom did not function well.  The shower floor in our room was at such an angle that the water didn\u2019t drain properly. \n\n- In all it just was not a nice experience. The hotel didn\u2019t at all live up to its ratings here and was not a good value for money. The hotel was not as bad as, say, the Marriott Marquis but not nearly as nice as many other options in the area. We would have much rather spent more and stayed in cleaner and more comfortable room than we had. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Some of the staff very relaxed, smiley and efficient, some not so pleasant..without being unpleasant however. I am surprised that for a 7 day stay they put us next to the elevator, which we heard start up every morning around 6am. I didn't even think about changing rooms till after about 2 nights...by then we were all settled in and I really didn't want to start complaining.  I didn't find really comphy the blanket style quilt  nor the  pillows on the bed. The kitchette with coffee maker and coffee was very helpful but poorly designed.  The frig didn't quite fit in the space.  Shame I had to go to the bar on the second floor to get non dairy milk. A grocery was just a few yards away...for my fresh milk. The restaurant was under renovation. There were lots little lights that were always on...like the microwave.  Everything was fine and clean.

I\u2019d booked the Deluxe Queen Suite for the first night and the Deluxe King Suite for the rest of the stay.

Best of all \u2013 no extra charge.\n\nGreat location, close to Time Square, close to Subway stations, close to loads of restaurants.

Azi and the team of reception staff  were extremely good and helpful with tips for restaurants and advice about getting about NY. The hotel is also very calm with a lounge area on the first floor which always has some fruit and tea and coffee. Between 5 and 6 every night there is also wine and snacks, though since a couple of months ago the hotel now charges an additional facility fee of 25 dollars a night.

They don't have their own restaurant but apparently will have soon, but Lillie's Victorian next door is a very beautifully-decorated English restaurant and the grocery store is a quick enough trip you don't miss not having room service.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My son made the reservation so his family and my husband and I could enjoy a fun two days in NYC just before the Christmas holiday. I was skeptical about the hotel as I had never heard about it. However, although small, it provided a large welcome with courteous and intimate service by going above and beyond any level of service we have ever encountered. The rooms were immaculate, large, modern and very comfortable. There was even a TV in the bathroom!  Robes and slippers were provided as well as high quality toiletries. The breakfast was continental but very well presented and the items were delicious. We attended the wine and cheese buffet and it was lovely! We checked in Friday afternoon and checked out on Saturday morning but planned a day exploring the city's sights on Saturday. My husband and I were exhausted from all the walking so we returned to the hotel and they graciously allowed us to wait for our family in the buffet area. Remember we had already checked out! Parking by valet was easy and reasonably priced. I will definitely return to this hotel and urge any skeptics to disregard their skepticism and book at the Pearl Hotel!

It is so near to Times Square, yet not smack in the middle of it so that you are spared the crowds and noise and just everything. It was just about 2 blocks off Times Square, which is well within walking distance, and yet it was so much quieter that you wouldn't feel oppressed. If you're a theater fan, then it is also right smack in between Chicago and Book of Mormon's theaters. Two subway stations, 50 St and 49 St surround the Hotel. The best thing is these two stations are on different lines, so we would just choose the station we have to use for the day based on where we were going. Convenience also surround the Hotel, with plenty of restaurants, diners, drug stores and fast food. \n\nThe rooms were of a very good size, and I dare say, much bigger than what I'd expected from a NYC hotel. We actually had more than enough space to put our luggage and walk around. Especially loved the separate sink\/coffee making machine area, which made things very convenient as we didn't have to go to the bathroom every time we needed to make a drink. We got upgraded during our stay which we were grateful for. The small number of rooms (about 8) per floor also ensured maximum privacy. Also enjoyed the free flow snacks and water provided by the Hotel at the lobby. It is a very small gesture but very much appreciated.\n\nThere was free breakfast on the Hotel's 2nd floor as well, but I thought the variety of food left much to be desired. There was no hot food at all, and it was just pastries and cereal with drinks. While I understand the food was likely just purchased daily instead of having a chef prepare them, I would have appreciated at least some variety re the food options. Instead, the types of pastries and cereal remained the same everyday, and I was there for quite a number of days. \n\nStaff were very friendly, but there was one or two at the reception who were less helpful than the rest. This was a little minus for me.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We traveled with an 11 and 13 year old, my husband and myself. My MIL had another rooms, so we got to see 2 rooms. The location is FANTASTIC. In the middle of a somewhat quieter block of the theater district, but an EASY walk to Time Square, Rockefeller Center, and many Major show theaters (Wicked, Lion King, Hamilton, Radio City...) and so much more! We easily walked most places and even to the Empire State Bldg and most of Central Park\/Natural History... although we did get a car back from those two locations. \nThe staff at the hotel was very helpful. There was a small fitness room, and a business center where we were able to check in for our flights and print boarding passes. The breakfast that is included was the same everyday, but had options ranging from pastry, toast, bagels, to hard cooked eggs, fruit and cereal. Both coffee and tea as well as juice, yogurt and granola. There isn't a lot of seating for breakfast, but we were able to manage and it was so nice to be able to start our day without looking for a restaurant every time. The rooms are actually pretty spacious for NYC, the bathrooms are wonderful - rainfall shower (that is completely frosted for privacy if another person needs to be getting ready while someone is showering- a nice to have feature when 4 are trying to get ready in one room), l'occitane products, fluffy clean towels. There was a single cup coffee maker, a bar sized sink, a micro and mini fridge - even some storage cabinets that suited us nicely. We shopped for wine, bear, snacks and fruit\/veggies to help make eating in NYC a little easier and more affordable. They even provide a few ceramic plates for microwaving - and paper coffee cups with lids for on the go! I highly recommend this hotel!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I'm so glad they were because The Pearl was a great choice! \n\nThe service was great, the reception staff and doormen were always smiling and ready to help you out. It's not a massive chain hotel like the others in the area so they get to know you pretty quickly which is nice! They also arranged a car to take me back to JFK on the sunday morning as cabs at that time would have been harder to come across. I'd definitely recommend taking advantage of that- cost the same as the cab journey would have but in a much nicer car!\n\nThe room was great, plenty of space and cleaned well every day. The amenities in the bathroom were also excellent. The shower was AMAZING- super powerful. \n\nLocation wise its ideal, only a 5-10min walk from Central Park, surrounded by theatres and restuarants and although right by times square, it's not in the middle of it so you don't have to fight through the crowds to get in and out. Empire State\/Macys etc is about a 15-20min walk and so is the Port Authority bus terminal if you're taking any day trips out. Also plenty of Subway stations around\n\nThe only 2 minor annoying things for me was the air con in the room was quite loud and switched on and off- I'm a heavy sleeper and it still woke me up a couple of times. Also (as far as I'm aware when I was there) there wasn't a bar, so I couldn't go down and grab a drink.

I believe the Pearl specializes in little extras the other hotels do not: We were celebrating a special occasion, the staff left wine and a card. One of our flights was delayed the manager contacted the airport driver and let him know. ( This service is arranged by the hotel for a fee) The staff was very attentive to any needs . We had a plugged sink-they sent somebody right up.  The room was very spacious my only complaint was we faced the theater across the street and the noise from the street could be very loud on occasion-bring ear plugs if you are noise sensitive. We were on the sixth floor I do not know if it was less an issue the higher you were. There is a Continental breakfast and a wine & cheese hour . The breakfast to me is a wallet saver.  There were plenty choices: bread, pastries, bagels, yogurt, fresh fruit, dry cereal, hard boiled eggs- you would not go hungry.  We only were at the hotel once to  utilize the wine and cheese hour but that too was lovely and a little something extra.  The towels were big and thick, the toiletries were by Octaine (?), there were robes and slippers and even an umbrella. Every night as we rolled in from the days adventures we were greeted with warmth and genuine-how was your day smiles . The beds were a bit noisy-very comfortable, but don't expect to sneak to the bathroom in the middle of the night with out waking your bed mate.  We enjoyed our stay very much and would book this hotel again as it is within walking distance to the theater action, central park, Carnegie hall, The Lincoln center, many great restaurants, Rockefeller center and the subway !","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I did, however, sleep here one night, and availed myself of the free wine-and-cheese evening a couple of times.  Suffice it to stay that if you want to be in the Times Square\/Broadway area and can afford this hotel, I couldn't recommend it more highly.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, and even the ones at the back (or at least the one I saw) avoid the \"looking-out-over-an-air-shaft\" problem that plagues so many Midtown hotels.  The aforementioned nightly wine-and-cheese event is quaint and pleasant, and the staff are exceedingly amenable.\n\nIn terms of the area, I will assume for the purposes of this review that you know what you are getting into.  This is, as I have mentioned in other reviews, my least favorite part of NYC, but if you are in town to see shows there is no better location, and you are also close to a range of great places to eat, from fine dining to the magnificent Times Square Diner, which is just around the corner.  See my recent review of Toloache for great Mexican, and of Da Marino for perfectly passable Italian, which are also just there.  And if you are on a budget, there is a grocery store (a Food Emporium) on the corner, and plenty of less expensive eateries.\n\nThe rooms are spacious and lovely, the amenities are notable (I don't know what their deal is with Lay's potato chips, but the fact that they are available for free 24\/7 is potentially dangerous), and the staff is welcoming.  If you have to stay in Times Square, stay here.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

A half block from Broadway & Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional.  The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted.  Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it!  I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day.  The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in!  The whole staff was very nice and  I would definitely stay there again.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our room overlooked the street and although you can hear city noises they don\u2019t intrude at all, great to be so close but peaceful as well. Our room was a good size with an enormous bed which is the most comfortable bed I think I\u2019ve ever slept in, wish I could have sneaked it into my suitcase! The only possible problem with the room was noisy air con but we solved that by making the room a couple of degrees cooler just before we went to bed and then turning it off overnight. In the morning, it was only a degree or two higher than normal which was fine. We arrived during a heatwave and it worked perfectly for us. Great coffee\/tea machine and good toiletries in the bathroom.\nThe continental breakfast was good and it was nice that the tea and coffee was available 24\/7 plus snacks and fruit. A cheese, wine and fruit hour was a nice touch as well.\nThe deduction of a half star is because 3 days out of four we had to phone housekeeping as we didn\u2019t have any shower towels, or only one, or the tea\/coffee capsules hadn\u2019t been replenished or the first morning the fridge wasn\u2019t plugged in. It just seemed slipshod as it let an otherwise great hotel down. \nMy other complaint is the reliance on single use plastic - all the plates, cutlery, cups etc for breakfast were plastic and all went into bins and not sorted for recycling. There are notes in the bathrooms about not washing towels unnecessarily yet they are sending so much plastic to landfill without a second thought.\nOverall an excellent hotel and highly recommended.

The arrangement worked out really well - some privacy but we didn't need to get a separate room, which I didn't really want to do in NYC.\n\nThe room was spacious, with a refrigerator and microwave.  There are free snacks in the lobby and on the second floor 24 hours a day - what a nice feature.  Basic but nice - chips, apples, water.  The free breakfast is not hot but offers cereal, croissants, yogurt, fruit, bagels, juices, coffee and tea.  Sufficient and a nice perk for NYC.\n\nThe location was AMAZING.  Literally less than a minute walk to see Chicago, across the street from another show, and surrounded by the theaters.  And lots of restaurants and stores.  The room was really quiet - you would never know you were in the heart of the theater district.\n\nThe gym is small but has the basics.

Each time we return, I hope that we will still be pleased with the shape of the hotel.  I'm pretty sure this place has great management because the place still looks the same as the day it opened.  Modern, clean spaces that look very new.  \n\nLet's start with the location.  Truth be told, I am so done with Times Square.  Do my best to avoid it actually, and it is only a 30 sec walk down the street.  Funny though, this is a very quiet block and you do not feel as if you are so close to the madness of Times Square.  We love this location because of its proximity to the theater district.  It is so nice to be able to quickly walk home from our shows.  Another bonus is how close it is to the endless great restaurant options along 9th Ave\/Hell's Kitchen.  This hotel is within a 5 minute walk of nearly every single subway line.  So easy to get all over the city from here.\n\nNow, for the staff.  Every single staff member we interacted with was super friendly and helpful.  Their staff seems to be really happy.  Again- must be good management.  And some of the folks have been working there since our first visit years ago.  From the doorman to the front desk staff, to the nice folks who stock the breakfast and wine reception- all very nice people.\n\nOur room was in great shape.  Clean as it could be.  No spots on the furniture or marks on the carpeting.  It truly still looks brand new.  The bathroom experience is a good one by NY hotel standards.  Great L'Occitane toiletries and super soft, thick, cushy towels.  Great shower as well.  There are only 8 rooms on each Floor, making this a nice, quiet hotel.  About the only thing we heard from our room was the occasional ambulance and the whirrr of the elevator which was nearby.  We got 4 good nights' sleep.\nThe included breakfast is such a nice feature.  Great bagels, muffins, toast, cereals, yogurt, fresh cut fruit, juices and good coffee- all served in a nice room overlooking the \"Book Of Mormon\" theater, which is directly across the street from the hotel.\n\n From 4-5 they offer a complimentary wine and cheese hour which is just a great touch if you happen to be back at the hotel during this time frame.  Good wines and some nice snacks.  Another thing we love about the hotel is the water dispenser and free snacks in the lobby.  The water has orange slices floating in it and is delicious!  So nice not to have to buy bottled water for the room.  The bags of chips are also appreciated.\nWe are so glad that we found this boutique hotel.  It is an oasis of calm in the midst of a busy city.  See ya next year \"The Pearl!\"","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If you want to avoid taxis, Ubers, and the Subway, stay here to see everything in Midtown.  One block off Broadway, three blocks from Times Square, ~four blocks to Rockefeller Plaza, within 1-2 blocks of SO many theaters all of the great restaurants on restaurant row, 5 blocks to 5th Avenue shopping, and ~5 blocks to the SW corner of Central Park.  You can seriously explore DAYS of Manhattan without the need for any type of transportation beyond your own legs.  An added bonus for being so close to everything is that you're in the middle of a quiet side street, so you don't get as much street noise as you would staying directly on Broadway.\n\nThe service was unmatched.  Check-in was fast and friendly, and we were given a free upgraded room.  ALL staff were friendly and professional, there's 24 hour security (door man), and when my wife had an unexpected health issue that delayed our return flight, Dan and the front desk staff were understanding, gracious, allowed us to stay the extra nights we needed (in the upgraded room for our original discounted price), and offered to provide assistance in any way needed.

Its a self-service and you can take what you want.  A great range and wide choice.  Every afternoon from 4-5 the hotel serves snacks and wine in the upstairs lobby - a great idea and well supported.  \n\nThe staff were attentive, friendly and helpful, arranging tickets or taxis as needed.  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble.  Our room was serviced every day with coffee and towels replaced regularly.  There is a safe in the room which offers the ability for you to keep your valuables safe without the need to deposit in the hotels deposit boxes.  \n\nWe were on the 6th floor and were very happy that we had requested a quiet room.  The hotel is virtually on Broadway with a theatre directly opposite and another about 100 yards down the road.  On show nights the street was particularly busy and noisy though the rooms are well sound proofed, you cannot keep the noise of sirens out and in particular the loud sounds made by the fire engines.  New York certainly is a city that never sleeps, but you soon get passed the sounds of the city and we found The Pearl hotel to be in a great location for getting all over the city - Fifth Avenue is 2 city blocks away, Central Park a little further and lower manhattan is just a subway ride away.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1888977,"title":"A hidden gem","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-12-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My 16 year old daughter and I JUST got back from a four day, three night stay at the Pearl for our annual trip to the city.  This is the FIRST time we strayed from our normal Marriott hotels, my husband travels a good amount and we are silver reward members.  Not really knowing the smaller hotels and the lesser known chains, I have always been reluctant to stray from the tried and true Marriott.  This time, not because I was unhappy with Marriott, but because I wanted something different, I decided to book into the Pearl (literally the day before our trip)...we were not disappointed, in fact, we were so delighted with the customer service, that it is now our go-to hotel choice.  The delights:  The staff.  Out of habit, when we first got there around 3:00, we dropped off our bags and went down to the restaurant for some light snacks and hot chocolate.  While we were there, the doorman came into the restaurant, noticed we didn't have the 10% discount card that we received at check in (I didn't even see it) and then told us to avoid paying for it and just go the second floor lounge.  (thanks for going the extra step to save us money, we didn't pay for hot drinks at the hotel the rest of the trip...unlike Marriott where we would end up with a pretty hefty room charge bill at the end of the stay).  The breakfast was good.  We're not huge breakfast eaters, so we appreciated having our bagels, yogurt, granola and fruit available for free rather than going to Dunkin to get it.  Again, it adds up.  If you're a big breakfast eater, you won't find this free spead adequate...but when we are in the city, we gotta have our NY bagels.  The room was good.  We were on the 8th floor in a deluxe king room (we shared a bed).   It would have been nice to have a chair other than the desk chair, but we really weren't in the room much.  It was quiet.  Let's be real though, you're in NYC, there's traffic noise in NYC.  We found this location to be much quieter than our usual location closer to Times Square.  Noise from other rooms, and inside the hotel was non-existent.  For the first time, my daughter and I both had a very restful sleep our first night, which never happens.  We credit the incredible comfortable beds.  \nThe bathroom is well appointed.  I appreciated the blow dryer, and the make up mirror.  The shower was a little confusing, but the water pressure was AMAZING.  \n\nHousekeeping:  This was one thing the really delighted me vs. the Marriott.  Our typical schedule has us getting up early, spending several hours outside our room and then coming back for a bit of break around 3.  With the larger hotels, many times we would come back to an unmade room.  For some reason, this bugs me.  When we left, we put out the \"please make up room\" sign on the door, and every time, without fail, our room was immaculate when we came back.  Ahhh.  Loved it.  \n\nAs far as the decor of the hotel, it's not terribly fancy, but it is on par with the chain hotels we are used to.  It was very comfortable in design.  For me, the staff at this place is what puts it over the top.  Seriously.  Every single staff member went out of their way to make us feel welcome and they made us feel like they were happy we were there.  On our first night, after dinner, we came home early after a long day of travel.  Before retiring to our room, we decided to get some tea at the lounge.  We took seats at the window to watch the crowds let out at Book of Mormon across the street.  We were tired, and a bit out of it, and when I looked down to the door below, there was our friendly doorman jumping up and down and waving to us...giving us a good laugh.  I truly appreciate this hotels willingness to allow their staff to be a bit \"goofy\" to make the experience more fun.  While every team member was impeccably professional, I so enjoyed this experience as well as another door man blowing a whistle and pretending to direct foot traffic outside of the hotel.  \n\nIn any city, this place would be a fun place to stay...in New York, this is a hidden gem.  We loved it, and we will most certainly be back again.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We booked just a few days before travel, and i knew I wanted to be in this area - close to the dining in Hell's Kitchen - accessible to Broadway - and not too far from the rest of Midtown. This place is in a perfect location: One block from Broadway, across the street from the Eugene O'Neil Theater, a block and a half to the Metro.  The lobby is small, but the staff is delightful - friendly and always available. Citrus infused water and snacks were constantly available. The included breakfast is adequate, okay nice, okay nicer that I'm not paying an additional $15.95 per person for coffee and danish! (This breakfast is more than that, but you've been to places that charge up to $20 a person for bad pastries and juice. This is perfect: enough to start your day, and everything was fresh.  We never were in the property during the afternoon \"wine and cheese\" reception.  Our room was a deluxe King (501), and directly overlooked the marquis for Book of Mormon. I was concerned about street noise at this level, but never once heard any traffic or disturbances. Nor did we hear any sounds from inside the hotel - it is soundproofed well.  The room was appointed very well, clean (my wife is a neat freak on hotels), and the bath was lovely. My one special request was very quickly fulfilled.  I have found that the nicest of properties can be spoiled by a poor staff. The Pearl is a gem with a very well trained team of folks. We will be back.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Pros: It has a fantastic location in the theater district, right in the heart of things. Check in was quick and easy.  The bedroom was clean and comfortable, the bathroom roomy for New York and up-to-date. L'Occitaine products are nice.  The blackout curtains are great for blocking early morning light. Wi-fi was included, and the room had a mini fridge, a microwave, and a Keurig coffee maker. They let us check out a little late, which we appreciated. Cons: The thermostat was not turned on in our room when we arrived, which we didn't realize until the middle of the night when we were freezing, but it worked fine after that. We were on the 14th floor but the street noise was terrible. This surprised me, as other reviewers tout the quiet of the rooms, which is a big reason I chose the hotel. But I found it hard to sleep with the Times Square street noise coming through the window. The 2nd floor cafe area is bland and small - I have stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses with more character. The included continental breakfast is pretty much all carbs, with some fruit and limited yogurt selection. Again, better at Holiday Inn Express or Hilton Garden Inn. The coffee\/hot water comes from a push-button machine. The entry to the hotel is similarly spare, even at holiday season. It just didn't have the feel of an upscale boutique hotel, which is what I was hoping for.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was however offered an upgrade option for $40 extra; I had no choice since I had to settle in and get on a conference call ASAP. In fact, I feel like they were just interested in selling me an upgrade. The view from the balcony of the [upgraded] room was an eye-sore and I immediately asked to change rooms. Except that this room had NO balcony (which is what I had asked and paid for), only difference was that it had a king bed -- there was no view from here since it was also at the back of the building overlooking the roof of other buildings and another high rise building. By the way, I arrived early at a previous hotel, the night before (Library hotel) and was offered free upgrade with no hassles, granted I got there at 8.30 am: I probably should have stayed there but I had already pre booked my hotels without the option to cancel.\nWorse still, the WiFi at this hotel sucks -- good luck trying to get on a conference meeting or Facetime with family while you're \"home away from home\". I spent 30 minutes of valuable time working with their tech support over the phone: turns out, the hotel pays for lower-tier WiFi service. Long story short the tech guy had to make some tweaks to get me on a \"fast lane\" which ended up being an abysmal 2.5Mbps download speed (my phone is MUCH faster than that): tech support mentions this is the expected average speed one can expect for the internet service level at this hotel. No kidding, perform a speed test after you check-in. I can understand if this is during peak hours (like at night), but this was at noon on a weekday -- when most guests are usually not on premise!\nFor what it's worth, my room was clean and decent; the hotel is located near the theaters, few blocks from Timesquare, subway stations, a glut of restaurants, landmarks and tourists attractions. Price point was also reasonable for what you get in return. However, I'll definitely consider other options the next time I'm in the city but I think I have already settled for where I'll be staying moving forward. Moreover, there are a ton of nice-looking hotels with great reviews around this part of town.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

Did lots of research beforehand and was very pleased that it lived up to all expectations! The Pearl is a smallish boutique-type hotel in the heart of midtown, with 14 floors and about 8 or 9 rooms on each floor. The staff is lovely and welcoming and went above and beyond to make our stay excellent.\n\nWe stayed in a queen with shower on the 11th floor for the first 4 nights, then switched to a queen with soaking tub (on our request) on the 14th floor for our last night. The rooms were very similar in terms of decor, amenities, and layout, although the first one had a more spacious closet and bathroom.\n\nThe pros: Very clean, nicely decorated rooms that included the usual amenities like bathrobes and slippers as well as bar fridge, microwave, and Keurig. L'Occitane products in bathroom (and a TV in the bathroom, although we never used it)! Great sheets, black out curtains, very effective air conditioning, and a decent view that reminded us we were in NYC. OUTSTANDING staff, from front desk to doormen to housekeeping, all super helpful and friendly. Breakfast and snacks through the day, nothing fancy but still convenient. Nice lounge, which was very handy when we wanted to relax for a bit after check out. Very good location close to Broadway theatres, restaurants, and subway stations.\n\nThe cons: Beds were on the soft side, which wasn't ideal as we prefer a firmer mattress. Only one chair in each of the rooms we were in; not sure if any have two chairs or if we could have gotten another if we asked. Could hear some noise from closing doors in one of our rooms. Also the taller neighboring building meant that it wasn't completely private at night unless we closed the curtains (and closed off the view). Finally, a hot breakfast would have been lovely.\n\nOverall, the positives far outweighed the cons. This is the place we'll happily look to rebook on our next visit to NYC.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":1888977,"title":"great location but a bit inconsistent","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-08-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We booked two rooms at the Pearl Hotel based on the Trip advisor reviews. Up to today, I'm still on the fence as to how to rate the hotel. That's because there are pluses and minuses. \n\nFor example, the complimentary breakfast had uneven reviews. Some reviewers said it was poor but there were others who said it was ok. I would tend to side with the latter. Sure, there were not hot meals at all - no eggs, no sausages or bacon, etc. - but to be fair, there was enough juices, coffee, bagels, sliced breads, pastries, cream cheeses and jellies, hard-boiled eggs, and fruit slices to give anyone enough energy to last till the endow the morning. \n\nService was also uneven. People who were tending the 4:30 to 5:30 cocktail hour  - white and red wine, cheese cuts, cheese biscuits, veggie slices and dips - weren't too friendly. On the second day, the guy in charge started to pack up at 4:55 pm! What?! When I asked if the front desk could give a call to my tour operator to confirm pick -up time the next day, the guy took a look, then gave the booking form back to me and said - don't worry, they'll come tomorrow at 10 am. He never even tried to call. Wow. When I asked the front desk to give my airport transfer a call to confirm, the concierge got it and said - I might as well; Im not doing anything anyway. Having come from hotels in Savannah and Charleston, the difference in how we were bing treated and served was quite glaring. Maybe it was just a NYC culture thing, I'm not sure. The doormen weren't any different. When we arrived, there was no problem in keeping the luggage in storage while we waited for the check in time. But nearing departure, one doorman insisted that the cheapest van transfer I could get to JFK was $160. He was surprised - and disbelieving - when I told him the guy who brought me to the hotel offered $115. Despite a very early booking, they weren't able to give us adjoining rooms, not even two rooms on the same floor. \n\nThe lobby is smallish but functional with their lounge area. The mezzanine which is where we have breakfast had enough seats to accommodate guests. They were unstinting with their plastic plates, drinking glasses, napkins, and plastic cutlery. The two elevators were sufficient for the 80+ rooms. \n\nHousekeeping was unobtrusive. There was a coffee maker, ref and microwave in the room. the headboard mounted on the wall was padded, a nice touch. I did had a big issue with the bed. The cushion was smaller than the wooden bed base so my wife and I kept hitting our shins on the bed base corners. That needs serious redesign. And on the writing desk, you tend to expect a mirror but they had a picture frame instead. TV was on the small side. there was another TV in the T&B but I couldn't figure it out - it had only a handful of channels unlike the main one. \n\nBut making up for most of the faults is the hotel's location - it's on 49th between Broadway and 8th. We had booked two different plays and both were within 2-3 blocks of the hotel. We were literally a few hundred meters away from the exciting Times Square.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I think it would be better if they didn't have breakfast rather than put all that plastic into the garbage every day. It was contradictory because in the room, they had a card saying they were devoted to protecting the environment in regards to the washing of sheets and towels. One other thing, if you are scent sensitive, I would ask them to not spray in your room before you arrive. Otherwise, it was all very good and everyone was really nice.

Unfortunately we did not receive a call so it was lucky my daughter had set an alarm on her phone as a back up. I forgot to mention there was also a free wine and cheese hour ever day from 4-5 and crisps, fruit and drinks available all day. The breakfast was basic but adequate. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The restaurant next door is a nice place to grab a cocktail or have dinner at the bar.  You're right across the street from \"Book of Mormon\" so the restaurant will get busy before the show.  Rooms are great.  Big for NY in my opinion.  If a gym is important to you, this hotel will fall short.  Its very small.  One Elliptical, One rowing machine and one treadmill.

I have no complaints with the room, bathroom or the cordiality of the staff.  \nI did not like the breakfast and I am not quite sure why.  The dark brown plastic plates and cutlery which one throws out after use were certainly not appealing.  The peeled boiled eggs were rubbery,  Some of the pastries appeared not to be fresh.  Each day, the guy in charge of breakfast abruptly removed everything at 10 am sharp, which was a bit disconcerting.  \nWe went once to the 4 pm wine and cheese session.  The wine was served in plastic wine cups by a member of staff whose sole function was to pour out the wine and not make small talk.  The cheese was tasteless.  My advice to management would be to scrap this session, if they cannot afford to serve the wine in proper wine glasses (I realize that there is a cost involved in washing the glasses) or to serve better quality cheese.    \nDespite all the plastic, which appears to be a cost saving measure and detracts from the quality of the hotel, the hotel employs people to open the front door when someone passes.  I have always found this to be pretentious and unnecessary as is the practice of a porter bringing ones bags to the room;  these measures are fine in a posh hotel frequented by people who like that sort of thing.

The location on 49th is perfect: close to all the action, yet quiet and peaceful as can be.  The free wifi, the free breakfast (fresh fruit, cereals, rolls and pastries, etc. is more than adequate), the wine in the afternoon, plus a decent sized hotel room - don't think there are many hotels that can come close for the price.  However, what makes The Pearl most special are the staff.  Nicer hotel employees do not exist (especially in NYC).  We adored all of them.  Don't want to mention too many names because we'll forget some, but have to throw a bouquet to Christian at the front desk and William at the front door.  We only stayed three nights this time, but already miss those guys.  Do yourself a favor and stay at The Pearl.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are spacious, the front desk and maids are all very gracious and helpful, everything is clean - and the location has even been improved by virtue of better restaurants opening nearby. A great place to stay - quiet and centrally located to all Broadway shows. A boutique hotel with many foreign visitors - I highly recommend it!","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

So the story goes, my husband and I stayed at the Fabulous Pearl Hotel in January 2016 for our honeymoon. Whilst there, we experienced the horrendous Nor'easter winters storm that brought New York to a standstill. Although a winter storm sounds romantic and exciting, believe me it wasn't. It was very stressful trying to organise getting home to the UK when all in and outbound flights are cancelled. Nevertheless the staff at the Pearl were SO helpful and accommodating. They contacted Expedia for us. They extended our stay in our upgraded King size room for a further 2 nights. The telephone in the room has a list of FREE phone numbers to all the airlines. This was most helpful as we spent around 11 hours on hold to United airlines trying to get a flight home.  So thank you for this fantastic facility. It would have cost a fortune to pay for those urgent calls if they had charged us for them...As well as the fantastic staff, lovely rooms with great facilities :- tea & coffee making machine, microwave, fridge, kitchen unit with sink and lovely bathroom this hotel far surpassed our expectations of an American hotel. Included in the room rate is breakfast. There is a lounge on the 4th floor? where you help yourself to hot beverages, fruit juice, yogurt,freshly baked bagels, muffins and bread as well as cereals and fruit. What a good morning kickstart. Bed and free breakfast is rare in USA usually just room only.\nThe staff here are superb. I genuinely couldn't fault them. They go above and beyond to help with anything they can. The management were great and all staff very friendly, and managed to keep our spirits up and have a laugh with us when we were stressing out about the weather and cancelled flights .\nThe location of this hotel is spot on.\nI could not have asked for anything or anywhere better to stay, especially during that dreadful weather phenomenon. Thank you to the Pearl. So highly recommended!We will be back a,s,a,p. ","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My room was close to the elevator but did not hear any noise coming from the hallway.  \nThere is a small Grill restaurant attached to the hotel where you can eat and have a drink.  I had a small appetizer and a drink prior to the show and that was nice.\nGood:  Close to shopping,  I liked being close to Broadway, 5th avenue and theatre district.  The Pearl Hotel is just across from the Theater Eugene O'Neill, where The Book of Mormon was playing. I had a free evening and enjoyed a first class seat for a third of the price at the last minute purchase.  I a very nice dinner at Oceans which is about 4 blocks away. If you like seafood, this is a huge restaurant with white tablecloth, very good seafood and nice servers.  The Pearl includes a small breakfast on the second floor, croissant, pastries, eggs predone, toast your own bagels and bread, coffee, juice, milk etc.  It's ok.  In the afternoon, in the same area, they have cheese, fruits, chips, snacks & wine.  They offer apples and chips in the lobby. Bed was comfortable. There's a small microwave and a bar fridge in the room. Nothing in the bar fridge.  \n\nWhen I left, I was offered a driver to take me to the airport, by the bell boy for $50.00 which was probably just a little more than the cost of Uber.

The sheets had not been changed and only noticed at 11 pm when I went to go to bed.

Breakfast is also included - it's nothing spectacular, just a selection of cereals, pastries and bagels etc but makes a difference in an expensive city!\n\nThe room itself was very nice with a big comfortable bed, wi-fi and large screen TV, and unlike some NYC rooms, was actually pretty big.\n\nThe only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because despite the breakfast and wine hour included, it is still pretty expensive, but I recognise that this is New York so everything's expensive!

So convenient to walk in off the street and be in your room in less than 2 minutes.  That's the beauty of a boutique hotel.  No grand lobby to walk through, no huge banks of elevators to wait on.  Only around 15 floors and each floor only has roughly 8 rooms.  This makes for a nice, quiet hotel experience!\nThe bed was super comfy and the sheets were crisp and clean.  The towels were huge, fluffy, and very soft.  Love the L'Occitane toiletries.  They smell wonderful and are of great quality.  Love the Keurig coffee maker in the room.  The blackout curtains are 100% effective.  This room is dark with a capitol D.  Makes for a great night's sleep!\nWe also love the free breakfast, which consists of bagels, yogurt, fresh fruit, and pastries.  Nothing fancy, but good quality items.  The coffee machine in the breakfast area is available all the time and the coffee is excellent!  The manager's reception each afternoon is also very nice with wine, cheese, veggies, snacks, etc....  \nA simple, but much appreciated touch is the water\/snack station in the lobby.  Wonderful to get a glass of \"orange\" water and a bag of chips as you head up to the room.\nAll in all, I can't imagine a better place to stay while in NYC.

We had booked a standard double room but were upgraded to a deluxe queen which was so spacious and the bed really comfy I could have spent all my time there!  I wasn't too sure about the continental breakfast but there was so much choice we managed to fill ourselves up which saw us through until way past lunchtime.  Unfortunately we missed the cheese\/wine due to being out all day but having experienced it on our first visit, it is  worth going.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  This review would have received a five star rating but my only complaint was the size of the bathroom - it was tiny and with a husband who is 6'5\" it was a tight squeeze if both of us wanted to use it.

Once inside the lobby there were two women at the front desk, with only one client in front of us, but the check in process took and exceptionally long time-especially since booked and paid for the hotel online and was a repeat visitor. Once that was completed I turned expecting by now certainly a bellhop would have appeared but again nothing, and we carried our bags to our room. As we had a dinner reservation to make we dropped out bags and returned to the lobby, where I asked the now present but very less than enthusiastic doorman (Ramon) for a taxi.

We were to arrive by Amtrak to Penn Station at 12:35 and we're going to check in early by 1 and have the hotel store our luggage; as normal check in is at 4 pm.  Storing luggage is one of many services they provide for guests of the hotel.  Upon check in, they had our room ready! I was shocked and very pleased; especially with an 8 hr train ride.

Two comfortable beds, lots of pillows, a shower with not only an adjustable water flow, but a wand too, and a television in the bathroom were only some of the features of our room. We had a fridge that was able to store wine and a sink. Each room is equipped with a safe, robes, slippers, ironing board, and hair dryer. Room service is provided by E&E Grill.

A cardio fitness room, free wifi, a cocktail hour at 4 daily for guests, free breakfast with danishes, bagels, fruit, cereal, and yogurt. 24 hr coffee, tea, and hot cocoa on the 2nd floor and snacks in the lobby.  One night, my daughter wanted something to drink and I was already in my pajamas.  I asked the staff if there was anywhere close to get a drink for her and they went to get me apple juice and brought a bucket of ice to our room because it wasn't cold. I was shocked! What service!!!!  Speaking of service...While we didn't have our room cleaned the first day because I left the do not disturb sign on the door, room service called and left is a message. If we needed anything in our room all we had to do was call anytime before 7. I thought that was very considerate as you never know when you'll run out of toilet paper. Back to info on the hotel, the doormen are courteous and always willing to help you get to where you need to be, call a cab to the airport, or help you load the car. The Pearl is centrally located between 8th and Broadway in the heart of the theatre district and all that is Times Square. The hotel is directly across the street from the production The Book of Mormon!  This is honestly the best hotel I've stayed in while in NYC to date!  Great effort to the staff and crew at The Pearl and remember to like my review!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The welcome was efficient, the room well-appointed (don't expect a view, tho!), temperature was good and could adjust it easily, got a sound sleep. There was a microwave and coffee in the room, no minibar.\n\nComplementary breakfast next day was a continental buffet: fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, bagels\/muffins, choice of juices, coffee\/tea.

Here are 4 reasons why:\n1. Location - Only blocks from all Broadway theaters (a few are mere steps away.) Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Central Park are easy, casual strolls from the front door. Walking in NYC is half the fun, and this location encourages it. And if you want to venture further in the City (and you should) subway stations are less than a block away in either direction, while taxis or Ubers are literally swarming the place.\n2. Quality Rooms - if you've ever stayed at a NYC hotel where the room is the size of your closet back home, then you'll appreciate The Pearl. By Manhattan standards, the standard room is generous in size, clean, comfortable and well maintained.\n3. Staff and Service - No waiting in line to check in at this boutique hotel! We had our key within a minute, and the front desk staff was always friendly and attentive. Our housekeeper greeting us in the hall every day with a smile, and the doormen were down to earth and friendly. Although we didn't take much advantage of it, a continental breakfast and an afternoon wine and cheese hour is included in the room rate.\n4. Price - Staying in a quality hotel at a prime Manhattan location is never going to feel like a bargain if you're the type who always compares rates to what you once paid for a motel room along the interstate in Iowa. Consider the context, people! Sometimes, you really do get what you pay for, and if you can book The Pearl for under $300 a night, you should. Rooms at nearby \"name hotels\" go for much more, and you compromise little and gain much by choosing The Pearl.\n\nWe will return to this terrific find. It's attributes made our New York trip memorable.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our bags were delivered within 5 minutes of arrival to he room. The room we had (Executive King) was perfect in size and decor. The concierge was helpful with directions and dining recommendations. We were so impressed with everyone we interacted with. So, suffice it to say, the five star reviews are 100% accurate. The location, the decor, the wonderful staff, the cleanliness, the breakfast, the wine and cheese hour, the water and fruit available throughout the day, the hotel restaurant (EE Grill), the well-appointed rooms....everything was excellent.

It's situated directly across the street from the theater now showing The Book of Mormons (which we had already seen in SF), but just far away from the busy-ness\/lights\/noise of Times Square.  Our room was listed as a 'Deluxe Double', and compared to the previous hotel's room, this room was significantly larger.  The bathroom was very well kept, and even had toiletries from L'Occitane (and a TV in front of the 'seat').  The staff was super friendly, and check-in was very pleasant.  We were well early of the usual check-in time, but they had our room ready to roll into even before lunch!  Over the course of the next 6 nights, we got have breakfast down in their lounge (while it was included with the hotel fee, it was a basic American Continental breakfast).

Although telling visitors that walk to Radio City Music Hall is only a couple of blocks when it has snowed and pouring out, was bad advice. It is much more than a couple of blocks.  Went to suite. First glance nice with the 2 rooms, amazing bathroom and small kitchenette with Keurig\/Microwave\/Refrigerator. Only temp control in \"parlor\" where queen couch located thus rooms either cold or hot. Hotel knew we had 4 people but had to call at 2AM to get couch made up. One bottle of water on counter which was never replaced. 4 keurig coffee with only one package of sugar\/powdered creamer. There were chips\/fruit snacks in \"breakfast room\" along with a coffee\/hot water\/decaf machine and supplies including tea and hot chocolate. Half and half available but type that doesn't require refrigeration. Jug of water with small cups.  Continental breakfast was disappointing. Cereal, bagels, toast, small pastries, yogurt, juice. Have had better continental breakfast at chain hotels. Only room service for lunch and dinner. Comes from restaurant next to hotel so have to pay at time of delivery. Check out at noon.

We were upgraded to a king size bedroom with a balcony which was absolutely beautiful! The location is perfect! It is right in the middle of Times Square, walking distance to shows, restaurants and shopping. The room is impeccable. I have stayed at the W Hoboken, Gansevoort Park and Yotel and none of them compare to this hotel. The bed was so comfortable, the balcony was huge. There was a microwave in the room as well as a coffee machine. The best part of the room though was the bathroom! It was beautiful and there was a even a television hanging from the bathroom wall. My boyfriend was watching the football game while taking a shower lol. There is a complimentary wine hour which includes delicious wine, fruit, and some snacks. This is great considering Manhattan is very expensive so it was nice to get something for free haha. Serafina is directly across the street, I suggest going there to grab a drink or some food because it is incredible. Because of the great experience I had here, I will be back to The Pearl.

We took three flights to get to New York from the Galapagos Islands overnight and the taxi from JFK took a lot longer than we expected due to a lot of the roads being closed off for the parade. We were extremely tired to say the least. We arrived at 7am, far too early for check in but were hoping the hotel manager could help us out. Although our room was taken he said we could upgrade and then be able to check in early. This is usually $120 but he gave us a discount to $80 so we took up his offer sharpish! He then said they usually charge a half day rate but he could see how in need we were of sleep so he wavered that. The other receptionist was really friendly, asking about where we had come from and how we liked Argentina and the Galapagos.\nWhen we got the the room I was very happy. Best features were the black out curtains, the complimentary tea\/coffee machine, the very large and comfortable bed, l'occitaine toiletries, free wifi. In fact, there wasn't anything I didn't like. Included in the room price was a wine and cheese hour at 5pm and snacks in reception and on level two. Unfortunately we were too tired for wine and cheese but we would most definitely had gone along if not.\nOn check out the next morning the hotel was more than happy to hold our cases whilst we explored the city some more. No extra charge and they got them out for us to repack our shopping and took them back again whilst we went for food and a walk. They didn't appear put out in the slightest. \nI would definitely recommend this hotel in New York.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Lots of room for four people\u2019s toiletries. Kohler faucets. (And Toto toilets in the lobby bathroom.) Lots of nice big soft towels.\n\u2022\tA pantry area (between the beds and the bathroom) which looked nice and elegant (not like those ugly kitchenettes in efficiency hotel rooms). It had an (empty) mini-fridge, microwave, sink, coffee machine, cupboards, etc.  (No freezer: but an ice pack that we jammed into the back of the fridge stayed frozen, more or less.) Perfect for travelling with kids, if you need to wash bottles or keep milk in the room.\n\u2022\tA sort of \"walk-in closet\".  Have you ever seen that for a reasonable price in a NY hotel room?? Lots of storage space in this hotel room! \n\u2022\tDesk & chair, huge dresser, ledge for suitcases, full-length standing mirror.\n\u2022\tWe had a double stroller (never had to fold it) and a playpen in the room, and it never felt cramped.  I would have loved a suite, but we had enough space.\n\u2022\tWe could hear doors closing in the hallway, & voices in the halls when people walked to the elevator, but not often. No risk of the usual loud NYC street noise, since we were not facing the street.\n\u2022\tDimmers on all the light switches. A very nice touch! With the lights out and the shades drawn, the room was so dark that it was impossible to guess when morning arrived \u2013 perfect for kids to sleep in. \n\u2022\tThe room was renovated recently to high luxury standards: they obviously put a lot of money into it, and it shows. The whole room and bathroom was crisp and clean, with high-end furnishings, and nothing looks worn out or shabby.    \n\u2022\tFree wifi too. Plus a TV in the room and in the bathroom. \n\u2022\tThis hotel room reminded me of the Encore or Palazzo on the Strip in Las Vegas: that sense of a newly renovated, fully appointed, large, roomy space. It\u2019s so rare to have that feeling in midtown NYC for a mid-range price. \n\u2022\tNote: there are different types of rooms in this hotel, so ask specifically for what you want. If travelling with kids, or if you might be stuck in your room feeling sick, or if you need to spend time working at a desk, this room was great because of its spaciousness. \n\nSERVICE: wow.\n\u2022\tIt was almost like a funny TV show: the housekeepers and bellhops were arriving so quickly that they were tripping over each other in the doorway of our room. \n\u2022\tThe staff member noticed we had a small child, and asked if we wanted \"a crib\". Five minutes later he was back with a playpen and thick mattress and sheet; he set it all up within seconds. (We used a nice big soft hotel towel as a blanket for the baby.)\n\u2022\tThe staff was nice, extremely friendly, and (dare I say) they even looked happy - a very nice change from some hotels where you get dirty looks or creepy stares from the staff. They smiled and laughed and chatted with us in a genuine way. \n\u2022\tYou can bring the breakfast back to your room, or take it with you as a snack during the day. This was great for our kids. Same for the apples and chips in the lobby (I never saw my kids eat so many apples!). We didn\u2019t have to stop for breakfast or snacks during the day. You can also make yourself a Keurig coffee in the room, there are take-away disposable cups with lids in the pantry area of the room.  \n\nLOCATION: \n\u2022\tMidtown\/Times Square, very central.  It's a tourist area, not a quiet residential area, but the hotel itself is quiet and peaceful.\n\u2022\tLots of 24 hour drug stores within a block or two that also sell grocery staples like milk for kids. Lots of inexpensive kid-friendly dining options nearby (and expensive options too of course).\n\u2022\tOur car was whisked away to a garage upon check-in, and returned to us with no problems or delays upon checkout.  \n\nFor us, this hotel stood out from its competition in NYC due to the large room & huge bathroom size, the high-end renovations inside the room, the nice multi-lingual staff, and having wifi\/breakfast\/snacks provided free of charge. (Don\u2019t hesitate because you're wondering why you never heard of this hotel. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of amazing things in NYC that you\u2019ve never heard of!) Just try it, you\u2019ll be happy you did. ","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We strolled back to the hotel from the Empire State Building and it's less than a five minute walk to Rockefeller Centre. \n\nI wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Midtown.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1888977,"title":"Unassuming and Friendly - A Great Hotel in Great Location; Highly Recommended","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-10-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"We used this hotel as the base for our recent 8-day stay exploring New York. At something like 14 floors and maybe 80 rooms this hotel is a tiddler compared to the multi-storey giants that surround it. So even on the top floor you are not going to get the high level views that you might get from the likes of the Crowne Plaza which is just along the street.\n\nHowever, what you get instead is a nice, easy-going, intimate and friendly atmosphere where you never feel like you are just a cog winding its way through the giant corporate hospitality machine. In terms of location you can't get much better - just around the corner from the tourist madness that is Times Square but far enough away to not be right in the middle of the mayhem. There is a subway 2 mins walk away and a supermarket at the end of the block for stocking up on snacks and drinks.\n\nThe front desk was always well-manned with an extremely helpful and knowledgeable concierge service and the complimentary crisps (chips if you are American) and iced water in the lobby are perfect after you have been pounding the miles around NYC in the late summer heat (as we were most days). Our room was a deluxe queen-queen suite which had two very comfortable double queen beds and a separate sitting area with TV, fridge and Microwave; the bathroom was modern, well-fitted. Despite the hotel's central location, our room was always quiet too.\n\nThis is also one of the first hotel rooms I have stayed in where the air-conditioning kept the room at a nice temperature without being intrusively noisy or turning me into a dehydrated husk every night, so bonus points for that.\n\nI think what sets this hotel apart from the crowd however (and the hotel market in NYC is especially crowded) are the extra little touches that they provide - and these make a huge difference to your overall experience.\n\nWhen we were researching this trip this was one of the only hotels we could find that included a breakfast. Last time we stayed in NYC the novelty of paying $20 per head extra or heading out to find a diner early in the morning soon wore off. I have seen a few complaints on here about the nature of the breakfast but I really don't know what people are expecting. We found the selection of pastries, toast, cereals, fruit, yoghurt etc perfect for a quick sustaining bite before we headed out for the day. The quality is great and there is no need to mess about going anywhere else. Yes, it was served on plastic plates but who cares? This is a functional (but enjoyable) no-frills breakfast that you don;t get in many other NYC hotels.\n\nThe room price also included a fast, efficient and consistent wi-fi connection - better in fact than many other paces we have stayed. To put this in context, the Crowne Plaza on the same street wanted to charge us about $30 a day for a package that includes wi-fi and a couple of other things you probably won't use (gym use anyone? I was walking 10 miles a day around the city... who needs a gym?! And if I did, The Pearl has one included anyway).\n\nDuring the time we stayed there was also a complimentary cheese and wine hour in the afternoon and we managed to find the time on a few days to sit and relax with a decent glass of red or white. Again, no frills but a really nice touch.\n\nRoom service was reasonably priced although out of hours it seems to be outsourced to a local deli that delivers. No problem - good quality, fast delivery and decent price. We also found a traditional deli-sandwich shop a couple of blocks down that was excellent too.\n\nFinally, the complimentary toiletries are L'Occitane. My wife LOVES L'Occitane cosmetics and would have stayed here just for that, but it is a great touch that gives an extra luxury feel to your stay.\n\nIn short, this was the perfect hotel for our NYC holiday. Great location, quiet, comfortable, friendly and with lots of nice touches - we would have no hesitation in staying again. It actually felt like good value - and that is saying something for a hotel just off Times Square.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The continental breakfast was included and they kindly provided me with gluten free bread and almond milk on request. Breakfast area runs from 7-10 but gets busy towards the end and shuts promptly. Wasn't a fan of the disposable plastic plates, bowls, cups and cutlery. There is a room service provided by the hotel in core hours but they have a very efficient ordering arrangement with a nearby cafe who can fulfil the same menu outside of the hotel hours and you order from your room in the same way.

I see people whining about the options, but for a free continental breakfast, it was pretty good, and was one way to save some money in New York! It was also nice to have snacks in the foyer. I took a packet of chips and fruit everyday in my bag to have during the day while out and about. I didn't manage to get to the wine and cheese in the evening, as I was too busy exploring New York.\n\nThe really good point was the location. Right in the heart of Broadway (I went and saw The Book of Mormon which was literally across the road) and block away from Times Square, and half a block from the closest subway station. Doesn't get better than that. Was also able to easily walk to 5th avenue and up to Central Park. Despite its location, being just off Times Square meant it was that little bit quieter, so was not disturbed through the night with street noise.\n\nOverall, really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to others coming to New York. If I return to this amazing city, I would hopefully come back to the Pearl Hotel","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

Now if you're looking for a big fancy lobby and tons of restaurants, etc. that's not what you will find here, but of you are looking for a great location, great service, a clean updated room, then this is the place for you. We arrived early, but were allowed to check in. We were given a handicapped accessible room, which was amazing since it was large and had an amazing walk-in shower. Our room didn't have much of a view because we were overlooking a courtyard, but that was a blessing. It was so quiet we both had great nights sleep. Beds were comfy.  I can't say enough about the staff. Everyone was friendly and kind, especially the doorman. When they found out it was my daughter's birthday we were sent a bottle of sparkling cider with champagne glasses filled with chocolates and a calligraphy note with her name wishing her a happy birthday.

The hotel is a smaller hotel in a spot on location, with friendly and helpful staff. Our room was a twin double with a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. There was a TV in the room and another in the generous bathroom which had a large and powerful shower. Beds were very comfortable and the room was spotless, the only negative was the view from the window out to the back, which quickly became a positive when we realised how noisy it was at the front of the hotel ! \nWe had a considerably quieter room because it faced the rear and as we spent no time in the room in daylight,  it didn't bother us at all. \nThe location is superb, a block from the Metro,  5 minutes from Times Square and within a few minutes of loads of Broadway musicals. It is astonishing how near a lot of attractions are with loads within easy walking distance. \nThere have been some negative comments on the breakfast here, but we loved it. Help yourself to whatever you like and as much as you want, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, toast, bagels, egg, pastries,  juice and coffee. If you want a cooked, that is not included, but you are surrounded by all manner of breakfast options at a reasonable price. \nAnd don't waste money booking a transfer to the airport before you leave the UK, for \u20ac70 all inclusive, the hotel offer a private car to JFK, that picks you up from the door.

The availability of certain food (muffins) and beverages (earl grey tea) was hit and miss\n- the noise - yes, it is a noisy hotel, and we were not staying by the lift.

To start, the location is perfect!  You're a 1\/2 block off Broadway Ave with theaters on 2 of 3 sides.  So, short walk to Times Square, hundreds of restaurants, Broadway shows, the Rockefeller Center and even Central Park.  This is a boutique hotel, so there's only about 10-12 rooms per floor, but 14 floors provide plenty of room options.  So, while overall a small boutique hotel, this property is not short on amenities.  Along with the location, the other attraction for us was all the perks and the Pearl delivered.  Just try to find another Times Square hotel with great location, plus free breakfast, free Wi-Fi, fitness center, concierge, door man, valet or self parking next door, free fruit\/water in lobby 24\/7, free wine hour every night, robes, name brand toiletries and the list goes on.  While you pay a decent price to stay here, you do at least get treated well and get something in return.  Although very small, also note that there is a restaurant (steakhouse) right next door that serves lunch\/ dinner and also provides room service to the hotel.  \n\nThe rooms themselves were fairly spacious for a downtown hotel.  The bathrooms were very nicely appointed with dark wood and granite\/  marble.  The beds were comfortable with in-room irons and safe.  Flat screen TVs in the room and bathroom.  The only thing missing was a mini-fridge\/ bar.  I'm very, very particular about cleanness and the room and whole hotel were near spotless.  Very impressive and very clean.  Kudos to the cleaning staff.  I was also impressed at how quiet the room was and the overall hotel.  We slept very peacefully every night.  \n\nLast, but not least, the service was also excellent from the entire staff, from front desk, to in-room services to doorman.

We initially booked a queen room and requested a high floor.  We were placed in room 1401.  Unfortunately the elevator is located right against the room.  We listened to the elevator rise and descend all night long (even with ear plugs in).  We asked for a different room first thing in the morning.  They immediately took care of the situation and upgraded us to a King Suite - room 1204.  They also supplied us with a bottle of champagne and a lovely card as we were celebrating our anniversary.  \n\nThe room and bathroom was very spacious considering this is a NYC hotel.  The hotel is near Times Square and can be a bit noisy.  We recommend ear plugs which are supplied upon request.  The bathroom was a decent size and the shower was amazing! The room had a Keurig which was a nice touch as well.  The hotel provides a bottle of water in the room however they charge $8.00.  I chose to get a bottle of water from the vending machine instead.\n\nThe continental breakfast was just ok.  We were expecting a hot breakfast however they supplied a large variety of bagels, pastries and cereals - and more.  The coffee was good.  Plenty of seating.  We never had an opportunity to attend the happy hour as it was only 4 to 5 p.m.  I am sure it would have been nice.\n\nThe staff was very nice and accommodating.  Upon arrival, (7:00 pm) we asked about local restaurants for a nice steak.  They recommended Gallagher's which was only a few blocks away and made reservations for us immediately.  Anything we needed, they were there to accommodate.  Housekeeping did a fabulous job daily.  They do not supply many towels however if you request additional, they will attend to every need.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable and the location is perfect!

Here you could make tea, coffee, hot chocolate and all kinds of herbal tea. There were also crisps and biscuits available to just take, and apples and fruit flavoured water for the healthier people.

This is also where breakfast is served, which was included in the room, a great selection of pastries, bagels, toast, cereal and fruit - plenty to fill you up and it was never massively busy so there was always somewhere to sit.\n\nThe beds were super comfy, and Hershey's chocolates were left on our pillows each night.

In a quiet way it gets just about everything right.  Vaguely modern and stylish, the Pearl is handsome in a relaxed way, not aggressively cool.  No glitter, no brass, nothing shiny, not much color.  The short halls are agreeably dim.  Terrazzo floors lend dignity to the lobby and elevator.  Amenities include an extra pillow and umbrella in the closet, free snacks in the lobby, and a free bottle of water in the room (not needed, NYC tap water is delicious).  Our room had a microwave and an extra sink by the fridge.  The room was quiet and the a\/c controls were intuitive.  There's no card urging you minimize the hotel's laundry expenses on the pretext of environmental sensitivity.  Our room was relatively spacious--a bit tight by American standards, ample compared to London or Paris.  Hearing foreign languages in the elevator I felt good about America.  Although the Pearl is not a \"luxury\" hotel, what greater luxuries are there than modesty, dignity, discretion, and good taste?  If you like the Pearl you'll probably want to leave the neighborhood at least once for dinner.

Wifi free throughout our stay\nBreakfast served each day was ample, enough to gear you up for a busy day sightseeing and the complimentary wine, crackers, cheese & fruit at 4pm was a nice touch.  This was all served on plastic plates - this did not bother us at all, but did notice some other people leaving reviews did not like this.\nAll staff were very friendly and helpful.  \nWould certainly stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone coming to New York","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

So much to do & see in Midtown. I'd done an itinerary before we went which was a life-saver. Not having to stress about what we were doing & how to get there etc each day enabled us to make the absolute most out of our 4 night stay. \n\nDid all the typical touristy stuff. We bought the New York City Pass & definitely got our money's worth. Would definitely recommend buying it. My personal favourites were \"Top of the Rock\" & watching \"Les Miserables\". Would recommend doing the \"Landmark\" boat trip with Circle Line Cruises & also walking the \"High Line\". So many amazing memories. \n\nOh & comfy shoes are a must!! \n\nIf you're looking for a small, modern, clean, friendly, boutique hotel - I would thoroughly recommend booking the Pearl.

We had to do half-head and half-wand to make it bearable, and the wand sprayed all over the place. \n--Breakfast is about the same as a Hampton Inn (nothing special). \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.

We're accustomed to staying in a chain hotel and setting our expectations fairly low in Midtown Manhattan, but our stay at The Pearl just made us rip up the rule book. \n\nI have gold status with two national brands, but Christian and the rest of the team at the front desk made us feel more welcome and cared for during our visit than anyone at any hotel we've visited over the past year. They remembered our names, anticipated our needs, made sure we had a safe place to store our luggage before our room was ready, and ensured we knew about the complimentary wine\/cheese hour and the continental breakfast.\n\nOur room was modern, comfortable, clean, actually had room to move (a rarity in Midtown), and quiet. There's no extra charge for Wi-Fi that was speedy enough for Netflix during our downtime (another rarity in Midtown). All of this at a rate that was $100 less expensive and significantly more stylish than either of our usual go-to chains. We no longer have to tolerate a shabby hotel for the benefit of walking just a few blocks to a show.

The Pearl is in a great location not far from Times Square and short walk to Central Park. Check in was efficient and friendly, throughout our stay all staff were extremely courteous and welcoming. We had paid a little extra to upgrade our room and were on the 7 th floor. To be honest the room our friends had which was a standard on floor 5 was equally nice and spacious so probably not worth paying the extra. The corridors and rooms are quite dark, whatever we did with the lighting was dim in our room. Generally looked a little worn but no complaints re the size of the room, large king bed, kept very clean and plenty of complementary bathroom products. Breakfast is served on the second floor. Decent range of light breakfast buffet, fruit, yoghurt, cereal and toaster for bagels. Generally busy and \"self service\" plastic plates, cutlery etc. The afternoon drinks\/snacks were disappointing compared to others I have had in NY. Very restricted range of wine and snacks - we didn't really bother after the first day. Out and about we watched the football in Carraghers bar on W 39 St, good atmosphere and decent bar food. Tried Bourbon Street on 46th Street, between 8th and 9th decent food and range of drinks and the Tir Na Nog on w 39th St between 8 and 9 st Decent menu and 80's disco on Friday night. Disappointed by the Rainbow Lounge at the Rockerfeller building, had been here around 10 years ago great cocktail bar with outstanding views particularly if you get in around dusk. Made effort to go but seems they let too many people in there now was very crowded and noisy and didn't have a single drink we asked for. Maybe we just timed it wrong.

The adjacent Bar\/Restaurant , which is accessed via the reception area served excellent food.  On our last day we booked a private transfer car through the Concierge for our return journey to the airport . it cost $70 - about $10 more than a Taxi - and was well worth it . We vacated our room after breakfast and the they stored our luggage free of charge so that we could enjoy a full day out before our night flight home .

The first thing you notice when checking in is the friendliness of the staff, it was always lovely coming home to their welcoming smiles after trekking the city all day (and dealing with tourist loathing New Yorkers, lol). The hotel has a Westin vibe, although maybe not quite as polished. Rooms are a good size and price for New York. The hotel is in an unbeatable location, right on Times Square. There is a million things to do, all the theaters are here, museums, tons of restaurants ranging from high end to $2 pizza slices, loads of shopping. There is a free continental breakfast which is okay. One suggested improvement would be the addition of a couple of waffle makers - most hotels offer them now and there's nothing better for breakfast when you're on vacation. They do free wine and nibbles from 4pm-5pm every day. If you get there early you can sit in one of the armchairs and look down on the street below, it's fascinating to watch the world walk by. Our room (402) faced on to 49th street (which is a fairly quiet street compared to others nearby). There was some minor noise from traffic - we used the supplied earplugs by the hotel and white noise on our phones and slept fine. My parents had a room (909) which faced over the church next door which was quieter. If noise is an issue (eg. if you have kids who can't use earplugs), request a room on a higher floor, not facing 49th street. Another tip, if you're looking for last minute tickets, google \"Last minute New York Theater Tickets\" or similar - you will save money over using the concierge. Overall, a great stay and would definitely return.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There is also a complimentary snack hour in the afternoon with cheese, crackers, dip, carrots etc which was an added bonus. The staff at the front desk and the door were very friendly and helped us with all our enquires. The only downfall was that the breakfast was repetitive and there were no new additions to the buffet during the week stay (this has happened in other hotels we've stayed at in the past). Nevertheless, would love to stay here again!","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Right around the corner from Times Square, a short walk to Rockefeller Center and 5th Ave. The only  recommendation we would make is regarding lighting in the rooms.  Even with the dimmer switch turned up to max it was difficult to get enough lighting for 3 girls to put on make-up. The magnified mirror in the bathroom was a plus, however better lighting near the awesome full length mirror would have been fantastic.  Small detail I know but feedback is always good.

It's certainly nothing to get excited about, but it's worth having around. \n\nA number of prior reviews had mentioned warm welcomes and upgrades at reception.  There certainly was nothing wrong with the check-in experience, but there wasn't anything out of the ordinary either.  Just a standard \"welcome to The Pearl \" and no mention of an upgrade.  We stayed in a deluxe double Thursday - Sunday of the weekend preceding MLK Day 2016, at an average nightly cost of around $350, booked through the hotel's website.\n\nThe heat in our first room wasn't working properly when we checked in.  The front desk said maintenance would fix it, and we left for meetings and then dinner.  When we returned several hours later, it was still 63 degrees in the room.  We were told that maintenance had left for the day, so we were moved to another room, a floor below.  Nothing major; just annoying.\n\nThe heat in the second room worked; however, it made a clicking or popping noise (it sounded like the plastic casing around the vent) in about one second increments every time it turned on.  The noise would continue for several minutes, then slow, and finally stop.  Until the heat kicked back in when it started all over.  Needless to say, those three nights were not among my most restful.  \n\nOtherwise, The Pearl is perfectly acceptable if you need to stay in West Midtown.  The room was a decent size, and the water pressure in the shower was excellent.  The continental breakfast was convenient, if uninspired.  The room was clean.  The price was moderate.\n\nThe Pearl did manage to score on two pet peeves of mine:  first, the bedside clock radio was glued to the nightstand; second, the \"hangers\" in the closet were those ridiculous contraptions that are attached to the rod.  Sorry, but free potato chips in the lobby don't make up for such highway chain motel touches.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We were given an upgrade on our room plus a free bottle of wine to celebrate my 60th Birthday, which was a lovely surprise and a very kind gesture.

Not in my book","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-01-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Location wise this place is excellent. Nest to subway stops and within easy walking distance of Times Square, Hells Kitchen. Reception and check in were warm, friendly and polite. The room, billed as a Queen delux, was just OK. I have found that all hotel rooms I have stayed in in America have one thing in common. They are all small compared to similar rooms elsewhere in the world. The bed was a standard double and comfy enough. There was a fridge, empty of course, which we kept our shop purchased water in. They do supply water but you have to pay for it. I found it quite amazing that there is no complimentary water in what is supposed to be a five star hotel. Coffee machine was good but could only serve one coffee at a time. The creamer was awful - so we got our own milk. As we walked in a full length mirror was leaning against the wall. I thought it must be a temporary measure but no it was screwed in in that position - I have never seen anything like it and cannot begin to understand the reason for it. Bathroom and toilet were fine. There was a TV in the bathroom to but it just flashed a message saying it was not working. \nBreakfast is served on the second floor. Billed as Continental style. I don't know which continent they are referring to. Juices, a hot drinks machine, bread and bagels to toast, cereal, boiled eggs and spreadable cheese. It was crying out for some sliced meats to make it a bit more moist and easy to swallow. Towards the end of our stay we had our breakfast out. We took advantage of the hotels car back to JFK which was 70 dollars. The taxi here was just over 50 with extras and tips and the never ending ads on the screen in the back.  The ride back was extremely comfortably. Well worth the extra money. \nE\/E grill attached is well worth a visit. \nIn summary the location and service make this place worth it. But if they had a better breakfast, supplied water, it would have been excellent.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The only draw back is for those of us living in Europe and have a usual evening flight back and need a late checkout. The Hotel is not flexible like other hotels with regards to checkout time. Needed to check out at 4 PM instead of 12 Noon. Despite the room not being booked for the day of my departure the Hotel took from me $140 for the late checkout. I think that after spending 4 nights in the hotel and with the room not being booked that same night , the hotel took advantage of the situation and could have extended the checkout to 4 PM without charge.

The bathroom was spacious, with a good selection of toiletries, dryer, fluffy towels.  Free wifi on as many devices as necessary was fab too, meant we could stay in touch with family over xmas and we could have chill out time after a day on our feet, my kids were thrilled that they could still use the interest. The Pearl really have thought of everything.\n\nThe hotel staff are fantastic; friendly, helpful, nothing is too much trouble.  Breakfast is fantastic, yes, I've seen complaints re the plastic plates, forks etc, but it really does work, it gives people the flexibility to take-out a coffee or bagel or take food back to bed etc.  There were ample snacks, refreshments throughout the day should you get peckish or need a coffee fix.  Water in the lobby is a great way to ensure guests are kept refreshed as you head out or head back in.....again, fab idea!  Its the little touches here that really do make me want to return and recommend this hotel.\n\nThe hotel is perfectly located; Times Square, Rockafella etc on your doorstep, but a pleasant walk to Central Park, and various other hot spots.  We bought a 4 day Big Bus pass which was great for sightseeing and getting to the places we had on our list of 'must sees'.  The tour guides were fantastic.  Once the pass expired we did a lot of walking, which helped burn off those calories from overindulging.  \n\nI would most definitely return to The Pearl.

I spoke to Joseph at the time and though he wasn't able to give me much information on what he could offer, he simply said that \"we like to surprise our guests for the occasion.\" I was sold at this place just from that statement alone; mind you, i hadn't paid for the reservations yet and i was really just looking around. But Joseph was able to answer a lot of my questions about their hotel without sounding annoyed or rushing me off the phone.\nWhen we got to our hotel we were greeted by Azi and he checked us in. As soon as we gave our information, he was already informed about our anniversary and greeted us on the occasion! Talk about a staff that is well informed! He was happy to inform us that our room had been upgraded to make our anniversary that much more special. I really wasn't expecting much to be honest, at most flowers in the room but a whole suite upgrade was incredible. The rest of our stay was great- the fact that the hotel was walking distance to everything NYC had to offer was a bonus. If you ask me, this was a luxurious hotel for an awesome price!
