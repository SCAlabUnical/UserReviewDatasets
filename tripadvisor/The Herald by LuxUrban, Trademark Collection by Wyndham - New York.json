Friendly staff.  Good size of room.  Really clean.  Bed comfy. No extra charges after paying on booking.com \n\nBe aware :  no usb charging points in room.  If you like up to the minute decor, maybe don\u2019t stay here as the room was a little \u2018worn\u2019\u2026 it didn\u2019t affect my stay, but others may mind more.  The room doesn\u2019t have a lot of natural light, but does have a good range of lamps to give atmosphere.  \n\nThe less good: when I arrived, I was given my room number and went to the room only to find it was already occupied.  I came back to reception and was given a different room.  I imagine this sort of thing happens, but when I came back, I couldn\u2019t get in my new room as apparently a note hadn\u2019t been made the evening before.  Not a huge deal and handled well by the staff, but when you\u2019re tired these things can irk! \n\nThe hot water wasn\u2019t working on my final morning.  Apparently the whole building was affected - a cold shower was invigorating, but not ideal ! \n\nThe deadlock on my door was broken - someone came to try and fix it but it would have needed a whole new door handle.  As a woman travelling along, this was a concern.  I didn\u2019t feel unsafe at any point, but the offer of an alternative room with a working deadlock would have been appreciated.  \n\nOn the whole though, this was a comfortable hotel and a reasonable price for the location and room size.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

First of all, the location is great and very central with a helpful subway station just outside the entrance. The entrance is easiest seen by \u201cMonarch Rooftop Bar\u201d. Other than a sign on the automatic door it is not clear where the hotel is. The lobby area could do with a bit of renovation to be more welcoming on first impressions. It is a small lobby but I\u2019ve seen other hotels with much better with the size available.\n\nThe hallways are behind what you would expect of most hotels in modern times as well as the rooms (we only stayed in 1 ofc) themselves. There was damage to the carpet, a very basic bathroom and very few old storage spaces for a few nights stay. Ultimately though, it was clean and when only sleeping in the room, it is acceptable. There is a gym on the 4th floor which is again just acceptable. I did bear in mind it may have recently changed hands, maybe they will work on and improve the hotel but this wasn\u2019t visible anywhere.\n\nIf you are similar to us and are visiting the city to explore and see what the city has to offer, this hotel is still below the average standard you would want but is acceptable and is generally cheaper per night than others.\n\nIf we were to visit again, we would select a different hotel for a better overall experience in the city.

Reception is run by a couple of girls who really don't care if you are there or not. I was charged 150 us dollars on arrival for purchases on my room. This is impossible as  it has no bar or restaurant or mini bar, so they took my money for the week I was there plus another week after. Reception is tiny, not very welcoming. On departure we were told to pay 2 dollars per suitcase to leave them behind reception. another rip off, no other hotel I've stayed at in New York charges this, think it's just a money earner for the family member doing it.\nRoom, we had a superior double, don't be fooled by the photo, whilst the bed was comfy, the walls had black marks on them from the dusty AC, same for the curtains. Certainly not as light and airy as you see in the photos. Carpet was well worn and should be replaced. Room service was good , extra towels were supplied by the maid when we asked her.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I was about to give up, I found The Herald with a price within my expectations and a good location.\nWell, when I arrived at the hotel I realized that it was MUCH better than I thought. The location is excellent, there is a 5-storey Macys and an H&M on the corner, less than 20m from the hotel there is a metro station that takes you to the most important points of the city, not to mention it is about 10-15min walking from Times Square, which always meant we ended the day by taking a stroll there. The room is spacious, we left our suitcases open every day and didn't even come close to stepping on or bumping into them. IMMENSE bed and wonderful bathroom, hot shower that heats up quickly, as well as an excellent staff. Everyone was very patient and always willing to meet all our requests. We had to pay US$150.00 when we arrived as a deposit, which was immediately refunded at check out.\nAnd the best part, our check out was at 11 am and our flight was at 11:30 pm, they spared no effort to keep our bags so we could enjoy the rest of our day. Well, if today I can say that I had a great trip, a good part is due to the great experience I had with the hotel, I recommend it with my eyes closed to anyone going to New York","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We drove into Manhattan. Here are some details of my experience.\n1.  No sign anywhere for Lux Urban or Wyndham - after searching the street in the chaos of Herald Square, we called the hotel and were told \"There is no sign. We are working on it. It says Monarch over the entry doors\".\n2. Enter the so called lobby for check in. Reception desk in a tiny space packed with suitcases which immediately sparked my suspicions as to the accommodations offered. Our friend booked the room on booking.com and called ahead to add our names to the reservation the day before. It took several attempts for them to find our names. I overheard one of the girls saying \"it's the last room, give it to them\". I questioned that and was told \"we are overbooked and work on a first come, first serve basis\". That was also not my idea of what I would expect a Wyndham hotel policy to be with a room booked and confirmed in advance.\n3. I was given a key to room 403 and when I got off the elevator, the attached photos are what I saw.\n4.  I entered the room and was surprised by the sparse and stark furnishings, minimal bedding, no mirror and no lamps.  Lighting was horrendous. Furnished more like a college dorm or hostel. We were to arrive at the hotel, get dressed for an engagement party nearby and stay at the hotel overnight. The one thing that struck me after seeing what the hallway looked like to make me decide I could not stay there was the smell. The smell of other people's body odor or sweat filled the room.\n5. I returned to the reception desk and told them I was uncomfortable staying there. I was told the room is not refundable after you check in. She said the photos of the rooms are on the website. Yes, but you can't see stink in the photos nor do they show photos of the hall. \nSo we returned to our vehicle, could not attend the party and drove home.

The luggage storage for guests arriving prior to the 3pm check-in time was complimentary but there was no one matching claim checks to luggage when we picked up our bags. The bags were stored in a hallway that was within the sight of the front desk clerk, but there was nothing to stop anyone from taking bags that weren\u2019t theirs. I did not notice anything stolen from my bags, however. The housekeeping staff was confused and thought I was checking out a day earlier than was on my reservation. Even after telling them this, they repeatedly tried to re-enter my room, sometimes without even knocking at all. Be sure to engage the manual lock if you stay here. There is no seating in the lobby of the hotel; it does not really feel like a hotel on the ground floor at all, as it is basically a hallway with a tiny kiosk up against the wall.

There's a 24 hour McDonald's around the corner. We got iced coffees here in the mornings and walked up to Bryant Park with them. Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this hidden gem!!

The bed and pillows were comfortable, the bathroom clean with extra toilet rolls, a hairdryer, and plenty of towels. It looks as though the room has been refitted fairly recently, but not to a very high standard..the cupboard doors, and the desk were all a bit wonky, but this gave us a laugh, rather than irritated us. There was no PowerPoint that we could find for the coffee maker, so we had to set it up in the bathroom. The room was fairly quiet, although New York sirens would cut through any soundproofing\u2026so loud!\nWe had a great three night stay, capped off by Jose, a wonderful concierge, who convinced us to take the subway to the air train instead of a taxi..and thanks to his help, with written instructions,we made it, even with three suitcases..easy when you know where the elevators are.

Throughout our stay, the feature of the hotel that really stood out to me the most was its location. We were able to walk to several attractions such as the Empire State Building (-5 minutes away), Times Square (~10 minutes away) and Macy's (~3 minutes away). There were also lots of restaurants (American, Mexican, Korean) and many shoping outlets (H&M, Foot Locker, Target, Forever 21) nearby so you can always do last minute shopping if you still have space in your luggage. The nearest subway exit is also right outside the entrance, so the hotel is very accessible. \n\nThe hotel lifts are sometimes shared for the customers for Monarch Garden Rooftop, but despite that the lifts service really quickly.\n\nAlthough the hotel itself was relatively new and did not have much services and facilities for now (e.g. complimentary breakfast, in-hotel laundry, service telephone), the staff did an amazing job with their service to make up for it. They were very accomodating and answered our queries well. \n\nOverall, I thought that the cost of our stay here was a little on the pricey side, but it is still New York city and it is still one of the cheapest accomodations you can purchase for your stay.

We were put in a smaller room, that only slept 3, with the promise that the next day we would be moved to a bigger room. Despite discomfort of squeezing into the small space we agreed, but when we arrived back at the hotel that night to sleep, the real issue became obvious. We were on the 17th floor, right below the rooftop bar that stays open until 4am on weekends! Our beds and room were literally vibrating to the music. The base continued until almost 3.

(And what is incredible is that I faced a similar situation a few weeks ago with Marriott Vienna during a business trip where a room was not ready at 5 p.m!)\nMoreover we have made this reservation on June 2019 for a stay in December 2019 and made a special request for an upper floor and nice view because this travel was a present for the 60th birthday of my mother-in-law who visits NYC for the first time and we wanted something special to please her. Finally, we have been provided with a room at the 5th floor (super noisy) despite the special request made a long time ahead of our visit. We have been told that no other room was available which is a non sense since the reservation has been made months ago.\nAnd finally, only 2 breakfast have been included in the reservation while we are 3 adults.\nWe stayed at the Hilton a few years ago which is literally next door and had been granted a room with nice view on the Empire.

Literally in front is the entry to the subway. Restaurants around. K-town is just around the corner, Penn Station and Empire State Building are just 5 mins away. Macy's is literally in front of you. There's also a great rooftop bar on top called Monarch (this is also sometimes a problem as on weekend nights, so many people are lined up in the entrance - hotel and club have same entrance to elevators). One night they commandeered as well one elevator for the hotel to use for the club as there were way too many people coming in and out.\nAlso loved that there are free water bottles that can be taken anytime at the ground floor, there's a starbucks inside the hotel. Not a complaint but there wasn't any tea provided, only coffee.\nFor the rest:\nGuys at the ground floor were way nicer than the receptionists at well, reception.\nA bunch of admin issues that people didn't seem to want to help with - given the wrong room and we had to change on next night. When I went the next day to change I had to kinda explain the whole thing again. I asked same guy if we could still change the credit card which we originally gave for check in. He said yes and cards aren't charged but on day of check out we woke up to a charged credit card. We could still pay it but upon paying it, we somehow  paid for the room of another person (!!) and only discovered upon inspecting the invoice closely. Tried to use the computer to print stuff and it wasn't printing - came to reception and they were like ok... and eventually said if i wanted help. don't bother. \nIce machine on our floor was just forever broken.\nanyway my point is, there's like 5 hotels in the same street (next street) which has same price point, view, location - would recommend to go there than here.

I booked April 2019 with booking and when we called last June to confirm this booking (they were not replying to my messages via booking which is why we called) they said there said there was no such reservation under my name. If we did not call then we would not have a room to stay in after 20 hrs of travel. \nThe consequence of this non-reservation was that on the first day of our stay we had to stay at a room without the city view (which is what we paid for) and was transferred only on the second day. \nAlso, I don't understand why we always have to ask for toiletries every time we arrive at the end of the day. I was paying for the 3 of us but the toiletries they give is always for one person only. \nAt the end of our stay another issue cropped up. We gave the room keycards with the room number to the front desk and I gave my card for processing of payment then we left and went to our New Jersey hotel. While in the New Jersey hotel, I checked the receipt given by Courtyard and saw that I paid for the wrong room since the receipt indicated a wrong name and a different room number. We called the hotel again and that was the only time they settled the issue accordingly, It was good that the person in the room number I paid for did not check out yet when I called. \nSome people may get bothered every evening with the long line of people going to Monarch rooftop bar since they share the same entrance door though they have a different service elevator.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The people are great, (in that special, brash, New York way).

So let's start: I check in: Kind of okay, but when finished with formalities I get handed two plastic bottles of water..... (suitcase, carry-on, briefcase, now 2 bottles of water. Why? Not a porter in sight, so let's go with this!).  \nApparently the hotel cannot place the water in the room for you, you have to carry it yourself, because if they give it to staff then it gets stolen?? Really?\nMinibar - joke! It's empty and you have to beg to get anything.\n\nI checked into my cupboard, (smaller than the walk-in wardrobe at the last Courtyard I stayed at) to find it was very old.

In this one it was expressly ignored 3 nights out of 3. I even put the 're-use' sign on the towel, and it still got changed and the card put back on the counter - this is like the 'evil empire'!\nThey say: \n1. We \"respect our customers\" and we give our customers an environmental choice;  \n2. At Marriott we care for the environment;\n3. We provide the means to help you, the customer, to help the environment.\nWhat they do is: \n1. We do not respect you or your choices, as we ignore your instructions completely. \n2. They do not care at all and have the worst dose of 'green-wash' in the hotel industry.\n3. The have a management regime and do not care at all about you or the environment.\n\nI love New York for all kinds of reasons, I'll go back, but never to this hotel. \nSorry Staff - you were great and you did your best - but management don't get it at all, and Marriott do not get it at all.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

With regard to those qualities this was a good hotel.  \n\nLocation: The hotel, right across from the iconic Macys and near the Empire State Building, was an easy walk to almost anywhere you want.  We loved the central location with Central Park a little to the North and Soho a little to the south.  The room was small, to be expected.  My criticism is that they didn't utilize the space well.  There were two beds and little floor space but it would have been adequate for a small dresser or even a fold-out suitcase stand. Instead, there was a small armoire with room to hang a few items and 2 small drawers. The TV was large and there was a refrigerator and safe - both helpful.  We're savvy travelers and didn't overpack, but with three of us in the room, we had to place our luggage on the floor and found ourselves tripping over our stuff.  The hotel could learn a lot from the cruise industry that has small space organization really well thought out.  \n\nSafety: The hotel was in a safe neighborhood with a security guard always at the door.  When you enter the hotel you enter a very small lobby where you have to pass by security to enter the elevators which take you up to the rooms.  People can't just walk up off the street and access the hotel.  \n\nCleanliness: The hotel lobby and amenities were clean and well maintained.  Our room appeared clean except that I could see signs of old mold in some parts of the bathroom.  And I could tell that our shower wasn't cleaned the entire week we were there.   \n\nAmbiance: We were on the 7th floor so we weren't bothered by rooftop noise and we did hear the occasional siren\/alarm out the window but that's to be expected.  Our view from the room was of an ugly rooftop next-door but we didn't really choose the hotel for the views. The hotel has a cafe with some breakfast items and starbucks coffee but the first day we went down to order breakfast they were out of all items except the breakfast burrito.  Needless to say we didn't even bother going again.  There are too many great choices in NYC to waste our time there. The hotel staff was really nice and the elevators worked well and without delay.\n\nOverall, this hotel is a good choice for families looking to stay in a clean, well-located, safe hotel with cost in mind.  We stayed on Marriott points but when I searched hotels I did look for budget-friendly ones when I chose this one.  It's not a fancy place...not a boutique hotel...but if you can get a larger room (they weren't available when we were there) it's worth staying here.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I repeat, do NOT use their valet service.  For $65\/day you would think you can get your car back w\/o much hassle.  But I was proven wrong.  At check-in the bell guy told us if we needed our car to call 30 mins ahead since the valet service is offsite at a parking garage.  Sure no problem, I understand, parking is limited, NYC traffic and we\u2019re staying in one of the busiest cities in the world.\n\nThe day we checked out I called the front desk 1 HOUR ahead to get our car ready.  Here is a timeline of events\n\n9am - called front desk letting them we want our car around 10am\n\n10am - went by front desk to let them know we are ready for our car.  Was told \u201cjust a few more minutes\u201d\n\n10:30am - still standing in the lobby waiting for our car.  Overheard a couple of other groups waiting for their cars for over 30 mins.\n\n11am - still standing in the lobby waiting for our car. Complained to bell guy and front desk.  Was told they were backed up today, system glitch, and blah blah blah.\n\n11:30am - A couple of groups ahead of us finally got their cars after over an hour of waiting.  I noticed it is the same valet guy dropping off cars.  WTF \u2026 so I asked the guy where our car is after waiting 2 1\/2 hours at this point.   He pulls out a paper list with 15+ cars.  I see my ticket # as the top of the list but it was a digit off.  Good thing I noticed, god knows how long it would of taken to fix that mistake.  At this point I was beyond pissed off.  I went upstairs to complain some more and my sister followed the valet guy back to the parking garage to RETRIEVE OUR OWN CAR from valet.  When my sister got our car, the valet guy had to nerve to ask for a tip.\n\nI spoked to the hotel manager and complaining that retrieving our own car from valet after 2 1\/2 hours of waiting is not acceptable and what are they going to do to improve the valet situation in the future.  The manager gave some BS rehearsed answer that they are always working with the valet company to make things more efficient.  Oh yea? then why is my complaint similar to another reviewer\u2019s complaint 2 years ago?  I guess since this hotel is central to all the major attractions this hotel is always booked so there\u2019s no need to improve the valet service.\n\n11:45am - Sister pulls up with our car.\n\nThe hotel is nice and staff members in the lobby did everything they could to help us and it is not their fault.  But I blame this bad experience on Marriott management for not working with the valet company to ensure customers don\u2019t spend over an hour waiting for their cars after giving them a heads up and in our case getting our down damn car from valet.  I would given this place 4 or 5 stars but it is getting a 1 star for the horrendous valet experience.  If you stay here and are driving in, try to park else where.

The location was perfect for our 9 day\/8 night stay in New York City.  We had a room on the 15th floor of a 17-story building.  The room was a typical Courtyard room with a king-size bed, very small sofa, safe, refrigerator, microwave, and desk.  What was missing was enough drawer space to hold our clothes for 9 days.  There were only 2 very small drawers in our room.  My husband is a Platinum Elite member and we got an \u201cupgraded\u201d room.  But the upgrade was not to a suite; instead we got a room in the corner with windows on two sides.  So we had great views of the Empire State Building, Macy\u2019s, and Herald Square. But I wouldn\u2019t say that this was really an \u201cupgrade\u201d. The bathroom was really small and it only had one sink.  Also, the lighting in the room was terrible with low wattage light bulbs. Michael and Amin, the bellboys, were very friendly and helpful.  Finally, there\u2019s a rooftop bar called the Montrose on the 17th floor.

You enter on the ground floor, and, if you're arriving in the evening, you'll see a line of partygoers for the rooftop bar that's separate from the hotel. Getting past that is a little chaotic, but once you're in the bank of elevators for the hotel it's quiet and smooth sailing. Check-in was fast and the service here was just fine. We called for more towels and, being a big hotel I figured it would take a while to get them but someone was at our door in less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe location at Herald Square is pretty good if you want to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city. It's NYC, there are going to be piles of trash, scaffolding, honking horns and homeless folks on the streets, so just expect that. That's not the hotel's fault. Being in midtown means you're near a lot of attractions and cool places to eat and hang out. \n\nHowever, the gem here is the rooftop bar, not affiliated with the hotel itself (and has a separate entrance you must go to like everyone else). The view is amazing, you're right next to the Empire State Building, and the crowd is a good mix of people.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I got it as a last-minute thing, not a deal at the time I did it, but this location turned out to work in my favor. It\u2019s not in Times Square, but it\u2019s in Herald Square, where you have all the shopping you can stand, on 34th street, and a very good assortment of ethnic (especially lots of Korean food as it's near little Korea) and American restaurants in the immediate vicinity. So, I made sure to indulge in both. You are also located a stone\u2019s throw away from the Empire State building, for viewing that landmark. So, while it\u2019s not Times Square, 1 train ride north and you\u2019re at Times Square, which is on the same corner as the hotel 10 feet away. You can likely save some money.\nThe facility is clean, the staff is friendly and attentive, and they have a little mini store, or the Market, as they call it. That is very key for me, because I hate when I get thirsty (late night) and don\u2019t have anything to drink until the next morning (there are no bottled waters in the room). Alternatively, there are drug stores nearby, so you can buy a bunch of things when you\u2019re out and about.\nThe rooms we had were small but not bad though. Smelled good, everything white was actually white and not eggshell colored, so that was a good sign, including the bathroom sink and tub. There isn\u2019t much of a view there, but if you just need a quick room, in a jam, it\u2019s a good place for that. It doesn\u2019t have any USB charging stations, but there are available AC adapters everywhere, and unlike many hotels, you don\u2019t need to unplug anything to have access to them. That\u2019s a good thing. \nThe included Internet speed is 33 mpbs, so that is far greater than you\u2019re going to get from many hotels in the area, and trust me, I know this to be true. Take advantage of this if you have a day with bad weather- STREAM STREAM STREAM! It\u2019s wide-open internet though, no password, so be safe out there.\nWas really quiet there, I have to admit, and I know the place was booked to capacity because I just beat out a few people for the last few rooms. I didn\u2019t hear anyone, nor anything, the whole time I was there, including street traffic. That was perfect, because I forgot my ear plugs. \nThe bed, however, I didn\u2019t care for. They are really soft and can be firm if you remain dead-center in the bed. If you happen to land on the side of the bed, you\u2019ll sink in or launch off of the bed in comedic fashion. The springs are really responsive on the sides of the bed. If you like a firm bed, like I do, avoid the edges of the bed. I felt my side hurting a bit in the morning.\nThere is nothing really fancy about the place, quaint look, some dings on the furniture here or there, but nothing to impress or depress you. If you are depressed, hit the room for some drinks. It\u2019s a 3-star hotel, but it holds its weight very well, in my opinion.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was just right for both occasions.  The location is very good (35th and 6th)... easy access from Penn Station for those taking the train.  We had a corner room that overlooked the iconic Macy's store on one side and had a great view of the Empire State Building on the other.  The room was small but comfortable... typical for NYC.  Service was friendly and attentive,,, especially Michael, our doorman, bellman and concierge (his description).  A couple of tips... street noise is an issue.  We were on the 14th floor and the reality is that if you are at 35th and 6th, there is a lot going on down below ... there will be noise.  Getting around on foot is easy, but if you want to get a cab or uber, leave yourself enough time... especially around the holidays.  Bonus tip... because the address is on 35th, your ride will usually approach the area via 35th... which is always slow\/backed-up.  If you catch your ride on the corner of 35th and 6th (about 100  feet from the hotel entrance), your ride can come up 6th, which tends to move more quickly than 35th.  \n\nOverall... price + location + service = good value","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

After all, we used Marriott Rewards points for this stay, so  the price was right :)  That said, we're glad that we didn't pay for our room as there were some things we disliked.\n\nFirst, I will talk about what we did like about the place.  The staff here is great!   Everyone we dealt with was very friendly and helpful.  Housekeeping did a great job keeping our room clean.  Everyone we talked to on the housekeeping staff, was very nice to us.\n\nThe location is great if you are using Amtrak to get to NYC.  It's a really easy walk to and from Penn Station.\n\nLiterally, right outside the door is an entrance to the 34th Street Herald Square subway station where you can pick up the B, D, F, and M trains.\n\nIt's a very doable walk to Times Square and Broadway theaters.\n\nThere is a rooftop bar that has both indoor and outdoor seating.  I wish that we had the time and better weather, we would have checked it out.\n\nNow, here are the things we didn't like --- Professional photos the hotel posted online had us thinking that the rooms are very spacious for NYC.  Well...yes, they are more spacious than the average NYC hotel room but...the layout is very inefficient.  For example, the bathroom was really small.  If you have claustrophobia, you definitely won't like it.  The bathroom sink was tiny and the faucet was awkwardly placed.    Every time we used the sink, water ended up all over the tiny counter.  There was hardly any room for towels.  They were placed in a very small shelf under the sink which they had to share with the hairdryer, a roll of extra TP and the box of tissues.  Thankfully, there is a ledge above the sink which has room to place your toiletries.  \n\nThere is a desk in the room but it has no light on it which made it difficult to use properly.  The desk chair is covered in red cloth which shows stains made by previous guests.  There is a fridge which is a standard size hotel room one.  One beef I have with Marriott---they no longer put a freezer compartment in the fridges.  We travel with meds that need refrigeration so we need the freezer to keep our freezer pack cold.\n\nThe closet was literally the smallest closet I've ever seen in a hotel.  A full-sized ironing board and an iron take up a good chunk of space.  Also, there is a small 2 drawer dresser which has a bag with an extra blanket on top.  There is no way that your suitcases can fit in there.  If you do any shopping while staying here, keep in mind that you may not have enough space to store your items.  We travel light and we could barely fit anything in that closet.\n\nThere are no luggage racks, which seems to be an issue in other NYC hotels.  Fortunately, there is a small coffee table plus a small cushioned bench, both that we used as luggage racks.  A couch is in the room which we believe was a sleeper couch.  It's not the most comfortable place to sit.\n\nOur room had a king-sized bed.  The mattress was on the soft side.  We would have preferred it to be a bit firmer but it wasn't bad.  The nightstands were tiny.  They had 2 drawers.  One draw held the Gideon Bible and the Book of Mormon and they barely fit in there.\n\nTo summarize, so much wasted square footage was in this room.  The room could have been designed better.\n\nOur room faced 6th Avenue and we were on the 9th floor.  If you are a light sleeper, be sure to use earplugs!","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Good security on the ground floor, too.

For two people, go for the executive king (it's not a huge room, but you'll get a some additional space with sofa, which makes it more comfortable for two). Bathroom is compact but well designed, with shelf for toiletries. Bring earplugs or run the fan if room faces Sixth Ave (street noise is the trade-off for any centrally located hotel in NYC). I stay at Marriotts in New York often but had not stayed at this one before. It delivers on the standard Courtyard expectations: clean, comfortable, nice hot shower, good treadmills.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":4053479,"title":"The Perfect Location ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-11-24","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"We travelled from Londom Heathrow to JFK. The journey to the hotel may show as 30 mins but trust me it's nearer an hour unless you are travelling between 12-6am. It's like rush hour all day and night in Newyork. There is a fixed rate into the centre of Manhattan which with tips and taxes should set you back around 70 dollars. The hotel is located right opposite Macys which is a shoppers heaven. The subway is also right outside. As you enter the hotel, take the lift up to the Lobby for check in. Check in was smooth and despite being early our room was ready (705). Our room was on the 7th floor, would have liked to have been higher as there was quite a lot of noise outside. I was delighted with the size, very spacious and clean and the bed was huge. Sadly it was too soft for us so we had to turn the mattress upside down. We had a great big flat screen tv which opens out as well as coffee making facilities. I would just highlight being from the UK we love our tea, so I would have preferred a kettle. If I am honest the storage space was a little limited, fine for 2\/3 days but we stayed 5 nights and so was a little tricky. The drawers by the bed were very small and there were only 2 drawers in the cupboard. I also had to ask for more hangers as there were only a few provided. The difficulty being on the 7th was that the room was a little dark, this only mattered when getting ready in the morning. 2 lights by the bed and one by the door meant the centre of the room was still dark. This is a minor detail though and by no means was a big issue. The shower was great, very spacious and clean and plenty space to put your toiletries. I loved the little heater for your feet too, that was a nice touch. The room also had aircon which was perfect as it was too noisy at night to open the windows. On a couple of mornings we went down to the Lobby to order tea and a muffin, this would set you back around 10 dollars. Please note that coffee in Newyork is considerably more expensive.\n\nThe location of the hotel was absolutely perfect, right opposite Macys which is a shoppers paradise! Subway is right outside and Shake Shake is a 2 minute walk away and do great burgers and hot dogs. 2 burgers fries and drinks will cost around 31 dollars. You will be spoilt for choice for places to eat but note that food is not cheap in restaraunts. We found a couple of Gems which worked well for our budget- 5 Borough Burger is a 2 minute walk (80 W 36th street ). 2 main meals and 2 soft drinks will set you back around 40 dollars including tip. If you want a good breakfast in a traditional American diner then Andrew Coffee Shop is the place to go on the corner of 7th and 35th. Waffles, pancakes, eggs benedict, the lot and at a reasonable price. Remember to tip, the service is second to none out here and average tip is around 20%.  \n\nWe walked everywhere, one day we managed 18k! It's very easy to get around on foot so bring some good walking shoes. Before we flew out we booked a multi use attraction  pass through City View. We selected the 911 memorial, rockafella, empire state and The Ride tour bus and am so glad we did. It meant we saved around 40 dollars in admission fees. The tickets will be emailed to you and you can either print them out or use your phone. The Rockafella was very impressive, the tour lasted around 90 mins, the tour guide Aaron was fun and informative. It was nice that we were given headsets so could hear him through the crowds inside and out. I have to insist you try The Ride bus tour, this is not like a normal bus tour which can become dull. I absolutely loved this interactive ride through midtown. One side of the bus is glass and so you face out to the streets waving at shocked passers by. There are also actors amongst the crowd to entertain you when sitting at traffic lights or in traffic. I didn't stop laughing the whole way through. Make sure you collect your tickets first from the bus ticket office using your phone so they can scan your code and print them off (I know, I thought the email would act as a ticket too and it did for the empire state only). Empire state was again really good, we visited at dusk which was the perfect time as all the lights were coming on. Really quick to get up to the top and absolutely stunning 360 views. It's windy so take a hat and scalf if you want to avoid hypothermia! There are toilets there too which you will need after 10 mins outside. \n\nThe 911 memorial was interesting and ofcourse sombre. Again you have to print your tickets off at the desk there and then queue up in their security line which meant 1 hour waiting in line, fine if you have warm clothes. You could easily spend a few hours here so plan it for either the whole morning or afternoon. We decided to get the subway to here which cost 3 dollars for one journey (W route)\n\nI have to insist you go to the BB King Blues Bar and Grill. It was one of the best nights I have had! An evening of Motown along with a sit down meal and drinks. People were up dancing and singing along, absolutely fantastic evening. We arrived for the 8pm show, just to note that they say doors open at 6 but we were queuing until 7.50pm so no point in getting there before 7.15pm. I booked via their website where you can see the calendar of events and pick what you fancy. The show went on until about half 9 and we were right by the stage which was perfect. Try the Mud Pie from the dessert list, this was really delicious!\n\nAs mentioned Macys is right opposite the hotel, Lord and Taylor dept store is also close by on 5th, we also visited Bloomingdale and Century 21 up by Central Park which has great discounts on designer brands. It reminded me alot of a TK Max store. \n\nI would also recommend a walk to Greenwich, it's beautiful and a totally different feel to midtown. It had a camden feel about it. This is where we picked up the High Line (an old train line converted into a long walkway) and walked along to Chelsea. The views of the city are wonderful, again being high up it was bloomin cold but totally worth it. \n\nIf you are leaving during the day to return home give yourself plenty of time to get to the airport, our flight was at half 6 in the evening and we got a taxi at 2.45pm which worked out just right. \n\nI would definitely stay here again, perhaps on a slightly higher floor so its a little brighter and quieter. Overall a wonderful time and 5 nights was just about perfect to get everything in that we planned. Make sure you have a good amount of spending money, the only cheap thing here was the subway!\n\n","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Given that we had an early flight coming into Manhattan, we expected a lengthy wait knowing the hotel\u2019s check in time is 4pm. I was pleasantly surprised to get a check in just after 1pm, with no charge whatsoever. \n\nThe room itself was very cozy, warm, and tidy. The location is mint \u2013 everything is literally steps away. In addition to the famous spots such as Times Square, Central Park and MSG, there are liquor stores, coffee shops, fast food joints, convenience stores, etc. on every block. It was amazing to explore the city to its fullest and returning to a comfortable room and lounge in a soft bed to some US cable TV. \n\nI\u2019ve travelled all over the world and I can honestly say that Michael\u2019s hospitality was excellent and has provided one of my best experiences while travelling. He genuinely cares about each and every customer that walks through that door and treats them like royalty. He greets you throughout the day as if you have been friends for quite some time. He ensures your stay is at its finest from the second you walk through that door to  the moment your taxi driver pulls up downstairs upon checkout. \nIt has been an absolute pleasure staying at the Marriott and Michael deserves tremendous recognition and appreciation for all of his hard work and dedication.

We wanted to a choose a location that was away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square, but yet was in a good location with access to the subway system.  I always stay at Marriott properties and found this hotel to fit the bill.\n\nWe flew into Newark and took a train from Newark to Penn Station.  The Courtyard was a quick Uber\/Taxi ride from Penn Station (3-4 blocks) and about a 10 minute walk.  So, it was very accessible by train.  One of the great things about this location is that the subway entrance is literally about 20 ft. from the hotel entrance.  It was so easy to jump on the subway and get around and then come back to be dropped off right at the entrance to your hotel.  It was great!\n\nRegarding the hotel accommodations...It is very clean and the rooms are nice, but very small.  However, this is what we expected and weren't surprised one way or another in that regard.  There is a cool bar on top of the hotel that has a great view of the city and a great picture opportunity looking up at the Empire State Building.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for reviewing this property is that I really want to say that our stay was fantastic due to the help of Jose, the Concierge at the Courtyard.  When we got there, Jose greeted us and took us up to the lobby.  He immediately helped us check our bags (got there too early for check in) and then started giving us recommendations on places to go and, more importantly, places to eat.  He gave us some coupons for food and a metro card for the subway.  We were meeting some friends that were also in NYC and he suggested an Italian Restaurant around Times Square.  He asked how many people would be going and asked for my cell number.  He said that he would make the reservation for us and would call to give me the details.  I was like, \"Yeah, right.\" and assumed I would still need to end up making them myself as he wasn't going to do that.  About an hour later, I received a text from Jose with the details for the reservation he made for us!  \n\nThroughout our stay, Jose was there to greet us just about every time we went in and out and gave the hotel a very welcoming sense.  It kind of felt like a home away from home while we were there and we always looked forward to a warm welcome back.  \n\nI will strongly consider returning back to this hotel due to the location and because of Jose.  Courtyard management team...please realize what value Jose brings and make sure you take care of him.  He is likely one of the most valuable assets you have at your hotel and you will want to retain him!  Keep up the great work, Jose!","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I am a Marriott Gold Elite Member and was very surprised at check-in that we were not offered any breakfast amenities or a complementary room upgrade. I was told that Elite members are only entitled to a late checkout and a few bottles of water at check-in (we were denied more water during the stay). In addition, the front desk staff was not very friendly or understandable. We were given a double room on the 4th floor. The room itself was fine, not large, but a seemingly good size for NYC. The room also has a small balcony, though the fencing was solid and there was absolutely no view. The bathroom is OK, however the sink is so small and it's difficult to wash one's face without getting water all over the floor. We had 2 specific issues with our room during the stay (the toilet was running when we arrived and the shower was very slow draining). We notified housekeeping of both of these incidents as they were in the hallway at the time, and they took care of these issues as well as providing additional towels and coffee at our request. Other than the housekeeping, the best thing about this hotel is definitely the location - right in the heart of Herald Square, across from Macy's and near to a lot of shopping. It's also near the new Target and there's a Whole Foods a few blocks north across from Bryant Park. The subway is next to the hotel. All-in-all a good experience, though I really did not feel like being Gold Elite at this hotel is worth anything at all.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Upon check out they had the nerve to ask me about my stay and when I told her, what disturbed me (from the loud AC to the management call) she just said \"Oh...\" and that's it. \nWater in the shower has little to no pressure and can't keep constant temperature.

Macy's Herald Square was right across the street. A subway station within a few steps that is a transfer station to take other subway lines. So convenient to go anywhere. Not sure if it's because of the location, but it was loud from street noise. \nKorea town was less than a 5 minute walk so restaurants were there. Lots of fast food restaurants, drug stores, and shopping all within a few steps of the hotel. Times Square was about a 15 minute walk or one subway stop. Empire State Building about a 5 minute walk too. \nElevators were quick (there were 3). \nThe staff were super friendly and attentive. Nice to see people take a minute to look you in the eye and smile :) Jos\u00e8 the other concierge that we saw on a daily basis had many ideas on where to go for dinner or shopping.  He even helped us arrange for a car to take us to the airport. The blond young lady at check in (I apologize I didn't get her name) was fantastic. She got us the room a bit higher floor and gave us the late check out.  One thing I will mention is the cab fare isn't much less (maybe $5-10) than if you were to get a private car. That cost $65.00 plus tip and you ride in a nicer, cleaner, and comfortable car. I would stay here again.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had a corner room (low floor but still quite interesting view) with big windows that were not insulated at all, and the heater just couldn't regulate the heat on cold nights.  To get what felt barely 70 degrees required setting the heat on 80, and still the heating was variable and not well distributed in the room.  The thermostat worked ok when it was 50-60 outside.  The elevator buttons intermittently just didn't work (or took 30 seconds of pushing until they finally registered your request and sent an elevator).  There were no usable electrical outlets near the bed the lamps and clock were plugged in, but there were ugly pieces of wood nailed to the wall to prevent access to these outlets.

The staff was fantastic --- very friendly.  I need to give a \"shout out\" to Yeilly, Jose, and Michael (he may have been the manager on duty on Saturday).  They made us feel very welcome.  The rooms were in good shape --- large by New York standards and clean.  I believe we were on the 7th floor.  The hotel's location was prime!  A few blocks from Penn Station and Times Square.  The Herald Square subway stop is just a few feet away from the hotel's entrance.  Check-in and check-out went very smoothly, and we were able to store our bags all day after checking out on Sunday.  Okay, so just one small item, which was also cited in a previous review.  There was an incessant and almost constant sound of water flow above and around the room.  At first, we thought it was someone next door flushing the toilet, but it was pretty much non-stop.  It continued overnight.  I have no problem sleeping through noise and sound distractions, but it could be challenging for some.  The hotel really needs to focus on addressing this.  Aside from this one small item, I would highly recommend this hotel for those coming to enjoy the city.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Last weekend was no exception. We arrived before check in, and were helped by Yeilly, who offered us an early check in on one of the lower floors, or it would be a wait for the high floor corner room we requested. We decided to go out for lunch, whereupon Yeilly called a bellhop to secure our luggage. He was the same friendly guy who had greeted us on the ground floor, Michael, I believe. As he took our bags both he and Yeilly asked what we were in the mood to eat, and offered suggestions on where to go. Michael even gave us a couple of coupons for local restaurants! After some great Korean food, we returned to the hotel and checked in to our room. \nThe rooms here are clean, coffee maker, safe, refrigerator and large comfy Marriott bed.\nThe bathroom was small but clean and the water was hot with good pressure.

Once in the lobby - which is bright and cheerful, a perfect spot to rest after a busy day or meet up with friends - you are met by the happiest reception staff I have ever seen. Any time I had course to interact with the reception staff I found them extremely helpful and polite. Check-in was a breeze - just what you need after a long flight, and we were in our room on the 17th floor in no time. I had booked a double with two beds and a city view and that is what I got - with a perfect view looking up 6th Ave. The room and bathroom were both spotless with all the amenities we could ever need, including a fridge and a safe - vital in my book! \nBreakfast is served on the lobby level at a Starbucks counter - some may find the breakfast limited - but we found it more that enough to start our day. Having paid for breakfast inclusive we were had to avail of the guest deal - otherwise you can order anything off the menu. The guest deal was a beverage (tea \/ herbal tea\/ coffee) and then either one hot item (BLT \/ Bagel \/ Ham & Cheese Croissant) or two items from the cold counter (fruit \/ yogurt \/ juice \/ water \/ muffin \/ croissants). I chose herbal tea, blueberry muffin and a bottle of water for my bag, my sister chose tea and a Ham & Cheese Croissant. We were both very satisfied with our choices, and once again the staff were very helpful and polite.\nThere is a subway stop right outside the door, but as the location of this hotel is one of it's best features we found that we walked everywhere - 10 mins to Time square. A cab from the top of 5th Ave to our hotel cost us $10.\nThe hotel also has a small gym and a private laundry room for guests - use your room key to enter.\nYes there is a bar on the 18th floor \"The Monarch\". The Monarch is a separate business and not connected to the hotel. The bar and hotel share the same entrance hall - it has 3 lifts, 2 for the hotel and 1 for the bar. The Monarch has it's own doorman waiting to guide you to the appropriate lift. The Monarch is fantastic - the best views of Empire State you will find - and the cocktails are just too good to miss.\nSo after check-in we put down our bags and headed off to explore the city happy in the knowledge that we had a secure, spotless and comfortable hotel waiting for us upon our return.\nI would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my fellow traveler. The staff are the excellent, the location is beyond compare, the breakfast is perfect, and the added extra of the rooftop bar makes the 'Courtyard by Marriott @ Herald square' the only place to stay when in NYC.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But we are heading to NYC again and staying again at this hotel. We stayed last January and were newbies to the city. \n\nWe were greeted very warmly by a nice young man who was very professional and friendly.  Our room was extremely clean and our view of the Empire State building was awesome.  I had read some reviews about the loud noise from club upstairs. We never heard the club noise ever and we were up close. This time around we actually want to try out the club upstairs. \n\nThis hotel is close to every thing.  Its is a hidden gem I believe. It made our first experience in  the city very easy.  Everyone at this hotel was very nice and seemed like they like their jobs. Always smiles on their face. \n\nWe are coming to stay here again next week after Thanksgiving and actually talked our friends into staying here too. I hope its everything we remember.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were traveling to NYC to help our daughter find a wedding gown and to enjoy the city.  Prior to arrival the front desk manager had promised  that we would be upgraded to an executive king room with city views in view of our status as Marriott platinum guests.  When we arrived the promised room was not offered to us so we were given an ordinary king room with no view to speak of.   That night when we came back to the hotel around 10 pm we encountered a party at the end of our hall.  We noticed that there were a number of people hanging out in the hall smoking cigarettes and otherwise being rowdy.  We immediately brought this situation to the attention of the hotel but the partying continued until at least 1 am.  Our room smelled of cigarette smoke as a result of the people in the hall.  Another minor problem in comparison was that our television kept going on and off which management could not fix.  The next morning we asked if the problem guests were going to be staying another night and were told they were. We questioned why  the hotel did not evict them and did not get a responsive answer. We were told the hotel was \"looking\" into the matter.  We then told the manager that we needed to change rooms and management accommodated by moving us to the same executive king we were suppose to have been assigned the first night.  Unfortunately, I had to pack up our old room that morning and could not go with my wife and daughter to search for a wedding dress.  This was a huge disappointment to all of us.  Someone left the executive room we moved to with the window open.  We did not notice the open window until we went to bed but by that time the room was filled with mosquitoes buzzing around our heads while we tried to sleep.  Another annoyance was that there were hairs in the bathroom sink and toilet from the prior guest which housekeeping missed.  As to the hotel, it is nothing to write home about.  It is located on 35th St. near 6th Avenue.  The street it is on is filled with very unattractive  Korean restaurants and the sidewalk while we were there was cluttered with rubbish from those restaurants.  The lobby to the hotel is on the second floor  with the  unattractive entrance on street level.   People line up in front of the hotel at night to get into the club on the top floor making for a struggle to get into the hotel.  So in conclusion, this is an unattractive party hotel, on a busy dirty street, with management not in control of the unruly guests staying there.  Definitely a place to avoid.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is good, opposite Macy's, a block from the Empire State and 5 mins wall from Times Square. The downside about the location is that there were quite a few homeless people about and the subway stank! We had to hold our breath walking on the street outside. \n\nWe visited NYC with my boyfriends brother, he booked a deluxe king and we booked the standard king. The price difference was around \u00a3300. The rooms were EXACTLY the same! Same view, room space, same everything. Don't waste the additional money. Also don't pay extra for a city view, the hotel is on the corner of the block so every room has a city view. \n\nThe room itself was very very small, even by NYC standards. We've stayed in a couple of hotels in New York, all other rooms have been double the size of this one. We had 2 large cases as we'd been travelling for a month and it was a nightmare trying to find space. Although tiny, it was spotless! Couldn't fault the cleaning! \n\nThe staff were all superb and very friendly, minus one young blonde girl on reception who was rude when we checked out and who didn't seem to care that we needed to collect our bags. The hotel organised a car to the airport for a flat rate, would definitely recommend this! \n\nAll in all its an average hotel which is overpriced because of its location. We wouldn't recommend it purely because the room was uncomfortably small and the smell outside was disgusting!","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Here is a summary of my experience along with what I think are the pros and cons. \n\nI paid around 170 for 1 night. The hotel is located right next to empire state building, Macys and broadway. There is no parking facility. The closest garage charges you 65$ for 24 hrs. Check in - check out process is smooth and quick. Hotel staff is very polite and nice.\n\nPROS\n----------------------\n\n1. Location is great if you just want to walk around in times square.\n2. Rooms are relatively neat and tidy\n3. Hotel staff was great to any requests\n4. There is free basic wifi\n\nCONS\n----------------------\n\n1. Value for money is bad. The rooms are extremely small\n2. No breakfast included with the money. You can pay extra $$ for it. We did not have even water bottles in our room which was strange. We had to ask for brushes and paste.\n3. Parking is bad, and the nearest parking garage (Icon Parking) has no discounts for this hotel but has for others in the area like hilton which is in the same price range\n4. There is always a big line in the entrance with people waiting to go to the rooftop bar. its well managed by very strange to always see big lines\n\nOverall I would rate it just average. With this kind of money there could be better options","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Jose is a gentleman who works there as a concierge\/ resource for guests. He is AMAZING! He took care of us with anything we needed. He even walked to into the Subway station (right outside the hotel by the way) helped us get a metro card and made sure we were getting on the correct train to get us where we were going.

As others have observed, its right to a subway station and has a lot of useful shops etc all around.  There are Starbucks, McDs, Duane Reed etc. all within a few 100 meters of the location and Macy's and H&M right opposite.  Furthermore, Herald Square has a lot to do and on sunday we saw 6th avenue closed off for a street fair!!!  \n\nThe Bad:\nThe rooms are pretty small.  You can understand that when you see the building.  BUT.  The bathroom is the smallest that I have ever seen in any hotel.  The sink is TINY.  You end up making a mess in the bathroom as water splashes all over the place when you do basic things like washing your hands or face.  Its also got only basics (soap, shampoo, lotion), and its the Paul Mitchell stuff that takes forever to get off your hands.\n\nThe room has basic amenities...no tea but there is some coffee that isn't the greatest in the world.  Hotel is very stingy with regard to these things as we (family of 4) had only 2-3 sachets.  And while there are real glass tumblers, there are only paper cups for coffee.  Oh and breakfast was not included in our deal.  \n\nFinally, our bus was leaving in the evening so I asked for a late checkout...and they gave me one whole extra hour...which was useless and as a result we checked out early and had to leave our luggage in the lobby while we went out.  Similar to other hotels but not what I expected from the Marriott, especially as I am a rewards club member.  \n\nWe barely interacted with the staff...other than the check in and check out (both quite painless and quick) we really didn't see anyone else, so cant really comment on their service.  But our rooms remained clean and neat so I guess they did there job well.  Front desk was well manned and the staff there was friendly and offered good advice.  \n\nSo all in all it wasn't a bad stay.  Perhaps my expectations were higher, but clearly not in the same category as other Marriotts that I have stayed at (including other Courtyards).  Location wise its a great place, but one should look around at other options in the area as it was certainly not a cheap stay.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Plenty of options to have breakfast near the hotel, no need to eat at the hotel's Starbucks (we did it only once in 3 nights). The price for a small room and tiny bathroom was moderate. We booked the city view double and we had an average view of some old roofs. What we disliked a lot was the countless number of homeless people in the area, although we didn't feel unsafe, we weren't comfortable. On weekends there's a big queue to go to a bar on the hotel's roof and it gets loud and crowded. For the remaining 3 nights we went to another Marriott (residence inn on 48th and Lexington) and we got a king studio and breakfast included for a rate that was only a fraction more.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It turned a fine experience into a memorable one. The building itself is narrow and so the ground floor entrance is somewhat hidden and not particularly welcoming. But the lobby one floor up is well designed and has plenty of natural light. We had a corner room on the 8th floor, also with lots of natural light and a very comfortable bed. The  design of the room and bathroom was clever and subtle-- no ersatz colonial boring sameness. The design choices made the room larger and more inviting than many urban hotel rooms elsewhere. The bathroom is small, but comfortable and, again, well designed and spotless. The work-out room is on the 4th floor and is above average-- clean, excellent signage, all equipment working (which is, in my experience, highly unusual!)-- with the added bonus of a small outdoor patio where, if the weather were better, I would have gone to recover after working out. My only complaint is something the hotel can do nothing about-- sirens and other noise from Herald Square and 6th Avenue. I heard no noise from other rooms in any direction so the walls and doors are clearly thick, but Macy's was doing some kind of incredibly noisy Ninja Turtle promotion for a few hours on Saturday afternoon which made working (much less napping) in the room impossible, even with ear plugs. I can't say enough about the staff though-- from housekeeping to the front desk to the security guards on the ground floor.  Marriott should give them all bonuses because they made the experience for us. The cafe was O.K., but I would have loved advice as to where one could get a hot, sit down NYC  breakfast place nearby. One tip that I didn't discover until later-- Macy's has nice cafes and food choices, surprisingly.  Overall, a very good experience, truly made by the cheer and helpfulness of the hotel's employees. There was only one front desk employee who was a little sour, but her attitude was in the range of 'normal' for big hotels --  I might not have even noticed had it not been so different from everyone else's extraordinary helpfulness and energy. Well done!","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location is just 2 blocks from Penn Station (so arriving by train or from JFK is convenient without a taxi), and is just a few steps from the Herald Square subway entrance (D, R, F and other trains easily connect). We had a quiet room with 2 beds, refrigerator, coffee maker - all the amenities of a standard Marriott Courtyard hotel. Breakfast is available in the spacious lobby that is upstairs from the entrance level - so it is a calm place to plan your day in the big city. Dining\/shopping\/theater\/meeting options are just a short walk away - the location is 35th St and 6th Ave, so, e.g., Korea Town is just 2 blocks south with restaurants, bakeries, shops. And the major locations are easily accessible for a nice long walk in the City or a short cab ride if you opt out of the subway: for example, Lincoln Center is 30 blocks north, the Village is 30 blocks south. And, when you come back to the hotel at night, the door next to the entrance leads to a great club that has an open air lounge with a spectacular view of the Empire State Building (pictured). Even though we were adjacent to this nightclub (and busy Herald Square) we heard no sounds in our room on the 8th floor of the hotel and slept like babies (or at least like babies who sleep through the night). The prices were reasonable for NYC - $229\/night on a weekend night and $249 for weeknights - for a room with 2 beds at a\nmajor hotel chain this was the best rate we found, particularly since we wanted the cancellation option (i.e., we could have prepaid and saved $30\/night but didn't want to risk an unknown hotel), and we refused to pay a \"resort\" fee (additional $30\/day at other hotels).\nStaff at the hotel were great - we had one problem with a man at the front desk who failed to read notes in our reservation as to who would be checking into our room first (we arrived at different times the first day and he charged the room to my friend despite my already having used points and my credit card to pay), but he apologized the next day and worked with other staff to fix the problem. Everyone else was very friendly and a pleasure to meet. In summary, a great place to stay and highly recommended.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Tucked away near Herald Square (you could easily walk by and not know it was a hotel - only just see the signs for the Monarch nightclub), this hotel is a great value for money, and a good experience overall. The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are well-appointed and a decent size for Manhattan. I love the location (easy walk from Penn Station, right by Subway, right by Herald Square shopping). The rooms are always clean and well-stocked. Amenities are minimal (it's a Courtyard after all) and you're not going to be blown away with a huge amount of space or features - but it's clean, quiet and friendly. There's no real restaurant - just a small cafe type place serving sandwiches, breakfast foods and coffee\/drinks. But I find that is okay for my needs as I'm usually away from the hotel for lunch and dinner (it's New York! food choices for all cuisines and budgets abound!)\n\nSpecial thanks to Jose the bellman. He is fantastic. He goes out of his way to help out, and does so with a smile - and in multiple languages! He truly seems to love his job.\n\nI'll be back next time I have business in NYC. :)","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Subway (34th St) station is at the corner- literally just a few steps from the front door (I think it was the R-L-Q line??). Short walk to Empire State Bldg, Times Square, Madison Square Gardens.  Macy's flagship store is across the street with all the other shopping opportunities at Herald Square. Bryant Park is around the corner.  Rooms are good for NYC standards- (small bathrooms). All is clean and modern. Staff was helpful. Michael, the concierge, was extremely nice and helpful- thank you again!  NYC-style rooftop bar- not owned by the hotel?? so it doesn't feel like a hotel bar. There is a Chik-Fil-A, McDonald's and an Andrew's coffee shop close by for breakfast if you don't want to purchase from the hotel offerings. There is a small market\/snack area- with a microwave.  If you need it, there is a Hertz rental car place a few blocks over. No issues with heat\/air. Beds were comfy. It is NYC, but there was no noise either from outside, the hallways, or nearby elevators. One minor obstacle was there is basically one mirror (teen girls) in a small space.  Computers are available in the lobby to print boarding passes, etc. There is a space with tables\/chairs for informal meetings or groups in the lobby.

Had no problems the nights we stayed, and all requests was sorted fast.\n\nOur room had 2 queen size beds, would have been nice we had larger beds, being 4 friends sharing a room. But the size of the room didnt allow for larger beds really. Room and bath was good overall, just got a bit crowded with 4 girls on a shopping vacation, but not sure we can blame the hotel for that problem :)\nThe view was ok, guess if you get a room even higher up ( we had 9th floor) you see more.\n\nIt was all clean and nice, did smell smoke in the hallway at night, not sure if someone was smoking in the rooms or what! But all in all we had a clean nice room and fresh towels every day. Im rather sure our room was not the easiest to keep tidy! Lots of stuff in there with the 4 of us.\n\nLast day we left our bags in storage and booked a taxi for the airport! Not sure if it was the amount of luggage or our friendly faces, but when we came to pick up and leave, Jose the bellman,had arranged a limo for us to the airport!

I was referred back to the bellhop later he basically snapped\/yelled his response that he would be back to pick up my luggage and was I next in line completely avoiding the question.

I can't stress that enough. I've had nightmares before at other hotels where they just can't seem to get it right. Kudos to the staff here! Our room was clean and comfortable, especially the bed and pillows. They were super comfy. Two little things - the climate control system leaves the air extremely dry. Kept waking up to sip water. The other little thing was actually sort of funny - After first checking in, I went into the bathroom, closed the door and was greeted by a pair of khacki pants belonging to the last guest.

It always seems like there is always something the hotel could improve upon, but in this case the combination of service, value, location was really top-notch. \n\nIt started even before our check-in experience by the greeting we got on the ground floor from the Security person and then from the Courtyard Concierge on duty, Mike, who guided us to the Lobby on the 2nd floor. \n\nI had used the Marriott app to request an early check-in, which is not something guaranteed by my Platinum status. Happily, we were offered our room 4 hours early, for which we were very appreciative due to the really cold temperatures outside. It felt great to warm up a bit before heading off to our Broadway matinee. We loved that the hotel was walking distance from Penn Station and close to so many subway lines. This weekend had been planned months in advance, so I was able to snag a rate of $159 a night for a 2-night stay. It was truly a bargain for that location and room.\n\nThe King bed room itself was clean, slightly more spacious than most hotel rooms in NYC (I am up here all the time for work so have stayed in about 20 different hotels in this exact vicinity.) We had an angled view of the Empire State Building (lit up in red on Valentine's Day!) The room included closet, mini fridge, large flat screen TV, desk with chair, and an easy chair. The bathroom had a huge (frosted glass) window that let in a ton of light and made it seem very large. We had plenty of towels, etc. The Wifi worked fine and was free.\n\nEveryone at the hotel was friendly, helpful, and polite - especially our housekeeper Sherley.\n\nBottom line is I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to others. FYI.  I typically like to stay at a property where breakfast is included especially when traveling for business (where I have an expense account that I cannot exceed) and that is probably the only downside of a Courtyard vs. other Marriott properties. The lower end properties such as Fairfield Inn or Residence Inn have breakfast included, and at the higher end properties such as a full service Marriott or Renaissance, I get Concierge Lounge access due to my Platinum status. However, given the price I got for this room, buying breakfast was not an issue.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If not, there is a subway station literally outside the front entrance to the building. \n\nThe rooms are pleasant and of a good size for New York hotel rooms, however, I unfortunately had a number of encounters of pretty poor service \/ rudeness at this hotel. When calling ahead a week or so before to confirm the room, front desk couldn't seem any less interested in helping if they tried. Said they had no reservation under my name, without taking and dates of our stay or seeking to clarify the spelling of the name. It then took me several more calls to various people to find out that we did in fact have a booking. \n\nWhen at the hotel, on one of the days that we were there, we had popped back to the room for 10 minutes, which so happened to coincide with when house keeping came to clean the room. There was no 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, however, when we came back to the room later that evening, we found that housekeeping had not returned to the room or cleaned it. \n\nFinally, I had a situation where I needed to make a call to my bank and enquired with the room's phone operator (front desk) as to the cost of making an overseas call. I was told that they did not know the hotels rates, but that it would be a lot cheaper than using a foreign mobile phone to make the call. However, I subsequently found an invoice under the door the next morning for $40 in charges for a 3 minute call. To credit the hotel, they refunded the costs upon complaining regarding the same, however, if this had not been the case, the misinformation given would have been extremely costly. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel for a budget stay in central Manhattan.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Average hotel. Nothing Spectacular.\n\nRooms: Modern and Comfortable but with small rooms.We had excellent views of the empire state building.The bathrooms had standing showers. no bath tubs.\n\nService: I was very impressed with the service  considering that this is New York City and very busy time. While checking in, the service desk allotted us a high floor room immediately and we requested 2 rooms next to each other on high floor. They advised us that the 17 floor rooms have a bar on top..so not recommended for us with kids due to noise. This was very good advice and gave us 15th and 16th floor. I really appreciated this. Also while checking out, they gave us a late checkout ( 1pm ) even though the hotel was completely sold out.\n\nValue for Money: Not worth the price. They charged us USD 318 on advance purchase. I guess it is due to the location that the prices are high for all Marriott's during this time of the year.\n\nWould recommend based on the location.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I called front desk, told there are no double rooms w\/ skyline\/Herald Square views.

Sicuramente non e' adatta a chi si aspetta una super colazione e buffet con cibo di ogni genere. Infatti, non c'era nessun buffet, ma un piccolo bar (Table 71), aperto solo negli orari della colazione, dove era possibile scegliere tra un numero ristretto di piatti prevalentemente dolci, gia' pronti o pre-confezionati, riscaldati al microonde. Alcuni di questi a volte non erano nemmeno disponibili (siamo riusciti a mangiare i waffles solo la prima mattina, per i restanti 4 giorni erano finiti).\nAlcuni menu precludevano la scelta di alcune pietanze (ad es. un te caldo precludeva la scelta di un succo di frutta, un waffles precludeva la scelta di un croissant)\nI membri della stessa stanza devono presentarsi tutti insieme e fare colazione nello stesso momento. \n\nLa tariffa della nostra camera includeva pernottamento e prima colazione.

We normally stay at a Marriott, because I am a Marriott Rewards Gold member.  The registration desk is not located on the main level.  Rather, one must take an elevator to the third floor.  An employee at the main level politely instructs guests as they enter.  I used mobile checkin 2 hours before, and our room was available upon arrival at 3 PM.  Our checkin went very smoothly.  We were assigned Room 913, which is classified as a Larger Guest Room.  Our room was very clean, and it was furnished with a king bed, sofa, desk, mini refrigerator, and microwave oven.  Free wifi is also available, and the wifi speed is more than adequate to watch a streaming movie.  In addition, our room faced Herald Square, and we had a nice panoramic view of Macy's and its Christmas decorations.  My wife and I had no problems sleeping that night, as the bed was very comfortable, and the noise level was nonexistent.  Furthermore, the location of this hotel is ideal, because one is within easy walking distance of several key attractions in New York.

Why did they not tell us about the lack of parking when we called?\n\nThe second issue came around 9:30am on Sunday when two members of the cleaning staff had a loud argument outside of our room. One was heard saying, \"Be quiet, I have guests on this floor\" (in a loud voice) and the reply from another member of the staff was, \"I don't care.\" They didn't stop talking until we stuck our head out of the room to let them know they were disturbing us.

It is located next to the Empire State Building on the one side and Macy's on the other.  Yet the hotel is quiet (as long as you have a room not directly under the roof top lounge which is popular on the weekends).  The rooms are slightly larger than most Manhattan hotels with a modern bathroom with a window (frosted).  The place has been recently renovated so furniture and bed and carpets are still relatively fresh looking.  Unfortunately the hotel is currently clad in netting due to renovations, however, the view is largely unimpeded. \n\nThe check in was excellent.  We arrived several hours prior to the 4:00 PM check in time.  The reception clerk ensured that while a smaller room was immediately available, since we would be staying for 5 nights, she would book us into the larger rooms.  This, however, would require us to wait.  No problem for us and much appreciated.  We checked our bags and went to town.\n\nOne peculiar issue did arise, however, upon our return.  When we returned at 6:00 PM it took over 20 minutes for our bags to arrive in our room.  Not good, especially when you've had a full day of travel and sight seeing.  I should mention that the front desk was not busy.  When we mentioned to \"Michael\" (the concierge) why it took so long to get our bags up to us and why the bags could not have been put in the room when the room became available, we received a somewhat flippant answer that we should have made this request at the front desk.  \n\nOK, folks, there's you cue according to \"Michael\" - if you arrive early and your room is unavailable and you check your baggage, ask that your bags go to your room when your room becomes available.  \n\nThe other peculiarity was the absence of a second pouch of milk powder and sugar.  The room comes with a fridge (empty) and a coffee maker (one cup at a time) with two  paper cups but only one little packet of milk powder daily.  Strange.  How did they know that one us took their coffee black (however, the other would have preferred another little packet without having to go to the lobby).\n\nOtherwise the hotel is quiet.  You hardly have the feel of a hotel since you go straight from the street level foyer to your floor - by passing the lobby.  The modern lobby is on the second floor and you can find the newspaper there.  The guards in the foyer are friendly, The reception clerks were welcoming and efficient.   The concierge was an ebullient fellow and, while a bit flippant, gave us a 20% discount coupon for the roof top bar, Monarch (which we unfortunately never had time to use).  There is free and efficient WiFi in the room, as well as nice soap and shampoo.  The bed is excellent.  And, finally there are some good Irish pubs right down the street with some excellent $5 beer\/lunch combos (Playwright Irish Pub).","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel was in a great location and within easy distance of the subway and main attractions, The hotel was clean the rooms were a decent size for New York and had everything we needed, we would have had a great view of Macys if it hadn't been for the scaffolding and netting outside our window due to building work. However there was no noise and the beds were extremely comfortable.The bathroom was bright, the lighting was very good and the shower had plenty of room, they also provided toiletries.\nThe roof top bar was amazing and must be one of the best location in the city it is up close to the Empire State building and can see Macys, the area is very comfortable and although the drinks are a tad pricey it is no more than can be expected for such an awesome location.\nThere are plenty of places for breakfast the best we found was Andrews coffee bar, don't bother with the Martinique it is overpriced and no where near as good as Andrews.\nA must if you have the time is The Cloisters which is way uptown past 190th St well worth a visit and also a visit to Brooklyn Heights which is a great area to explore. I wouldn't bother with Coney Islands to say it has had its day is an understatement, way past its best and not worth the travelling time.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

WE are SO happy with this hotel. EVERYONE was SO nice. Jon was VERY approachable when checking in and out. I didn't realize we would be  SO close to the Empire State building. We could see it from our window. This isn't a resort as I read that some reviews said the rooms were small. This was a nice size room, this is all you need when you are in NYC. Comfy & clean bed clean bathroom. AC worked well. I have been to a few other hotels in NYC and walked right out. NOT HERE. The hotel is RIGHT in the middle of Macy's\/ Hearld Square. Perfect location for lots of subways.   The Monarch on the rooftop has a beautiful view of the city. And great snacks The only negative thing to say is the bartender was for no reason was rude to my husband and I. We asked for 2 different drinks she said no she couldn't make them and walked away. I stayed and waited for her to come back and had her make us something else, I was not going to let her upset us with her rudeness.  YOU will be happy with your stay if you book here!!

EEVVVEERRRRR","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-09-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"First, let me start by stating, I am huge on customer service. It means the most to me when giving anyone by business. Sooo my flight landed in NYC at 5:30AM and check in was not until 4:00PM. To say the least I was panicked. I arrived at the hotel and greeted by Corey and Didire. I didn't even have to explain or beg for an early checkin they accommodated me right away. Thank god. Throughout my stay the staff here was extremely helpful. I have never been to NYC so I had no idea how to get around. One of the doorman, I think his name is (Jose) literally walked me down to the subway and gave me a full on tutorial of how to use the subway system and which train to use for my destination and return. If you stay, ask for him. He will help you get anywhere in the city. Then there was a guy on the fourth floor for house cleaning. Every morning he asked me if I needed anything additional or if I needed him to do anything. Who and where can you house keeping service that extends themselves so much?? Every morning going forward  the staff was so friendly and nice. Anything, I needed I would call down to Corey or Jesse and they would help me with directions, activities, info about the city, and whatever other needs suddenly came arise. I appreciate this kind of service because often at hotels you can hear the frustration in the staff's voice for becoming a nuisance. Not to mention, last minute we needed affordable and quick transportation to make our returning flight and Michael, one of the bell man helped arrange that just with a simple request. \n\nAdditionally, the hotel is great. Its in a perfect location! You can literally walk across the street and access major shopping stores and the largest Macy's I have ever seen. There is a subway stop right outside the door of the hotel too. In addition, a couple nights a went upstairs to the rooftop bar for drinks. The view is AMAZING. You can see most of the city and it looks like the Empire Center directly in front of you. Be sure to ask Corey or Jesse for a coupon for discount on your drinks if you visit. Both are super nice and seem to remember every guest at the hotel. The hotel also has laundry, fitness center, business area for free computer and printing use (crazy cool), FREE WIFI (that works great by the way), and its meticulously clean. I love this place. It feels like your at home because any resource you need is accessible (refrigerator and microwave too for all your late night leftovers :) ).I will definitely be back to this hotel during my next NYC visit.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Insomma la posizione ci \u00e8' piaciuta, anche se la 35^ Strada soprattutto di sera e' zeppa di sacchi dell'immondizia con le relative esalazioni e insomma non \u00e8' uno splendore. In pi\u00f9 la facciata dell'albergo \u00e8 attualmente coperta da impalcature quindi arrivando penserete: ma dove sono arrivato?\nInvece l'albergo e' molto comodo. Il piano terra serve solo per entrare in ascensore, infatti la security vi far\u00e0 entrare superando la coda di giovani che va all'ultimo piano dove c'\u00e8' un locale di tendenza. \nAlla reception ci si va all'arrivo e alla partenza. Arriverete direttamente al piano con gli ascensori.\nLe camere sono piuttosto piccole ma tutto sommato accoglienti.\nNel complesso tutti gli alberghi USA sembrano avere almeno una stella in pi\u00f9 rispetto alle abitudini internazionali.\nIl frigo c'\u00e8 ma \u00e8 vuoto. C'\u00e8' la cassaforte.\nIl bagno \u00e8 l'aspetto meno esaltante. Piccolo e da tre stelle (doccia nella vasca senza telefono e tutto un po' anni Ottanta).\nAsciugamani contati come il bagnoschiuma.\nPer il resto, pulizia senza problemi.\nNeo di un certo peso e' il sistema di condizionamento: quando di accende sembra sia entrato un camion nella vostra stanza! Davvero fastidioso nella notte, quando si viene svegliati dalla riaccensione dei rumorosi motori. Meriterebbe un drastico ammodernamento.\nWI-FI ottima.\nIl voto \u00e8' quindi una media tra la comodit\u00e0 della location e gli aspetti non esaltanti detti sopra.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We loved it for several reasons. First of all, the room as compared to New York City standards was quite spacious, which was a pleasant surprise. We had enough room to spread around. The room was elegantly appointed and modern and very clean. The beds were SUPER comfy and gave us a good night's sleep. Also, our room faced the Empire State Building so there were no complaints with the view! The bathroom wasn't huge but was clean and well appointed as well. We also really enjoyed the decor of the common areas...very sleek and modern. The location of the hotel was great too. Herald Square is bustling and full of energy, yet we did not hear street noise at all from our rooms. Many places of interest were in walking distance, particularly Times Square, and there was a subway entrance right on the corner making it easy to venture to other parts of the city. We loved having the large Macy's right across the street too! The only negative at all to the Courtyard that we could find was the breakfast. We did not find the food very tasty at all and it certainly wasn't cheap. But there are plenty of places to get a great breakfast at a reasonable price right within walking distance. In the end, I highly recommend the Courtyard Herald Square. I would be happy to stay there again!","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

He worked hard to graduate from undergrad in three years and planned to start a dual grad\/law school degree program. I initially made a reservation at The Carlton on Madison Avenue, but also reserved the Courtyard Marriott\/Herald Square (CM\/HS) to accommodate the budget of 7 other family and friends who wanted to see NYC. On Friday, July 31st, upon utilizing a link specifically for cancelling my Carlton hotel reservation, I accidentally deleted my CM\/HS reservation. I immediately called CM\/HS and, after 20+ minutes, spoke for 37 minutes with a rep who assured me that I was not only able to reserve the two rooms with double beds from August 2nd through August 4th (2 nights) at a rate of $235\/night, but I was able to have breakfast included. I thanked her (and God) profusely. \n\nAlthough I still hadn't received a hotel confirmation 10 minutes later, I felt one would be forthcoming, per my past experience with many hotel reservations. What I received instead was an email on Saturday, August 1st stating that I could check in for August 2nd, with a check out on August 3rd (1 night) with two rooms, both with one king beds each. I'd already purchased Amtrak tickets for a return trip on August 4th; so, no way had I planned on leaving on the 3rd. In any case, staff on the phone was rude and dismissive, refusing to be accountable or remorseful for the error and the impact it was having on me and those who were traveling with me. Although the in-person hotel staff wasn't rude, they were equally dismissive, refusing to acknowledge or address the hotel's error. It was not only humiliating, but it was stressful. I would have accepted it if the rep was unable to meet my request when I spoke with her on Friday. After all, I deleted the first reservation. But, I was told (not just given the impression) my reservation and all I had specified had been secured. So, I didn't bother to immediately race to secure other lodging. Going forward, I (as will the four adults in my party who travel for business and leisure frequently) plan to boycott Marriott. Even if for business, which I travel for about once a month, I will pay the difference (in lodging and transportation) to lodge somewhere else.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I started planning this family trip to New York over 9 months ago. I must have spent hours upon hours looking at various hotels in New York and reading countless reviews. Deciding where to stay was always going to be the conclusive factor in a successful trip to New York. After many sleepless nights I decided to book the Courtyard Marriot Herald Sqaure. So on the 5th July 2015 we set off with some trepidation on our first trip to New York. Any worries regarding the Courtyard Marriot were soon dispersed the moment we were  greeted by Kenny at the front door. Always cheerful and always willing to help in any way he could. Passing on vital information to New York first timers. If the Courtyard Marriot was as good as their first point of contact then we had struck it lucky. We had no need to worry. Reception staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were very clean, ideal for our stay They were kept clean by a hardworking group of housekeeping staf, always eader to assist. It's  little things like that your remember. The hotel is in the ideal location for sightseeing, shopping, Broadway, Central Park. Ground Zero is a must, Central Park was fantastic and the Jersey Boys on Broadway just topped it off. As I said at the beginning I don't normally write reviews but the Courtyard Marriot deserved it. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and its staff.From the first point of contact to checking out on our last day, eveyone \nat the Courtyard Marriot could not do enough for us. As for the city that never seen sleeps Thank you for a wonderful holiday.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

(Macy's across the street). Subway - 20 steps from the hotel entrance & you are at the subway! Plenty of lines to choose from. \nEasy walk to Penn station & Times Square. Close to Broadway theaters & plenty of shops in 34th street (Vic Secret, Gap, Mango, Aldo, Banana Republic, Sephora etc)\nFood - turn right out the entrance & right into 6th ave to find Pax whole foods for cheap fresh food. The hotel does offer breakfast for purchase at a restaurant on lobby level (above street level) but it is more expensive than eating out. Pancakes in the hotel are $9.95; at Pax $5.95. Oatmeal cheaper too plus far bigger selection.\nThere was a small market in lobby where snacks, ice-cream, toiletries etc could be purchased. They even had a limited selection of frozen meals & a microwave so you could heat up something to eat.\nStaff- are wonderful!!! All so friendly & helpful! Thank you to all.\nMonarch - roof top bar at entrance to hotel not cheap but this is New York! Wonderful trendy place to grab a cocktail & watch the sunset. The Empire State Building is right behind you. Very pretty at night.\nFree wifi (3 devices only)\nLaundry room if you need to do some.\nRooms - our 2 x queen room was a good size but I did notice other rooms weren't as large. Some will have Empire views or Herald Square (&  Macy's). Our city view room looked north along 6th ave. A small window could be opened for air or to gauge the outside temperature before venturing out. Air conditioner than we could turn off or adjust temp.\nAmenities - Hanging space; plenty of bench space (desk); window that allowed natural light; all amenities like safe, ironing board etc. Lovely Paul Mitchell shampoo\/conditioner & body lotion. Coffee machine in room.\nClean!!\n \n\nNegatives: only 1 power point at bedside table & not large enough for overseas adapter. If trying to use phone while in room & charging we had to use the wall power points & sit at foot of bed.\nBathroom - small with no place for toiletries bag. On the plus side, they did have a narrow shelf running the width of the room to store small items on.\nFood - no room service or restaurant for lunch or evening meal.\n\nThe positives far outweigh the limited negatives of this fresh, modern, clean hotel. Would not hesitate to check for rates if ever back in NY. If the price was comparable to hotels of similar quality & location this would be my first choice. Even if just because the staff were so lovely!! Thanks Kenny (I hope that's right!) & Michael....others too but names escape me...sorry! :-) \n\nNote: This hotel is 71 West 35th street.

I chose the Marriot based on price which at \u20ac180 for the night was as good as I could get at short notice. \n\nThe hotel is literally around the corner from Macys and Penn Station. Took me about 10 minutes to walk there from Grand Central. Its well served by the subway stations close by so opens up the shops on 5th avenue and the world trade centre very easily. ITs a location you pay for but you really cannot fault.\n\nThe room I had was very small, as a double room its hard to imagine 2 people in it but it was clean with wifi, tv etc and did the trick for a single traveller on a one night stay. \n\nIn common with some NYC hotels, the building is not exclusive to the Marriot. Reception is reached via passing by a security desk on the ground floor and taking a lift to the second or third floor. The bedrooms are further up. Its not exactly a 4 star welcome.\n\nI didn't dine in the hotel and used it purely as a base. I was due to check out at 12 but rang and asked for a late check out and was given until 1. Better than nothing!  \n\nI left my bags at reception upon check out and continued on my trip. The bell hop gave me a hard sell on a limo to the airport which I later availed of. $65 including tips and tolls was probably about what you'd expect to pay in a yellow cab to JFK. The porter took my bags to the car and waited with me chatting until pick up, you can't fault the service in the place.\n\nAll in all a great location, very cramped but good facilities and very accommodating staff make this hotel ideal for a (very) short trip - I'm just not sure I'd stay longer than 2 nights in it.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

Penn Station was in walking distance which was an easier trek than taking the subway in spite of the fact that it's only a couple of stops. Like many urban hotels, you have to get to the lobby from the street via an elevator and then you obtain your key and go on to your room. I didn't spend much time in the hotel so not sure about any of the amenities other than the gym (which had plenty of equipment for a hotel gym in the city as well as a decent size so you didn't feel like you were literally on top of other gym goers).The really pleasant surprise was the room size. I worked from the room and it was very spacious for one person and would have been more than sufficient for two people.The room also seemed recently renovated and the shower was good. I'd definitely recommend it and the price point was ~$115\/night which made the stay even sweeter. The only challenge I had was with my neighbors who were a bit \"over zealous\" at night.

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":4053479,"title":"Great Thanksgiving Day Parade Watching and Guest Services","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-02-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Everyone should see the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in person and this is a great home base for watching.  We stayed in room 910  (911 was the corner room) and had a perfect view up 6th avenue and a great big window for watching the parade - the window opened a notch so we could hear the bands and the hoopla. Next time, I'll ask for 7th floor to look the balloons square in the face for a different perspective - 9th floor was a bit over their heads - but gave great perspective of the whole parade coming at us and all of the people lining the route.\n\nRoom was \"cozy\" for 4 people - they are definitely doubles not queens - but we made it work. There is a cupboard - no closet - but it and the area under the wall hung desk and the hanging vanity in the bath room were enough storage area for a 4 day stay with 2 twenty-somethings who brought their entire wardrobe. Room was very clean and quiet.\n\nAs bad weather was forecast for Thanksgiving Eve, we pushed our stay up a day to arrive Tuesday night and the hotel was very accommodating. They put us directly into the parade view room we had booked several months in advance, so we didn't have to make a move. Tuesday night cost $179 compared to the $999 rate for the 3 night minimum Thanksgiving stay (before taxes and fees of course). Some hotels would have stuck us for the higher rate for the additional night - Marriott didn't. Was it worth the money? You bet!  The parade came directly at us just before it turned the corner a block south to Macy's.\n\nI was a bit apprehensive about our arrival late on a weeknight - and there is no real place to pull in and unload the car - they have a marked loading zone on the street. When we pulled in at about 11pm, the hotel staff was waiting for us and quickly unloaded the car and the valet wisked the car away and they kept it until we left on Saturday - for a fee of course :)  We were in our room, unpacked and zonked out by midnight. \n\nThe area around Macy's gets understandably crazy the day before the parade. They close 6th avenue and get to work swinging all the street lights to the side and out of the way of the parade. We walked or used cabs to get around, but driving would have been more a hassle than usual. There are several fun restaurants within a block - pricey Keen's steakhouse and Bryant Park Grill are right around the corner, but so are StellaTrattoria in Macy's and my personal favorite Playwright Irish Restaurant and Pub on 35th street. There is a handy Duane Reede and a few nice deli's for snacks.\n\nThe hotel provided a handout with advice on handling the event. Main points - the hotel does not have a special viewing area (but you can spend an extra few $100 to view from the 3rd floor lobby with brunch - otherwise this area is closed and blocked off from guests during the parade - more about this later). There is a delay re-entering the hotel after the parade because there are so many people coming and going. Bands practice across the street by macy's overnight - if you're a light sleeper - you'll hear them! If you're a fan, you'll enjoy them :)  Spoiler alert - Macy's actually films many performances starting at daylight in from of the store to insert with \"live coverage\" of the parade on tv  - but don't count on watching - they block the area off pretty well to lookers on.\n\nAfter the parade, you are landlocked. 6th Avenue is closed until about 6pm so they can restore all the street lights. Cabs going down 7th are already full and 7th is gridlocked. Cabs going up 8th are already full. Face it - you're stuck. Our solution was to walk down to Playwright's and enjoy their Thanksgiving special - it was amazing - a full traditional Thanksgiving spread for $35 a person - including the pumpkin pie. Or you could order off the menu - one of our girls had a steak and it was as big as the plate and perfectly cooked. We lingered a long time and the staff made us welcome and kept filling refills long after the bill was paid and tip rendered.\n\nHotel staffers Michael and Nicholas seemed to be everywhere, all the time. I don't think they sleep. But they were wonderful hosts and always ready to offer ideas or help and very accommodating to requests they could fulfill. Keep in mind, every single soul in the hotel wants to be front and center for the parade - so there are limits to what can be done to accommodate some requests. Some people who didn't plan ahead were particularly surprised and offended that they couldn't use the lobby during the parade. You'll find that EVERYPLACE that has a parade view is making the most of the $ return on that view for this day. Don't expect a free ride unless you watch on the street. The hotel's hiring strategy must be very special because we never encountered a sour face and they all seemed to be loaded with holiday cheer!\n\nSo what are some other strategies if you don't want to make yourself cozy in a parade view room to watch the parade?  Get an interior room (much cheaper!!!!!!!!!!) and sign up for the lobby parade\/brunch special - lots of room to spread out in the lobby (out of control kids alert) and there are doors to the outside \"porch\" that runs along the side street with a parade view - but you'll have to stand to see it out there. If the brunch special doesn't show on the website - call and ask for a reservation. Or combine an interior room with brunch at Stella's in Macy's - it's on the 2nd floor in Macy's - has its own elevator at the corner of Herald Square and a wall of windows looking out to 6th Avenue and the parade. Be prepared for some jostling in the beginning, but the parade is 3 hours long - reserve your energy at your table having the wonderful brunch and you can score a front row spot by the middle of the parade.  Again - you'll probably be standing but you'll have a reserved table to go back to and eat and this is a great, warm, view. OR reserve an interior room and head down to the street to watch the parade.  It is not nearly as crowded at 36th street as it is up by Central Park and gee, its the same parade. Be prepared to take a thermos of hot chocolate (warmed in the lobby microwave) and bundle up for the full frontal parade experience.  With 3 hours to watch - you can slip back to your room to warm up and watch a bit on tv before returning to the street.\n\nIf you're used to The Doubletree Times Square amenities, you'll see a contrast. There is no room service and although you can get a snack and coffee at the counter in the lobby - the hours are really limited. The few times we found ourselves there at lunch or breakfast (other than Thanksgiving), we made a deli run and had a \"picnic\" spread in the lobby - comfy chairs and plenty of space to spread out and visit with friends.  The twenty somethings visited the rooftop bar, The Monarch, one evening and it was empty - so empty that their waitress sat down with them for a while. Great views, astronomical prices, but worth a visit. For my money, I'd rather go back to Playwright's a have a soda and snack and watch sports on the gazillion flat screen tvs behind the bar. If only I could have had a leftover turkey sandwich with some dressing and cranberry sauce on the side, but I didn't have the nerve to ask.\n\nAll in all, I think this was a perfect spot for the parade, worth the extra $, a bargain compared to some of the Columbus Circle hotels, great proximity and view of parade, clean and comfy room, wonderfully accommodating staff, and once Macy's opens Thanksgiving evening, you can slip across the street and do your Black Friday shopping if that's your thing.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I did a lot of research and wanted to find a reasonable hotel ($300\/night) to stay at near or in the Parade route. So I decided to go with the Courtyard Herald square. I considered booking a room with a view of the parade so I wouldn't have to take my 2 year old son down to the street for a view. However, I couldn't justify paying the $800 a night charge for the a view. So I went with the regular room and decided to brave the crowd. When we got to our room I was very surprised to see that we had a clear view of 6th avenue exactly where the parade comes down. We were on a upper floor, but we couldn't ask for a better view in my opinion. This worked out perfectly for us, we watched the Parade live and didn't have to leave the warmth of our room. I'm not sure if this is a hidden secret, but if it is I am very happy we found it. I definitely recommend this hotel, on Thanksgiving or any other day of the year.

The price, though high compared to roadside hotels, was lower than comparable places in mid-town Manhattan ($266 including the various taxes).  The location was great for tourists - across the street from Macy's, one block from the Empire State, and a 10 minute walk to Times Square.

Mike the doorman does his best to be outgoing, cheerful and helpful. The hotel also has rooftop club, Monarch. When I returned to the hotel after an evening out I was greeted by the club bouncer and by hotel security. Note: if you plan to visit the Monarch, adhere to the dress code or you will not be admitted. \n\nThe hotel is experiencing growing pains. I felt as if my legs were being bitten as I sat at the desk in the room assigned to me.  I called the front desk and was eventually moved to another room. Management asked me to file a report about the room, which I did.  I soon learned that the rooms smoke alarm system is finely tuned to pick up ANY smoke or steam (this is non-smoking property). I opened the door after taking a hot shower and triggered the smoke alarm. I called the front desk within minutes a member of the maintenance team appeared and inquired about what happened. The fire department was also alerted and came to the hotel to reset the alarm.  I found out that the complaint about the 'biting' sensation and the smoke alarm trigger happen from time to time. I was disappointed to see long dark brown hair on the inside of the bathroom door (not my hair). Hopefully management can resolve these matters soon. \n\nI tried the hotel because of an offer from Amex.

I did not hear noise from other guests coming through the walls of our room at all, not even a peep.  \nLobby is nice and inviting, lots of seating, tables, booths, computers, and a cafe.  Rooftop bar was great when I was able to catch them at off-hours and not packed with huge parties of people with 'reserved' signs on every table--the view up there of the Empire State Bldg is worth the elevator ride alone.    \nSuper clean rooms; attentive and courteous housekeeping.  Very comfy beds and pillows, just wish they had been queen-size instead of full but I realize space is limited.  All linens were fresh and sparkling white throughout our entire visit.  Excellent a\/c that cooled off the room in a flash, thankfully, I think we were there during their hottest week of the year.  \nIt's been said before, I'll repeat it:  Michael the Doorman is the man!  Truly, he is at your service.  Always welcoming, sweet, helpful, personable and fun.  Not walking or taking the subway?  Michael will drop everything and get you a cab. \nSeesya later Michael!  Thanks for being a memorable part of our great vacation.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We found this at the Herald Square Courtyard.   Our rate was $377 a night in late August - and even cheaper than that if we didn't need a room with 2 beds.   Just a few yards in from 6th Avenue on 35th.   The only thing that is a little confusing is that the front door isn't really well marked.   I imagine that many people miss it the first time.   The other thing is that you go into the lobby it's the lobby to the building - not the hotel.   So you have to go up one floor to get to the hotel lobby.   It just not inherently obvious - especially if the doorman has stepped away.\n\nThe room was clean and quiet.   We were on the 15th floor with a city view.   Typical small room - as is usual case in the city.   A frig in the room was convenient (not a mini-bar).    The hotel does have a small restaurant.   We did not try the restaurant.   I know the breakfast was just a light breakfast buffet.   We opted to just grab a banana on the street and focus on a good lunch.   \n\nIf you aren't looking for a place with all the bells and whistles, this is a good hotel.   The location can't be beat.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had a great twin room on the 8th floor, very impressed with the room space as it's so hard to find a hotel room in NYC that can comfortably hold two people and shopping without tripping over each other! Tiny bathroom though with no bath and not the best shower but was super clean. \nRoom view wasn't that great but I guess the higher you go the better the view! \nStaff where friendly and helpful they even had there own laundry room, which was brilliant in 93 degree heat and we came home with a suitcase of clean washing a bonus.\n\nThe hotel is in a great location opposite Macy's and within walking distance of lots of tourist hotspots and great shopping! You may struggle to find a decent restaurant in the area that's not a tourist trap. It's better to head towards Greenwich village a few stops away on the metro (direst line) \n\nMy top tip would be to befriend the lovely concierge guy Michael he is a great source of information and he has a whole black book of top tips! \n\nPoint to note is there's only a very small cafe for breakfast mainly coffee and muffins perfect for a quick bit before heading out but not to give you lots of substance which is needed to hit all the shops. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the hotel and of course New York","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
