Great television. Small minibar available, safe, small but sufficient wardrobe.\n\nFairly large bathroom, with toilet but without bidet. Nice sink and great walk-in shower. No tub. The bathroom would be missing an extra shelf. Present products (shampoo, conditioner, creams, soaps), small toiletries and hairdryer.\n\nVery fast wifi and no disconnection.\n\nThe room is well heated, bright, quiet and very very comfortable. The large window with that wonderful view is its strong point. At sunset all the lights of the skyscrapers are turned on and the city shows itself in all its splendor. Really suggestive.\n\nDaily cleaning with change of towels. The room and bathroom were very clean.\n\nIf there had been a coffee machine with a few pods and a kettle of water, the room would have been perfect.\n\nThere is only one dispenser of still, sparkling or hot water available in the entire hotel. Maybe it would be good to put one on each floor.\n\nCheck-out is 11 a.m. and to keep our two trolleys in storage we were asked to pay 2 dollars for each package. This has never happened in any other hotel around the world. You can pay with cash and card.\nBut be careful: keep the receipt that is provided to you for luggage storage carefully because otherwise returning it becomes complicated and if you are in a hurry, you could waste time.\n\nOn the lobby floor there are many sofas where you can sit after checking out while waiting for your flight. There are several USB sockets for charging mobile phones and wifi is always available for free even after checkout, as is the very spacious and very clean toilet and, of course, the water dispenser. Excellent service.\n\nThe hotel is located in the Financial District, Lower Manhattan, within walking distance of several Subway lines. The beautiful and modern Oculus shopping center is just a stone's throw away. The Freedom Tower right in front, Wall Street very close. Area full of local shops and restaurants. Very recommended even if it takes 20\/30 minutes by subway or 40 minutes by taxi to get to Times Square.\n\nThe Washington by Luxurban hotel was an excellent discovery and, despite a couple of small shortcomings, it is absolutely recommended for a short stay in New York.\nRating 8.\n\n ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We arrived at the hotel in the evening 6\/12\/23 and checked out on 10\/12\/23. Check in was easy and straightforward, we were informed that the hotel was no longer serving breakfast and we would receive a $8 per night per person refund if we had booked with breakfast. For us, this wasn\u2019t an issue as we planned to eat elsewhere regardless. We stayed in room 1205, on floor 12 of 30. All lifts working. Room was clean and tidy. Views from the room were incredible. Huge windows with padding on ledge so you can sit and admire NYC. This hotel is literally next to the world trade centre and 9\/11 memorial. The free WiFi was very fast and didn\u2019t disconnect at all. Good shower with soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and hairdryer provided. Beds were comfortable and our room was cleaned everyday. On the final day, the hotel was able to store luggage, there is a surcharge for this of $2 per bag - which was fine for us. We stored 4 bags but they only changed us $6, the doorman was very helpful friendly. They take cash and card for this. \n\nIf you are planning to stay here when visiting NYC:\n\n\u2022The closest subway stations are probably going to be WTC, Rector Street and Wall Street. We found the subway easy to use, after 12 journeys in a week or after $34 you won\u2019t be charged any more to use it. We found this was the most cost and time efficient way of travelling. You can get the AirTrain from JFK (approx $8) to Jamaica. From there you can get an E train to WTC. The hotel will be about a 5 min walk from there. Although this journey took about an hour, this cost less than $12 each, whereas a taxi was going to be $50+. Do the reverse journey for your return. \n\n\u2022If I was to visit again coming from the UK, I would chose to stay Monday-Friday. We stayed Wednesday- Sunday and I personally found the Saturday to be overwhelming busy in NYC, particularly on the subway. However, it\u2019s a Saturday in the run up to Xmas - I should have expected it really. \n\nOverall a really pleasant stay. I would love to return to New York and stay here again.

I sent an email earlier this week with all of the information I thought was necessary for them to process the refund but added if they needed anything else to contact me.  Still no refund or even a response to my email to the refund specific email address.  I decided to go to trip advisor to see if anyone else has had the same issue and it appears that the treatment I am receiving is unfortunately the norm and not an unfortunate exception.

Camera al 19 piano con vista eccezionale sul World Trade Center e Ground Zero e molto silenziosa. Camera ampia con due letti matrimoniali comodi. Bagno sufficientemente grande per 2 adulti + 2 ragazzi. Pulizia quotidiana della camera. Molto apprezzata la possibilit\u00e0 di avere acqua fresca naturale\/gasata gratuita al 5 piano dove si trova la reception. A piano terra vi \u00e8 il bar per la colazione ed il deposito bagagli (2 dollari a collo) se si arriva prima del check in (ore 15.00) oppure per la partenza dopo aver lasciato la camera (entro ore 11.00). L'Hotel da l'impressione di essere lasciato un po' a se stesso: personale presente 24h24 ma non particolarmente attivo (trovi sempre qualcuno seduto alla reception, ma mai nessuno che lavora in giro per l'hotel), segni di rottura un po' dappertutto sia nella camera che negli spazi comuni. Macchia di umidit\u00e0 sul soffitto della doccia (presumo che provenisse dalla doccia della camera al piano superiore). Al 5 piano c'\u00e8\/c'era un bar completamente abbandonato: non che io venga a NY per stare al bar dell'Hotel, ma da un senso di completo abbandono. Capitolo a parte la colazione: i primi giorni devono avere avuto qualche problema con il bar e quindi veniva fornito un sacchetto con dentro una banana, uno yogurt e una brioche\/muffin confezionato, il tutto da consumarsi o in camera o al 5 paino negli spazi comuni (le bevande calde le ritiravi insieme al sacchetto); che tristezza. Poi hanno risolto il problema ed il bar \u00e8 tornato accessibile, ma la musica non \u00e8 cambiata: a parte il sacchetto e la possibilit\u00e0 di consumarla seduti ad un tavolino, quello che veniva offerto non \u00e8 cambiato con il pi\u00f9 il disagio di trovare un tavolo libero (il bar \u00e8 piccolo e l'Hotel \u00e8 grande) e possibilmente pulito (nessuno passava a liberare i tavoli). Quindi in sintesi il The Washington by LuxUrban \u00e8 stato probabilmente in passato un Hotel di uno certo standing, ma ora non lo \u00e8 pi\u00f9. Se si cerca un hotel senza grandi pretese, comodo al centro senza spendere le cifre degli hotel pi\u00f9 centrali e con una grande vista, questo va benissimo, ma se si vuole il lusso che reclamizza con il suo nome, cercatene un altro oppure aspettate che gli diano una rimodernata.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Cerca de la recepci\u00f3n hay una terraza con unas vistas espectaculares del World Trade Center. \nPara hacer turismo utilizamos las paradas de Wall St y Rector St. Subimos al One World  Observatoy, impresionante, estaba frente al hotel. La zona es segura,  hab\u00eda mucha polic\u00eda de NY y sistemas de bolardos para parar el tr\u00e1fico. Es una zona s\u00faper vigilada, con mucho turismo. Muchos sitios para comer y comprar ropa.  Nuestra experiencia fue muy positiva. Era la segunda vez que visit\u00e1bamos NY y quer\u00eda estar en otro zona distinta a la 42 St y sus alrededores. Puedes dejar la maleta abajo el dia de la salida, cuesta 2 d\u00f3lares. Nos pidieron un taxi, que era mucho m\u00e1s limpio que el que cogimos al llegar al aeropuerto.

I honestly thought I had a smoking room. The towel rail in the bathroom was hanging on for dear life, and the dark tiled floor of the shower room had been horribly repaired and re-grouted with white grout. Turn on the shower and instantly get soaked by freezing cold water. It baffles me why so little thought is put into bathroom design, and maintaining a property to original specifications seems beyond anyone's ability.\n\nThere is no coffee maker, no bottles of water. The AC worked, but when it powered down it sounded like someone was knocking my door.

As soon as I gave this info to the front desk, the reaction was very friendly and a room maid was sent to clean again (which helped a little).\nOne really annoying thing was, that we had chosen the hotel also because of the breakfast buffet - and exactly that had been abolished two days before our arrival. No excuses, no refund, nothing. We got paper bags in the restaurant with croissant\/muffin, fruit&yoghurt, banana. That was it. For us actually no problem, but there should have been some kind of explanation at least. The manager kept hiding in his office and I didn't bother to give him a call. The staff were also stressed by the situation of guests making complaints. And, the worst thing: Everything that was left in the bags simply got thrown in the garbage every hour twice or so - homeless people sitting everywhere in NYC!

There was a huge spot on the wall that had peeling paint. There were dirty handprints on the bedroom and bathroom walls. Upon taking a shower, I realized that someone's hair was tangled in the shower head, and strands of hair throughout the rest of the bathroom. There were no washcloths in the bathroom. The iron and ironing board had a purple gooey like residue (probably from a previous burn) that transferred onto my clothes. Although these issues made my stay very uncomfortable, I tried to look past them because I was only staying there for one night. \n\nOn the day of my departure, the room was without hot water for hours, and I needed to leave for a meeting. I expressed the issue of the hot water to staff several times and I don't feel like they acted fast enough to assist, given that I had somewhere to be. They kept saying the hot water was back, but that wasn\u2019t the case for my room, so I asked for another room to shower in. The manager finally came an hour after my first complaint, which was well after checkout time, offering to take me to the 20th floor. At that point the hot water was starting to come back, and I needed to leave, so I didn\u2019t have time to move to a different room. She took 50% off the room rate. \n\nI think this hotel uses pictures of their lobby to sell rooms, but there is nothing pleasing to the eye once you are beyond that point. The room I stayed in was very small. I always hear people say New York City hotel rooms are small, but I\u2019ve stayed in spacious rooms in the city plenty of times. The hallways are very dark and very dated. Not to mention, all the conversations and noises we could hear coming from other rooms. I will not stay at this hotel again, and will not recommend it to family and friends.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After some looking around, I found the entrance and the fifth floor of a building of this hotel. It was around 3pm afternoon.\n\nElevator stopped and I looked around at what seemed to be a hotel lobby. Dark, entrance, just like the everlasting mood of the receptionists of this hotel.\n\nI awkwardly moved to the end of the room where there was one person behind the counter. \n\nNo hi, no welcome, no are you here for the checking?, no I'll be with you in a moment, no eye contact. Just deafening silence. \n\nI checked in, they added the usual surcharge crap I always get in the states, and got 2 complimentary drinks (beer, wine, cocktails) vouchers for the restaurant. View from the room is a lie. Balcony is a lie. Usually, you would expect hotels to angle their pictures a bit and add the lights, but this is pushed to a point where it's annoying. \n\nThe receptionist informs me that I can choose the only left room on the 8th floor or on the 20th floor \u201cbut that's small so it's not really an option\u201d. I disregard the idiotic statement and move on. At this point I should have probably cancelled the whole thing and move to a new hotel, but my fatigue wins the argument.\n\nI get to the restaurant a couple of days later they blew me off and said we only give complimentary beer or wine. What a joke. \n\nTheir rooms are old and rugged, likely they weren't touched (renovated) for the last 20years or so.

Let me explain.\n\nI went to make a reservation for a high-quality hotel downtown, and saw from my search on Google hotels that the W Downtown was available at a decent price.  Trusting from the listing this was actually the W Downtown, I made a reservation.\n\nAfter making the reservation, I wanted to connect my Marriott awards account to my reservation get points for my stay.  It was then that I found out that the hotel was sold and is fraudulently trading on the W name through the various travel websites where it is listed.\n\nMy next thought was, ok, its a boutique now... let me see what the reviews are like under new management and maybe I'll keep the reservation, and boy were the reviews bad as evidenced on this and other review sites.\n\nSo I thought, fine, if this is the case, I'm getting a refund as I was sold the hotel room under false pretence.\n\n I get in touch with Traveleuro (Splitty), they tell me they don't know the hotel changed hands (Sure...) and they have a no cancellation policy, but they'll escalate. I said I'll escalate too if I have to and dispute this charge as my credit card company has a no fraud policy and its an easy win.\n\nFrom there, the latest is that I get a message from traveleuro\/Splitty stating they indeed confirmed with the hotel it changed names and is under new management, but when they asked for an approval from the hotel for a cancellation they denied it (wow).\n\nThey are going to, they told me, get in touch with one of their \"other travel partners\" to see if they can resolve this in my favour. Good for you.\n\nTo which I replied I'm not only disputing the charge, but also contacting Marriott (I did) to let them know these companies are trading on the W name fraudulently, and if I don't get a refund, I'll contact AMEX and dispute this charge and post a negative comment on every major travel site.\n\nSo the moral of this story is, don't be fooled by this hotel being listed as the W Downtown - it isn't, and based on the review, it's gone way downhill since it was sold.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":23719753,"title":"Disappointing and eyebrow-raising.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-03-30","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"My partner and I visited at this hotel for a total of 7 nights in late March 2022. I booked this hotel primarily due to the cost, as I had booked it in part with a redemption of air miles so I managed to obtain a drastically reduced price. The hotel\u2019s location and online photo gallery also seemed pretty attractive. Sadly, however, my expectations were not fully met upon arrival.\n\nWhat I very quickly learned is that The Washington seems to be a fairly young hotel, and occupies the building of the old W Downtown hotel and residences. This is fine - the decor has remained from when it was a W Hotel so the lobby and rooms are decorated to a very modern standard and are kept looking nice. However, everything else surrounding the ethos of a W Hotel is gone: service is non-existent, claimed amenities do not exist anymore, and the hotel is more reminiscent of an apart-hotel. Rather than being the \u201cboutique hotel\u201d that they claim to be, The Washington provides a bed and that is about it. Nonetheless, I provide here a comprehensive review of The Washington, highlighting both the positives and negatives of my stay.\n\nThe Washington is in a very attractive location. It\u2019s across the street from the World Trade Centre, and we had an outstanding view of the 9\/11 Memorial Pools and the One World Trade Centre\/Freedom Tower. It\u2019s only a few minutes away from many local transport connections including the subway and PATH trains over to New Jersey. Local facilities in the area are somewhat limited and expensive, given its proximity to the financial centre of New York - though convenience stores, coffee shops, cafes, and the like are no more than a few minutes away. The building of the hotel itself is a fairly nicely presented skyscraper, still baring the signs of it formerly being a W Hotel and still flying the W flag above the door - which was strange to say the least. It is beginning to look a little rundown, so a good clean of the exterior would not go a miss.\n\nWe arrived at The Washington at around 14:00 on the day of our check in. The reception is located on the 5th floor, and there are no staff on the front doors guiding guests to the reception or anybody available to help with luggage. We were able to check in almost immediately, which was much appreciated. I was charged a ridiculously expensive deposit on the room and a $20 per night \u201cresort fee\u201d, the purpose of which I am still confused about. The lady who checked us in was friendly enough, though my positive experience with staff at the hotel stopped at this point. On all of the other occasions when I passed through the lobby or asked reception a question, I was frequently met with a rude member of staff who was typically sat lounging about and on their mobile phone, not even stopping to look at me or greet me. On more than one occasion there was nobody even on the reception but they were rather lounging on the few sofas in reception. It was also notoriously hard to reach the reception and I couldn\u2019t work the in-room phone at all. \n\nThere are three elevators which operate between the ground floor and the reception: these worked well consistently. The other elevators which operate between the reception and guest rooms were not as consistent. On two days we had to use the service elevator as they seemed to be out of service. These elevators are also showing signs of age: one of them has had a panel screwed onto the ceiling, indicating damage, and another is simply very dirty. The service lifts were also unpleasant and generally not a nice experience.\n\nThe halls to the guest rooms are incredibly dark. They are decorated nicely enough, but they almost have a sleezy look to them. There are no windows in the halls and I did not particularly enjoy walking around these areas. Many of the guest room doors are also scratched or showing signs of strange damage. \n\nOur room was located on the 17th floor. I was surprised at the size of it - it was definitely larger than other New York hotels in the area and boasted, as outlined above, a very nice view. The bedroom was cleaned to a high standard. In-room amenities were present, but limited: there was a safe, a mini-fridge, an iron, an unnecessarily large TV and an in-room phone. The TV worked well, though it had limited channels and the Netflix option did not work. I could not manage to work the in-room phone either. \n\nThe bathroom featured a large rainfall shower, sink, and toilet. When we arrived, Molton Brown miniature toiletries were in the bathroom though this was not maintained consistently throughout our stay, as I will outline in a moment. The bathroom was not as clean as I would expect: there was a notable amount of black mould around shower ceiling and tiles, and the toilet seat had been scratched or damaged.\n\nThe room that we were provided with had an inter-room connecting door, and as such the noise levels in the room were at times a nuisance and troublesome. The two groups of people who checked into the room next door during our stay were obnoxiously loud, and the thinness of the walls as well as the inter-room connecting door only further amplified this noise. When I complained to the reception, they sent security to the room but were otherwise unwilling to help.\n\nHousekeeping was present in this hotel and I mostly commend the housekeepers. They consistently serviced our room each day, providing us with fresh towels and new toiletries though they were often mismatched and not always Molton Brown as advertised. The room was vacuumed daily. As for the bed linen, these were changed only once during our week long stay. While housekeeping did make our beds, I noticed that the sheets were simply put back onto the bed and not refreshed. The two women who serviced our room throughout the week were friendly, and I commend their service.\n\nThe hotel, seeming to cling onto the old W Downton vibe and online photo gallery, claims to provide services that do not exist. There is apparently a terrace on the 5th floor. The outdoor space is indeed there, but it is inaccessible. Similarly, photos show a bar in the reception. The bar is there, but it is dilapidated and unused. Photos indicate that there is a rooftop area with loungers, though these were again not accessible. \n\nAs such, catering was essentially non-existent at the hotel. While there is a bar\/restaurant at street level, it did not particularly intrigue me enough to try it and I instead had to venture out for basics even such as breakfast and bottled water.\n\nOne final event which gave me a bad impression was that when we checked out, we asked to leave two small bags at the hotel for a few hours until our flight. This was swiftly rejected, claiming initially that it\u2019s because of COVID-19, before the man then simply said there is no storage room. I don\u2019t understand either of these claims. \n\nAs a whole, The Washington could be a lovely hotel. It occupies a nice building in a good area and has inherited W Hotels\u2019 vibe to it. However, the hotel management should decide whether they want to be The Washington - the \u201cboutique hotel\u201d they claim to be - or W Downton 2.0. If they want to maintain W\u2019s vibes, they should therefore also maintain or surpass W\u2019s service. Otherwise, the hotel needs to become a lot more transparent in its advertising and stop claiming to have certain facilities and features that it simply does not. \n\nI am unsure as to how the hotel claims to be 4.5 stars. I would rate it more a 3 star budget hotel based on its inadequate service. The Washington could indeed be a 4.5 star hotel, but it is nowhere near that level at present.\n\nSince I did not pay a full cash price for this stay, I am not as bitter as I otherwise would be. Nonetheless, I still do not think that the air miles that I redeemed, the cash surplus, the deposit, and the resort fee were justified in cost. I am somewhat resentful of how much I ended up paying for this room, as I know that I could have gotten much better service from another nearby hotel for roughly the same cost.\n\nAt present, I would not recommend this hotel and I would not return to it. That being said, I hope that the hotel will increase its standards in due course.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Whoever bought it did not make edits, so it has the W feel, but it needs maintenance. My room was clean, but needed some TLC. Thin walls. I heard my neighbor\u2019s alarm go off and a lot of elevator dinging (my room was a couple rooms down). 20$ resort fee for a couple waters. Staff was helpful and pleasant. It\u2019s near the world trade so I would return when I have to be down there although not enthusiastically.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our room was covered in dust, the bathroom had hair and some dried fluid (who knows what) on the toilet and sink. The fridge had black mold in it. The shower had not been cleaned. We had to use the service elevator during our 5 day stay. We wanted to leave our bags the day we checked out since we had a later flight, but they couldn\u2019t accommodate us. It\u2019s weird because they said it was because of Covid, but we stayed at the Hotel right across the street in July of this year and they were fully staffed, cleaned our rooms, brought us towels and let us leave our bags. I believe the owner is taking advantage of the staff and Covid situation here. They seem overworked and underpaid. I expect so much more from a hotel with this rating. They even charged us a resort fee with no amenities. Our floor smelled of smoke for half of our stay. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to stay. To the owner, hire some bellman and more housekeeping staff. Fix your phones.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Beim Einchecken hat alles super geklappt. Die Leute waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbewusst. Hatten unser Zimmer im 15 Stock mit einem atemberaubenden Blick auf Ground Zero und das World Trade Center. Das Zimmer war f\u00fcr New Yorker Verh\u00e4ltnisse gro\u00df. Es war sauber und wurde jeden Tag gemacht, was leider f\u00fcr New York nicht selbstverst\u00e4ndlich ist. Weil wir am Abreisetag das Gep\u00e4ck wegen COVID nicht deponieren konnten durften wir bis um 16:00 auf dem Zimmer bleiben. Wir k\u00f6nnen das Hotel nur empfehlen.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}
