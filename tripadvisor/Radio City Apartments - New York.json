I like older mid-town hotels,for both the price and location.  Examples might be the huge Edison, the botique Belvedere, and this former apartment hotel.  It seems every room has a full kitchen.  This would be a lot handier if there was a decent grocery in the area, but I like exploring on the subway.  And there are a couple small groceres 5-6 blocks away.\n\nOn two stays my view was practically non-existent, and on one occasion, I could hear what sounded like drag racing down nearby Broadway well into the morning.\n\nAgain, however, the price was right, the room comfortable and clean, with nice guests I would run into.  There is a good (and popular) Italian retaurant on the first floor and numerous options in the area.  For a decent traditional breakfast I did have to walk three blocks to Bennegans (Applebee's?)  which was great.  This is an awesome location for theater goers, which was why I came.  I don't expect a lot of service, and had no problems to call down for.  But a place like the Marriott Marquee on Times Squre would probably have run me $200 more per night and wouldnt have had the convenience of the kitchen.  I'm a big fan of the RCA.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

Avoid eating in Times Square and go to Hell's Kitchen where the food is good and more reasonable. The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly, obliging and professional and the few requests we had were immediately seen to. The flat is well air-conditioned, housekeeping comes in daily to make the beds and change towels.....the hotel is very clean.Our flat had a view on tall buildings and despite facing the street, we did not get disturbed by any noise (air-conditioning helped). The beds were very comfortable. We didn't use the pull-out couch for sleeping as the 2 beds in the second bedroom were large enough for two children each. The hotel was the best price quality accommodation I could find in that location and I would definitely recommend it (especially for families). We were allowed a late checkout until 12 am and left our luggage with the reception until our departure in the afternoon. The hotel is very close to the subway (we took the subway back and changed in Queens to take the air train to JFK...took about 1hr15 minutes total whereas the cab when we arrived took about 40 minutes). Advice buying the one week metro pass (about 30 dollars, the air train is about 8 dollars a head from queens to JFK).\nI also advise buying the New York pass for first comers....very economical for those who want to do tons of sightseeing like us.\nWe loved our stay....hotel is very good and we would definitely stay there again.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The guy on the front desk was less than average - provided us with absolutely no information when we checked in. Did not know what time to check out, where the laundry facilities were, etc. There is also no compendium in the room to give information about the hotel and nearby facilities. He basically gave us our keys (which were physical keys, not key cards) and that was it. \n\nThe room suited us well for the 5 nights that we stayed there, and its proximity to Times Square and subway stations was fantastic. However, Friday & Saturday nights, bring ear plugs or don't expect to get any sleep. The noise from bars below as well as crowds and traffic for Times Square was insane (and we were on the 10th floor!) The other alternative is that you go and join the madness below so then you are kept awake.\n\nLaundry facilities are in the basement free of charge to guests. HOWEVER, they're only able to be used between 8pm and 8am because these are the washers used by the cleaning staff to clean the bedding and towels. The timing was super inconvenient for us. \nWe asked for house keeping only one of the days that we were there and it was also below average. Towels got replaced, but sheets were not changed, dishes were not washed that we had in the sink. We had left a tip so we expected more to have been done. There are separate window air con in the bedroom and the lounge which are very noisy and the hotel 'hums' when these are turned off, so I would not recommend this place to anyone who is a light or sensitive sleeper. \n\nAll in all, the only thing saving this hotel is its location and relative cheap price compared to other hotels in the area. The building is older with solid walls and floors so no noise from other apartments. There are 2 elevators and they take forever to get you anywhere. Leave your room a few minutes earlier if you need to be anywhere in a hurry! \n\nWe would only ever return to this hotel and recommend to others if they specifically needed to stay in this area, or were only staying for a few days excluding weekends.

Its a shoe box. Book the deluxe studio or the one bedroom apartment. Even if you book the deluxe studio, be aware there is no closet or place for you to store your suitcases. You will have to keep them standing next to your bed because there is no place for them.  We booked a room for a couple and a twelve years old child and we thought it was too small for the three of us in the room. The beds were not spacious.

I really don't understand why all hotels offer 2 double beds when you're travelling with 2 teenagers. This hotel was the only one that remotely met our requirements with 2 double beds in one room and a sofa bed in the living room. The kids said their beds were very comfortable, the sofa bed however was a little tired, not sure we could have used it for any longer than the 4 nights we stayed. Having the kitchenette was a real bonus. The rooms and the property were very clean and the staff were really helpful and friendly. Its a nice touch that they'll hold your luggage if you have a late flight. The location of this hotel was brilliant with subway stations on the next block and on the corner, restaurants and shops all around you and Times Square just a couple of blocks walk away.

Nos dieron el apartment 410, situado justo al frente de una construcci\u00f3n, a menos de 10 metros.  A las 7 am empezaban con la fuerte bulla, incluido el domingo.  Despu\u00e9s de la primera noche fuimos a hablar con recepci\u00f3n para cambiar.  Nos ofrecieron un cambio pero en 2 horas que hac\u00eda check out otro departamento y nosotros ya quer\u00edamos salir a conocer la ciudad.

When we arrived at the apartment, we realized it was a handicap-equipped apartment.  We immediately went back downstairs to request another apartment.  Javier was wonderful.

Minutes from Broadway, Rockefeller Centre, Bryant Park, Time Square and the action of NY . Position will not disappoint. Rooms are tired but a decent size for the location - we had two double beds in bdrm and a sofa bed in lounge with triple aspect so size will not disappoint and you forgive the decor.  The shared areas are well maintained. The rooms were quiet and no sound of road noise or a city going to work. However what was not shared was that a new building was going up beside you - eye level to fifth floor at present and the noise at start up early in morning was unbelievably loud and unacceptable - no mention made at checkin or at booking and to me this should have been an essential . Check out was easy for us but I read the reviews and realized we had to make it downstairs before the lifts jammed up and people became hostile at the service they received at reception however there was one very frustrated young woman who was being quite rudely treated as I waited . There was often chaos happening and frustrated guests as we went in and out - so you need to be organized and aware of times as you check out or it will disappoint. The staff were the worst I have encountered ever at a reception desk. The staff that were great was the security man that always met you with a smile , the porter who was wonderful and the maintenance man who bought us a heater - so Thank-you . The main staff reception require lessons in good manners, good grace , customer service and humility . My complaint regarding someone opening our door with a key after midnight was met with disdain . When I rang to find out the outcome I was told he had sent up security and that someone had mistakenly opened door - after repeating my complaint that someone actually had a key and it was unacceptable they had access to our room he dealt with it by over speaking - he  was arrogant and fobbed me off - he finally asked what I wanted and I said to be reassured so he rudely offered to shift us - however it was 1.15 am and I felt this was more stressful . He said he would write it down in the book - two days later and no mention of apology - so if like me you are part of a group of women traveling and you want to feel you are safe then this property was a huge disappointment to me . However if you want it written in the book of safety you will not be disappointed.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The service was very poor and the people were rude. My friend and I stayed here the week before christmas. It was cold outside and the room was freezing as well. There was no thermostat in the room and upon calling, we were told there was nothing they could do about it. The room was unbearably cold. There was a kitchenette in the room, but the stove and oven were not functioning, and we had to turn on the refrigerator ourselves. \nIt was incredibly noisy, but I understand due to the location. Which I may say is amazing. Very close to many attractions and a subway station. The location is the only thing that made this hotel a decent place to stay. \nEverything was very outdated and seemingly dirty. However, the service was horrific. We were barely acknowledged during our stay here. When we contacted about the heating issue we were basically dismissed. The service and lack of heating inevitably led myself and my friend to check out early and relocate. \nFollowing our stay, I had realized I had left two items in our room. Upon calling, I told them exactly what I left and where I remember leaving them. I was told they did not find anything and they could do nothing more. They did not offer to double check or look in the location where I told them my items were. I am very disappointed I will never get my items back. I do realize I should've double checked myself before leaving, but the hotel should have at least offered to look again. \nLastly, upon checking in to the hotel, they take a $250 deposit in case of broken items, smoking in the room, etc. as many hotels do. I was told when I checked in that the deposit would be reimbursed among checking out. That was not the case. About 5 days after checking out, I had still not received my deposit back. I called the hotel and they told me some banks take a week to refund the account. Which is understandable. Today, it has been over TWO WEEKS since I have checked out, and I still have NOT received my money back. \nOverall, I would recommend that anyone should find another place to stay while visiting New York City. I strongly advise against staying at Radio City Apartments.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff is super friendly and helped my wife get our luggage from the curb to our room while I parked the car (more on that later). We had a one-bedroom apartment, which had a fridge, oven, and microwave. Everything is clean; they provide the standard stuff in the kitchen, such as utensils, pots, pans, plates, etc.\n\nFor cruisers, this is a great spot if you want to spend a night or two before heading out on your cruise. We left from Bayonne\/Cape Liberty on Royal Caribbean and spend 3 nights at Radio City. Since we had the car, we were able to pack breakfast, lunch, and dinner in order to save some significant money. Given the location, we were able to head back to the hotel every night for dinner and then back out again for activities. We packed lunch, water, and snacks in backpacks.\n\nTIPS:\n1. Parking: I parked at a garage 2 blocks away heading west on 49th street. I had never driven into Manhattan before and was a bit apprehensive, so I used the ParkWhiz app to secure a spot at 225 West 49th Street. It's less than a 5 minute walk and the car is pointing in the right direction after you drop off passengers and luggage at the hotel. I would highly recommend this garage.\n2. Subway: We purchased the unlimited weekly pass for $34\/person. It's just easier that way. We found the 50th & Broadway station to be the easiest to use, especially since most of our itinerary was to the south.\n3. Drop off\/loading: There is no loading\/unloading area, but the street in front of the hotel is very wide. Again, as a first time driver into the city, this worried me, but it turned out to be nothing to worry about.\n\nWith all that, I spent a lot of time in advance researching hotels in the city. This one turned out to be a real find. Go ahead and book it!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Earplugs help, especially if you\u2019re a light sleeper. \nCleanliness: it wasn\u2019t terrible, but it wasn\u2019t great either.

Times Square & Rockefeller Center are both within a 5-10 minute walk, all the Broadway theaters are within a 10-15 minute walk and Central Park is about a 40-45 minute walk away.\n\nThere are multiple Subway Stations within a short radius of the hotel, meaning easy access to get wherever you need to go; we were able to use the Subway to get to Yankee Stadium, the World Trade Center\/9-11 Museum & Memorial and Battery Park where we took the Staten Island Ferry.\n\nAs for the hotel itself, it was great.  We had a Queen room which featured a queen bed (obviously), a small kitchenette (fridge, microwave and small gas stove) and a private bath.  To be fair, the room was small but that's what we were expecting; the room was more like what you'd find in Europe than what you'd find in one of the big chain hotels and some people might be put off by that.  \n\nHaving kitchen facilities in the room was nice as we were able to grab some groceries (there's a spot called \"Food Emporium\" just down the street, about a 10 minute walk away) so we were able to have breakfasts and snacks in the room.\n\nThe only real negative that I came across was the noise from the street below but that was really only an issue for the first night.  Car horns honking, the occasional sirens wailing and loud music from speakers attached to the pizza restaurant all echoed up between the buildings but truthfully, by the second night we were there, I didn't even notice it anymore.\n\nThe staff were super-friendly, the room was clean and comfortable and we heard zero noise from any of the neighbors.

We were met by some really friendly staff on arrival and checking in was swift. Reception area is small but manageable with a small seated area for resting. Lifts up to the floors are a little shaky and tired, our floor was floor 11.

I have done a lot of camping in my time and am used to getting by and I wouldn\u2019t have fancied making a hot meal in the room. We only used the fridge for drinks cold meats and cheese. We ate a takeout meal in the room once or twice but had to eat it on the bed.\nOkay negatives out of the way. The good points: the location of the hotel for the price is amazing. 5 mins walk from Times Square, A subway 2 mins away. For a city a relatively quiet room. Everything worked in the room, good shower, free wifi, clean room, friendly helpful staff. Free use of a safe in reception. \u2018Halal Guys\u2019 street food on 49th street corner, very tasty. A supermarket a few blocks away, you can eat hot food there, bit like UK \u2018Wholefoods\u2019 supermarkets. A \u2018Toasties\u2019 deli diner 2 doors away, good for breakfast.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Kitchen facility is very good with a coffee machine and microwave, oven and stove  so we saved money making our own breakfast and other meals every day. Concierge is very helpful. They have umbrellas we can use when it rains (it did rain for a few days when we were in NYC). There are a lot of restaurants in the area - our fave is the Chinese restaurant downstairs which was not too expensive at all and various food trucks along the street during the day.

Est\u00e1 en 49th entre la 6ta y la 7ma, o sea literalmente a metros del Rockefeller Center, de Times Square, de Broadway y del acceso a varias l\u00edneas de subte que lo llevaran a cuatro de los cinco distritos que componen la ciudad.

Room was very dated, the rooms were very hot, so needed them to adjust the temperature. Kitchenette was well appointed and grocery stores close by if you are wanting something simple or have breakfast before you visit the sites of NYC. Subway close to take the red line down to Chambers Street if wanting to visit Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty. Make sure if you are wanting to visit the Crown, you book well in advance as they sell out months prior particularly for tours of the festive season. I would also recommend booking the tour online from the official site, as this will save you a few dollars.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Am searching for bad things to say about the place so that it doesn't get overrun by yuppies and so that most of us don't get priced out - lol.  I paid about $100 a night, which is a bargain for the area.\n\nThe positives and the negatives about this place are summed up by the word \"location\".  While six blocks away from 42nd Street, this place is still a block away from the Times Square strip.  If you stay here, you will want to take the subway to 50th Street or find some other way that doesn't take you through Times Square.  Traversing packed Times Square with luggage is not a good idea.  The location also puts you a block from Radio City Music Hall and the NBC Studios.  Other parts of Rockefeller Center as well as MoMA and NY City Center are also not far.\n\nAn old, interesting building.  My guess is that it was formerly a condominium and there is a mix of residents and hotel guests presently.  I'm unsure though.\n\nEasy check-in and the hotel staff are very nice.  They answer the phone promptly when you call the front desk too.  Very nice people and I can't say enough good things about the staff.\n\nThe room was equipped with a fairly full kitchen and basic cookware\/utensils - full size frig, oven\/stove, and microwave all provided.  There was a table with two chairs.  TV with HBO.  Bed was comfortable.  A small set of drawers.  Pretty normal bathroom.  No in-room safe but decent deadbolt on the front door of the room.  Everything was clean.  Decor is inoffensive and not trendy.\n\nI'm unsure that this property has an exercise room but I was able to use a location of my gym chain.  (Plus, it's NYC.  Who worries about exercise after walking around the city all day?)\n\nI would stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

It was perfect for our family of four including our teenagers. The beds were firm but we found them comfortable. The bathroom is accessible through the bedroom. Towels were plentiful. I read reviews that the hotel was dated however I think it was updated but kept the brownish\/rust colored furnishings of older times. Housekeeping kept our room clean however they did not do the dishes. I would have washed the dishes prior to using them had I known this.  Kitchen soap, sponge and towel were provided. The air conditioner in the bedroom was loud but it managed to drown out the noise of the city streets. The living room area had a separate air conditioner that was quiet so the outside noises could be heard throughout the night. There  was a full size refrigerator\/freezer, small oven\/cooktop, microwave, and  coffee maker. The hotel provided umbrellas for the brief showers were encountered. I did a load of laundry in the basement ($1.75 I think, bring your quarters!) The housekeepers use the dryers and they kindly removed the towels so I could dry my load. All the staff were very pleasant. We ate a very reasonably priced (for NYC) breakfast at Toasties two doors down. Be sure and check this place out. It was always busy with local business workers. Subway station was on the corner, Times Square around the corner, Rockefeller Plaza two blocks down.

We enjoyed having the space that gave us as a family. The apartment was very clean. We had a blocked toilet on arrival. When we phoned reception someone came straight up. It didn\u2019t solve it though so we had to have a second visit the next day, this time Felice (sorry if spelled wrong) left us the plunger, which we did have to use as it blocked with little encouragement. The filter coffee machine was also broken, but Felice found me another one. On two days out of six our apartment wasn\u2019t serviced. The day after the first time I mentioned this to reception, only as we were heading out then and to make sure they did it that day. The guy on the desk immediately phoned housekeeping and told me it\u2019s because the sign on the door said do not disturb. This wasn\u2019t the case, but he was brusque and having none of it. I didn\u2019t bother mentioning the second time. We were out between 10 and 4, so there should have been ample time. When the rooms were serviced, they did a good job making the place very clean and tidy. \n\nWe were very glad of the location, it made it as easy as possible to get around with a choice of nearby subway stations and plenty within walking distance. The location does mean there is a lot of noise. The apartments are not well sound-proofed to the street noises. The air-con consists of units embedded in the lower part of each window in each room. They cool effectively but destroy the integrity of the double glazing so sound proofing is minimal. We were on the 9th floor and glad we were no lower. There is also building work going on nearby which starts at 7am until about 5pm. It is intrusively loud during those hours. It would be wise to check before booking whether it will be finished before your trip. \n\nThe apartment was just as it looked in the pictures, but I agree with other reviewers who have commented on the need for an update. The decor didn\u2019t bother me, but I think the place needs maintenance so it all works as it should. \n\nBeds were comfy, sofa not so much. My kids called it the whoopee cushion sofa due to the noises it made when you sat down on it. Big fridge with freezer, which was great. Kettle on a gas hob. Good lighting options in each room. Shower over bath, didn\u2019t try a bath but it was very shallow. Shower was effective although seemed to be not much hot water last thing at night, although plentiful in the mornings. \n\nFront desk were helpful in booking us a cab for the airport although wouldn\u2019t let me pay the bill the night before our early start.

My teenage son walked into the lobby first, in time to witness the desk clerk in a headlock.  Seconds later, I literally had to jump out of the way as the desk clerk was thrown to the ground.  At first I thought the desk clerk was being attacked by someone off the street, but then I realized his opponent was an employee also.  In addition to my family, the altercation was witnessed by a group of young ladies who were terrified to enter the lobby while trying to get to their room.  After the altercation turned into a finger-poking, face-to-face screaming match, our two groups managed to slip by to the elevator, seemingly unnoticed by the two employees still shouting at each other.  Other than the fight our stay was good, so hopefully this hotel resolves their staff anger management issues before it escalates.  The rooms were decent size for NYC, and clean.  No issues there.

Plenty of room for all of us. Pretty spacious for NY standards I think. It was great having the  kitchenette with a full size frig (for water and leftovers) and a microwave.  The bathroom is small with only a pedestal sink, which meant 3 women had to be creative getting ready in the morning, but there was a big mirror in the bedroom above the dresser and a big full size mirror just outside the bathroom. Also a kitchen sink to brush teeth, etc. We were supplied with plenty of towels and blankets. Lots of food nearby... Toasties, for a great breakfast. A quick, 'grab a piece of pizza' attached, and Pasta Lovers, a nicer sit down place attached also. And food trucks up and down the street, with the best Philly Cheese steak sandwich at midnight after the Tonys.  We even had a view of the city with this room, but don't know how long that will last...looks like they just tore a building down and are going to be building something there...probably something that will block that view. I can't think of a reason not to stay there.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The plusses: If you want to be near to the Broadway theaters, this is a good option. The price is better, for the most part, if you are needing 3 or more beds. Window Acs work well. The kitchen supplies were adequate. It is next door to Radio City Pizza, so you can grab a bite before or after your daily activities. Nice at the front desk. As we stayed there 10 years ago, I was not expecting anything other than an older building with older rooms, but there were significant renovations that were surprisingly nice. I know other reviewers said it is old and needs renovations, and I suppose I could have said that, but there were positive renovations since our last visit. Minuses: Now this is extremely important to me -  cleanliness. The cleaning during our stay was completely inadequate. Might as well have kept the do not disturb sign and let no one in. The only thing that was done daily - clean linens, fresh coffee supplies, beds made up. Floors were never cleaned. Toilet paper roll was empty and not a new one placed. Bathroom definitely not cleaned. The in-room bathroom amenities - I usually leave my items at home and use hotel's-I do not recommend that here - only small shampoos, no conditioner, no lotions. Soap fresh, so-so. I really did not drop the stars to where it really should go, because this place is still a good option, as long as you bring your own bath amenities and either are OK with poor housekeeping or you complain and get it corrected. I just don't like to argue a point with management during my stay.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My first reaction was fear that I would get shoulder pain in the morning cause mattress is pretty firm (i have a thoracic outlet syndrome and pretty cranky about pillows and mattresses). Next morning I was super fresh and even felt better than after sleeping in my own bed. \nAfter a while, I contacted the apartments and, to my big surprise, reservation manager Tina got back to me with information about the mattress and even provided the manufacturer phone number.

(1106)  my biggest fear, after reading reviews, was not being able to control the room's temp\/ not having a thermostat.  I nearly cancelled my reservation out of that fear....true story.  BUT---we had a window a\/c unit that we had on at all times....never felt uncomfortable with the room's temp!  And both of us normally use a sound machine to sleep at night, so the a\/c worked as white noise.  It pretty much drowned out noise from the street as wee as surrounding rooms, as well.  (**Just an FYI: I learned that ALL NYC building from before 1980 have steam heat, thus lack any duct work.  The only option on those buildings is window unit a\/c.  Even Jackie O had window units, living in her park ave apartment.   This building is super old and historic, so it too has steam heat\/ window units.  )\n\nThe beds are a little hard, but i never woke up achey.....have definitely slept on worse.  We had a hairdryer, iron, ironing board, microwave, mini fridge, dishes, utensils, paper towels and dishsoap.  Oh, and a coffee pot....though we bought ours at all the cafes in the area.\n\nThis was my 3rd trip to Manhattan but my first time staying in the Times Square\/ theatre district.  #1, i think i may have to ALWAYS stay in this area.  If you are planning on seeing a show (or 2!) every day, it is wonderful being at a hotel where you can run back to for a 15 min break before heading to the theatre a block away.  #2 this hotel is the MOST CONVENIENTLY located, affordable hotel.  It is like 2 or 3 blocks straight down 7th avenue to the \"red steps\" at Times Square.  All 3 of our shows were within 1 block.  And Rockefeller Center is 1 block east down 49th.  It is steps to everything Midtown! \n\nI would give this place 5 stars if it did 1 thing (or does this count as 3 things?): update the bed spread, bed skirt, and curtains.  Sooooooo not a big deal to me, but the REST of it is updated.  If those 3 things didn't scream 1990's, it would feel extremely high end. (And they'd probably charge more!)

We (2 people) stayed in a TINY Queen studio with a little sink, microwave and refrig. The bathroom was also small but well-appointed and had plenty of towels. The staff was friendly enough. The hotel was very busy too, people were coming in and out steadily while we were there. The room was noisy because the hallways are narrow, at least on the floor we were staying. It reminded me of the New York apartments you see on \"Law and Order.\" You can hear the goings-on in the room next to you and door slamming across the way. Also, please understand that you will hear street sounds. We were on the 11th floor and still heard traffic, but after a while it becomes background noise. The only complaints I had were that the sheets were really dingy, though they smelled clean. I was kind of put off by that. I also found the mattress to be uncomfortable. All in all, the place is serviceable. No, the hotel is not the most modern but if you are in NYC you probably aren't spending a ton of time in the hotel anyway.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1397856,"title":"Pro's and Con's","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-03-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Overall, I'd say this hotel is average to above average. I will say that I'm stunned that so many reviewers before me gave it 5 out of 5.\n\nIt's been a while (decades) since I last drove into Manhattan, so I was a little nervous about getting to the hotel, unloading bags, parking, etc. When we pulled up, there were about 2-3 spots right out front, which surprised me. It gave my mother (the person who booked the trip) a chance to run in and talk to the front desk attendant, and I didn't have to stress about being double-parked. That was a bonus.\n\nThe hotel works in conjunction with two local garages to offer discounted parking for guests, which is helpful. Still expensive to park for 1-2 days (it's Manhattan, after all), but it's not of control. It cost $70 (total) for 2 days in the Rockefeller Center parking garage, which is a relatively short walk from the hotel.\n\nWe had originally booked what I believe was a 2-bedroom suite (or something along those lines). There was an issue that prohibited them from giving us that type of room when we arrived, so they offered two separate rooms for the same price, which we took. We had to wait a little bit to get in (We walked around a little), but they did have us in before regular check-in time, which was appreciated.\n\nWe were initially given 1208 and 1211. Only 1208 was ready. OMG. In my opinion, and I'm not over-the-top picky, this room was small and dated. We were stunned, and not in a good way, because this room looked nothing like the pics we had seen online. Wow. The door for 1211 was open as well, and although it appeared to be a bigger room, it was still not what we were expecting. All of this was addressed at the front desk, and they did offer to move us to 704 and 706. Again, this was appreciated, and the difference between these rooms and 1208\/1211, was very noticeable. The rooms on the 7th floor (the ones we saw), were way more up-to-date, including the kitchen areas.\n\nThe beds were comfortable, and the rooms were relatively clean. No issues to speak of on that front. It was weird because, while it was obvious that money had been spent to upgrade the kitchen and bath areas, the bedding, walls, phones, etc., are in need of a serious upgrade. The thermostat situation was odd as well, mainly because there isn't one to be found. I spent 15 minutes looking for a thermostat in 704, and finally gave up. I opened the window to get some fresh air. There was a window unit (AC) in 1208, but not in either of the 7th floor rooms.\n\nIt's a minor thing, but elevators are extremely tiny. Barely enough room for one luggage cart and 1-2 adults. They're slow too, and I ended up walking up and down the stairs on multiple occasions, rather than wait.\n\nThe best thing this hotel offers is its location. I mean, it's a 10+. If you make a right and walk 2\/3 of a block, you're at Rockefeller Center\/Magnolia Bakery\/Radio City. If you make a left and walk 1\/3 of a block, you're in the heart of Times Square. It's tough to beat the location. The rest of my group went to a show at Winter Garden Theatre, and it's a 3-minute walk, at least to the 7th Avenue side.\n\nCheck in\/check out seemed to go smoothly, but I wasn't as involved in those processes.\n\nIf I could give it a 3.5, I would, but I can't, so 3 it is. If you want something relatively clean and comfortable, and close to most touristy things in midtown, it's a good option. You do pay for that proximity (again, it's Manhattan). My advice to the hotel: please update your linens, bedding, etc. Spruce those rooms up a little.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Time square, Central Park, The Rockefeller centre, Grand central station, Madison square gardens are all in easy walking distance.

Our apartment was quiet small for 5 adults especially in the lounge\/kitchen area where the sofa bed was set up, but with a tv in each bedroom there was room to spread out. The kitchen was excellent although we chose to eat out every night. The full size fridge was great for all of our drinks.

While I typically try to avoid staying in tourist areas, the Radio City Apartments is located on a fairly quiet Midtown street just steps away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square, and within close proximity of a plethora of attractions and sites.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived early on a Wednesday, around 11:30 a.m., and we were able to check in immediately.  Unlike some of the other reviews, we found the front desk staff extremely friendly and professional.  If you talk to them, you will find they will smile, laugh, and joke with the patrons.  They were otherwise businesslike with the occasional \"hello\" or \"have a good day.\"  The entrance of the hotel, and lobby, while small, were very charming, and decorated beautifully for Christmas.  We stayed in a room on the 11th floor with windows facing a walkway and not directly to 49th street.  The elevators were perfectly fine, and we never had an issue with them being slow.  The up and down arrows on the 11th floor don't light up when you push them, so, you didn't know if the button was actually pressed and the elevator was actually coming.  You just have to wait for a minute, but it always showed up.  The room itself is large for a NYC room, and the kitchenette had everything needed, however, we only used the paper towels, fridge, and microwave.  There is a grocery store a couple blocks down which is convenient.  Everything in the room was CLEAN which is my number one priority.  The bathtub had a stain in it, but probably not something they could address without replacing the whole tub.  I have seen other reviews about the rooms not being updated, and things being old, but everything in our room appeared updated and fairly new.  The colors chosen are a bit retro, but nothing was run down. The location of this hotel was my second priority when choosing, and for the price, it can not be beat.  Subway stations were close by for easy transit to uptown or downtown.  It is an easy walk to restaurants, Time Square, Rockefeller Center, and more.  We ran the window unit air conditioner, and kept the fan running instead of on auto to drown out any outside noise.  It seemed to help, and the outside noise did not bother us at all.  We will definitely stay here again when we return to the city.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

If you need anything else, do not hesitate to contact the front desk. \nThe hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to many attractions and landmarks including Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Plaza, the Museum of Modern Art, the MTA Subway station along with numerous restaurants and shops including JCrew, Loft, Banana Republic, Cole Haan, and Nintendo New York. \nThe room was clean and the beds inside the room were comfortable. The sleep quality was good. We stayed at the hotel because of the location, not for the views from our hotel window. Be aware the two elevators are small and for those travelling either in large groups and\/or have luggage, be prepared to wait. \nI am happy with our stay at Radio City Apartments. The convenient location was well worth the price. Special thanks to Carlos and the staff for their excellent service!","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You can notice when and what other guests were cooking. \nAbout sleeping quality: View to the back yard was not much but the rooms were quiet so it depends what you value. The street side will be noisy.Weird mattress which felt like \u201cmelting\u201d and make a \u201cpit\u201d under you. For a restless sleeper this mattress may be a slight problem. \nRooms (2) were spacious, bathroom was small, the shower drain needs some improvement. \nOne quite irritating thing with many USA hotels is that they will hold your reservation authorisation AND they will also charge your credit card with the actual amount, so my credit card was charged twice until the reservation authorization was released. This took approx. 2-3 weeks. This may cause your credit limit to exceed and no good things will follow when that happens.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had to ask if that meant either left or right in Direction.\n\nI asked him what the total was in cash and he quoted me a total that was $200 dollars over what I had totalled up in head.  When questioned about his total, he seemed annoyed at being challenged and when he added it up by a calculator and realised that his initial total was wrong, there was no apology from him.

{"helpfulVotes":17,"locationId":1397856,"title":"Great location, great price, great stay!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-01-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Family of 4 (mum, dad and 2 teenagers) from Australia stayed for 10 nights at start of January during a cold spell. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment (with 2 double beds) with a kitchen and separate lounge room. \n\nTHE ROOM\nThis is an old hotel so don't expect modern, slick design. It LOOKS a bit dowdy but it's all new inside and our bathroom was brand new. But because it was an old hotel, it had a quirky style with big rooms and high ceilings.Even though we had loads of luggage and 2 big, messy kids, it never felt cramped.\n\nEverything was clean and new -  clean carpets, comfy beds, plenty of towels.\nWe were on the 11th floor overlooking Times Square. Whilst that sounds great, the immensely huge, bright blinking lights of Times Square were really difficult to shut out - so bring eye masks!\n\nNo hotel noise at all but the usual New York sounds could be heard through the old windows (garbage trucks, sirens). Didn't bother us (I mean what do you expect in New York?) but this could bother some people who are used to the double glazed fixed windows of modern hotels.\n\nTHE LOCATION\nSuperb! When you step outside the doors, turn left and then left again and you are in the middle of Times Square. A 2 minute walk. Everyone always says not to stay in TS cause it is too touristy but this is our 3rd time to NY and it was great to stay somewhere central, bustling, safe and always interesting. \n\nThere is a subway station on the corner of the street although it was cheaper for us to Uber everywhere rather than pay 4 subway tickets.\n\nWe were a quick walk away from the Rockefeller Centre ( ice skating) and Broadway theatres. Plus a walk to Macys and lots of shops.\n\nWHAT TO EAT\nThere is a comfortable Italian restaurant attached to the hotel but we found the prices a bit high compared to Australian restaurants (this goes for all food in New York BTW). Instead the desk staff told us about the grocery store 2 blocks away (the Food Emporium) and they had terrific (and cheap!) pre packaged but freshly made food that we were able to bring back to the hotel and microwave. Their pastas were divine! Could also buy things like a roast chicken.\n\nThere is a Shake Shack in Times Square (too expensive!), a gorgeous bar called Lillies down the road for adult drinks and pub food, a cheap pizza-by-the-slice place next door to the hotel plus some Asian and Japanese places on the street.  Around the block we discovered the Melt Shop for toasted cheese sandwiches which were filling and a great price.\n\nSadly we were unable to locate a decent (ie. Australian quality) coffee place in the area. So you are stuck with Starbucks. The best coffee and the one closest to what we get here was in Eataly which is far, far away downtown.\n\nHOTEL SERVICE\nRooms were cleaned every day (new sheets, towels, extra shampoo etc). Staff were lovely and friendly but not many spoke English. So if you needed anything it is best to ask at the desk.\n\nThe service desk always had 2 or 3 guys on hand. They weren't friendly, but they weren't unfriendly. But always helpful if asked a question and quick to help with luggage.\n\nGenerally the service was super efficient - one day the radiators stopped working. I called the front desk to see if it was something I did or if there was a building problem and they promised to send someone to have a look. As soon as I hung up the phone, someone was at the door with an electric heater! Radiator fixed later that day while we were out.\n\nAnother night, to stop a cold draft, I stuffed a pillow against the gaps around the air conditioners. These are old style air conditioners which were propped into the open windows with packing either side so they had some drafts coming through the gaps. When we came back that night all the airconditioners had been removed which allowed us to close the windows properly. Even though this was something I was prepared to live with, I love that they did this because they saw we had an issue.\n\nTHE AMENITIES\nThe lifts are seriously slow and small. And even when they come, you might find you can't fit because there is someone in there with luggage or the staff are hauling rubbish down to the ground floor. It didn't bother us to wait but if you are not a patient person or prone to whining, I suggest you ask for a room on the lower floors so you can walk it.\n\nEach apartment has a kitchen with a full size fridge, cook top, oven and microwave. Like all US hotels, they have one of those dodgy drip coffee makers with awful tasting coffee. There are utensils, melamine plates and cups, some pots and pans and a limited selection of food preparation items. Not enough to cook a decent meal from scratch with so I wouldn't suggest cooking in the apartment. Also, the staff won't wash up your sink mess so ask for a sponge and dishwashing liquid as soon as you arrive.\n\nWOULD WE STAY AGAIN?\nAbsolutely! I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else now.\n\nNEGATIVES.\nNot many that are worth noting. The only thing was that the bathroom didn't have any shelves or hooks. So there was really nowhere to hang used towels or to put your wetpacks. Even the shower didn't have anything so the shampoos and soaps had to go on the floor. I think they simply forgot to put these things in when they finished the bathroom! A pain in the bum but we could live with it.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Studios are clean and functional (nice renovated kitchens) in a pricey area of midtown Manhattan. Check-in fast and efficient, but keys are regular metal keys, so don't lose them. Upon entering, the studio was spotless, including the kitchen and bathroom. There was a little camera hanging off of the TV, which I found very odd. Bed linens smelled and looked clean, but I wasn't a fan of the outdated bedspread, which should be replaced by a white, European-style duvet. \n\nHousekeeping was good, but abnormally late in the day. I left each day to do some work tasks and returned about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, hoping to be able to relax in a clean room, but the room had yet to be serviced, even when I put the \"maid\" hanger on the door. I don't blame the housekeepers who are friendly and do a good job, but the hotel management for not hiring enough staff. \n\nElevators should really be renovated or replaced. They are very slow and, on the last day as I was trying to leave with my luggage, my elevator went from the ninth to the seventh floor and, on that floor, the door just kept opening and closing, which meant I had to haul my suitcase down seven flights of stairs. Fine for me, but would have been near impossible for a senior citizen or disabled person. \n\nI was staying here for some consulting work, but location would be especially nice for tourists who want access to a lot of New York's biggest attractions and a multitude of subway lines.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

It was an ideal place to stay. It's literally less than 3 minutes from Time Square, close to the Rockefeller centre and St Patrick's cathedral and about 10 minutes from Central Park. The subway on the street where the apartment is links directly to downtown and has a stop for the World Trade Centre. There are shops close by and Irish bars- we found the Celtic Club to be a lovely bar. It has a vibe like the bar in \"Cheers\" and it served great food upstairs. There is also a fun karoke bar next door where some celebs visit after being on Jimmy Fallon- Radio City is close by so the likes of James Cordon and Lady GaGa were spotted in the Karoke bar while we were there.\nThe apartment itself I can't fault. There was 5 girls so we had 3 double beds in 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, hall and a kitchen come sitting room. We picked up some bits to have breakfast there every morning. It's very clean and cleaning staff came in every day and left the apartment spotless. I think they realised there was 5 girls and we had a great supply of towels! The guys on the front desk were always welcoming and helpful. It is an old building so the lift isn't really big but we all fitted in with plenty of space. Would i recommend it? Absolutely-  it's bang in the centre of where you want to be and the beds were very comfortable. But when your in New York your not there to stay in the bed all day- but if you are, those beds are amazing! We had Tv's in all the rooms. A gem of a place and I will be back!

The service was good and the rooms clean and well appointed. overall a really great stay and would stay there again.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My boyfriend and I stayed here this summer. It was a last minute trip to the city and we were very excited. I always read reviews before booking any hotel and the radio city apartments had decent ratings and was affordable. When we arrived it was extremely hot outside. The lobby was the same temperature. No AC. We got our keys which were actual keys not the cards you usually get. Our Room was a penthouse suite with a mini kitchen. The room was dated and noisy which was expected considering we could see Times Square from our window. So far I was ok with our choice but wasn't super impressed from the beginning. After walking from central station all the way to the hotel I was hot and wanted to take a shower. I go to open a clean folded towel and was about to wipe my face when I noticed that it had skid mark stains on it! I was so grossed out but decided that I would not complain since we were only here for one night.  After our showers we went out for dinner and came back to the room. As my boyfriend is laying on the bed he noticed something funny on the tv. When we took a closer look we realized that it was a mini camera like those used for Skype which was plugged into a box behind the tv. I started to freak out wondering if someone had been recording us. We had been undressed in the room and intimate. I could have been wrong but I still felt so violated! All these thoughts were now running through my head. Was someone watching us? It was late at night and I was exhausted so I unplugged it and decided to confront management in the morning. When we woke up the housekeeper was in the hallway and my boyfriend asked her if she knew what this device was. She acted very defensive and said it was for the remote which I couldn't believe seeing as it worked just fine without this piece. We even showed her that it worked without it. She left the room and didn't say anything. We packed our bags at about 10:30 am and went to return our keys at the front desk. There were several men working. I showed them the device and asked why there was a camera in our room and that I wanted an explanation.  One of the men were super rude stating why did you take that! He also claimed that it was for the tv remote. Once again I wanted to know how it was for the remote if the remote worked just fine after I unplugged it. The man became very aggressive towards me saying I'm not going to sit here and argue with you. I was shocked at his tone of voice. Yet he still couldn't provide me with an explanation. I've never been treated like this by hotel staff! This just made me even more suspicious and upset. Then I asked to speak to a manager. He said there's not a manager on you can go call this number on the phone in the lobby. He didn't apologize or accommodate us. My boyfriend called the number and explained our issue and it was another man who answered. We asked if it was a manager he said no. What hotel doesn't have a manager present on a weekday? This man was also rude to us. We had to catch our train so we left feeling completely disgusted with our stay. Even if we were proven wrong and it wasn't a camera it was the way we were treated for asking a simple question that really destroyed our trip.

They told us it would be sorted the next day and we could speak to a manager, we gave in for the night and agreed.\nThe next day we had a pre-booked trip to 911 so left around 9am, we returned about 6pm and i asked the same staff member who had been there the night before if he had the room sorted, he said no as i hadnt been to see him, i told him re trip etc and he said the manager had now gone home. So again i asked him if he had spoke to the manager regarding he matter and he said NO as i wasnt there??\nSo i asked him for our room and was it ready , he shrugged his shoulders. After a 20 min discussinon with him he amazingly found a room we had booked and told me to drop the other keys off in ten mins!\nThere were three staff there and no one offered to help move five bags from the second floor to the fifth, we had been in the room for no longer than ten mins and there was a knock on the door by a staff member asking us for the other rooms keys...what did he think i was going to do with them!!\nAll week i asked to see the manager to discuss the matter and everyday they were busy or in meetings, the last day my wife spoke to someone on the hone who offered $27 for our inconvenience......what an utter joke!!\nUpon booking out this was not taken off our bill and have still not received it.\nGreat location and decent rooms to stay in, however the staff are an utter disgrace and unhelpful and unfriendly and was hard work to get a \"good morning\" out of them.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Thankfully our emails told a different story. We were then escorted to a lift in serious need of a service to a Queen room not fit for one person never mind two. It was stinking of musty carpet and rang of noisy air conditioning and was clearly close to a restaurant because you would have thought the food was being cooked there!\nOur second room was a delux two bed and again for the remainder of our guests was basic, cramped and had a really foul smell. Instantly we complained and were told it was an error to send us there as the room needed a professional clean. What was wrong at reception that they could NOT get it right? We had just arrived from Ireland and simply wanted checked in to start our holiday.\nEvery room we were shown was either stinking of food, was musty or was a building site use to maintenance in rooms surrounding it.\nOur party was united we were not staying in this accommodation. We knew from reviews it wias supposed to be clean and very basic with a great location. The latter is the only reason you would stay there. \nZac the door bell staff and the domestic staff were the only accommodating members of staff with any common sense. They tried so hard with extra towels, pillows etc to cover over the appalling senior staff at reception. Avoid Carlos who works in the evening. He really is not suited to reception. He is unprofessional and rude!\nWe ended up 4 hours later finding an amazing hotel which was spacious, much more central in Times Square where the staff could welcome, secure two rooms beside each other that was superbly located and helped us kick start the holiday, eventually, that we anticipated earlier that day for very little extra.\nIf you want a cheap accommodation that is really basic, smelly and very contained then opt for the Radio City. We definitely made the right choice to get our money back and leave immediately!","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Grande aereo a due piani , che ha tenuto il volo superbamente senza sobbalzi o forti vuoti d'aria , servizio ineccepibile con personale che parlava anche l'italiano disponibile e cortese ogni oltre dire !!!!!!!        \nIl volo \u00e8 durato 6.30  all'andata e 6 ore al ritorno  !!!!!!!!!!  BREVISSIMO  !!!!!!!\nAbbiamo scelto l'apartment x avere un po' di spazio in pi\u00f9 , x aver la possibilit\u00e0 di far colazione all'italiana e magari cucinarci qualcosa al volo all'italiana . Avevamo a disposizione una camera molto grande con 2 letti matrimoniali  ( eravamo in 2 : io e mia figlia ) comodissimi ,  un tavolo , comodini, una grande cassettiera , un armadio a muro,  un cucinotto attrezzatissimo con stoviglie , cucina elettrica, caffettiera , bollitore, ferro e tavola x stirare , forno elettrico e a microonde,  caffettiera americana , un bagno non grande ma ben attrezzato di prodotti e di asciugami nuovi e morbidissimi che ci cambiavano tutti i giorni e tutti i giorni venivano a ripulire l'apartment. IL WI-FI era gratis e si riceveva benissimo .  Il brutto era la moquette sul pavimento ... non osavamo nemmeno chiederci quanto fosse pulita !!! l'unica cosa  brutta \u00e8 stata questa , x tutto l'altro ci siamo trovati benissimo ed anche il rapporto prezzo-qualit\u00e0 : buono , tenuto conto dei prezzi alti degli hotel a New York  !!!!  Le nostre finestre davano su una stradina laterale dell'hotel  x cui  il silenzio di notte e di giorno era OTTIMO !!!!  Come , non ottima ma direi eccellente era la posizione : tutto a portata di mano TIME SQUARE , ROCKEFELLER CENTER, LA CATTEDRALE DI ST. PATRICK'S , MOMA ,IL CENTRAL PARK , IL CHRYSLER BUILDING, L'EMPIRE STATE BUILDING , LA 5 AVENUE ,  LA STAZIONE DELLA METROPOLITANA E LA FERMATA DEI VARI BUS X IL TOUR DELLA CITY. A fianco dell'ingresso dell'hotel vi \u00e8 un ristorante ( al quale si accede anche dall'hotel )  una pizzeria e alcuni ristorantini cinesi. Inoltre consiglio una visita  ( prendendo la metropolitana) al MEMORIAL delle TORRI GEMELLE , dove hanno eretto un grande monumento a forma di aquila , il museo , 2 grandi vasche e un grattacielo meraviglioso. Siamo vicini al porto e prendiamo  un grande vaporetto arancione ( STATEN FERRY ISLAND ) che gratuitamente ci trasporta nel  NEW JERSEY passando accanto alla STATUA DELLA LIBERTA' .

I was in NJ for a 2 week business trip and they flew in to join me for a few days.  We caught the train to NY and checked out the History museum.  Left there to check in to Radio City Apts.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful.  My disappointment was with the room itself.  To start with we were given two keys, yes real keys.  One for the door and the other for the dead bolt.  Not a problem, I actually liked that since almost every location now uses cards.  We had a two room apartment with a bedroom having two double beds and living room with pull out sofa.  The apartment included a refrigerator and stove\/oven.  My wife and I thought the bed mattress was too hard.  It was, to me, almost as hard as mattresses I slept on in Thailand.  The kids thought they were fine.  That I could easily deal with and get over.  The windows had a view of the parking deck right behind the hotel with it's nicely BRIGHT shining lights.  What made me dislike the stay was the AC units.  The AC units were the standard window unit you could probably find in a Wal-mart or Lowes.  I grew up with window units so, the units themselves were not the problem.  Remember my talking about the parking deck window view and the bright, very bright, lights from it?  Now add in a window AC unit and remember it is summer time.  If you wanted to use the AC at night while sleeping, guess what?  You can't close the curtains because they will cover the AC units, blocking any cool\/cold air.  Since you can't close the curtains, you're left with bright lights shining in the bedroom and living room while trying to sleep.  If I had known, I would have packed eye masks for everyone to use.  After a very long day of walking and seeing the city, you really want to sleep without the room feeling as if it has an early morning sunrise all night.  Especially for the room price paid which was slightly better than the surrounding hotels. \n\nThe kids didn't care, but of course they weren't the one paying the bills either.  And again, the staff was excellent to talk to and deal with.  Not a problem with them at all.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

To begin, most of the elevator buttons didn't even light up when you pressed them in the elevator car, or to go down from the 8th floor, so you couldn't tell if you called for the elevator until you could hear it moving.  Getting to my floor, it smelled strange.  Upon entering my room, there was hair in my bed under the pillow, public hair on the sink, hair in the shower, and I got a piece of copper wire stuck in my foot from the bathroom floor.  It was also very noisy in the room.  I understand it's near Times Square and it's a busy area, but the windows did not seal out the noise (it almost seemed like they were wide open), and I could hear music, cars, and everything else over the sound of the window air conditioning unit.  Between the bed being unclean and too hard, I decided to take the last train out of NYC back home and just got home really late.

So location was great! Hotel was comfortable and clean but more to the standard of a 3-star than a 3 1\/2 star. That last half a star is not really deserved. Housekeeping had left the door wide open when I checked in and left a dirty rag on the bedside table on another day. The shower is a little cranky and there's no shower foam (but there's shampoo) provided. The rooms are really in need of a makeover, they could be used to fill a 60s show.

We booked over 12 months in advance so we were able to secure a very reasonable rate. The location was excellent being an easy walk to Times Square, there was a subway station at the corner of our street about 50 metres away, & there were a few handy Indian & Chinese restaurants right next door to us which provided very good fare. We had requested a non-smoking room though when booking online it was specified that non-smoking rooms even when requested could not be promised. The first thing we noticed on entering our room was the strong pungent smell of smoke, we asked if any non-smoking rooms were available but we were told no. Our room was on the 7th floor (we had expressed a preference for 12th floor as recommended on Trip Advisor to escape the constant street noise). Air-conditioning was not ducted but provided in the form of a single a\/c unit installed in the window of our room. At first I was very concerned about the noise from this a\/c unit but it turned out to be a positive as the a\/c noise completely drowned out any street noise. The a\/c unit worked well & it was well tested as it was up to 36 degrees Celsius during our stay in NYC. Our room & ensuite bathroom were quite small but adequate for our needs for 2 people. Beds comfortable & room was clean. Our room also had a kitchenette which we put to good use as we kept milk, fruit & breakfast items in the fridge. Tea\/coffee making facilities & a gas stove top were also provided. Their website advertised that a washing machine was available for guest use & so it was. We availed ourselves of this washing machine more than once. It was located in the laundry in the basement alongside the other washing machines & dryers which were used by staff to launder guests' bed linen & towels. There was no specific machine for guest use, we had to wait until a machine used by staff became available. The staff member in the laundry was a lovely fellow who assisted us by loading our washing for us when a machine wasn't immediately available, this help was so wonderful as we had a very busy sightseeing itinerary & didn't want to waste time in the laundry. The concierge staff, all male during our stay, were not particulary friendly or interactive but they did answer our questions if we asked. Overall we knew we had booked into a budget hotel & so we weren't disappointed. I would stay there again as location was far more important to us than luxury accommodation.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The location was amazing - turn out of the hotel and turn left you have a subway station then left again Times Square (it's like a 3min walk) if you turn right you have the Rockefeller (best observation deck in New York) and if you come straight out of apartment turn right then left and keep going straight you have Central Park (10mins max) If you are facing the hotel on the right hand side is the best pizza I've ever tasted! I think it was $2.50 per massive slice, and if you buy 2 you get a free drink! Definitely worth every penny! \nThe apartment itself had everything we needed! There where 5 of us and we had plenty of room! We had a 2 bedroom apartment with a sofa bed in the lounge! All the beds including sofa bed where really comfy and everything was super clean! The staff where amazing and answered all our questions with the upmost enthusiasm. We needed help finding a few things and the best ways to get there. The staff drew us maps and searched on their computers till we got the right answer! The handymen and chamber maids are a real credit to this place and would always smile and say hello! The negative reputation that the people of New York has is a total myth! 100's of times nice than Londoners! Ps. On your way to this hotel do not get a taxi from JFK to Radio City Apartments. However tired you are get the Subway!! The taxi drivers rip you off with tours and tax wether you want them or not! Unlimited metro card is $31 for a week and that was definitely our best investment!! The Subway is so easy as well!! Just follow the colours then Uptown or Downtown! Pps. If you use your metro card but don't go through then you have to use another subway or wait 18mins! We only made the mistake once! \nEnjoy :):)","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Nonetheless I was checked into my Deluxe Studio for 2nights. It was impeccably clean with all the amenities stated. At some point I had a bit of an issue with my Water Closet and the maintenance guy was sent up in 3mins. Really impressed. On my last night I was checked into a Studio with a Queen bed which was equally clean. There is a subway within 60seconds walk with access to the NQR lines. The other concierge on duty were very polite and friendly. In all, it was a great stay. By the way, still awaiting the refund of my $250 mandatory caution fee. Yep, you get to pay a $250 caution fee which will be refunded to your account when you check out.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"SOLO"}
