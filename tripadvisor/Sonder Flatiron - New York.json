Shopping is just a couple minutes walk. Rockefeller center is about a 30 minute walk. It is a bit noisy at night but they provide ear plugs and i honestly didn\u2019t use them or mind the noise. It was easy to chat with management via the app if you needed something, although we requested an iron and didn\u2019t receive one.. there was an ironing board but no iron? But there was wrinkle release spray that we purchased in the lobby so all worked out! All in all our stay was great! It didn\u2019t feel like an Airbnb or a hotel.. almost felt like an apartment we lived at! highly recommend.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I\u2019d go as far to say one of the worst hotel experiences my fianc\u00e9 and I have had to date. The only PRO here is the location but that\u2019s about it. Here are were our issues:\n\n- The customer service was extremely unhelpful, made worse because of the lack of communication between the remote team we communicated with on the app and the nearly non-existent \u2018team\u2019 at the physical location.\n- The state of the hotel room itself was not good. The sink easily clogged, light switches by the bed hung off the wall and there was grit \/ grime around the bathroom floor. To make matters much worse, one of the 3 large shades that covered the tall windows was loose when we arrived and by the first night had completely fallen off. We asked multiple times and were told multiple times a team member would come to fix \/ replace but no one ever came. This left the window by the bed completely open with no privacy and woken up early to tons of sunlight pouring in.\n- We also asked the customer service to come and clean our room multiple times to no avail, finally having to go up to the cleaning team member we saw in the hallway and point to our room to please help.\n- We were asked multiple times throughout our stay if we wanted to extend our trip (we didn\u2019t need to) but when we asked to push our check-out time from 11am to 12pm they said it would be $25 fee if approved\u2026 but it was never even approved.\n- Lastly, small but annoying - Every time you use the elevator, you have to enter an 8 digit code into the elevator\u2019s janky keypad, even just when going down to the lobby. Would be much more convenient with the app or keycard.\n\nAll and all, this is NOT a 4-star hotel as listed and we will never stay at a Sonder again.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1563892,"title":"Misleading Website, a bit shabby and not really a hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-08-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I was looking forward to staying at the Sonder Flatiron, as the location is great and the website makes it look new and we designed.  The reality is quite a bit different. \n\nFirst of all, the tech system they have driving everything (the Sonder Ap) is clunky and does not work well. The electronic key for the room does not really work, even after you manage to download it to your phone, which in my case took 45 minutes and a visit from the property manager.   You actually need the electronic key or a numeric  code to enter the rooms AND to go up and down in the elevator.  The alarming thing about this is that if there is an emergency and you don't have the code, you are effectively unable to get out of the building. How that works in the event of an emergency is something that this place really needs to consider... It seems extremely unsafe to get trapped in an elevator if you don't remember the code and the electronic key fails.\n\nSecond, the place has no regular TV.  They provide a chrome cast ap and a monitor, but if you don't have a phone or a laptop that can stream media to a Chromecast TV,  you are out of luck.  I don't come to NYC to watch the TV, but it is pretty weird to not even be able to watch network news or CNN.\n\nThe room itself (at least my room) is small and sort of shabby, with numerous scuff marks on the walls and what I hope is coffee stains splattered on the base boards.  The bathroom is dark and small, with  worn and faded tiles and when you open the blinds covering up the bathroom window, the window is actually boarded up with a large sheet of plywood.  Strong tenement vibe.\n\nThe lobby of the property is spartan and the only person on the scene is a security guard who was very friendly, but did not appear to be able to assist with check in or sort out the technical problems with the ap.  He send an email to a helpful woman who is apparently the property manager. She came by our room after about 40 minutes to try to help us out, and is very capable and friendly and tried to  help but she can't manage this whole place on her own.  In any event, it appears that most of the decisions need to go through head office.  \n\nAlso, unlike a normal hotel, once you pass the cancellation period (3 days before check-in), keep in mind that the bookings are completely non refundable.  I tried to shorten my stay to move to a better place and was told that I would not get any refund if I left 3 days early.  In other words, if upon arrival you are unhappy with the shabby rooms, the virtually non-existent service, the poor housekeeping, the odd media arrangements and the strange and potentially unsafe  access system, too bad for you, you aren't able to leave without losing 100% of the payment for the booking. \n\nOverall,  It seems like Sonder quickly and cheaply (and only partially) renovated the building, put a badly designed IT system in place to try to manage the property with little to no support staff, and have a poor maintenance and housekeeping team.  This is really more of a collection of badly run Airbnb units than a hotel.  Even though the price is quite competitive and the location is very good, I would not stay at this place, or in fact any other Sonder property again.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The rate was so far below others I was skeptical so I prepared myself for \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d, but I was pleasantly surprised! To kill the suspense, it was incredible! Once booked online, you are sent a code to enter on an outside keypad. No check in required. Once in the elevator you punch in the code again and proceed to your floor. And a final key pad press at your room. The lobby is modern and clean and the room, like a nice boutique hotel room. Very clean, very luxurious bedding. Lots of pillows. An enormous flatscreen, a small bathroom with all the shampoo etc. I even used the iron. And 3 very large windows with easy to open shades and even a mid century copy of a famous danish chair. \n\nAnd the best part. Listen closely. Just a few feet from the front entrance is the best Gelato place called Anita , worth the wait. And a closed off street to lounge and enjoy a dozen restaurants. \n\nSo if you like a CLEAN room with nice decor A\/C, comfort, a beautiful view, amazing safe surroundings all for under $200 per night (which exists no where else in Manhattan) then this is the place for you!\n\n* took lots of great pics but keep getting error message, so just take my word for it.

The hotel looks fine from the outside and lobby area but the rooms aren\u2019t up to par with the amount they charge. The furniture is old and the floors and bathroom full of old scratches and stains.  And the padlock sometimes does not work, twice it took 10-20 minutes for it to reboot and allow me inside my own room. \n\nBut all of that does not compare to being stuck in the elevator twice in two days and having to be rescued by the same firefighters twice. The one elevator I was told was too unsafe for use and was shut down and the only other elevator had broken down two-three times before that week, which the fireman had told me cause he had responded to those calls. And on the second time I got stuck I ran into the elevator mechanic which he had mentioned this was his second call to \u201crepair\u201d this elevator in one day. I had a room all the way in the 9th floor and when I brought up this concern to Sonder they were unable to accommodate my stay at a lower level floor and offered to switch my reservation to a different sonders if I paid the difference. But I refused and asked for a full refund and once I asked that they offered to switch me for free. Which might have been another mistake. \n\nThe sonders the Nash is an apt building with tenants which they converted a floor with a few spaces for Sonder guests. It also is older than what they have in the pics, the kitchen is great but the other furnitures need to be updated. It\u2019s a hodgepodge of furniture styles and all scratched up. The bathroom shower\/tub would flood and be slow to drain so i hope your ok with showering in dirty ankle deep water. And did I forget to mention the cockroaches?!? Sure sure it\u2019s New York City but if your paying$200-350\/night you expect a little more cleanliness. I\u2019ve stayed in roadside hotels and have never once seen a cockroach. That roach was the straw that broke the camels back and decided to cut my stay there short and moved to the Moxy.  To sonders credit they did refund me the unused days and a total of $600 for the inconvenience of being stuck in a dangerous elevator and cockroaches which I\u2019m told will be in refunded in 7-10 business days. Funny how quick they are to charge your account but it takes almost two weeks for it to return. Did I mention they charged me a $800 cancellation fee? Which is taking them days to figure out and I\u2019m still left with a $800 charge. What ever you do make sure you have a paper trail.

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":1563892,"title":"BEWARE! Read this entire review before thinking about booking this hotel.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-04-28","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"This is NOT a 4 star hotel, I repeat, NOT A FOUR STAR HOTEL! It is closer to what I would imagine a 1-2 star hotel would be like. It was by far the absolute worst hotel experience I have ever had( if I thought my previous worst was bad, this hotel made that one look like the Plaza). The Flatiron set the bar at an entirely new low. \n\nMy boyfriend and I  booked our room the morning of our stay based entirely on the pictures shown online and the fact that this was listed as a 4 star hotel, this was a huge mistake. We booked the king room which according to the website was roomy, bright and clean, with fresh flowers and a stately bathroom featuring a jetted bathtub, in a hotel listed as having been built in 2011. That was all a charade because the building is dark and old and the pictures online are not at all an actuate representation of what the hotel actually looks like.\n\nLet\u2019s start with check in, we arrived at the hotel between 12:30-1PM, the \u201clobby\u201d should have been a dead giveaway to what we were walking into. First, there is a large dirty fish tank in the middle of the room, the water is cloudy and the fish look like they are dying. To the right there is an area with dated window treatments and old restaurant booths sporadically placed around the room. This is confusing because there is no restaurant and \u201cbreakfast\u201d (we will talk about this in a second) is \u201cgrab and go\u201d. To the left is the check in area, consisting of ratty old mis-matched furniture and a counter in the corner that serves as their \u201cfront desk\u201d. This area was filthy, and standing behind those piles of papers, boxes and wires stood our first encounter with the Flatiron\u2019s awful customer service. As we entered and approached the desk, this woman did not greet us, welcome us, or even smile. We said hello and gave her our name, but without even checking, she told us that our room was not ready yet and would not be for awhile. This seemed odd because the lobby was empty, and the hotel was eerily quiet, (this was the case for the majority of our 3 night stay, as we never saw or heard anyone on our floor and only saw 2-3 others in the lobby) so I am not sure how they did not have a room ready, but OK. The woman said they would hold our bags in their baggage area (this is listed as an amenity on their website) and we could come back to check in later. After a morning of traveling, this was a little annoying, but we tagged our bags and left. We went to lunch and a quick museum and by 3PM, we assumed the room would be ready, so we called to ask. WRONG! The same rude woman answered the phone and in an annoyed tone, told me that our room would not be ready until at least 4. At this point, we are tired, frustrated, and just want to relax before our evening plans, but we are able to kill another hour walking around. When we returned to the hotel, the rude woman reluctantly  checks us in, and to my horror I noticed that our bags are still sitting exactly where we left them in front of the desk! I assume this means that they don\u2019t have a bag room because our bags just sat out in the sketchy lobby for hours. There was no porter\/bell hop to help us with our bags(as listed online), so we grabbed our luggage, took our keys and headed to our room via the dilapidated elevator. This elevator was as scary as it was disgusting. The kind of elevator that you hold your breath on, not only because it is so dirty, but because you think that if you breathe it may stop working and you will be stuck in it forever. The elevator also does not have key access, so anyone can wander off of the streets and onto the guest floors. Upon exiting the elevator, we stepped into a dirty, dark hallway that was straight out of a horror movie. Dim lighting, cobwebs, dirty old carpet, paint chipping off of the walls, the whole works. We get to our room and open the door, and it gets, if possible, worse. With a loud bang, the door slams behind us(because there was no slower arm) and we enter this weird corner room with so many angles. You\u2019d think that because it was a corner room, it would be bigger, right? Wrong! This room was MUCH smaller than all of the rooms shown online, the carpet looked older than the lobby furniture, the walls were peeling and dirty(you could see layers of handprints and gunk when the light hit at different angles), the window treatments were dated and stained, the furniture was chipped and beat up, the windows were dirty and old, and the room was stuffy and hot(even though it was only April). We looked around and tried to find something that would make the room better, but we never found it. Remembering the reason we booked this hotel (the beautiful bathroom with the jetted tub!), I excitedly opened the bathroom door, only to be met with more disappointment.\n\nThe bathroom was black, totally black, with black floors and walls, not at all like the beautiful bright colors shown online. It was so dark, like God forbid if you dropped something on the floor, it would probably disappear into the black abyss and you would never see it again. It was terrifying to even use the bathroom because all I could think about while sitting on the toilet (making sure to not let my feet touch the floor) was \u201cwhat am I not seeing in this dark bathroom?\u201d. It was also tiny, not at all like the large bathrooms pictured online. How small you ask? Well, to enter the bathroom, you had to step in, go all the way back wall so that the door(which barely cleared the toilet) could close. You could not even get to the shower if you left the door open(unless you wanted to climb over the toilet). If you\u2019re a couple, forget having two people in there at once. To brush your teeth together, one of you will have to stand in the bedroom. If two people are trying to shower together, one of you will have have to step in, close the door, cross to the shower, open the shower door, get in, close the shower door, yell to the other person to open the bathroom door, step in, close the door, cross over and enter the shower. I often wondered, \u201c if this is a deluxe bathroom, what does a standard bathroom look like?\u201d If you\u2019re expecting the mirror TV to work, you will be disappointed. I am not sure why this is an option in such a tiny bathroom as it is just an inconvenience (there is a just a black square where your face reflects). The mirror did have a light, but don\u2019t expect to be able to do your makeup in this bathroom because somehow the mirror light\u2019s odd blue hue makes the bathroom seem even darker. In place of the missing tub, our room had a shower that was supposed to have different modes and settings, none of which we could use because you could not change between the overhead and body jets, so it may as well have just been a basic shower head. The shower also leaked despite the door being closed, so when exiting you stepped into a puddle of water and sopping wet towels(which could not be hung to dry afterwards because there was no towel rack). Speaking of leaks, the sink faucet also leaked, leaving a puddle of water on the counter which soaked everything I left out on the first day. There is no soap dish, so expect the counter to be not only wet, but also soapy. The website boasts about their \u201cdesigner toiletries and hair dryers\u201d, and while the toiletries did smell nice, they were not replaced by housekeeping and the hair dryer was old and smelled of burnt hair.\n \nBack to the room, the tiny, tiny room. Be prepared to smash your shins on the bed platform literally every time you walk around the bed. The mattress is absolutely awful, never in my life have I slept in a bed this old and uncomfortable(this includes those awful ones in college). You will literally feel every single spring inside of the mattress and I promise you will wake up in pain. The room has no dresser, there are drawers under the bed, but not all of them open. There is a small table under the tv across from the bed, but no end tables. A garbage can sits where a nightstand should be on one side, so you can imagine how that will smell when you wake up after disposing of food cartons. There is no safe in the room despite it being listed as an amenity, and the mini fridge kept falling apart and overheating. It was also empty despite the website listing it as containing a fully stocked mini bar(something that you might find yourself in need of if you book this hotel).\n\nIt quickly became apparent to us why the hotel was so dirty. During our 3 night stay, we only had housekeeping once. That means that our bed was only made once, our trash was only taken out once, and we were only given fresh towels once over the course of our entire stay, despite pressing the housekeeping button. We checked in on Saturday and housekeeping did not come until Monday. Not  Monday morning, not Monday afternoon, but Monday evening! After returning from a long day in the city (around 5PM) we just wanted to relax. Walking down the hall we noticed that our door was propped open and the housekeeper was inside. She eagerly invited us in(without having us verify that we were even staying there) and asked if we wanted her to skip our room, but that was a big heck no as it had not been serviced since our arrival, so we opted to wait in the lobby for her to finish. Unfortunately, the room was still quite dirty when we returned 30 minutes later as she had only made the bed, taken out the trash and given us new bath towels (no hand towels, washcloths, or bath mat).\n\nPossibly one of the worst issues with the room was the lack of AC or airflow. As soon as we arrived, we put the AC on because the thermostat read 70 degrees and we prefer a cooler room. We did not feel an immediate change, but assumed that like everything else it the hotel, the AC was probably old and might take awhile. Fast forward to the middle of the first night, Waking up covered in sweat, I check the thermostat which had risen, so I turn it all the way down(~50F) and go back to sleep. By the time the sun came up, the room was so hot and stuffy and we were covered in sweat. After showering in the leaky dark shower, we headed out for the day, stopping at the front desk to complain about the AC on the way. We were informed that the AC in the building had not yet been turned on and that several other guests that had made the same complaint about the temperature of their room. We were told that we should turn the thermostat off and open a window. I explained to the gentleman that our windows had been painted shut(I found this out  in the middle of the night when I tried to open them after smashing my sweat covered shins on the bed for the umteenth time). He took our room number and told us that he would send maintenance up to fix the AC issue, or at the very least, open the windows. This made us feel better and we left for the day. When we returned that night, the problem had not been fixed and the room was a sweltering 79 degrees. That night was worse than the first and again we woke up wet sheets. Once again, on our way out for the day we stopped at the front desk to complain, but nobody was there. We waited a few minutes for someone to come back, but nobody returned, so we stopped and explained our problem to a man who we assumed to be the missing bellhop\/doorman(this was the first time in 3 days that we had seen him). Thinking back now, he very well may have been some random person who wandered into the hotel because despite giving him our room information and him telling us he would have the front desk take care of it for us, it was still not taken care of when we returned several hours later. The AC never came on during our stay, our windows were never opened, and we were never even offered a fan. I could not imagine staying in this hotel in the summer or on one of the higher floors, because of how hot the fifth floor was in April. Upon reading reviews of this hotel, my educated guess is that this hotel does not have a working HVAC system because many other guests have complained about not having heat and AC throughout the year. \n\nAdditionally, this hotel comes with its share of additional charges. You will be charged a $10.00 refrigerator fee for that broken refrigerator and a $28.69\/night resort fee. Although this is common for most NYC hotels, it felt like a rip off here as we only saw a few of the items listed as included in the fee. According to the website, the resort fee includes the following:  \n\n-Breakfast (Sugary kids cereals, open containers of milk, and coffee in paper cups.)\n-Business center (not sure where this was because I never saw a sign for it, but if it's anything like the rest of the hotel, it\u2019s probably a Windows 98 desktop on a folding table somewhere)\n-Internet (the WiFi was slow and failed often)\n-Daily newspaper (we were not given one for the length of our stay, nor did I see any in the lobby)\n-In-room safe (how are you charging a fee for this? We did not even have one)\n-In-room bottled water (2 bottles of warm Poland Springs)\n-Daily Housekeeping (we only had this one time)\n\nTo sum up our stay in a pros and cons list:\n\nPros:\n-The toiletries smelled nice\n-The location \n\nCons:\n-No real lobby\n-Poor customer service\n-No bag room, leave bags in lobby at your own risk\n-Room not ready upon arrival\n-Breakfast was a joke\n-Lobby, elevators, halls and rooms are old, smelly and dirty\n-Room was tiny and not as pictured online\n-Bruised shins from bed platform\n-No dresser or nightstands, under bed storage drawers didn\u2019t all work\n-Uncomfortable old bed\n-No housekeeping\n-AC did not work, no airflow in room.\n-Empty mini fridge kept falling apart and overheating\n-Dark cave-like bathroom\n-Bathroom was smaller than pictured and did not have a tub\n-Shower did not change modes and leaked onto floor\n-No soap dish and sink leaked\n-Mirror TV did not work\n-Hairdryer was ancient and smelled like burning hair\n\n","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"NONE"}

At least you know what you\u2019re getting at a Hyatt.\n\nThe cons: I chose this hotel because it was the least expensive near the place I was doing business. Huge mistake.\n\nThe lighting is terrible; even if you don\u2019t wear makeup you can\u2019t even read the temperature setting. I don\u2019t think any bulb is over 10 watts.\n\nNo shelving, even though the huge bathroom has one bare wall that could hold a ton of shelving for cosmetics, etc.\n\nThere are no instructions on how to change the shower head flow, so you don\u2019t know that you can\u2019t change dribbling water to a strong flow while the water is running. It\u2019s only when the water\u2019s off that it can be changed, which means you have to turn the head, then turn on the water to see what you\u2019ve done ... repeat, repeat, repeat. \n\nAlso there will be a huge puddle of water on the floor when you get out. The shower mat is folded on the back of the toilet, which makes it hard to tell what it is until after you\u2019ve used your body towels to keep the water from flowing across the room.\n\nAnd all of the above describes the better, larger room I was moved to after being assigned a closet with a shower. The coffee maker didn\u2019t work, the phone didn\u2019t work.\n\nAnd when you book a room for more than one day, you must stay the entire time or pay for it anyway.\n\nThe pros: the people who work here.

It's generally clean, and our room was big with a nice corner view on Madison park. There was a very nice bar nearby (The Smith) where my kids enjoyed themselves... and so did I. Cool perks also included automated curtains in our room that would open and close upon just pulling on them (cool!)... Frankly, those are what keeps me from giving this place a much worse review.\n\nOn the NOT-SO-PLUS side, the hotel looks GREAT in photos... but reality is different. The hotel is shabby, with repair patches everywhere in the corridors. Ours was a very dysfunctional heating and A\/C system -- on our 2nd day there, we came back to our room where the control panel displayed a temperature of some 89 degrees despite it being set for 72 degrees on automatic mode (not just plain \"heat til you bust\" mode)... I just shut the whole thing off and didn't touch it again before leaving on the next day. In addition, there is always ONE single person at the reception desk, so just hope you don't have to get your keycard remagnetized at the same time 2-3 people are checking in, as happened to us. Breakfast pretty much sucks (and I'm a very tolerant French Canadian on these issues), and Internet simply didn't work, despite their charging a $20 daily resort fee for these services on top of the quoted price. No restaurant or bar on premises (although I don't care much for those, except when traveling with kids - which I was!), and empty mini bar in the room. Room was also noisy from the street (I can live with that in a city, though) but also from the adjacent rooms (that, I have a harder time with).\n\nAlso, if you drive, consider PARKING : We parked at the nearby ICON parking lot... they have a deal with the Hilton and Marriott Hotels that's $25 a night -- we paid $55 per 24 hour period, so $165 for 2 nights and a few extra hours...\n\nSo all in all, NYC hotels generally aren't the best value for money, in my experience. But I've stayed at several other locations in the city, and all I can say in comparison is that I will definitely not consider this place when I go back to the city. I'd much rather go back to W in Times Square or Hilton Fashion District (in that neighborhood), although I don't typically like staying at chain hotels when travelling for fun.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I checked in around 9 pm with the intention of quickly showering then meeting friends for dinner and drinks.  I returned around 1:30 am and attempted to enter my room, this is where one of the strangest, unprofessional hotel experiences I've ever had began.  Getting to my room the key card seemed to not be working, after a few more tries, i began hearing voices coming from inside, I returned to the front desk where I was rudely informed that they had changed my room and somebody should have told me about it. I was given a new key and got to the room to find all of my possessions, which had been unpacked in my original room, dumped into my new room. The next day when i was checking out i mentioned how dissatisfied i was with my experience, the woman at the front desk did not seem to care whatsoever.  \n\nmy physical experience at the hotel was only half the problem.  About a week later i noticed a handful of odd charges that had gone through on my credit card from the flatiron hotel. I called the hotel and was very rudely told they had no record of charging my card. After calling back 2-3 more times a speaking to various employees who completely disputed my claim i finally spoke with someone who recognized my card had been charge. They gave me a refund for about 1\/3 of the total charges they had put through.  \n\nI have stayed at may hotels as I've spent a considerable amount of time traveling for work and never in my life have i dealt with employees so blatantly disrespectful and rude to a customer.

I used to live in NYC so I know this is not indicative of other nyc hotel experiences which for what you pay are usually a bit lackluster. Upon arrival this place seemed cute and decent (minus the fact that it was 95 out and the lobby wasn't air conditioned). My room wasn't ready but my co-worker's was so we dropped our things and were told about our \"free\" breakfast and drink at the bar between 4-7PM nightly. \n\nWe arrived back after dinner and had missed the window for a drink but we had to be to the office early so we retired for the night. At 12:30AM the fire alarm went off for a few minutes. As I was opening my door to see if any other guests were evacuating the hotel announced over an intercom that there was no need to evacuate and this was a false alarm, so I went back to sleep (but noted how there was no latch on this door which left me uneasy. As a female staying alone, I always put the latch across.)\n\nA few hours later (around 3:00 AM) I heard my door unlock with a card key swipe and my door opened and the silhouette of a man entered and approached my bed. I sat straight up and said hello and he immediately backed away saying \"sorry\" and closing the door. Half delirious and needing sleep after two big interruptions I went back to bed.\n\nThe next day I inquired about this incident at the front desk but the \"system was down\" so they couldn't tell who had entered, saying they would look into it during the day. I ate my \"free\" breakfast (a box of cereal that opens into a bowl like the kind my mom used to bring for the kids on camping trips) and went to work exhausted.\n\nUpon return after dinner that evening I asked if anyone had figured out who had entered my room and of course their system was still down, including hotel wide internet (I was here for work!!) so they still did not know. I told the front staff that since nobody could find out and the same maintenance man from the previous night was on again, I didn't feel comfortable staying in the room. She actually said she wouldn't stay in their either but that they were fully booked and she could offer me nothing! She actually agreed with my co-worker's suggestion for me to stay in her room as she had 2 beds! But never once offered any solutions or compensation.\n\nShe told me her manager was already aware of the situation and was looking into it when I asked for a manager. \n\nI slept in my co-worker's room. The next morning when we woke up the air conditioning for the entire hotel was not working. Our room was 83 degrees. The internet was still \"down.\"\n\nI went to work looking tired and with frizzball sweaty hair from getting ready in ny room that was nearing the 90s when Inran the blow dryer. I had to get a headshot that day. (I got it back this week, it's really cute! (NOT)).\n\nI had to leave for the airport from my office around 1pm and had very little free time to argue with this horrendous hotel while there so when I got back home to Tampa I called to ask management to refund the $25\/night \"resort fee\" which was for things like that drink at the bar and breakfast...There's no gym, pool or spa, this is far from a resort, and a house beer or wine and a mini cereal box cost $6 at most! I also asked to be refunded for the night I did not stay in my room at the suggestion of their desk staff. The manager questioned my story and why I hadn't spoken to her directly when I was there (btw it took me 6 calls to reach this manager who is ALWAYS \"currently not in and not returning until tomorrow\") and as noted earlier, when I asked for a manager in the hotel I was told they were aware and \"looking into it.\" The phone call ended with the manager saying (very unconvincingly) that she would \"investigate this\" and return my call. It's August 9th now. Nobody has ever returned my call.\n\nI gave this place a chance to rectify this laughable (now after the fact, wasn't funny at all during my stay) excuse for a hotel and these thugs aren't even trying to make things right. They should have been ashamed sticking that additional bill for $65 under my door the day I checked out for their \"resort fees\" that weren't included in my initial book. \n\nThis place is dangerous and a total scam. Stay at your own risk. Someone should shut them down before a tragedy occurs in the night.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The decor was fun and funky (giant two level cylinder tropical fish tank and an oversized king chair in the lobby). Staff was friendly and Jeremy at the bar was also pleasant as he made me the free drink that came with my stay.

When I tried to adjust, I knew it was going to be an issue as the touch screen could never quite register what I was trying to do. I spent the entire night either freezing or too warm so did not get the best night's sleep. The register for the AC is also located in a bad spot and blew constantly right over the bed all night. 2) Despite a lighted mirror, the bathroom was too dark and the mirror had this weird piece of dark film over the bottom of the mirror and a res light towards the bottom.

This includes the room - outdated & faded, and the lobby. If\/when you see the fishtank in the lobby (dark, cloudy, and... past it's prime), you'll know exactly what I mean. Kinda like.... how they advertise a fast food hamburger on TV vs how it looks in real-life\n-The shower is kinda cool in that it has these crazy nozzles - and I always love rainfall shower heads - but the shower massively leaked. Like, you try to close the door and it settled with a half inch gap. When you're done with your shower, it looks like you took 2 64 ounce cups of water and poured them all over your floor. Literally. The foot towel wasn't wet, it was sopping. I asked the front desk to look into the matter, and I believe that they did - the door wasn't settling quite so open, but the same issue occurred.

Check in service - check in time is at 11 I think, we got there at 4pm and had to wait another 20 mins to come up to the room, which is odd because what if we got there at 11? Does that mean we'd have to wait 5 hours? The front desk lady seemed to not care one bit. I'm sure she was just having an off day, it just took me by surprise how little she cared about us waiting. The air is constantly on creating a humming and a dryness in the air at all times.

If you are comfortable taking the subway it is a short walk to a station, but otherwise if the weather is fine and you need a bit of exercise after the long flight, you can walk to most places easily. The room was quite small but nicely decorated and the bathroom had a high end fit out to compensate for its minuscule space! Our room was on level three, but as level 1 is the ground floor and level 2 is a mezzanine, level 3 is the first floor above street level. The street noise was quite pronounced but the main issue was that the hotel bar has live music every night and it is really loud in the rooms immediately above. Most nights it stopped at 11pm but on Fri and Sat it went much later. So ask for a higher room, pack earplugs or go to the bar, enjoy the music and have a few drinks. Self serve breakfast is charged on top of the room rate so take advantage of it because you are paying for it anyway. Breakfast food was limited to bagels and spreads plus boiled eggs and some fruit and yoghurt but load up for energy for sightseeing and save a few bucks buying food elsewhere. Staff were friendly and helpful. Not a great neighborhood (in my opinion) but walking distance to shopping and Empire State Building if you are a first time visitor.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They agreed to another room, sent up an employee to confirm that it was empty, and they came back down and said it was free and clear. \n\nI went up to the room, walked in, and there was A MAN REFILLING THE MINI FRIDGE WHEN I WALKED IN!

When you're traveling, and spending money on a hotel room, you would think that the room would be all yours!\n\nOn another note...there was a TV production crew that took up the entire bar\/restaurant area for the first 3 of 4 days that I was staying there, so I couldn't even get into the bar area and it was so crowded with staff and crew. The free drink tickets couldn't be used because the production was there and we never got notice prior to our stay. \n\nAND they ran out of breakfast coupons for our daily free breakfast that came with the room. \n\nThe location was great, the front desk staff was nice, but it was a mess of an experience.

We did have trouble connecting to WiFi and we didn't bother to inquire about it we were just to exhausted.  The lighting was hard to figure out so it was pretty dark in our room.  The continental breakfast was nice but they kept running out of coffee.  The young men who were running the buffet were very nice though and they were doing their best to keep everything filled.  They had a variety of bagels muffins & cold cereal.  They had hard boiled eggs and a variety of juice and yogurts. For fruit they had bananas and apples.  I was satisfied.  Of course the picky little children couldn't find anything to their liking.  They had the breakfast in the bar area.  That area could be cleaner.  The seats need to be scrubbed and it would look so much nicer if the tablecloths were ironed.  I would definitely come back to this hotel.  It is in an interesting area and I really like that they have entertainment in the bar  at night.  It would like to bring my husband back for a nice weekend stay.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our bathroom was beautifully tiled with marble and had lovely fixtures and a jet tub. Also a very lovely continental breakfast was included in the price, bagels, muffins, fruit yogurt and of course, coffee. Couldn't ask for more. I've stayed at \"newer\" 4 and 5 star hotels in the city and the rooms were not much larger than a walk in closet and more money too. This was a great value and Flatiron is a great location with quick access to other neighborhoods like Chelsea, Union Square and a nice walk to the Highline. The best part is the friendly staff who were very accommodating in securing our luggage before check-in and after check-out so we could make the most of our time in the city. Freddy & Christian were extremely helpful and courteous and epitomize the best in customer service. You really can't beat this hotel.

Location was good for us, easy to walk to a variety of places; check-in was pleasant and efficient. The room was very nice, modern and clean, a bit on the smaller side but enough room to move around easily. The bathroom was also on the smaller side but that's very common for NYC. The glassed-in shower had a rain shower head and additional body sprays; shampoo, etc. amenities were supplied. The bed was very comfortable with a memory foam type mattress; the bedding was soft and comfortable. Air conditioning worked very well, a bit too well for me. The blackout curtains were controlled remotely with a wall unit by the head of the bed - nice feature. Room security was very modern and a light for housekeeping could be initiated from the inside. There was the availability of t.v. in the bathroom; however it was a square panel within the mirror, which obscured mirror clarity for my husband when he was shaving. Also couldn't seem to get it to work but overall not a big deal. Two for one drinks was offered for that night however it is for only basic drinks. A basic continental breakfast was available the next morning, yogurt, some fruit, muffins, bagels, some jams, coffee\/tea. Free wi-fi was offered in the room as well. \n\nNow to the odd fee. Although the drinks, wi-fi, and continental breakfast were considered 'free', on the bill was a Resort Fee of $19.00, which upon check-out my husband discovered was to cover the 'free' amenities.  The hotel rate was very good for the day that we stayed; however, I would prefer that the Resort fee be rolled in so there would be no surprises upon check-out.  I would recommend this hotel and I would also stay there again but just be aware to add the additional fee on to whatever the rate is for the day that you're staying.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Do not be fooled by the website. This was not luxurious. The lobby area especially is tacky with crushed velvet furniture and a throne! Given the price, the customer should expect a better atmosphere and experience.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

You are basically walking into a night club that hasn't opened yet to check in. there are some tired sofas that probably look great in the dark during the club hours.\nWeird. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful.

The internet was not available in the entire hotel, we had to go out and buy a hotspot. Obviously that affected our presentations. Lunch was 30 minutes late. The bathroom toilet (1 of 2) was clogged and there was no garbage can in there. They had a hanging rod with no hangers. The chairs were wobbly and very cheap. It was so bad that we cancelled our event for the next day and had it at our own offices. There were only 2 people working the event because someone called out. They were understaffed and under-prepared. I was pretty much their third party, helping carry up bagels and cups. There was no place to put dirty dishes, they ran out of plates. It was awful and I was completely mortified. The rooms were nice and modern but some were small, and others had small issues like a wobbly toilet seat or a shower that did not work.

On arrival the staff were welcoming but asked us for credit card details before we could go to our room. We were apprehensive about this and staff reassured us that no funds would be removed from the account unless there were any breakages during our stay and this would be $100. \n\nLuckily we had access to our online banking and could see that we were minus \u00a3140, we contacted the bank for the merchants details and they confirmed it was the Flatiron hotel. We spoke to the young boys at the reception downstairs who printed out an itemised bill showing a list of charges to our account for a number of different things and different amounts ranging from 0.48 - 19$ they were rude to us when we asked why the card had been charged and fobbed us off saying it would be sorted before we left. Shocking customer service. \n\nWe had to complain multiple times before they would refund the amounts which would then inconvenience us by putting said account into a negative amount of money. They tried to tell us that we had been charged for a complimentary breakfast this in itself does not make sense!! We never ate breakfast at the hotel and didn't even know it was available as the lights to the restaurant area were off the whole stay. \n\nAfter being told a day before we were due to check out that our bill had been refunded and the bill currently sat at 0$ we woke up to an envelope slid under our door which was another bill for 19$ again we had to complain while checking out and have it changed to 0$. We feel that the hotel is being fraudulent and taking money from people's accounts in the hope that they won't notice.\n\nNo excuse for the way staff spoke to us, rude and very condescending. This hotel does not care about their customers.\n\nAside from the money issues we asked about access to the rooftop and staff stated it was currently under construction and won't be ready until 2016!! This is false advertising we paid good money to use this feature another money grabbing ploy. Another guest told us that the owner keeps his rooftop for the highest paid guests and private functions if this is the case then don't advertise as something else.\n\nHotel room ok had everything we needed and nice features spa shower and tv in mirror.

There were coffee shops, restaurants, bars and super markets within close vicinity which was very convenient.\nHotel staff were very friendly ad helpful.\nHotel lobby was attractive and the bar had a good atmosphere.\nRooms were very basic with dated furniture and the layout was not very attractive, for example the wardrobe was an old stand alone in the middle of the room. It had unnecessary features such as a TV in the bathroom mirror which would have been a great extra touch, however the bathroom was tiny and there was only a shower, so these things should have greater importance than watching tv whilst brushing your teeth. \nWe didn't experience any noise from the roads or traffic, however the hotel is on the corner and we were facing the side street so I don't know if this would have been a problem had we been facing the main road. Maybe this is something to consider and request when making a booking.\nAt the end of our stay we received a bill, $19 per day for 'Service Charge'. I enquired about this and was told it was for the wifi, breakfast and hotel booking charges. On the website we booked through it said 'free wifi', we had booked the room only (no breakfast) and did not have breakfast in the hotel and I did not feel it was appropriate to pay a booking fee to the hotel as we had already paid! When I relayed this to the concierge he promptly removed the charge without question. So I advise that you question this at the end of your stay to not pay anything that you shouldn't!!! I thought this was a bit cheeky as I imagine many people pay this without looking in to it.\n\nIn spite of these few negative points, I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would stay here again based primarily on it's location and connections around the city and also for the other shops\/restaurants etc in the area.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

However, the street noise on 26th at night was the worst I've experienced anywhere. It was so bad that after the third night I left early and took a penalty because I was so tired from lack of sleep I just couldn't think. I've stayed in NYC many times and every hotel I've stayed has had double pane windows and although that doesn't entirely cut all noise (like sirens) it helps tremendously.

There is absolutely no lobby to speak of, not even a front desk. When you walk in, you are checked in on an iPad and then taken to your room. There is no room service either which is a bummer in my opinion. The beds are on the firm side but pretty comfy and they do offer free wifi and bottled water in the room.  The bathrooms are pretty cool with all marble and Swiss showerheads. There are also tv's in the bathrooms which is a neat feature but not something I really used.

This Hotel seems like it should be elegant and well kept, there are a lot of details that make it seem shabby. Hotel rooms in NYC are notoriously small, so that is not an issue, it was small. But, the bathroom shower knob fell off, we had to ask to have the room cleaned after returning at 5PM, when we got back later that night our sheets were in a jumble under the main blanket. When we checked out we were told there was an up charge for the news papers in the lobby and for room cleaning. I guess this is their way of compensating for not getting full price for an online purchase, but it was not stated in my receipt. After arguing the point the charge was removed (I think, we will see when my credit card bill comes) but just the way you want to check out and remember a hotel - as argumentative and trying to rip you off for a few extra dollars.

We chose a Toshi Corner room as we figured with four of us sharing a room, we'd need that little bit of extra room and we'd heard New York hotel rooms are already smaller than average. The room was pretty immaculate - nicely decorated, comfy beds, tv etc, The bathroom was lovely, good pressure in the shower. The tv in the bathroom mirror was a bit random - we didn't use it but fair enough. The view was fantastic. Overall, the accommodation was pretty good value for money.\n\nThe free wifi didn't work in our room, only in the corridor and downstairs. \n\nThe staff are mostly friendly but there was definitely a sort of 'disconnect' in terms of answering questions - maybe because we were completely new to New York and didn't know much of what was referred to. How can we give a mobile number to the staff so they can message us when our taxi was booked if it has to be an American number? Obviously we have British numbers, can't you just whack the country code on it, no apparently not (we ended up using Whatsapp, seriously, just to confirm a taxi). \n\nWe didn't try the bar downstairs, but we definitely heard it. Very loud music. We stayed out pretty late ourselves so this wasn't really an issue but it's definitely not a quiet hotel.\n\nThe location is pretty good...once we worked out where we were. Two of the staff were incredibly helpful with directions, even explaining to us the subway system. The other staff were not so good and we ended up just figuring out ourselves how to get places. I'm not sure if this is standard in New York but in the UK, you'd pretty much expect a hotel to assist you with directions. Anyway, you can walk to Broadway, Greenwich etc all very easily. Once you get the hang of navigating the streets, the city opens up.\n\nOverall, it was an okay stay.

It was a great location with many restaurants to choose from, including Eataly which is only a few blocks away. Starbucks is across the street, Times Square is about a 20 minute walk, and there is a subway station 2 short blocks away.  Wifi is free.  There is a small business center on the 2nd floor with 2 computers and a printer.  I checked in for my flight and printed out my boarding pass (at no charge by the hotel).\n\nWe were very impressed with the staff while we were there.  Everyone was so nice, from the doormen, to the people at the front desk, to the people cleaning the rooms.  A special thanks to Leo, Jose, Oz, Juan, and Pedro.  They were so helpful with organizing transportation to and from the airport, suggestions for places to eat, and activities while we were visiting NYC.  It was obvious that the customer comes first.  \n\nOur room was on the 7th floor, so we did not hear music from the band downstairs.  I also didn\u2019t hear complaints about the noise from friends on the 5th floor.  The bands are loud, but really good.  \n\nWe would definitely stay at the hotel again.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were allocated a room on the 8th floor which was great. As you come down the elevator you can here the music getting louder....it is very loud!! There is no way anyone should be expected to stay in the floors above the bands! Not unless you are happy to party every night with them.\n\nThat leads me onto the biggest problem that we had during our stay. On our first night we decided to pop in to see the band. They really are very good (although loud!) so with the people we were with we bought 9 drinks including 1 coke. When the bill came we couldn't believe the price... $186!!!!! We asked to speak to the manager who just said there was nothing that he could do, to be fair he gave my husband and I a free drink ( when I mentioned trip advisor) he told us that is the price throughout Manhattan. We felt totally ripped off! We met a lot of local people during our stay and we were told this was not an acceptable price. So my advice would be to go somewhere else for a drink and then go to reception and listen to the bands! We got a cab, then a ferry to statten Island had lunch, a couple of drinks each and it still didn't cost as much as those drinks!!!!\nBut the hotel is lovely....such a shame.\n\n The flatiron is in a good position for local bars and restaurants.

Every single band was fantastic! A couple reviews have talked about the cocktails being overpriced, we didn't find this to be the case, especially in the City. All drinks were on par with pricing, but beware because they do pack a punch! \n\nThe Flatiron Hotel is in a GREAT location. It is walking distance up to Midtown and over to the Chelsea District.

I won't stay here again on principal, but also because you can clearly tell that the building owners are cheapskates that refuse to renovate the property.

When we returned back to the hotel Andre checked us in with Christian and they both gave us great recommendations on where to spend our evenings here in the city. Being two business women from South Florida these gentlemen definitely have southern hospitality, which in return has made us feel welcome with a sense of security staying here.

When I had gotten to my room I realized I had forgotten one of the pamphlets Andre and Christian gave to me on the counter and Steven went back down to retrieve it for me. Everyone here is so kind and respectful; it's a great first impression of New York for me.   \n\nAs for the suite, it's all very posh and has a television in the bathroom mirror.

Sat - Sun for purpose 2, and that gets 5 stars - average it out and I rated it 4 stars. \n\nCheck in\nEasy and painless. I booked with Expedia with no issues. They asked for my name, DL and CC. My card was charged 100.01 dollars for incidentals - that was okay. \n\nParking \n49 dollars a night. Find street parking on 25th street.

Drawers and safe were both under the bed. A bit dated, with some cracks in the wood of the doors and crown molding. The bathroom had a window, didn't open it tho lol. The windows in the bathroom and in the bedroom are openable. Not much space to walk around in which is typical. Bathroom had a TV in the mirror, which was kind of annoying to me. Shower was a bit complicated with it's fancy knobs and settings - or maybe I'm a tad impatient.

It was a beautiful spring evening in the flat iron district. We got back to the hotel to try and get some rest but could NOT sleep! It was so loud with lots of drunks yelling, horns on the street .. I only partially cared bc I knew id be one of those drinks the next day. The AC is also really loud and strong, so if you sleep light it'll def wake you up. \n\nSaturday Morning \/ Evening\nThis is when the location made all the difference! Starbucks is on the corner, as well as Num Pang. What was most important was that Pranna was walking distance away.. And went there for my bday brunch.

I expressed I would've preferred a good night's rest, it's not about the money (especially since work was paying for the visit). A day passed and no call from the hotel. I received an automated email from them asking how my stay was and stating who to contact to express any concerns. I called and left a message for this person on Sunday. She returned my phone call the next day and provided 20% off of my bill, the room really should have been completely comped. I expressed disappointment that I was not told that this music would be heard in my room (I cannot imagine this is the first complaint they've had), I was not offered a choice to move rooms, no one answering the phone at 12:30 at the front desk, and the very slow follow-up to my complaint. She was apologetic, but provided limited explantation on how this was allowed to happen. If anyone books here, be sure to ask for a high floor room or ask the front desk if the live music they play will interfere with your night's sleep. The hotel should provide a disclaimer to anyone booking a room on a lower floor.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The colors, curtains, high ceilings, and bed\/furnishings added up to a great looking place. There isn't a lot of storage so if you are staying several days, you may want to plan on just a few hangers in an armoire. Perhaps other rooms have more storage. You cannot use the fridge in the room for your own stuff - it is intended as mini bar. The shower was phenomenal - it was a little tricky to figure out but was really cool with a big waterfall above the head and jets all over. There is a 'bottle service\/VIP lounge' type of nightclub off the lobby and in the penthouse - returning to the hotel at 1:00 AM on a Saturday was quite the scene as the suited club hosts\/bouncers had temporarily lost control of the crowd of club goers. It's a loud place on weekends - bring earplugs if you're sensitive to that.

The limited number of bedrooms mean that there is a more personal feel.  The rooms have some cool gadgets such as electric curtains and a tv in mirror in bathroom if you are into that!    We had a corner room with two double beds in.  One of the largest rooms I have had in Manhattan although there wasn't much of a view.   It is on a relatively quiet street so we slept well enough and found temperature control good.\n\nThe staff were very helpful.  Anglophile manager Benz was so funny and Angelo on the door was very helpful and always recognised us when we came in.  Oz on reception was also helpful.\n\nWe did have to wait for our room on check in but Benz kindly gave us a late check out in compensation which was very helpful as not having our flight till the evening.\n\nThe only downside is the relatively noisy bar on the ground floor.  Great if you enjoy live music with different acts every night but it did permeate through the building somewhat.  We were on the third floor but directly above bar and we could hear it, although it didn't stop me sleeping.  In some ways it was nice to come back to a hotel where something was going on but perhaps an earlier finish might help guests.\n\nGreat location, only few blocks to subway and easy to walk down to Union Square with some nice shopping nearby.  We found it easy to get around from here and was much quieter than some other areas of town.\n\nAll in all a good experience and a memorable one too thanks to friendly staff.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I met her in the city and we went to check in, only to find it was a double room even when the confirmation clearly stated a twin and requested a high floor. We were on floor 3, the first with bedrooms on following the bar and mezzanine. We requested a town only to be told it would be a charge. We looked at our first room, a very small double that apparently was for two people and then looked at the twin which had two beds exactly the same size of the previous room. Clearly this left us confused, the first room was apparently fit for two people but so was the twin with two of the sane sized beds? In this theory, this too could have slept four!!!! Very disappointed my friend went to complain and me very tired from two flights and long transfer stayed in the room. After several conversations we had to choice but up pay a further $137 dollars on top of what we had paid in advance. We were staying for four nights and no way could have shared the tiny double, even if I were in a couple that bed would be tiny. Our stay following this was lovely and the staff and facilities were great however the stay was affected by this event. Even more so when on the last day I was looking for a check out time and read on trip advisor that this had happened to another girl and the staff had been very accommodating and had moved their rooms twice for a twin room without charge. This left a very sour taste in our mouths. Not exactly fair treatment of guests.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"NONE"}

After reading reviews about the bands that play, I requested a higher floor. Oswaldo was excellent in communicating via email and advised he would move the earth and sea, to ensure we had a higher floor. On checking in we got to meet Oz, and as he promised he gave us a higher floor. We received a room on the 6th floor. \n\nRooms are really nice and modern with electronic blinds,  I am assuming they were recently redone. They are small, but that is what we would expect in New York.. Only issue I had with the room was the sound of the air-conditioning fan. It was hot when we were there so we had to have it on. In more mild months this may not be an issue or for those less sensitive to airconditioning noise.\n\nLocation is excellent if you want to be in the middle of a lot of places. You have an sensational view of the Empire State if you want to go out on the balcony of the Penthouse for a drink. Great photo opportunity.\n\nI have to say, when I booked this hotel, I assumed it was in the famous Flatiron Buidling. It is not, it is two streets away. It is in the Flatiron district.\n\nThe only negative was on the last night (Friday Night) the band was playing and we were trying to arrange transport to the airport at 4.00.am.  We just couldn't hear the reception staff properly. It was too loud due to the music.  We actually went down to reception three times to discuss the arrangements this was frustrating, \n\nIf I was one to be out all night in new york and avoid the bands I would give this hotel a very good review. I think I may joust be getting older.\n\nA big rap also for Oz, he was excellent in arranging the booking and giving us some tips.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is close to the subway, coffee shops, great restaurants and Madison Square Park. Make sure to visit the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. The front desk and bellman staff were outstanding, especially Leo and Alex. They were friendly and helpful. The negatives of the Flatiron are the noise from the night club in the lobby. We were in a corner double Queen room on the 5th floor directly above the night club. The noise was unbearable on Friday and Saturday nights. We could hear the music and people screaming and yelling until 3 AM. Not much sleep was gotten those first 2 nights. On Sunday - Tuesday the noise was much more tolerable - it might have been that the crowd was much smaller and less obnoxious at the nightclub. Since we had one of the largest rooms available(corner queen double) it was a comfortable size for a family of 4. The room was well worn (furniture and carpet with multiple stains). The bathroom had a tub\/ shower and was clean. Despite the hotel being in an ideal location and having a friendly staff, I would not recommend it for a family. They appear to be marketing to a young crowd who likes to party and does not care about getting much sleep on their vacation.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Charge incidentals after they happen. Obviously. Second, we were 3 thirsty travelers when we arrived. A nice relaxing drink at the bar to unwind from the drive? No, the hotel bar doesn't open until 6. Really? So instead of quenching our thirsts, my daughter decided to look in the huge floor to ceiling fish tank in the lobby.

The location is ideal as it is a short walk away from a subway station and there are many places to grab breakfast before you head out for the day.  The room was relatively clean and the shower was great.  \n\nOn the other hand, the nightly music was usually terrible (singers always out of tune), the beds were uncomfortably firm (and I typically like firm beds), and our sink would not properly drain.  We called maintenance about it but their solution was to take out the stopper, which did not change anything.  Also, do not be surprised about mini-bar items being inappropriately charged to your room.  Annoying when the one tray of items is on the desk you would like to use.  We were told at the front desk that the sensor is incredibly sensitive and that \"looking at it may charge you!\".  Okay... \n\nThankfully, you do not spend much time in your hotel room and at least it was clean.  As others have said, only stay on floors 5-7 in order to get a good night's sleep.  Odd business model when you place offering entertainment higher than giving your paying hotel guests a good night's sleep.  I understand that this does not apply to everyone but it seems odd when there aren't that many individuals listening to the music in the first place, particularly on weekdays.  I have read the replies from management mentioning \"light sleepers\".  You do not need to be a light sleeper to be able to hear that music.  Geesh.    \n\nWas it an adequate stay?

Toshi does not love you if he thinks anyone should stay on floors 3&4, and 8 -10.  We were originally put on 3rd floor.  1st floor is their lobby and bar where they have alive band every night, 2nd floor is another lounge area.  Our friends were on 10th floor, underneath the penthouse where they also host parties with live bands or djs.  Weekends they play very loud music till 2 in the morning. Returning to our room on 3rd floor, you would smell weed coming up from the lounge in the hallway. The rooms are not very sound insulated, so on the third floor room, it sounds like you are still in the lounge.  Then after music stops you can hear the partiers out on street. We were not able to go to sleep till 4 am due to the noise.  Same with our friends on the 10th floor.\n\nHotel did move us to the 7th floor (which was quieter) after we complained about not being able to go to sleep on the 3rd floor.   But this room the shower was really musty, because the shower did not drain properly.\n\nOur third floor room had no pen and paper, there was a leather notebook that usually has info on the hotel it was brand new and completely empty.  Why would you even put this in the room?  There was no luggage rack, no alarm clock.  Our shower in the third floor room would run when ever someone else in a room around us was taking a shower, as a result the floor flooded.   There is no room service.  The bar\/lounge downstairs was out of every single wine on their menu.  They were no help on concierge services, literally had no clue what restaurants\/bars etc were around the hotel. \n\nI still don't understand the live music concept of toshi loves u lounge.  It is not that packed and they don't have any alcohol they list on the menu.  They can't be making that much money on the nightlife, but they jeopardize the satisfaction of their hotel guest that would bring most of the revenue of the hotel.  As a business man it does not make sense.  If you want to do this music concept.

When we pulled up in front, the cab driver said, \"Oh, I'm sorry you have to go into that noisy place.\" The band was in full roar and you could hear them in the street. Inside, the front desk person and I had to shout at each other to be heard over the music while I checked in. I asked for a room on a higher floor, and he sent me to 5, which wasn't quite high enough. It was also on the 5th Ave. side of the building, so I could hear the music from the lobby, as well as the raucous party that went on in the street from about midnight until 3, the subway, and someone's small dog yapping for hours on end. I had forgotten my earplugs, so the first night I suffered, but the next night I left the fan running all night for white noise and it was somewhat better. I visit New York a lot, so I understand city noise, but this was over the top.\n\nThe room itself was fine, although mine didn't have all of the amenities advertised on the hotel web site. I had a standard tub and shower -- no rain shower or jacuzzi -- and no electric curtains. The TV in the bathroom mirror was cute, but the lighting around the mirror was dreadful -- I had to put my makeup on in the mirror next to the door where I could actually see what I was doing. The room was fairly large and mostly clean, although the carpet was stained and ripped in one spot and the chairs had stains on them. Also, the window was so dirty I wouldn't have been able to see the view if there had been one. (I realize winter just ended, but wow, the grime was astounding.)\n\nThe best part about staying here is the location. It's in the middle of everything and an easy walk to food, shopping, and entertainment. Madison Square Park and the Shake Shack are steps away, as is Eataly. There's also a popup food square in Madison Square Park where you can find all kinds of ethnic street food for a reasonable amount of money.\n\nIn short, I doubt I would stay here again. Details are critically important, and this place drops the ball. And really, having a rowdy nightclub in the main part of the hotel is unpleasant if you're there to work or rest. (Although I guess if you're there to party, it would be just fine.) There are many better options in the same price range where you can actually enjoy peace and quiet.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After getting my food I headed back up to my room, to find that the automatic curtains in my room were malfunctioning and opening and closing randomly. I called down and they told me they should stop shortly. Sure enough, after 20 minutes they stopped. Ate, went to bed. Fast forward, curtains opening and closing randomly at 2AM. Sigh.

From Angelo opening the door making fabulous recommendations, to over the top service from Kendra and Benz (relax on the couches in the lounge, I'll print your boarding passes and bring them to you).  I've stayed at numerous specialty and boutique hotels since I visit 2-3 times a year but I can't see staying anywhere else now. No rooms in NYC are large but these are redesigned to use the space wonderfully, fantastic lighting for reading, fun high tech touches like a TV in the bathroom mirror and keys that you simply wave at the pad.  There is a comfortable living room style bar and restaurant that has music every night, it made the decision to see a show hard but was wonderful to return to.  The energy of the hotel and staff is what hooks you - you never want to leave.\n\nWe had a bit of a glitch and confusion with the reservation system but they attended to it professionally and with grace beyond hotels that charge 3-4 times the price cannot manage.

All the rooms are differently designed and are different shapes and sizes and all the beds are too, but are incredibly comfy. There's just such a lovely vibe about the place and it's such a super location, close to mid-town for business yet not far from downtown which is more my area. Its got music and different artists performing every night but if I didn't want that, it was unheard where I was on 10th floor. I would say it is more suited to maturer young people.

When I requested a high floor, the manager advised that there was a party going on in the penthouse that night and would prefer to put us two levels below to avoid being disturbed.\n\nAs with any New York hotel, the deluxe king room and bathroom were very small.

Some improvements could be made in the quality of pillows and mattress (rock hard) and towels (small and scratchy).  \n\nThe lobby bar looked nice but was inundated every night with non-guests coming to hang out and listen to the (awful) band that was playing.  Walking through it during the day showed some dirt and wear thanks to the sheer number of people that pile in every night.  We had no chance to check out the rooftop bar as a visit in February isn't conducive to a relaxing patio drink.\n\nAs we came for a Broadway show, we were quite happy with the central location that made walking possible.

I was in a bad mood at check in, but Kenndra's upbeat attitude made it impossible for me to stay angry. I love the lounge and will probably stop by with friends some other night. The fish tank was so pretty too, I love aquariums. Our room was nice and cozy, we didn't want to go home. If it weren't for our two babies back at home we probably would have tried to stay another night.\n\nI read other reviews about the noise. Since we were staying with the intention of celebrating that didn't really bother me. However I really didn't think it was as bad as others have stated. Then again, I'm actually from Manhattan so I know how loud it normally is at night--especially during the weekend.  My husband's from the Hudson Valley, however, and he didn't really notice until I pointed it out. I don't know, maybe some people are just more sensitive to noise than others.\n\nAnyway, I already told my husband I want to do the same exact thing for my birthday.

And when we got there to pick it up, he had even put our luggage in the back seat!  He got us an umbrella when we found ourselves in the rain, gave us directions, and greeted us by name.  Benz, the receptionist who registered us gave us a free upgrade, called us when the room was ready (we arrived two hours early) and then apologized because the room wasn't ready when we got there - not their fault we came early!!\n\nThe rooms themselves are a kick.  Palatially large by NY hotel standards with enough gadgets and electronic devices to keep one amused for a week.

The room itself (toshi corner deluxe) is very large by NYC standards. My wife loves the little hallway in the room. The view is nice enough.  For us the location is hard to beat, walkable to a lot of great stuff,and close enough to the mta for other things. The staff were very friendly. The hotel could easily earn higher marks from us for all these positive things. \nThe drawbacks for us included the following.\nOur single biggest complaint would have to be the seemingly overburdened housekeeping staff. There simply does not seem to be enough people on staff to keep up in a timely fashion. We would typically leave around 8-9 in the morning and come back for a spell in the afternoon, before going out again at night. Housekeeping never got to our room before 3:00 and often well after. We know because of the great location of the hotel we were able to pop in now and then to pick up or drop things off.  It's not like it got a complete makeover every time either. Sometimes the sheets were not changed, just made up. Not a problem per se, we're all about reducing the use of resources etc, but that tactic should save a lot of time when making up a room. We just felt keeping the rooms tidy in a reasonable timeframe was not a priority of hotel management.\nSingle paned windows allow a fair bit of street noise in, which actually wasn't a problem for us, we love the hustle and bustle. However they also tend to generate large temperature swings in the room. The heat, when blowing, was a bit too effective. If you were in the blast radius the air temperature would start to become unbearable after 3 or 4 minutes. When the heat stopped blowing there was a period of about 10-15 minutes when all was well. Then the drafty windows took over and the temperature would drop fairly rapidly. All well and good when you are tucked under the covers, but quite cool (or hot) when just being in the room. The bathroom was consistently cool because there was no heat register, but there is a large window that let a lot of cold air in.\nThe room itself was a bit shabby for the price I felt. The furniture was well used, some kind of beat up, which happens,but making sure that not all the drawer knobs are loose is a simple thing I expect to be addressed for the price we paid. All it takes is a screwdriver and couple of washers. There was no hairdryer in the room despite what we were told by the confident bellhop, nor did the safe work. The in-room coffee was not always replaced. These are admittedly small things, but they started to add up to create a picture of hotel management that is far more concerned with the music venue than the day to day functioning of a good hotel.\nAll in all we enjoyed our stay, but if we did not have the corner deluxe room we would not even consider staying again. There are too many nice hotels at this price point","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Bottom line:  this is a beautifully renovated little hotel in a great location with wonderful staff and a loud nighttime lobby. \n\nThe building itself  is loosely shaped like the nearby Flatiron Building that defines this area.  It is right adjacent to Madison Square Park (the first ever Shake Shack is there) and across the street and down a few doors to the popular and delicious Hill Country BBQ, fyi.  The all 20-something and 30-something staff are friendly, smart, and service-oriented -- had I had the opportunity I would have loved to sit and chat with the front desk staff as they seemed like such great people.  The decor is sort of like what you'd find at Kimpton properties (this is not one) -- a combo of modern with self-conscious ornate touches.  \n\nOur room was predictably small but well-appointed and comfortable.  For example, our queen bed was a platform bed with storage drawers underneath (note the room safe was housed in one of them).  The bathroom was tiled in what looked like alabaster stone (pretty) and the shower had one of those \"car wash\" type nozzle arrangements that aligned vertically - nice.  My only issue with the bathroom was that the mirror above the sink was a bit far away and I kept looking for a magnifying mirror, which wasn't there.  There was, however, a TV embedded into the bathroom mirror, complete with a waterproof remote and directions on how to use it.  In putting my contacts in in the morning, I'd much rather have had a magnifying mirror!\n\nThe one big downside to this place is the nightclub that happens in the lobby, complete with a live band.  Coming back from dinner around 11 p.m. we had to wade through a bunch of folks with glasses in hand. It was hard to communicate verbally with the front desk staff even though we were standing right at the front desk because nobody could hear anybody speak.  I don't know how the front desk staff stands it.  Once we got past the party-goers (and thankful he was there, a security guy) and up to our room, we laughed at how from the third floor it was still pretty loud.  My hubby pointed out that you could hear\/feel the subway as well.  At some point the noise was punctuated with an elevator alarm.  With the exception of the subway, this all stopped around 2 a.m. We expected this from reading other Tripadvisor reviews.  \n\nSo, if you understand what you're getting here, you'll be perfectly satisfied with this hotel.  If you are looking for quiet, don't stay here.  For us, although we liked so much about this place, we would hesitate to return because we don't really value a party soundtrack to a hotel room.","travelDate":"2013-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The lobby is tiny and was crowded with patrons and their suitcases. I was a bit annoyed after an early morning flight, however the rest of our visit went smoothly. Our room was spacious for NYC standards but the bathroom was tight. Our beds were super comfy and we both didn't have problems sleeping (I should also mention we came in late most nights). \nSamantha at the front desk was very personable and she gave us a few dining recommendations which we appreciated. \nI liked that live music was offered in Toshi's, the lobby bar, however we always had someplace to be so we didn't enjoy it. It turns into more of a club\/lounge at night. When we came back to the hotel one evening, we were whisked into the bar by the bouncers and they sat us at a table... we thought why not have a nightcap.... Well, we waited about 15 minutes and no server came by to take our drink order so we left... it was maybe at half capacity.

The next night we met Toshi -the owner- and instead of acting like a professional he was galavanting around the lounge with his dog in one hand and a martini in the other. We were appalled by this behavior. We completely understood why the lounge was so loud at that point - because the man just wants to party!! Needless to say we will not be returning to the flatiron hotel. The whole idea of the place disgusts me. There is no consideration for the guest. And you can see it in the employees faces, they want to help but they CAN'T HEAR YOU!!","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We lucked into a last minute reservation there and ended up paying a fraction of the regularly advertised price.  We didn't know what to expect.  From the beautiful two story fish tank and opulent nightclub just off the lobby to the elegent room upstairs, this place was fun!  Yes, you could hear the band in the nightclub until the wee hours of the evening and yes, you could hear the rumble of the subway beneath the building.  But as someone who hates quiet, this was the place to be.  My husband and adult son loved the t.v. in the bathroom mirror and the big screen t.v. in the room.  Fun features included a doorbell in each room, a jacuzzi tub and automatic drapes. We loved having a drink in the nightclub and listening to the band.  However, beware, there is a $40 minimum in the club and it is assessed in later hours when the club is full.  I would not recommend this hotel to families with children under the age of 21 as the real attractions are things that can really only be appreciated by adults.  The hotel is pet friendly. Actually, there is a dog that serves as mascot for the hotel and it is often on site.","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Also the bar did not open until 5pm which is not really brilliant after you've hoofed it around in 100 degree heat all day! The bar menu is severely limited. All in all the experience was pleasant but for what we paid we should not have to ask for a high level room and should not be made to feel that the lobby was basically out of bounds if we didn't want to be deafened. Its a good job there are three nice bars within easy walking distance.\n\nAlso, Mr Flatiron Hotel, please do not advertise so heavily around the rooftop terrace that isn't open to \"normal\" residents like us, only the fancy in crowd who get invited to parties.

We had read in other reviews that you could not hear the noise above the 4th floor, so after making our reservation we called and asked for a room above the 4th floor. We had a room on the 6th floor, right above the lounge and with a view on Broadway. Well, the noise does go above the 4th floor. In fact, it was so loud that it felt it was right undeneath us. On the first night, we asked for another room, but there were none available and we were told we could probably have one the next day. On the next morning, the front desk called our room to offer us one on the 9th floor. Since we wanted to see the room, we waited for it to be available.

The staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly and made us feel very comfortable and welcome. Beyond the staff, New York City opened its arms to us...or at least it felt that way. Across the street from the hotel is \"My Place Deli\" and the people there were absolutely amazing...so helpful, friendly and even stayed open late the night we got in (horrible weather, cancelled flights) to make us sandwiches. \n\nI would highly recommend this hotel to anyone in their 20's, 30's and maybe even 40's...I am 57 and my husband is 65 and we and not old fogeys...but we do like our peace when we get back to home base on trips. I had read the comments about noise and requested a room away from it all. The staff placed us in room 905 which was great...we could not hear the band at all up there. But you should be forewarned...the lobby where you walk into the hotel is actually part of the bar with a very lively, live (and loud) band right there. When we first got in (around midnight on a Thursday, having left our Tucson home at 5am that morning) we had to shout to be heard over the music there in the lobby. Again, the people were so nice and helpful, it wasn't a huge problem but it was a bit jarring and unexpected. \n\nThe idea of a band Monday through Saturday nights appealed to us, we just didn't think it would be right in the entrance and part of the lobby. Also, from the pictures on the website, I was very excited to sit up on the rooftop and have dinner and drinks but turns out the rooftop is only for private parties. Again, the staff were so nice and willing to take the time to show it to us, but we couldn't actually relax up there. There is a rooftop bar just a block or two away on 5th Avenue though so all was not lost. The room was very small (we got the queen size) but well appointed and the t.v. embedded ghost-like in the bathroom mirror is an interesting novelty. \n\nThis is really a fantastic property, just a little on the high energy side for us but we highly recommend it if you are not put off by the entry bar.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As a veteran NYC visitor, I don't think I've ever stayed in a better located hotel.  I must say however, if I hadn't read about the club in the lobby, when I arrived on Saturday night at 11:00, I would have turned around immediately and left.  The lobby which houses the front desk, also serves as part of the hangout for the live music venue and there were lots of tipsy club goers hanging out in the lobby along with the myself and another group who were trying to check in.  The separation between who was a hotel guest and who just needed a question answered (where is the bathroom?; can I get change for a $100?) was definitely not clear and just a little frustrating.  As was the shouting at the top of my voice just to be heard by the front desk staff - but, remember I had been informed of this before going and sort of knew what to expect.  However, it was still more than a little off putting.  My room was on floor 5 and surprisingly (!), I could not hear even a bass thump from the band downstairs.  Upon descending early Sunday morning into the lobby, i was greeted by sweet peace and quiet and a very happy, helpful staff who made me feel like I was in a hotel again.  The rooms are quite small and not as clean as I would prefer, but not grossly so.  Again, the major point for me is the excellent location.  Would I stay here again?  Maybe, but with a few recommendations - find a space on the second floor to use as a check in desk during the evening hours when the band is playing; better communicate what kind of place they are trying to be (the website mentions the club, but from my observation, the the site projects a much higher end of venue, when in reality the club has much more of a downtown vibe); clean the windows.","travelDate":"2013-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I got a deal via Priceline for The Flatiron (Madison Double room) for 7 nights. I read other reviewers regarding the noise issue from live music venues @the lobby level, so I called the hotel to confirm reservations & ensure a high floor room (which one should always do). The confirmation was honored & our room was available upon our arrival after a red-eye flight, which was amazing. My thoughts on the Flatiron:  1) while the room was spacious w\/high ceilings & crown moldings, it had a peculiar odor which I couldn't readily identify (I ended up going to the local grocery store & purchasing room spray & scented candle); 2) comfortable platform beds w\/drawers below for lots of storage (armoire also in the room)-no bugs; plus the main window opens a couple of inches, which is a treat!; 4) the carpeting was dirty; lots of stains (I believe the hotel accepts pets; maybe we got a \"pet-friendly\" room?)-bring your slippers, the hotel provides bathrobes; 4) tiny marble bathroom w\/shower only, although the shower is fantastic (6 heads & rain shower fixture above)-nice bath products called \"Pure\" by Gloss; there is room for your own toiletries if you re-arrange the towels on the shelves; 5) there is a coffee maker, but if you like tea, bring your own teabags-none are provided; 6) no room service (in fact, no food is available within the hotel) or evening turn-down service-I find that very unusual if Flatiron is striving to attain a high-status reputation; 7) cable was spotty (HBO never came in); 8) the hotel charges to store bags if you have a late departure flight, which I find annoying. Having said all this, the staff is first-rate (thanks Joe & Samantha) with expert housekeeping service & the location is prime-subway lines- N, R, 1, 6- all nearby as well as Eataly and The Doughnut Plant.

It is such a loud and \"party hotel\" which is not what my company and I were looking for. The front desk was highly unorganized and we were quoted a price half of what we we to pay at check out. Such a waste of money. Thank goodness we only ended up staying one night! DON'T STAY HERE! ","travelDate":"2013-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff couldn't do enough for me. They received marketing material and held it for me for two days before I arrived - everyone was lovely, polite and incredibly helpful. In particular Devin at reception who helped me throughout my stay with organising cars to pick me and my clients up to go to dinners, airport runs, catching cabs and even lending me an umbrella for the entirety of a rainy day. He recommended places to go, directed me to pharmacies and even helped me on the last day to get an extra suitcase. \nHousekeeping brought me extra coffee when I needed it (and I SO needed it) and the room although small - it is NY after all - was delightful and I wish I could've stayed in that amazing shower for the whole week. I know I'd be all pruney but wow those jets.\nI was SUPER lucky that I had a room on the 10th floor so I didn't really hear all the noise from the bar & band playing downstairs, but the PH did have a party and it did get quite rowdy. It's the only reason I wouldn't give this a five star rating (if I'd had my kids with me I would've struggled).\nOther than that, I absolutely recommend this place.","travelDate":"2013-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

When we arrived the hotel staff seemed overwhelmed even though there were only 3 people at the front desk. There was a new person \"training\" it seemed and the woman \"training\" him was more so yelling at him for not doing something correctly instead of helping him. The hotel has an odd vibe to it right when you walk in. Our room was not going to be ready until RIGHT at the check in time, 4pm. Which was fine cause we were going out. But that's never happened in all of the hotels we've stayed at. Oh well. So when we got back and got into the room we were on the 3rd floor right on the street almost. The walls are not sheet rock painted walls, I am not sure of the material but it was a kind that was glossy and SOOO dirty, you can see so many fingerprints and smears of dirty hands. SO gross. The room was SO small, you literally walk in the room and the bed is RIGHT there. No room to put anything, no closet or dresser. At night you can hear music loudly and noise of people slamming their room doors. Late, like 2-3-4am. The carpet in our room was stained and pulling up from the floor where furniture was. I think we almost could have dealt with all of that, but the rock hard bed and pillows were the final straw. We did not mention any of these things to the hotel cause we were only there for one night then left to go to a different place thank god. But it was not comfortable, it was so small, dirty, staff was inexperienced and seemed rude. We have stayed in probably over 20 hotels in NYC and this was by far the worst. It has neat little touches in the room that would have been cool if the important things were not so crappy.","travelDate":"2013-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Chose it because it was convenient to where I was located in manhattan and wanted convenience to LGA in the morning. A friend had stayed there 1year ago right after their grand opening and he loved it. \n\nWon't comment on the area, because whether \"it's in a great area\" is REALLY dependent on where you need to be \/ what you want to do in NY. Flatiron area is convenient to Chelsea\/midtown\/east side and fairly close to Times Square. Not a \"hip\" area but Betty is in the eye of the beholder. Very safe area though. \n\nPros: the hotel was fairly stylish, decent location, safe, and you really can't complain for the price. The room had fairly cool amenities (but see below), and I agree with many other commenters, the staff was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC: the front desk girl was very nice, helpful and accommodating, and the front door bellman\/security\/front-house guy (same guy all the other commenters mentioned) was super helpful. Took my bags to my room when I was in a hurry (not standard service), gave a legitimately good restaurant recommendation, and they were both very friendly and kind. \n\n Cons: and this is why I said I wish I could give a 4 but can't: agree with another user review - the hotel simply looks tired. It is an older building which was renovated a year ago, and while the rooms have fancy options like TVs in the bathroom mirror, flatscreens in the room, remote-controlled curtains, a waterfall shower with about 7 waterfall heads, and also had a very cool bed & finishings... Unfortunately, the phone didn't work, the waterfall shower didn't work, the tv didn't work (either of them), the room was pretty \"worn\" (prob due to location and price point), and the shower tiles were taped up with masking tape (seriously, shocked) and I found some tape which had fallen off the window in the middle of the floor. \n\nI probably could have complained and I am certain that the very helpful staff could have moved me, but I was only there for 8 hours and then flew out, so I didn't bother. In a nutshell, if you can't find a decent hotel for the 100-200 range (NEVER stay in a 3-star or less in NY unless you want bedbugs), it is good enough. But through Hotwire\/Priceline you can usually get 4-stars for the same price (the same day there were multiple options in manhattan for 113+), and other places I've gotten like the Waldorf, Benjamin, Hyatt, westin grand central - are nicer.

Devon the Guest Services guy was superb and couldn't do enough to help us. Lets face it, we all know that it is the job of front of house staff to make you feel special - and that is how they make their tips. But, this is one of the first hotels that my wife and I have stayed at that the staff , seemed to want to help because they were proud of their hotel and their city, and that shone across. We couldn't be more complimentary about them all.\n\nRooms were clean. Our room was very small - but we got a deal on the room and that is why - you get what you pay for.\n\nMusic in the downstairs area was lively and fun. It finished by 12pm all nights bar Friday and Saturday, no music on Sundays. We read other reviews before we arrived and requested a room on the upper floors - duly granted. We also took earplugs in case we needed them and I popped them in on Saturday night (the noise was not excessive).\n\nLocation of the hotel was good - away from Times Square, but close enough to walk there in 10 mins. Subway stations within 2 or 3 blocks.\n\nAltogether a briliant little hotel. Advice would be to look out for deals on this hotel - they do happen. If you are looking for a hotel with loads of facilities to relax and enjoy then this possibly isn't the best option. But, if you are looking for a place with superb customer care, and somewhere to use as a base and get out and see New York then this hotel is perfect.","travelDate":"2013-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It turned out to be a great choice for us.  Having said that, if you are visiting New York for the first or second time, do your homework. Each neighborhood has its own personality, and you should make sure your expectations, priorities and agenda synch with reality. Staying in the Flatiron district is going to be a very different experience than staying on Central Park South or the Upper East Side. The neighborhood itself is named for the Flatiron Building, a New York landmark and architectural gem.  There's lots of office buildings, plenty of places to eat (check out Eataly) and subway stops. The hotel itself is a friendly boutique hotel with a nightclub in the lobby.  There is free wifi but its not the most reliable...so if you want a good night's sleep and need to be on the internet all day, this isn't the best choice.  The rooms are small, but again, expectations have to coexist with reality. In a city where it costs $50.00 to park your car in a garage overnight, its ludicrous to expect a spacious room and large bathroom for $200.00 or less\/night.  I found that the small space was very well thought out and gladly traded a large bathroom for my six headed rain shower, high quality toiletries, linens, bathrobes and lots of fun electronic gadgets.  The queen sized bed was captain style, which means the mattress was on a platform with six large drawers underneath.  For us, the nightclub in the lobby was great.  The band, City of Six, was fantastic, and without having to leave our hotel on a freezing night, we had a few drinks, bar food, danced and had a really nice evening. Best of all was the free pass to the 24 hour health club across the street.  Its a full service gym, better than the one we belong to at home.  We found this hotel to be wonderful, and will definitely return on our next trip home.","travelDate":"2013-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location popped up as being ideal for a  recent combination business\/leisure trip with my husband and a friend.  My challenge was to find a hotel in the neighborhood that would serve us all well.  I wanted a romantic pad for the first night, desk-work space and connectivity throughout the stay, enough room to welcome a third occupant for the second night, a reasonable rate and, dare-I-ask in Manhattan, abundant natural light?  I zeroed in on a Toshi Corner Deluxe room at the Flatiron.  With 2 queen beds, a spacious bathroom and wrap-around floor-to-ceiling windows, I scored a home run with all parties. We found the staff very welcoming.  Devin, in particular, had a knack for keeping an eye out and making sure that all of our needs were being met before even being asked.  The room was overall terrific, with a few rough edges; a leaky hot water tap, a loud and hot-air-blasting heating system, and oddly, soap was \u201con-request,\u201d whereas bath gel, shampoo and conditioner were supplied.  Colors, d\u00e9cor and bed linens were all pleasing.  We had plenty of towels and wash cloths. The (no surcharge) WiFi worked fine. Closet space was tight but the corner room had good nooks to tuck things away and there were plenty of drawers under the TV stand and beds, so storage was ample.  I had been forewarned on TripAdvisor regarding loud and late lounge music 6 nights a week, so I requested a high floor room in advance of our stay. The request was acknowledge by email.  I admit that I was a bit disappointed to end up assigned to the 4th floor, only one floor above the first level of rooms.  Perhaps this was the only corner room left, but no explanation was given.  Music was indeed loud on Saturday night, but we did not return from our evening out until after 1 am, so we were not kept up for long and Sunday night was quiet.  All in all we were very satisfied with our stay and would happily return to the Flatiron Hotel.

It was in a great location, 9 W 26th St., and the rooms looked modern and frankly the prices looked impossible.  A regular room was listed around $169 so I sprang for the largest room for $233!  I have never stayed in NYC for anything close to that except when using Priceline.  The Flatiron is a boutique hotel with a very cool vibe.  The lobby is an open concept, sharing space with Toshi's Livingroom, a slick restaurant\/bar with live music every single night.  As soon as you walk in you note an enormous spiraled floor to ceiling fish tank worthy of an HGTV special.  Fun.  The room was large and very tech saavy with switches for everything, a remote control for the curtains, a jetted tub in the bath and a huge mirror in the bath with an imbedded tv.  We had two very comfortable queen beds with abundant pillows. I'd like to mention again...for $233.  I love this neighborhood and will definitely be returning to this hotel in the near future.

I stayed with a friend for a four day girls weekend that we booked blind on hotwire without knowing the name of the hotel until we confirmed.  Lucky for us because we really loved this place and may not have found it otherwise.\n\nFirst of all, the location can't be beat- an easy walk to everywhere from Saks to Soho, subway only a block or two away, and only a short walk to Penn station.  Ideal for us because we wanted to cover a lot of ground.  Also good when you are planning to buy every pair of shoes in the city because you are never too far from the hotel to drop off your bags and keep going.  \n\nThe rooms were very clean and modern.  The shower was pretty amazing- plan an extra 30 minutes of shower time into your day because you will undoubtedly linger in that shower.  The tv in the bathroom mirror is pretty neat, although I couldn't see above the tv because I'm so short and used the full length mirror in the bedroom instead.\n\nThe lobby is great at night- fun and energizing!  They had great music during our stay and a pretty good stand up comedy night on Sunday.  And the fish tank is fabulous, especially lit up at night.\n\nThe Flatiron staff are what distinguish this hotel from the rest.  They are all very helpful, genuinely friendly, and surprisingly polished and professional for such a young team.  The service from everyone was great, from check in to requesting extra blankets to reserving and printing tickets for events to restaurant suggestions.  We particularly loved Devin!  He sent us to a number of great restaurants and was always excited to hear all about it when we got back. I'm a real foodie, so I knew I was in good hands when we asked him where he thought we should go and his eyes lit up when he spoke of caipirinhas and Brazilian food. He took such great care of us and was so welcoming when we would return each day!  Would have loved to pack him and the fish tank up to take home to PA but was limited to two carry on bags on the train.\n\nI also felt very safe and comfortable here as well as in the surrounding neighborhood.

You are stuck listening to music that isn't all that great, at volume.  \n\nI read a lot of tripadvisor reviews where people complain about noises, and i think they are just whiney.

My friend kept asking me if the window was open and we made a running joke about who has to have the bed closest to the window.

The room itself wasn't bad and the bed was pretty comfortable.  I rank it \"poor\" for several other reasons.\n\nThe bathroom was ridiculous - so small you have to squeeze into it and close the door before you can even see the toilet.  No soap dishes of any kind.  In fact, no place to put soap or shampoo in the shower other than the floor.  They have opted for some trendy \"perks\" which are nice on the surface but not worth the effort.  The bathroom mirror has a TV nested within the mirror itself.  At first this seemed pretty cool but quickly became a nuisance as you can really use that part of the mirror for shaving.  They also have a wall shower in addition to the overhead but the showere stall is so ridiculously small I could barely squeeze into it.  I'd prefer a soap dish over these expense and useless additions.\n\nThe wireless internet is beyond ridiculous.  The signal strength goes in and out all the time.  I sat and watched it go from 1 bar to 3 bars back to 1 bar, over and over.  When I called the front desk, they explained that the internet may be slow when the bar is full downstairs.  Slow internet doesnt' explain why I can't attach to the local wireless network however.  Moreover, I got up a 6 AM to get some important work done and the internet was still *painfully* slow.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem of all is that they have no room service!  I've stayed in all kinds of hotels all over the world of every shape and size and every price category.  Even those places that don't have a restaurant or kitchen at least provide local take out menus.  The only available information in the room was urging me to check out Toshi's, the clubs on the ground floor and penthouse.  Clearly, the clubs are what the owners care about.  This hotel has a restaurant\/kitchen but no room service!  I've never seen such a thing.  The local food establishments leave a lot to be desired.  This is probably the only area in NYC that has very few choices for food without venturing farther afield.\n\nOther nitpicky problems - the desk chair is actually quite nice, but since the room was so small, I couldn't fully pull it out and had to stand on top of it and gradually slip my legs under the desk.  Also, I had turned on the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign as soon as checking into the room as I was very jet lagged and needed to take a nap.  As soon as I fell asleep, someone from Housekeeping knocked and entered the room to restock the minibar even with the Do Not Disturb prominently displayed.  There is no concierge service to speak of and I ended up having to find out everything myself as the staff seemed to know nothing about New York City.\n\nThey should stop spending money on useless oddities like curtains around the bed and provide some of the basic features all hotels have.

I was disappointed by the Flatiron Hotel.\n\nI'll start off by saying that this hotel is in a perfect, convenient location.  That is key.  It goes downhill from there.  I agree with others who say this is not a 4 star hotel.  I've stayed at many boutique hotels, frequently with Kimpton--and if you think that's the level of service\/ambiance you'll get here, you're wrong.  The whole hotel seemed a bit haphazard--from the bizarre lobby with aquarium and a very loud bar\/live performance area--to the room which was very gimmicky\/electronic\/digital, but nothing really worked right.  I had to switch rooms because things weren't working properly in my first room.  The size is ok--nothing to be excited about--but normal for a NY hotel.  I also wasn't impressed with the service.  They were willing to help when asked but definitely nothing above and beyond.  Also, they make you pay to store your bags... Seriously?  At a hotel that's theoretically a 4 star?  That's just a service you provide for people who are paying $ already to stay with you.\n\nThis hotel is aspiring to be something cool, hip, high end.  But on all accounts, it does not succeed.\n\nFinally, I had horrible sleep staying here.  I live in a city--on a traffic circle--so I'm not sensitive about sound.  I'd read about the bands downstairs so requested a room on a high floor.  I got floor 5.  I could hear the pounding of the bar downstairs and the live music until past 2 am.  This is NOT a comfortable place to stay.  Not the worst.  But I'd sooner stay at the Chelsea Hampton Inn next time than here!","travelDate":"2012-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My room wasn't large but was well appointed with contemporary furniture, including electric drapes controlled from a bedside switch. The bathroom had the tech gimmick of a TV built into the mirror (which I had no interest in, and which, when switched off, meant there was a dark rectangle in the mirror when I was shaving).  The shower was a highlight: a combination of overhead rain showerhead and front-on body sprays: you could select either or both with the rotating knob. The main problem with the accommodation was that no amount of flashy technology could conceal the underlying dated infrastructure. The heating was crude: every few minutes it came on with a huge whirr and blasted the room with hot air until it began to feel oppressive, then it switched off again and the temperature dropped away until the cycle was repeated. During the night I switched it off to avoid the noise and the big temperature swings while I was under the covers. But at least the room had heat: the bathroom, on the other hand, was distinctly chilly. It seemed that there was no heating there at all, except when you opened the door to let a little drift in from the room. Hotel staff were very friendly but another annoyance was the restaurant\/ bar on the ground floor, where at check-in a band was playing so loudly that I asked for a high-floor room. The receptionist chuckled, obviously knowing exactly what I was talking about, having had to work with it all evening. In summary, a great location and nice fitments in the rooms, but with issues caused partly by their own making and partly by the fact that this is a conversion of an old building.","travelDate":"2012-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

But surprisingly Flatiron Hotel has big rooms. We had a corner room on the 6th floor with 2 queen beds, flat screen TV, even the bathroom had a built in TV in the mirror.  The hotel bar\/lounge has live music daily. I hate when places charge you for Wi-Fi, and some hotels even have the nerve to charge you per device. But Flatiron Hotel not only provides this service free of charge but the access code and password to log on to the Wi-Fi is written on your key card holder.  Thats considerate and a nice added touch.

It is walking distance to Union Square, Herald Square, Times Square etc. but is still away from the hustle and bustle of things so you can get a goodnight sleep. Also there are some good eats down the block and around the corner like Hill Country BBQ, Melt Shop and Shake Shack.\n\nWhat trumps the spacious rooms and great location is their hospitality.

We were a little surprised when we learned the bed would be a full-size mattress and not something bigger, but that's what you get when you gamble on a boutique hotel.  Other reviews have complained about noise, but we were on the 5th floor and weren't really bothered by it much--you hear some car honks and the underground subway, but hey, it's the big city. The automated curtains were cool; there was a receiver tucked away in the room's desk so you could play music in surround sound; a closet unit to hang clothes in next to the fluffy bathrobes; expensive snacks, if you so choose; iron and ironing board; iHome clock; hairdryer; coffee pot; TV in the small shower room (no tub); another TV mounted above the desk, and an extra chair to sit in by the bed.  The bed size ended up being not a problem after all.  The shower had many water heads on it, so that was really cool.  They do not have rollaways because the rooms are small, so if you have more than 2 people or have adult family members or friends of the opposite sex, be sure to see if they have a two bed option before booking.   I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again, as it's location was really convenient to a lot of touristy things to do around Broadway and Times Square.  The subway is nearby, so it's easy to hop on and off of it if you get tired of walking so much.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.","travelDate":"2012-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Toshi's \"lounge\" is extremely loud and there can be some horrid singers, so you don't want to hear that all night. The waitresses at the lounge were all too busy chatting with themselves and fixing their dresses instead of providing service, so I wouldn't bother going there. \n\nThe room itself was pretty decent after we finally got one. Apparently our original room had \"frozen over\" because someone left the AC on, so we had to get a different room. \n\nIf you go through Bookit.com and you're entitled to two free drinks, be careful to ask in advance. The concierge had no idea what we were talking about and I got some vague answer about them comping it at the end, which I had to argue for when the bill actually came. The concierge in general were all pretty lax and unprofessional. \n\nI really wouldn't bother staying here, there are tons of better locations and better hotels to stay at. \n\nAlso, the CHARGE you to hold your bags.

The address on 26th St, close to 5th Avenue, was its best asset as far as I was concerned.  It was close to where I needed to be as the next day my daughter's final fitting at Kleinfeld's bridal was within easy walking distance.  Madison Square Park, Shake Shack, and Eataly nearby which I like. I thought the hotel was good but not great for these reasons:  upon walking into the hotel for check-in after 9:30 pm, the ground floor entrance was interesting, especially the exotic round cylinder fish tank running up the middle of the room.  However, the band playing in the lounge which is open to the check-in area, was absolutely blasting, so unnecessarily loud.  We felt bad for the clerk who must have hearing loss by this time.  Thankfully, check-in was so quick we got our room keys and quickly got out of there.  Security while traveling is important to me, so I was disappointed that anyone could enter the elevators and go up to our floor without restriction.   Our room was practically across the elevator and the hallway was quite narrow in favor of a rather large size room (two queen beds in this room) with very high tray ceilings and ornate crown molding.  The beds, while stylishly decorated, especially the headboards with decorative curtains on either side, were not as comfortable as I've had for the price and the mattresses were hard, but some like it that way.  Nice pillow selection and nice sheets.  The beds were platform beds with drawers for storage, so I promptly banged my leg on the corner of the platform.  The rest of the furniture in the room, in my opinion, was cheap looking, nothing special.  I'm used to minibars, but this one the clerk actually warned us about it upon check-in saying that you only have 20 seconds and if the sensor picks up that something is not in its place, you're getting charged.  That includes a sensor for dry snacks on top which look like they're in an ordinary tray - they're not.  Needless to say, didn't touch either.  One cup at a time coffee maker, lousy coffee.  There's a Starbucks a stone's throw from the hotel, much better.  There is a restaurant which I assume serves meals in the same location that becomes the lounge for entertainment in the evenings.  I didn't have any meals there.  The little extras that did not impress me was a TV in the mirror of the bathroom (you had to shut the door to get in front of the sink) so the only time you might want to watch it is while washing you face, etc. since you can't see it unless you are standing right in front of it.  The shower was very nice with a large rainshower head, optional jets for lower body, plenty of towels, etc. but no where to hang them except one hook on the back of the door.  Toilet small, very low.  Air conditioning very good.  Robes in wardrobe closet.   Lighted buttons for do not disturb or to request housekeep.  Very large windows running the width of the room with motorized curtains.  Free wifi and nice large LG flat screen TV on the wall.  Clean room, but definitely wouldn't say immaculate.  Seems like a lot of stuff that might appeal to some, but when it came down to it, I decided I'll stay somewhere different next time.","travelDate":"2012-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were there to celebrate our anniversary to to catch up with old friends because we moved away from NYC 10 years ago.\n\nLocation:  Perfect for us. We both used to work in the neighborhood, so we're especially comfortable with the area and it was easy for all our friends to come meet us in the Toshi bar downstairs.\n\nToshi Lounge: Loved it.  Added a good vibe to an area that we remember being really dead at night. My husband couldn't help but notice and mention (repeatedly) what a good looking crowd of women were at the bar on Thursday night. Obviously, if we still lived up there, that would be his new Thursday night hangout.  :)\n\nThe room we were put in on the 9th floor was a good size, so judging by the other reviews on here, ours may have been bigger. The bathroom was especially spacious, so we must have landed a good room. Husband also liked the TV in the mirror. Typical guy.  He likes pretty girls and cool gadgets, go figure. \n\nThe front desk staff could not have been nicer. We mentioned we were there for anniversary when we checked in and they made a big to-do about it.  You would have thought it was our honeymoon instead of our 17th year together.  Made us feel very welcome.\n\nOverall, the place was clean, comfortable, safe and welcoming with a funky vibe that made me give it the full five stars. Def planning on staying here again next time.

E-mailed the hotel 3 months prior to arrival, requesting high floor and nice view and ended up on the 10th - and highest - floor with a street view! Warm welcome from the front desk, easy and quick check in and just a perfect stay. The bathroom mirror-TV was not working and this was fixed directly. Stayed in room 1008 which was a king with a large bed (180 cm), desk and a - by NYC standards - huuuge bathroom. Clean and fresh with a hand held shower in a HUGE shower cabin (could easily fit 8 people in there) with good water preassure. I think that a full length mirror in the room was missing from a wall which was a bit annoying, We used the bathroom mirror instead so not a big deal but would have made going out at night more easy. Also hooks in the bathroom would be nice - we ended up hanging towels on whatever surface we could find. \n\nSome people have written that the neighbourhood is shady, but this is not true at all. The hotel is right by the park with lots of restaurants and shops, 5th av and Broadway. Garbage is left outside of every building in NYC so this is not any kind of weird thing to see at night. You reach Macy's within 10 minutes by foot, and the subway is 2 blocks away (lots of different lines close by actually, but the closest one is just 2 blocks away - one minute by foot). Broadway between 26th and 28th (hotel is on 26th) has some down market shops and sure, you might think this is \"shady\", but trust me there is nothing unsafe about this area at all. My fifth time in NYC this is by far the best hotel and nicest location I've stayed in - no matter where we were, Times square, The Upper West Side, The Village or Brooklyn, we were always close to home which is perfect when you want to dump the shopping and take a shower before you head out again.  \n\nTurndown service consisted of turning down bed + changing towels and emptying trash. A nice touch! Housekeeping was spotless. \n\nBed was comfy and had drawers in which one could place belongings. There was also a closet with hangers and bathrobes.  \n\nNice lobby with cute fishtank & Toshi's where you could have a drink or dinner. Good live music! \n\nWe were not disturbed by Toshi's or subway but keep in mind we were on the 10th floor.\n\nAC worked fine, did not get a chance to look at the gym. Front desk had adapters and when we checked out a faulty minibar charge was corrected without discussion. \n\nI would very much like to recommend The Flatiron - cool, clean and a perfect NYC location with friendly staff! Very nice and by NYC standard very-very nice! Will be staying there again.","travelDate":"2012-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Key reasons are...\n\n1- the location is amazing. We love the flatiron building, which is just round the corner so we could enjoy it everyday. We enjoy walking and getting down to Battery park or up to central park and everywhere in between was easy from the hotel. Very near a couple of subways on 23rd. Also near some great food places including Eataly, shake shack and while we didn't go, two of the top three trip advisor rated restaurants in NY. We also benefitted from a seasonal food festival 'Madison square eats' which we would highly recommend. \n\n2 the hotel - the hotel is about a year old and looks great, very clean and contemporary. The big fish tank in reception is beautiful! We were on the 10th floor an had a very good sized room. For ten days stay we accumulated quite a bit of stuff and the room was still spacious, the bed comfy, always clean and the tv in the bathroom mirror - quality! The downstairs bar was good, live bands every night and while we never ate there, the food looked and smelt good. It was nice to have a good bar on site as an option for a night out. \n\n3- the staff. The staff were always very polite and professional. Everyone associated with the hotel that we met we're great - special mention to the concierg team who were tremendous especially Carmelo (hope I've spelt that right) who we saw most evenings on our way in and out of the hotel and was always friendly and willing to help. \n\nAll good? One slight grumble was that we booked through hotwire and had to reschedule due to a dislocated knee (ouch!) and extended through the hotel by an extra couple of days. This caused a number of conversations with different people before it wa finally resolved. To be fair, it is one of those rare events that would be a billing nightmare and as it got resolved fairly this by no way impacted our stay. \n\nWe had an amazing trip to New York and a great part if this was due to our stay at the Flatiron hotel.

Don't pick up the snacks on the table because there are sensors on them, and if you move them for more than 20 seconds you are charged. So if you want to move them out of the way you'll have an unpleasant surprise on your bill. \n\nThe tv in the mirror is a fun little accessory, but if you're a woman of average height you may wish it were not there, since it makes putting on your makeup difficult. The dark area where the tv is makes it hard to see your face. \n\nI will not be going back on my next trip to NYC.

La mia maggiore preoccupazione era la grandezza della stanza, temevo che come spesso accade in Usa ci avrebbero stipati in 4 in un stanzetta angusta e invece abbiamo avuto la \"corner suite\"' che ci ha permesso di avere due grandi letti matrimoniali, un ampio bagno e tante finetre che rendevano la stanza ariosa e confortevole. Accappatoi ed asciugamani a profusione, pulizia, cassaforte e design moderno confermano il livello 4 stelle dell'hotel. Avevo letto anche che l'hotel era 'rumoroso' per via della metropolitana che in effetti un p\u00f3 si avverte anche dal settmo piano, ma vi assicuro che dopo aver camminato per 8 ore al giorno con l'emozione che una citt\u00e0 vibrante come new york ti da, il rumore si avverte appena.

After talking to expedia directly, the matter was finally resolved at the intervention of the Hotel Manager, Mr. Benjamin who informed us personally that we will will able to check in and our room will be upgraded to superior room. He also apologised for the delay which lasted for about Hour and half. \n\nThe room was in the sixth floor, corner of the buliding with full size windows on both sides which provided excellent view on both sides outside. It had hitech features such as mirror with lights and small TV screen in it in the bathroom, bath tub with Jacuzzi, button to open curtains near the bedside, electronic display button for do not disturb & for house keepin, etc. The mattresses and the pillows were fantastic and the lights in the room were excellent and much more than sufficient.

The area itself is full of attractions to tourists such as Mario Batali's \"Eataly,\" Jay-Z's \"40\/40 club\", the Flatiron building itself, Teddy Roosevelt's birthplace and many more.  The hotel is new and still in its opening phase, so there are a few hiccups here and there, but the overall experience FAR outweighs any negatives.  The lobby is lovely with a huge unique saltwater aquarium surrounded by a transparent spiral staircase. There is live music at night with a great jazz ensemble.  The room itself is wonderfully apportioned and the bathroom has a TV in the mirror.  We had some difficulty using the Wi-Fi and had to be in certain places in the room to get it, but I'm sure that's a minor kink to be worked out. The thermostat settings were a bit touchy, so we found it better to leave it alone. There are those who complained about the subway noise - and while noticeable, I have to say my take was \"Welcome to New York City.\"  There's nothing they can do about that now.. and if anything, if you want to visit other parts of the city, you know that the subway is close by!  You're in walking distance to Times Square (16 blocks - we did it with a 7 y\/o) and a nice park around the corner. We found the staff to be very friendly and accomodating.

A decent size, too. A clean, comfortable bed and a really nice shower unit sealed the deal.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and incredibly helpful. One day after an lengthy sight-seeing tour, we got back to find they had very kindly taken our luggage (lost at the airport for one day) up to our room so we had it waiting on our return. It's all in the little touches, and it was very much appreciated.\n\nIf you're looking to get out and see the sights, the Flatiron Hotel's location is really second to none. Close enough to the main sights and attractions of Manhattan, but far away enough to be a little haven at the end of a long days sight-seeing or shopping. Yes, you can hear taxi horns and sirens at night and the occasional rumbling of a subway train, but we certainly didn't find it unbearable by any means. Plus, you just have to remember this is NYC... \n\nTip: As it's a relatively new hotel, a number of the taxi drivers and shuttle bus employees looked puzzled when you gave them the name. Best to make a note of the address if you go out and about.\n\nI'll be recommending this hotel to friends and family, and given that it's still in the 'soft opening' stage (although the bar adjacent to the lobby is now open and looks great) it can only get even better.

The Flatiron is really a beautiful building and truly unique!  Around that area is also the popular Shake Shack right inside the park, as well as Mario Batali's Eataly!  There's no restaurant in the hotel itself so at least there are a couple of legit options around.\n\nWe had the Madison Double and it turned out to be one of the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in for NYC.

Flat screen TV and a remote controls the curtains.  The temperature can be set easily also.  Beds were very comfy as we all got a good night's sleep.  The room also comes with one of those iHome iPod\/iPhone controls.  The only thing about the room is the layout of the bathroom.  Our room's wash stand was right in front of the toilet with little room to spare.  Had to make sure we didn't touch the bowl when we were brushing our teeth :P\n\nHowever, the showers were awesome.  Swiss rain fall coupled with a few shower heads that shoots right at your body.

I booked and prepaid for a room several months prior to our stay date (March 10th). My wife, who is 8 months pregnant and I were in the city for a surprise party. I researched the location in regard to the party location so she could easily return to the room when she got tired and it seemed to be a nice boutique hotel. Upon arrival, 4:30 on the 10th, we were informed, after we parked in the garage recommended by the hotel, that we no longer had a room due to a ceiling collapsing the night before (???) I am not sure why the didn\u2019t call us in advance, but they booked us in another hotel. I was not pleased, but tried to be understanding and went to the next hotel (which shall remain nameless). Upon entering the room it was immediately determined it was unacceptable (not an even exchange by any standard) Then my wife began calling the Flatiron to request more suitable accommodations, she read a report of bugs in the hotel we were transferred too. It took approximately 1 hour and 4 calls for them to provide any suitable suggestions, now we are less than an hour from the party and are not dressed. We finally accepted a stay at another hotel which was very nice, but not particularly close to the location of our party. Overall it was a disappointing experience, because simple customer service in the form of a phone call should have been provided. We also questioned why it was our room that was damaged and unavailable, had every other guest booked prior to us? We had other friends from the party staying at the Flatiron without incident. Overall, I have nothing to say on the room, but the quality of our experience was poor.","travelDate":"2012-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

If they claim I didn\u2019t stay there a second time, I assume they\u2019ll give me a refund?\n\nI booked a stay at the Flatiron on 2\/17. The dates I booked were 2\/22 to 2\/24. After booking the hotel, I made flight plans and unfortunately had to book a redeye flight. I then contacted the Flatiron by phone and very clearly offered to add one night\u2019s room on the beginning of my stay so that a room would be ready for me when I arrived at 7AM in the event that an early registration would not be possible. Jessica, who I spoke with, said that she \u201clocked\u201d that room and that an early check in would be possible. Again to be completely clear, I offered to book another night\u2019s stay to ensure early check in, but was told by the Flatiron not to do so. \n\nUpon arrival early in the morning on the 22, I was informed that no room was available and that the room had been rented the night before\u2026I would have to wait. I went to a Starbucks and waited about 2.5 hours until they had a room available. Not a huge inconvenience.\n\nUnfortunately that was pretty much the highlight of my stay there. It became such a comedy of errors that I ultimately suspected that they were messing with me intentionally. \n\n-\tI went to the front desk in the evening of my first day and extended my stay one day. The clerk made the change and told me I would receive an email confirmation. When it had not arrived by the next morning, I again stopped by the front desk to confirm. Either of those interactions would have been idea times for the front desk staff to offer to redo my key entry card \u2013 on three occasions the last two days of my stay, I couldn\u2019t get into my room and had to go back down to the desk and reques that the key card be adjusted.\n-\tThe WiFi service ONLY extended to the 8 to 10 inches closest to the room door. I called the front desk two nights in a row and both times and was told that the \u201cweb guy\u201d wasn\u2019t on duty, so please use the business center. \n-\tThe  Jacuzzi tub in my room did not work. I called the desk on the first night, no one ever came up.\n-\tWhen I got to my room on the third evening, it had not been cleaned. Had to ring the front desk two times requesting service. When they did service the room, they neglected to leave any bath towels. \n\nThere\u2019s more but that\u2019s about all the space I have. I understand errors and I also believe that often times when one error occurs for whatever reason, seems like chances are something else will go wrong. So in all honestly I would have likely laughed all of this off if the Flatiron had not successfully gotten my earlier review removed. That speaks to their character and should serve as a warning sign to anyone considering staying there.","travelDate":"2012-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was debating between this hotel and an UWS one, but chose this one because it's proximity to the subway and my favorite coffee shop (perfect to grab breakfast\/coffee on my way to the airport).\n\nTo sum up my 90 minutes in hell with the Flatiron staff: I ended up switching rooms 4 times because in each room there were either tiny black hairs in the bed or in one bed there were long black strands of hair & blood on the duvet. The front desk manager I dealt became more insensitive & cold each time I had to deal with him.\n\nAlso, it seems this hotel encourages it's staff to remain unprofessional. None of the housekeeping\/maintenance employees were in any kind of uniform, the \"General Manager\" gave me his card in which his former title \"Housekeeping Manager\" was scribbled out and \"G.M.\" was written above it. He also gave me his cell phone number (which he had to look up on his phone?) to call him next time I was in the city and he assured me \"he'd take care of my visit\".\n\nNot once was I offered an upgrade for my inconvenience, any kind of refund, comped room, or anything that would have made my stay more pleasant beyond the vague \"call me and we'll take care of you\" thing.\n\nI was made to feel like a nuisance & very unwelcome, and I think that would make any guest at any hotel upset.","travelDate":"2012-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

I just got back from our trip (Feb 16 - 19) with my husband.  We were booked for 2 beds and I made a number of requests, which they happily provided. Since it was only the 2 of us, I requested to have the King size bed and from reading the reviews here about the noise, I also requested for rooms in higher floors. We end up getting a small cozy king bed room on the 8th floor in the hotel.  We still were able to hear the trains passing through, but the bed was so comfortable and my added exhaustion from traveling the city, we were totally out and sleeping like babies.  \n\nThe room was very modern and clean, we had fun with the remote curtains and the TV in the washroom mirror, but had a problem setting the alarm. Wish there were instructions on how to use the alarm clock in the room. As the alarm would set off the curtains to automatically open and the heat to turn on.  There wasn't enough towels, so we had to request for more.  We had a mini fridge full of items, but no place to put our own items.  So, we end up taking out some cans to cool our own items and placing them back when we left. We found out afterwards, the mini fridge keeps tabs of items you take out for more than 20 sec and charges it on the bill. When we checked out, we were charged for the cans, but the clerks removed the charge, as we told them we didn't consume the drinks and only use it for fridge space to put our own items. So, we will see later if they still charged us for the items on our credit cards. We had trouble controlling the temperature in the room. It was either too cold or too hot. There was also a delay with hot water for showering. It took about 5 mins to get the hot water running for our showers.  There were some misses but the stay was overall enjoyable, as we just need a place to sleep.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located close to the subway. The reception will recommend you to take the subway on the 23rd, but we learned that there was a closer stop on the 28th and Broadway, which is about a 5-10 mins walk to the hotel.\n\nI would definitely come back for another stay here as the location is great and the service satisfied our needs for the price we paid.","travelDate":"2012-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Can\u00b4t be beat! \nThis was a trip that we took to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary, and when I booked the room I made a comment about this. When we checked in to the hotel there was a bottle of sparkling wine for us in the room. Very nice! But 4 nights later it wasn\u00b4t as nice anymore...\n\nPro\u00b4s:\nLocation; Close to subway, starbucks around the corner, side street to broadway and many good restaurants nearby (ilili, Le pain quotidian and others)\n\nFree Wi-Fi (not as slow as expected) \n\nRoom decoration and armenities (free coffee and water, minibar selection)\n\nElectronic housekeeping and Do not disturb buttons\n\nAutomatic drapes\n\nNot as loud as expected (Subway and street noise minimal, since we were on the 9th floor)\n\nPossible to borrow adaptor (for EU plugs) and umbrellas free of charge\n\nAnd last but not least, the best thing was an employee named Alex - Always in a good mood and always smiling - Asking how our days was. Hotel (GET MORE staff as service minded as he is!)\n\nCon\u00b4s:\n\nThe hotel has a deal with a parking garage down the street (first 24 hours is paid by the hotel). Upon arrival we was not informed that there was two parking garages across from each other, and we parked at the wrong one (Icon) instead of Central Parking and had to pay 47$ out of our own pocket. Before picking up the car we informed the front desk staff about the situation and they told us, that they would talk to the manager, about reimbursing us. This was Wednesday. Thursday morning we asked the staff on the new shift if there were any news on the situation, they hadn\u00b4t heard or talked to anybody about it. We explained it to them and asked if they would talk to the manager. Friday Morning we went down, still no answer. The prior shift hadn\u00b4t told them about the situation. Obviously none of the staff knows how to pass on information when changing shifts. This is pretty annoying to have to deal with, when on vacation. We finally talked to the manager ourselves, and he told us he could\u00b4t do anything before he talked to the accounting department. We are now awaiting an e-mail. Seriously a manager that can\u00b4t make a decision like this, and take it off the final bill?. We feel that It was the hotels mistake not to guide os properly, and it became our headache.\n\nHousekeeping a whole other story!:\n\nHousekeeping was really late in our opinion between 2pm to 4pm (But maybe thats just us)\n\nNot enough towels; the housekeeping took all of the dirty towels but somedays only replaced the big towels and not the ones for your face, hands etc. Also there is only one little hook to hang the towels on so if you want to shower both in the evening and in the morning, the towel will be wet in the morning.\n\nWhen housekeeping had been in our room, they left empty shampoo bottles in the shower, and didn\u00b4t even replace them with new ones - We had to call the front desk for new ones.\n\nThey didn\u00b4t change the hand soap even though it had hair on it (I work at a hostel and we even do that there)\n\nHair was found in the shower, ours probably, but just a sign that they were not thorough.\n\nThey didn\u00b4t change the trashcans one day, and didn\u00b4t vacuum at all, even though there was visible need for it.\n\nHousekeeping didn\u00b4t change our sheets AT ALL during a 4 night stay. When we were at the front desk friday morning, we asked if it was normal at this hotel not to change sheets. Their answer was: \"we will check to see if thats the case\". What????? Don\u00b4t change sheets, this is the 3rd night and the front desk don't know? Friday when we got back and the housekeeping had been there, they had only changed part of the bed linen. - not the pillow cases which was full of hair and make up and the upper sheet. \n\nWe had had enough at this point and went down to the front desk, when I told them about it they checked their system and told me that housekeeping had been there. This really ticked me off, so I asked them to go with me to the room so I could show it too them myself, they wouldn't . At that point I asked for the manager, it took about 5 minutes and then he came and took me aside. His first question was if we came to the city often, my answer was that we didn\u00b4t have any set plans for it in the future yet, THEN A LONG PAUSE where the manager didn\u00b4t say anything.... Then half a sentence, and then he said: I can give you the last night for free because thats the only night that hasn\u00b4t gone through the system yet.\n\nI told him that was fine, and then he sent somebody up to the room with some sparkling wine and pillowcases we could change our selves???\n\nLooking back I find it kind of insulting the way it happened, but I\u00b4m questioning the managers ability or freedom to take decisions on his own.\n\nNext morning we checked out with a weird feeling about the staff!!!\n\nWe had really hoped for us, to find a place, we could return to in the future. We have been in N.Y 5 times in the last 3 years, and love to go there, so we will definitely return to the city, but unless The Flatiron hotel get their act together, we won\u00b4t return to this hotel - Even though it\u00b4s at a good price!\n\nFor a 4 star hotel this is not good enough!!!","travelDate":"2012-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The previous comments made me nervous, so we requested a room on the upper floor, which they accommodated (7th floor). yes, you can hear the vibrations of the train below, but you couldn't hear street noise.  and the train vibration wasn't a big deal.  Very light sleepers probably have a problem with everything in NYC. \nPros: for NYC the room is good sized.  people not familiar with NYC might be shocked by room sizes here, but it is new york.  I saw the queen size rooms, and they are much smaller than the king.  The bed was comfy, room was clean (we were nervous about bed bugs - no issue at all), the tech features were cool.  Ipod radio was nice, the black out shades worked really well.  bathroom was large\/clean.  i wish our room had the cool showers i saw in the queen room (I peeked into a few other rooms during the mid day while housekeeping was cleaning).  but the bathroom with the tub was much bigger.  The hairdryer was a real hairdryer, not the typical hotel crappy thing (wish i knew ahead of time, i could have packed less).  the tv in the bathroom mirror was a novelty, but not really my thing.  the location is AMAZING!!  this is exactly where i want to be in NYC.  The cost was great, but i assume it will go up in price as it gets more well known.   we met the owner one night - he's really energetic and seems to care a lot about this project.  It's not like a big corporation is running this show - it's small and getting attention from the owner.  Thats nice to see.  Room safe is so well hidden, we had to call the front desk to find out where it was... but it's there.\nMeh?: the lobby is interesting.... clean but a bit over the top for me.  Is this a con? probably not, but not anything special for me.  The decor overall is not exactly my taste, but at least more playful than most hotels. there weren't any places to really hang out in the lobby other than just some couches.  it wasn't the type of place i would like to just hang out.  Not bad for sitting and waiting for someone, but not a \"place\" yet.  Other hotels do this much better.  \nCons: wish there was a mini fridge in the room.  it has  cooler selling water\/soda, but no space for our food.  The bar just opened while we were there.  The liquor selection is not great.  the bar tender gets an A for effort, but not execution.  I'm going to assume they just need some more time and experience.  and some nibbles.  Another Con - the hotel doesn't yet have any thing other than just rooms.  No cafe, no food, etc.  However, starbucks is right next door and the neighborhood has so much.  All in all, for the cost savings, i would prefer to spend the extra money on doing something outside of my hotel than just paying for hotel accoutrements.  \noverall, i highly recommend this hotel.  we were very happy with it. our \"cons\" are minor, while the pros were great.","travelDate":"2012-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The cylindrical aquariam is really something to see!  \n\nThe rooms were quite nice, size was typical of other NYC hotels.

It was hard to get a stable temperature in the room.  Also, the tile floor in the bathroom was freezing cold on barefeet.  It would have been nice to have heated tile floors or even provide guests with complimentary slippers.  Also, there were no towel racks at all in the bathroom! After showering we would just throw the towels on the floor or leave them on the counter. Sometimes I would hang them on top of the door.  i think this is something they perhaps missed???  It also would have been nice to have real glasses to use in the hotel room, rather than the flimsy plastic cups sealed in celophane that they give you.  That just makes the room look cheap.  They also need to upgrade the quality of coffee in the room.  While it was nice to have the coffeemaker and complimentary coffee, the quality was very poor.

Stayed for three nights.  Room was very small and cramped partially mitigated with high ceilings.  Great mattress and comfy bed but no extra blankets and a very noisy HVAC system.  No table, no lamp and no lighting controls on one side of the bed.  Where are you supposed to put your glasses or turn on a light in the middle of the night?  First day of housekeeping they brought no washcloths and all hand towels and did not replace the drinking glasses.  Second day of housekeeping, there was none - housekeeping was a no-show as of 4:30pm when we returned to our room after being gone from 8:30am.  When I complained about both housekeeping issues (I had left a note about the washcloths and glasses but no housekeeper showed up to read it) someone finally brought washcloths to the room an hour later.  Never did get any drinking glasses.  Seems like a minor detail until you try to take a pill.  Sign says they are in their soft opening but staff said they opened last August.  That is plenty of time to get the kinks worked out...  Staff was pleasant, location was OK thought the street where the hotel entrance is located is off the beaten path and a bit sketchy at night.  Some common areas were still under construction and the lack of any kind of dining was a bit inconvenient, especially for breakfast.  I would give them another try if the price was right...","travelDate":"2012-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The location is perfect, we were able to walk everyone, Times Square, Tribeca, SoHo, Central Park...

The shower was awesome; with jets, rainwater showerhead etc.  The monogrammed towels were good quality, the hair blow dryer was a proper one, not the usual hotel nightmare.\n\nOur room was large, 2 double beds with lots room to walk around.\n\nThe electronic curtaisn were cool, same with the tv in the bathroom. And our room had an ipod docking station, which is always a nice touch.\n\nI was worried about noise because of the complainers on here, we didn't have any issues.  I think I heard a horn honking a couple of times... but that's to be expected in any city.  I didn't hear the supposed train noises at all.  (We were on the 3rd floor).\n\nThe lobby is really cool, hip furniture and a cool fishtank.\n\nIf you are the pickiest person ever, you might not like that the toilet roars when it flushes (it's powerful)...

My stay there went ultra smooth, it was a great location and I felt safe.\n\nMy stay was from Friday - Sunday. The Flatiron is shiny and new but there are a few improvements needed:\n\nCons:\n1. Sensitive to noise, I specifically requested in my reservation booked weeks ahead, NOT to have a room by the elevator, and they did the complete opposite.  My room literally faced the elevator.  Takes literally just one leap from the inside of the elevator into my room.  I called down to the front immediately realizing this and they said they'll check and call me back if anything.  So they called back literally 1 whole minute later and said there wasn't anything available.  Seriously, they could have waited 5 minutes to pretend they tried.  This showed me they are not accommodating and do not care to show they want to make an effort! I was ready to look for a new hotel at this point. \n2. Since there was nothing they can do about my room situation, and i was in a time crunch, I just sucked it up and stayed.  I got there on Friday afternoon and I needed to work a bit before the weekend.  For a few hours I was working in my room and all of a sudden someone opens the door into my room!  The voices of two adult men were behind my door about to walk in!  I quickly said \"HELLO!\"  They stopped opening the door halfway and did not see me but heard my voice.  I panicked!! I thought I was getting robbed or worst going to be assaulted!!! So I quickly grabbed my laptop ready to whack the people coming in.  Then they said \"um, are you decent? we're here to check something!\"  Are you kidding me?  I could have been in a very vulnerable situation!  Oh, and the room I was in did not have one of those long hook locks that keeps people out even if they have a key.  So this is a very unsafe situation for a single female traveling alone.  I put down my laptop and walked to the door to see what they wanted.  And they said they just wanted to check to see if something in the bathroom was fixed.  So one guy peeked into the bathroom and said it was.  I was just still in shock and disbelief in what was happening.  So the shorter guy saw this and asked \"what's wrong.\"  I'm like \"um. well, most people knock before they just walk into someone's room\"  And they explained that they thought no one was checked in yet and the other guy said a matter of factually \"you just checked in like 5 mins ago right? so ...\" I'm like I've been here, working!  Jerk!  God the rudeness of this hotel at this point was almost too much to take.  If I didn't have to finish a report and meet someone soon I would have packed my stuff and moved to another hotel. \n3.  The noise level is outrageous!  I can sleep through fog horns and earthquakes but this room was beyond those things.  I heard the TV of the room next door all night long and loud too, the walls are thin.  The trains are also passing by every so often.  Because my room was so low in the building, I can hear every honk, siren, and crazies shouting!  Oh and people in and out of the elevators didn't help either!  Those noises went on all night long. \n4. One ice machine for the whole hotel, in Mezzanine level  and no vending machines for softdrinks or water.  (they are working on setting up minibars in the hotel rooms)  They did suggest we go across the street to the liquor store to get water\/softdrinks, which we did and it was convenient enough. \n\nPros:\nEverything is new.\nThe curtains are electronically controlled, you open and close them with a remote!!! Really fun.\nThe curtains keep the light out very well.  So even if it's super bright out, the room can be dark.\nThe phone in room is cordless.\nThe TV was crisp (but it is digital so a lot of channels didn't have signal, since I don't watch much tv, I don't consider this too bad an issue)\nThe desk was good for working (though there were no power outlets where the desk is so my cords were connected to the walls on the other side, not too big a deal for me)\nTwo new bathrobes. \nThe shower was awesome, it had a total of 8 spouts and 7 running at a time so you're getting sprayed from head to knees with multiple spouts, LOVE this feature.\nThere's a TV in the bathroom mirror (which can be a good or bad thing, I didn't like it because it got in my way of seeing myself since I'm short.  And it's not facing the toilet, so you can't watch it from there.  You can see it from the shower but can't hear it since shower is so loud) I think they tried with this but it ultimately does not make much since. \nLighting in the rooms are well situated and can be adjusted for bright to dim to romantic.\nElectronic control for Privacy  and Maid Service.\nThe lobby is very nice, with cool furnishing and a large cylinder aquarium. \nThe doorman\/luggage guys are very nice and quick to come to help me.  Girl who checked me in was also nice.\nThe location, right by beautiful Madison Square Park (depending on the type of person you are, it can be a shady spot at night, but I liked it because it was walking distance from all the places I ate at in LES and East Village.  Don't expect upper east side or midtown when staying here.  There are characters and you should be alert as you walk through the neighborhood)\nTwo short blocks from the Subway station.\nVery easy to catch a cab.\nThey have car service if you need it ( i didn't use it but looks convenient)\n\nAll in all, my stay (after my first few hours of weirdness) went smooth.  I would stay here again, but I would definitely call ahead to make sure they won't put my room in front of the elevators and hopefully by then, they would have installed long hook locks so strangers can't just bust into your room if you're in the shower or doing something more private!","travelDate":"2012-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Upon arrival, they said they only had side by side rooms on the lower floors.  When I pointed out that I had requested rooms on the higher floors, they gave us rooms on floor 9 and 10.  The 10th floor appears to be the highest.  They then upgraded us to corner rooms - very nice.\n\nThe rooms were very nice, spacious, and had lots of bells and whistles.  The jacuzzi tub was wonderful to use.  The electronic operated curtains were also a nice touch.  Check in was effortless and they were very accommodating when we asked to store our luggage for the afternoon after we checked out.\n\nI wouldn't worry about the subway noise.  The subway does run underneath the hotel and you can hear it.  However, you can drown out the intermittent subway noise with white noise generated by the heating\/ac unit.  Set the fan for continuous operation.  It is fairly loud and it effectively drowns out the subway noise.

We booked a corner suite and once we arrived in our room we saw some immediate issues.  The curtains did not close (they are controlled remotely), there was a loud subway noise every 10-15 minutes, and the room did not have a floor length mirror.  The front desk was accommodating and moved us to a lower floor, which did have working curtains, but still there was loud subway noise and no mirror (we were told they were on order and were to arrive that week).  We didn't spend much time in the room as we arrived back late and checked out early the next morning so we didn't think much of it..until we received our credit card statement the following month.  In addition to the room charge there was an additional charge of $200.00 from the hotel.  When I called the hotel to inquire about the charge, the person in reservations told me it was because both bed spreads were missing.  I was completely shocked!  I proceeded to tell the man on the phone that was an absurd allegation and that we absolutely did not steal anything.  The man said someone would call me back and that he could not address this personally.  After I did not receive a callback, I proceeded to call again and was able to speak to the person that was supposed to return my call.  I again told him that they were wrong and that we absolutely did not steal the bed spreads and demanded a refund of the $200.00 or we would dispute the charge with the credit card company.  He told me he would refund the money and apologized.  I asked him why we did not receive a call to ask about this before charging our card and he said it was an oversight and again apologized.  I would suggest anyone staying at this hotel be sure and check their credit card statements since this hotel happens to quietly add on charges without guests' knowledge.  Who knows if the bed spreads were even really  stolen.  This hotel obviously employs thieves either way.  Whether they are stealing items from the room and blaming it on guests....or just stealing money off of guests credit cards.","travelDate":"2011-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It is a newly renovated hotel, and this was a soft grand opening, thus the room rate was less than $300 per night for the 1 week night and one Friday night I was there.  Lovely, clean lined foyer with a cylindrical two story tropical fish tank, and a glass circular stairway to the mezzanine.  No restaurant in the hotel at this time.  Location on Broadway was OK...just two blocks from the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Ave.  Closest subway station was at least a three block walk. Staff was friendly and helpful. My room was one of the larger rooms on the 10th floor. The rooms were recently remodeled and I found them clean and neat.   I do have two complaints on this hotel however.  They did not put in new windows when they remodeled, so there is street noise that infiltrates the room at night. (however, west 26th is quiet at night) Then there the rumble of the subway running under the street at this location.  The beautiful heavy, blackout drapes are automatic, you tug on them, and they open and close by themselves.  This was fine, until they decided to open and close on their own at 7:30, 8, and again at 8:30 AM.  My room was facing somewhat east, so the light was rather intense.  I let the staff know that I had a unseen visitor playing with my curtains, and they said they would look into it immediately.   When I returned, the issue seemed to be solved, curtains were closed, and didn't open until I tugged them when i got up the next morning. King size bed was Extremely comfy and made it difficult to get up in the AM.  Connectivity via their wireless network was weak.  I neglected to inquire about a hard cable connection in the room.

There were certainly some impressive touches. Like the flat TV screen magically embedded into the bathroom mirror. Overall, though, I would have preferred it if the hotel had splurged less on electronics and other special effects, and more on practicalities that travellers actually need. For example, I would have traded the TV in the bathroom for a fridge, especially since there is no restaurant in the hotel. Worst of all, the hotel has a 4pm check-in time, probably because it doesn't have enough cleaners to turn around the rooms fast enough. I arrived at around 3pm and had to step out anyway to meet a friend, so it did not inconvenience me much. But if you are arriving in the city in the morning, this hotel would be the wrong choice. You don't want to pay these sorts of rates for the privilege of having the hotel store your luggage while you wait hours for your room.","travelDate":"2011-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1563892,"title":"Fantastic Stay !!!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2011-10-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I was in New York with my 2 daughters on Oct. 1 and 2nd and stayed at the Flatiron Hotel.  We were absolutely impressed with every aspect of this hotel.  Very clean and well appointed rooms.  Great size room (for New York).  The beds were amazing, the best sleep I have had in a long time. Great location.  I have a background in travel and have stayed in many hotels all over the world, the Flatiron by far exceeded our expectations in service, cleanliness, and decor.  As indicated in other reviews the hotel is still in its soft opening stage and may be lacking in some of the service areas however, this did not affect us in any way because if you required anything, the staff was \"on it'  .\n\nThe Hotel Manager - Steven Meyer - definately made our stay unforgetable!  From the moment we arrived, Steven greeted us, spent time with us to provide us with information on sites, shopping, getting around, and even made dinner reservations for us.  \n\nThe hotel was very busy upon our arrival, check in was at 4 pm.  I needed to have the room available for 3 pm.  Steven took care of us immediately and ensured that we were comfortable, satisfied and had everything we needed.\n\nI can't say enough about our experience in New York.  Having worked in the service industry for many years I can only say that good service is what keeps people coming back.  I have to go back to New York in a few months and will definately be back at the Flatiron.  Since my return 2 days ago, I have already recommended the Flatiron to a number of people travelling to New York in the next little while.\n\nI recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates good, beyond expectations service, a good night's sleep and a friendly environment.\n\nHope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.\n\nThank you Steven for taking such good care of me and my girls  -- coco and daughters :)","travelDate":"2011-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There are no amenities available at this time. My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary. Since we were in New York, we did not plan to spend much time in the hotel anyway, but it would've been nice to have a lounge. The hotel was clean and very up to date. The bathroom had a TV built in the mirror and the lighting and curtains were all controlled by a remote. The room was small, but very nice. The location was OK. It was one block away from Broadway but was 16 blocks from Times Square. Penn Station was 8 blocks so the Subway was within a good distance. Unfortunately I only have one photo because my wife's phone was lost on the trip.","travelDate":"2011-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is nicely designed and quality of furnishings is good.  The rooms are not huge, but comfortable.  Also, the neighborhood is interesting, not \"touristy\".\n\nStaff should just be direct and honest about the missing amenities:  we were told by two different staff members that the gym wasn't finished, but they had an \"arrangement with a local gym\".  The arrangement was that anyone that was a resident of NYC got a free three-day trial.  Not sure why a NYC resident would be staying at the hotel!  The room rate was such that that the $30 fee for two-days at the gym was not a big deal.","travelDate":"2011-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

For example, I arrived late at night, tired and thirsty, only to discover there was no room service, no restaurant or bar, no minibar in the room, and no vending machines. I assume this will not be the case forever, but if this matters to you, check before you book! The room itself was quite spacious, with glorious high ceilings and warm Venetian plaster walls. Wonderfully comfortable queen bed. Coffee maker on the compact desk but no electrical outlets on it, or nearby, for recharging phone, iPad and laptop. Push-button controlled draperies but no full-length mirror. There was enough space for an armchair, but there was no armchair. (These last two are the kind of things I expect they are still working on. I hope.) The bathroom was small but had good counter space and lighting. And a TV screen in the mirror. The shower was very small but had an amazing array of shower heads--an overhead rainfall head, a hand spray, and six body jets. Took a bit of experimenting to figure out the controls on the shower, however. Staff were friendly and helpful, although I think they are still figuring things out. Location is terrific, close to subways, Flatiron district, Chelsea galleries and restaurants, Greeley Park, etc. Penn Station is walkable if you don't have a ton of luggage and the weather is good. I would stay here again, especially after they are fully up and running.","travelDate":"2011-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

We had the Toshi suite which is the corner room.  I believe this is the largest room on each floor.  The hote is small. There are only about 8 or 9 rooms on each floor.  From the floorplan map near the elevator, it appears the corner room is the largest.  The room overall was small.  The room had lots of windows which gave a good view.  From this room, you can get a side view of the Empire State buiding.  We stayed on the 9th floor.  The odd thing is, on the 9th floor, we can hear and feel the subway beneath.  I found this very strange.  You can basically tell when a subway was going thru.  \nThe hotel is new but somehow the rooms don't look or feel new.  The bathroom was small.  In general, everything felt claustraphobic.  The AC in our room was not working well.  It hums loudly all day but the temp in the room remained the same.  The engr came to look at it on the 2nd night but couldn't get it fixed.  We didn't sleep well during the entire stay.  The kids did enjoy the awesome fish tank in the lobby.  \n\nWe would not return to this hotel.  I found the hotel on Travelzoo and thought to give a try. Not a good choice.","travelDate":"2011-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I took my 22 year old daughter and her two best friends and we planned to stay 4 days. After delays, cancellations, and a stay in another city, Delta finally got us to NY.  We arrived tired and discouraged. The staff at this hotel was absolutely wonderful. They made sure we had the best room in the hotel, and helped us map out our activities to guarantee us covering as much as possible in our shortened stay. Our every request was met and our stay was so comfortable. The beds are heavenly, the rooms were spotless, and everything was decorated so beautifully! One evening we were in the lobby, getting ready to get a cab and head to Times Square for the evening. The Owner, Mr. Toshi was in the lobby, introduced himself to us, offered us champagne, and had a staff member get us a taxi. We had champagne and took pictures with him, it was the start to a fun filled evening. We will stay at this hotel again!","travelDate":"2011-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}
