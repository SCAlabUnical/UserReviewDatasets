We arrived in the evening to collect our keys and get to the room.  We stayed for 3 nights. The room was small but comfortable.

Read my other review about another hotel in New York. It was horrific. One of the reasons why we switched to this hotel on the same trip was because of the unpleasant experiences at the other hotel (We traveled as a group in January). This review is overdue. We want to show our appreciation especially to Scott. We checked in smoothly with Scott at the desk and he was friendly, competent, professional, and welcoming. He was diametrically opposite to the staff we encountered at the other hotel before checking in to this hotel. Scott\u2019s professionalism was pronounced. I was grateful for Scott as I traveled with a group of people from Hong Kong. I did not want them to feel that New York is a horrible place to visit because of the horrific experiences from the previous hotel. Scott saved the day! The hotel location is awesome if you like to be close to everything and Grand Central station is within a few blocks. I would not recommend staying at the Grand Central\u2019s hotel for the reasons I stated in my other review at that hotel. Also, if you are reading this review because you want to stay close to the station, Hampton Inn is within a few blocks from Grand Central. It is an easy walk as well. The room itself is clean and spacious by New York standards. Everything worked in the room. The complimentary breakfast was adequate, and it is a plus especially if you travel with your family. We had a total of five rooms and all of us agreed our overall experiences at Hampton Inn were far more pleasant. Next time I come to New York, I would not hesitate to stay here again.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

But starting at 1 am and lasting throughout the night until morning, our room absolutely REAKED of marijuana.  It was so bad that now days later we and our child are still dealing with the after-affects.  We complained to front desk the next morning and they allowed us to cancel our second night without penalty, which i gladly accepted because god forbid we lose our points for a late cancellation.

My wife visited for a few days and found the hair dryer was also broken.\nThirdly, the hotel was a nightmare when full. The lobby got blocked by queues of people checking in and it became hard to get in and out of the building. Many guests got upset during this period and complaints at the front desk were regular. The lift at these times took up to 10 mins to come to my floor which was quite frustrating. The food ran out at breakfast which shouldn't happen but did on two occasions during my stay. After about 20 mins it was replenished, but on one monirng i did not have the extra time to wait.\n\nFourthly, the rooms are also very small. Basically just enough room for the bed and that is it. The hotel is old and in need of some updating. The air con units were old, noisy and didnt work well. Not all the light bulbs in my room and the corridors were working.\n\nFinally, the staff lied and added false charges to my credit card, so beware. I was given a 125US smoking in my room charge. Yet I never smoked in my room. The manager claimed to have evidence yet the evidence was not the smell of smoke in my room or a smoke alarm going off but that the cleaner took a picture of loose cannabis flowers from in a draw in my room (cannabis was decriminalised in NY for anyone wondering). When I disputed the charge the manager had problems understanding English and stuck to the argument that seeing loose cannabis and the end of a joint in the room is the equivalent of smoking. But smoking in the room would need smoke and\/or lighting something. Yet i never did that. So i have been charged for cannabis possession in my own room. This \"having cannabis\" in your room penalty is not stated in the fine print and to say possesing cannabis is the same as smoking is a false equivalence. These are tricks and hustles of the trade I guess. But it's not a nice feeling when people lie and steal your money under false pretence and accusation. The manager also never mentioned this charge to me so that we could discuss it, or came to the room to mention any smell of smoke to me, which suggests this is a common hustle they are operating and hoping guests do not challenge it. If they had a probelm why not come to my room at the time to mention it and then you would have evidence of smoke. This never happened. An end in your room is not smoking in your room.\n\nAn extra charge of 282USD was then charged to my account 3 days after i left the hotel and the hotel has not told me what this second extra charge was for. \n\nThey also have not returned my 175US deposit for incidentals yet. Although that should be returned one hopes. Nonetheless i had to cancell my credit card due to these rogue transaction.\n\nSo overall not only is the hotel poorly maintained and cleaned but they are looking to scalp extra charges onto your credit card which have to then be challenged. Double check your records if you do stay here.\n\ni regret staying here. The price is relatively high because of the location but the standards are pretty low. I should not have tried to go more budget by staying at the Hampton Inn, but I was trying to save a few bucks. Sometimes however you find out that in trying to save yourself a few bucks you actually end up having a much worse overall experience. Lesson learnt.\n\nIf it can be avoided I would suggest not choosing this hotel during your trip.\nI am hoping this issue will be taken to a higher level as i have also written a complaint to head office.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is about 1 1\/2 blocks from the Grand Central Terminal station. In fact, I discovered a \"secret\" entrance the subway via a corridor that goes near the Hyatt Centric hotel and exits almost directly onto 43rd street. Grand Central Terminal has access to almost all the subway lines in NYC and Metro North and LIRR.\n\nOn the hotel, as a a Hilton Diamond member, I selected my room ahead of item via the Hilton Honors app and made a special request to Ms. Briana Smith ahead of time which was graciously accommodated. Although the hotel was full so I could not check in early, my luggage was stored for the day. Lobby and dining room are small but it never felt crowded as I went to breakfast late. Hotel has NYC size business center and fitness center in the basement but it has everything you need. The complimentary breakfast had eggs, sausage, 3 types of cereal, make your own waffles with 2 flavor, bagels, bread, fruit, hash browns, yogurt, and 3 types of juice and coffee and tea. A pretty good size breakfast with 3 hot items.\n\nI had a king size bedroom on the 21st floor with a view towards other apartment buildings. Bathroom was shower only and bed took most of the room but this is New York City so I was not expecting much. There was a small closet, ironing board, in room safe, desk, and LED TV.\n\nOverall, I would stay at this hotel again due to the convenient location, excellent breakfast, and excellent service from the hotel manager, Ms Briana Smith, and the front desk agents, Tatiana.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

La camera non era grandissima era comunque confortevole, con due letti matrimoniali alla francese, la scrivania con sedia, un piccolo armadio con dentro anche asse da stiro e ferro, e nella scrivania c'era il bollitore per th\u00e8 e caff\u00e8 (apprezzo sempre quando lo trovo in camera!). Il bagno era piccolo ma essenziale e molto pulito e rifornito di tutti i prodotti da bagno, apprezzo molto anche questo. Alla reception ho trovato dei ragazzi gentili, nonostante il mio scarso inglese, cercavano di aiutarmi a capire quando chiedevo indicazioni sulle attrazioni da visitare o le fermate della metropolitana da prendere. Sono stati tutti molto gentili e rispettosi. La colazione era abbondante e varia, ovviamente tutta americana con uova, bacon, waffle, salsiccie, e tanto altro per il salato, e per il dolce c'erano i MUFFIN (che adoro e mangiavo tutte le mattine ed erano sempre diversi, alla frutta o alla cannella o al cioccolato!) varie marmellate, burro e miele e due\/tre tipi di pane per farcirli con queste prelibatezze. C'erano anche yogurt, ovviamente i fiocchi d'avena, le macchinette per caff\u00e8 caldo e acqua calda per il the', e in sala colazioni erano disponibili anche due contenitori di latte, uno normale e uno alla mandorla. Insomma, una favola americana meravigliosa! Ho adorato i due tavolini con ombrelloni fuori nel cortiletto  dell'hotel, dove tutte le sere cenavamo con il nostro cibo d'asporto (New York non \u00e8 Bologna, \u00e8 tutto molto caro! Quindi, consiglio di comprare qualcosa nei fast food, e portarselo in hotel o farselo portare ...ho scoperto l'applicazione UBER EATS dove puoi ordinare il cibo che vuoi e te lo consegnano all'entrata dell'hotel! Paghi la consegna ovviamente, ma \u00e8 fantastico e comunque meno caro che mangiare nei ristoranti di midtwon!). La zona dove \u00e8 ubicato l'hotel \u00e8 perfetta, quasi di fronte al CHRYSLER, e vederlo al tramonto \u00e8 una sensazione di pura meraviglia che ti fa battere il cuore. L'hotel \u00e8 vicino alla GRAND CENTRAL STATION, dove c'\u00e8 un delizioso mercato e localini per mangiare a pranzo, che \u00e8 la stazione centrale e grandissima dei treni, e ovviamente si trova anche la metropolitana. Io mi sono innamorata di NEW YORK, e ho ancora tante cose belle da vedere e tanti sorrisi ancora da dare e da ricevere, ho intenzione di tornare, mi sono data tempo massimo due anni, per i miei 50 anni, vorrei rivivere LA FAVOLA AMERICANA, e per una scrittrice e creativa come me, a NEW YORK, TUTTO E' ANCORA POSSIBILE!

I booked my stay on a no-cancellation fee condition and the circumstances meant I had to cancel just a few hours before the time window for free cancellation expired. \n\nHowever, an issue that arose with Expedia\u2019s website (which they acknowledged) meant that my request for cancellation was not processed by the company correctly and I had to try again the next day - at which point I was charged a cancellation fee because it was no longer within the time window. This is despite me initially requesting the cancellation within the time window. \n\nI contacted Expedia, who contacted the hotel and all agreed that the cost of cancellation would be waived on this occasion. However, to my disappointment, the cost of a night\u2019s stay was still withdrawn from my account as a cancellation fee. I have tried contacting Expedia, who insist they can\u2019t handle the refund as this is Hampton\u2019s responsibility, but I contacted Hampton and they insisted that the refund is actually Expedia\u2019s responsibility. I am at a loss for words and I am quickly losing my patience. Maybe next time I will take my business to another hotel chain.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

There is no vent in the bathroom and therefore the room becomes very humid and damp all the time, which can be uncomfortable when you're trying to sleep. The remote was greasy and there was some type of sticky white tape residue on the bottom. The room phone also had some funky crust on the dial pad and it did not work when we tried to call down to the front desk- just got the busy beep, so we had to call the front desk from our cell phone. The room had a coffee maker and coffee packets but no paper cups. This is the first hotel I've stayed in where the comforter and top blanket are combined- mine was stained on the bottom and I noticed one of the pillows had some yellow  stains on the side as well. I stayed here on a business trip with my elderly parents. One of them has a medical condition where they get up tp use the bathroom about 6 times a night. The problem with the room  (other than everything already mentioned) is that the bathroom has a very heavy sliding door, instead of the regular door that opens and closes. One of my parents is very old and could barely open the door and close it that many times and I also had trouble opening it and I'm pretty strong. This made it very stressful for them at night. What is the alternative, to use the bathroom with the door open? - impossible when the bathroom toilet directly faces the beds. The sliding door also doesn't close all the way so there's about an inch and that doesn't leave a lot of privacy, either, which is also very uncomfortable.  I've stayed in hotel rooms in various parts of NYC and this is one of the smallest. We had a 2 night stay. After the first night I tried calling Hampton Inn corporate and expressing the medical concerns of my party and asked their corporate manager to move me to another hotel within their branch and that I'd be happy to pay the difference. The \"manager\" which was obviously someone from overseas, said that I have to just book another room myself and see that if this hotel will refund me later on.  I chose this very cheap hotel only because it is within a block of a private event at the U.N that we were in attendance of on  both days of our NYC stay and so it was literally the only reason why we stayed. Hampton Inn (Hilton) did not care about my families medical needs in regards the room and offered no help whatsoever. The web doesn't make it clear that this hotel had sliding doors for their bathrooms, so I really wasn't aware of this ahead of time. The woman at the front desk is also very abrupt and unhelpful. I do not recommend staying at this hotel at all. It's one thing to deal with a dirty hotel room, but it's another when they will not even try to accommodate you when there are medical issues involved.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Stayed 3 nights (Fri - Mon)  My overall rating was - it's so-so.  I'll be honest, I was looking for other places to stay up until the last minute, as I was just not getting the warm and fuzzies about this place.  I should have listened to my gut - but, the price was what keep me from canceling my reservation.  I have stayed at many Hampton Inns in several states across the US and this one is by far my least favorite.  \n\nI'll start off with the GOOD: \nPrice - the price was great, as I got a Long Weekenders special; as I said above, the price was really the only reason we stayed here.\n\nLocation - great location as it's only 2 blocks from Grand Central Station and you can practically take any train out of there to get wherever you want to go.   \n\nArrived early and was able to check in - this was nice as we could start our visit as soon as we arrived.  \n\nThe BAD:  it's a SMALL hotel.  \nThe room:  We were in room 1106 - 2 double beds.  The room was very small, there was not a lot of space for our luggage (4 suitcases).  We had to keep everything in our suitcases and just \"live\" out of them.  The beds were a little stiff for our preference, the pillows were flat, by the last night, by back was really hurting.  The heater\/AC unit made a sound like a wind tunnel - very annoying when trying to sleep. And I noticed on the last day - the bathroom ceiling had a small leak.   \n\nThe lobby - small.  Got very crowded with all the people. Seems there were a few large groups there during our stay.\n\nThe breakfast area - small.  The area where you get your food is very tiny and got very crowded getting your food.  And because of the crowd food was always out.  Eggs not so good.  Sausage ok.  Best to get a bagel or yogurt.  The wait to make a waffle was really long, they should add a couple more waffle makers to speed up the process.  \n\nThe elevators - small and SLOW.  Had to wait a very long time for the elevators, and once they came they were full, so often times you had to wait on another.\n\nThe hallways on your floor - very hot and very narrow, hard to navigate with a lot of luggage. I think there are only like 8 rooms on each floor.   You had to walk single file and if others were in the hallway at the same time - forget about it.  Also, there are not ice makers on every floor.  Our floor had one, but it was not working, so had to go down to floor 8 - but again took a long time because of the slow elevators.  \n\nSo, final thoughts:  would I stay here again - maybe?  If I was traveling by myself for maybe a night - sure.  Traveling with my husband\/family or for more than one night - NO!  It just wasn't big enough in all aspects for a family and the beds were just not comfortable.  I like the idea of the free breakfast, but honestly, you can grab a bagel or breakfast sandwich pretty cheap, so I don't know if it's worth it.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Nice bedding and great pillows. Extra blanket in a drawer.\n- Great bathroom. Broad counter, shelf for storage, nightlight, Neutrogena products, shave shelf in the shower, toilet has lid (nothing falling in), eco flush, hooks on the wall, plenty of towels and towel bars, decent lighting for makeup, no combo light\/fan (so you can turn on the light without waking up your partner), easy shower controls, sink bowl large enough to soak your head.\n- Good location near Grand Central. Also close to 2nd - easy to get a cab there.\nMy only teeny, tiny complaint was that the creamer for the 24\/7 coffee was flavored. There was no other option. During breakfast there were half and half and skim milk also available. ( I am picky about my coffee. I usually carry no-chill creamers with me, but forgot them on this trip.)\nWe will definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We decided to book away from Times Square as it is generally cheaper, which this place is, but beware - don't be tricked into booking here if you are going because of the breakfast! \n\nPros:\nLocation - very easy to get to Grand Central, lots of places nearby etc.\nOff of 2nd ave so very little street traffic in front of hotel, so definitely quieter.  \n\nStaff - friendly, booked us a town car for our return to the airport which was great. Check in was smooth. \n\nCons:\nThe breakfast - So small, so slow. It is offered from 6-10 and we were downstairs between 7-715 each morning, so getting up earlier does not solve the problems. There are not enough seats for 21 floors of people, the actual breakfast area is so small you can't fit more than 5 people in the area at a time so their is a giant line that snakes around. \n\nElevators - 21 floors and 2 elevators and one always didn't work! Ask for a lower floor that way you can take the stairs. No need to be higher up as their is no view or street traffic. \n\nWe booked this hotel thinking we would save a few dollars being outside times squares AND saving on breakfast. But sadly we were VERY disappointed that the breakfast was too small, too busy, and we had to end up buying breakfast 2 out of 3 morning's because it's not worth waiting 30 minutes for not only a seat, but food. Treat this hotel as no breakfast offering because chances are you won't ever get it. I personally don't want to have to fight through and stress on my vacation for something that is supposed to add value.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We ate early most mornings and thoroughly enjoyed both the cooked and continental style breakfast, setting us up for the day. The staff are the highlight, however, and the reception staff in particular were welcoming and extremely helpful. They made our 2 daughters\u2019 stay more special by organising balloons, cupcakes and handwritten note for both their birthdays (18 and 21st!). These touches made our stay and to top it all off we ordered a 6 seater taxi back to the airport through the hotel. What arrived for us was a white limo!

He was soo excited to spend a night in the city and see all the sights. The staff at Hampton Inn really went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. The Manager Emilda (sp?) checked us in and when she heard my little guy talking about seeing the \"big buildings\" out of his room window, she put us up on a top floor overlooking 43rd street. It's the little things like this that made our stay so wonderful. For her to go out of her way to find him a room she knew would have a nice view for him was really sweet. My little guy just sat in the window for about an hour eating his snacks when we first went up. He couldn't get over the view :) The hotel is within walking distance to everything (around 1 mile to Time Square which was about a 20 minute walk with my 5 year old) and if too tired to walk, only about a $7-$8 ride share home. Fast forward to the next morning, we made it down just in time for the free breakfast! The attendant that cleans up the breakfast area and restocks the food saw my little guy and just came on over to say and offer to make him a hot chocolate. Again, something as a parent that you find soo sweet for someone to do for your little one. He had a big ol' smile while she went to the back to warm him up some milk instead of hot water. Then as we're heading up, the little guy wanted to have some cereal in bed (as a special treat) so we were juggling carrying two bowls of cereal with two little containers of milk. So again the attendant came over and went to the back and got us a tray so we could bring everything up without spilling it. Having worked in the service industry through my teen's and 20's and now spending my last 10+ years in sales, I recognize the effort. And the Hampton Inn crew went above and beyond to ensure every little detail of our quick 1 night stay was as memorable and enjoyable as can be. Kudos to you all, you made one 5 year old feel like one super special little guy last week :)","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Quite a long review because there's many aspect. \n\nLocation & price: \n1) I was there for meeting at UN HQ, and this was one of the most reasonably priced hotel, with breakfast included. & It's just 5 mins walk there, so it's great. \n\n2) And don't fret, it's about 10 mins walk to fifth Avenue where you can shop till you drop. Plenty of eateries in walking distance. I kept going back to the 99cent pizza place nearby, cos it's convenient, cheap and taste decent! \n\nBreakfast & water: \n1) Breakfast was good! Cooked food: Egg (they make one type of egg per day, scrambled, omelette, cheese omelette, and it rotates), protein (sausage, breakfast patty, turkey links) and Carbs (potatoes or French toast). There's cereal and oats, bread, bagel and donut too. Oh and the cool thing is they have a waffle machine for you to DIY (I had it once only cos I felt that the batter was quite tasteless). Drinks wise, there's Milk, yogurt, juices, coffee, tea, hot chocolate! Fruits available too! \n\n2) if you are rushing, they have \"happy bags\", which contain breakfast-to-go! Very thoughtful of them. Monday to Friday, while stock last \n\n3) they have cookies every afternoon - evening, while stock last too! Flavor changes \n \n4) There's no bottled water in the room, but you can ask the reception for water (for free)! If you don't want to waste plastic bottles, you can refill water during breakfast time or head to the gym at Basement, there's a water dispenser there :) \n\nService \n1) Most staff were very nice! Especially this short lady, I didn't get her name.. We reached early at 9am, she went ahead and check us in and even invited us to enjoy the breakfast! She was also smiley whenever I see her. But, of cos there were exception.. One or two of the receptionist wasn't very nice. Can't help but feel it was a racist thing as I saw that she was alot nicer to Caucasians. \n\nOthers \n1) I think the building and furnishing are quite old? But everything was working, and kept clean. So no complains actually, just a remark! \n\n2) Only issue that I had was the lift. There's 2 lifts, and the building is 21 storey. I stayed at the highest level. One day, one was spoilt. Took really long to get up and down. Some days, they lock one lift for independent use (at the morning breakfast hour). Thought they could have done it off breakfast peak though. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend the stay! \n\n","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Good location, friendly staff, clean and confortable. Breakfast was good but didn\u2019t change a lot. The main reason why i\u2019m giving it this rating it\u2019s because of the hotel policy regarding credit card confirmations. I booked this hotel in May through Booking and it was free cancellation until 6th of December. The reservation mentioned that the hotel could verify the credit card just to make sure it was valid. I used a card that was valid until august and i didn\u2019t know that i needed to update in the reservation. Imagine my surprise when i got to the hotel,  after a 9h flight from portugal and i was told that my reservation was cancelled and i didn\u2019t have a room booked. When i asked why they told me that i didn\u2019t updated the info of the card. I said that i wasn\u2019t notificed that i needed to do that and asked when do they check that. The receptionist told me 3 to 5 days before. Immediatly i checked my email and there it was the email asking for a new credit card 3hours before my arrival and informing me that i had 2 hours to update otherwise my reservation would be cancelled. 2 hours after the email with the cancellation confirmation. I was on a flight with no internet connection so i was unable to update the info. After spending some time talking to Booking and the hotel they managed to put us in a smaller room with a king size bed for 3 people instead of the 2 queen size we booked but for the same price. Also because of this we lost the 10% refund from booking regarding a promo code we had. It was a very stressfull situation and a very unpleasant begining of holidays. The hotel should review the timings given to confirm the cards so this doesn\u2019t happen again. ","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Me base en esta calificaci\u00f3n para escogerlo, la de 4.5 estrellas que tiene en TRIP ADVISOR, cuando en realidad es uno de 3 estrellas en el mundo hotelero. El servicio es bueno, eso no lo puedo negar, pero en general el hotel se siente barato y no de la mejor calidad. El desayuno es regular, tiene pocas opciones, (lo que se ve en la foto, cereales, lecha, jugo, waflera, y uno que otro pan). Espera un mejor desayuno, cuando la verdad estaba pagando uno de hotel de 3 estrellas. \nLas habitaciones son peque\u00f1as, muy peque\u00f1as. Viajabamos 4, ten\u00edamos una habitaci\u00f3n con 2 camas dobles. Las camas estaban muy buenas, pero el espacio para caminar, para poner las maletas, y para sentarse era muy reducido (Tanto que no abr\u00eda la puerta del ba\u00f1o.) Los pasillos en los pisos son peque\u00f1os tambi\u00e9n.\nLa ubicaci\u00f3n es buena, queda a 5 minutos de grand central, y a 15 de Times Square. Es muy agradable caminar a Times Square caminando.\nQuiero decir que mi experiencia fue satisfactoria, ya que es servicio fue muy bueno, pero la verdad no era lo que esperaba. Quede satisfecho por que no tuve inconvenientes, a\u00fan as\u00ed, no volver\u00eda. Una calificaci\u00f3n de 4.5 en TripAdvisor pone las expectativas un poco mas altas, y el hotel no las cumpli\u00f3. \nEscribo esto para que personas como yo, que buscan siempre en Trip Advisor antes de comprar Hotel, no se equivoquen con las expectativas, y mas bien vayan esperando un hotel de 3 estrellas. \nEl precio fue bastante alto, descarte opciones mas baratas por la calificaci\u00f3n, pero en realidad creo que muchas habr\u00edan sido mejores que ese Hotel. Me arrepiento bastante de haberlo escogido. \nGracias, y espero que les sirva de ayuda. Si tienen alguna pregunta no duden en escribirme.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Just a short stroll to Grand Central Station. The street is so quiet but you have some great restaurants within walking distance. Cost is great and the rooms are good too. Quiet and clean. Breakfast options are good, however the dining area is tiny so it's almost a fight in the morning to find somewhere to sit. Worse is the rudeness of people who forget their manners and think complimentary breakfast means free breakfast and act like pigs pushing people out the way to get food. It was a disgrace. We chose to get a simple bowl of cereal and cup of coffee and take it to our room. This was no fault of the hotel. The front desk were lovely. A special shout out to the staff on Christmas Eve - I asked if they had cookies my daughter could leave for Santa which they didn't, they said they would make some and I said no it wasn't necessary but they insisted and 20 minutes later delivered them to my room. Very thoughtful. Was nice to be greeted in the mornings or after a long day with a smile or an offer of a bottle of water.

Etage) durch die auf den D\u00e4chern anliegender H\u00e4user angebrachter K\u00fchlaggregate enorm. In der Nacht werden diese gedrosselt und man kann bei offenem Fenster schlafen (eine Einstellung der Temperatur im Winter ist nicht m\u00f6glich, ist jedoch mit 20 Grad okay). Die Dusche mit nur fester Kopfbrause ist gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig. Soweit alles okay. Es sind eher mehrere kleine Dinge, die den Eindruck tr\u00fcben.

Insgesamt haben wir so dann f\u00fcr 7 Tage Aufenthalt \u00fcber 1700,- $ mit Kreditkarte bezahlt. F\u00fcr ein 3 Sterne Hotel mit Papptellern und Plastebesteck sowie m\u00e4\u00dfigem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ( hakt amerikanisch) ist das selbst in New York nicht sehr preiswert.  Trotz mehrfacher Anfrage war das Hotel nicht in der Lage dem Wunsch einer vorherigen Bezahlung mit einem anderen Zahlungsmittel als Kreditkarte in der Lage (wir wollten das Limit der Kreditkarte schonen). Bei normalen Limits muss man also wenigstens zwei Kreditkarten f\u00fcr eine New York Reise haben. Beim Checkin traten dann Probleme mit der Kreditkarte auf, da sie noch nicht initialisiert war. Man konnte uns hier nicht helfen und wurde eher unfreundlich, als wir mit m\u00e4\u00dfigem Englisch versuchten uns ein Telefonat mit der Bank zu erm\u00f6glichen. So musste ein teurer Roaming Anruf get\u00e4tigt werden, zum Gl\u00fcck war der Service unserer Namk Sonntags erreichbar.

En una palabra; LAMENTABLE. Describo mi experiencia, el periplo comienza nada m\u00e1s llegar, despu\u00e9s de todo el d\u00eda metido en un avi\u00f3n llegas al \"hotel\" sobre las nueve de la noche y vas a tu habitaci\u00f3n, peque\u00f1a, pero eso no es un problema en Manhattan, el problema es que en noviembre de 2018 (cuando escribo esta opini\u00f3n) hay temperaturas en New York de menos seis grados cent\u00edgrados y el aparato de aire acondicionado de la habitaci\u00f3n que nos han dado expulsa aire fr\u00edo, llamamos a recepci\u00f3n y nos dicen que cuando volvamos de cenar est\u00e1 arreglado, cosa que no fue as\u00ed y volvemos a llamar, y es entonces cuando comienza el p\u00e9simo servicio de este \"hotel\". Nos mandan al \"Jefe de Seguridad\" que no tiene la menor idea de qu\u00e9 le pasa al aparato, pero lo que le pierde es la mala educaci\u00f3n con la que nos trata, nos cambia de habitaci\u00f3n a una planta superior a rega\u00f1adientes y protestando, donde tampoco funciona el aire, nos mandan a la supervisora del hotel, y estamos probando el aparato casi una hora, el aire caliente no funciona. Nos cambian a una habitaci\u00f3n de la planta veinte, donde parece que va algo mejor, y nos dicen que esa noche no nos la cobran para minimizar el enfado monumental que tenemos porque son las doce de la noche. Por cierto, el inodoro de la habitaci\u00f3n ven\u00eda con \"regalito\" porque al limpiar la habitaci\u00f3n, supongo, no hab\u00edan tirado de la cadena y hab\u00edan hecho \"aguas mayores\", por decirlo finamente. La cosa no termina ah\u00ed, porque durante la noche siguiente, mi mujer y yo nos despertamos a las dos de la madrugada empapados en sudor e intentamos cortar el aire, y por supuesto el control de la pared no funciona y no se apaga, llamamos a recepci\u00f3n y nos mandan a un t\u00e9cnico que s\u00ed sab\u00eda lo que ten\u00eda entre manos y anula el control de la pared, y nos deja el control en el aparato directamente, la noche en vela. La climatizaci\u00f3n consiste en aire caliente y aire fr\u00edo alternativamente, sin t\u00e9rmino medio, cosa que afecta y mucho en el desayuno que merece menci\u00f3n aparte.\n\nEl cap\u00edtulo del desayuno es interesante, el \"comedor\" es min\u00fasculo y con escas\u00edsimas mesas, las cuales est\u00e1n siempre sucias, si las quieres limpiar no busques l\u00edquido desinfectante en el dispensador porque no reponen, bueno no reponen ni el l\u00edquido, ni la leche, ni la fruta, ni los yogures, ni absolutamente nada de nada, te buscas la vida si es que encuentras una mesa libre, y esto en noviembre, como para ir en fechas de gran afluencia tur\u00edstica. A todo esto, en el \"comedor\", que es la prolongaci\u00f3n del hall del \"hotel\", o te asas de calor o te congelas, porque la climatizaci\u00f3n es la misma que la de las habitaciones.\n\nEl cuarto d\u00eda de \"estancia\" nos vamos de la habitaci\u00f3n a las diez de la ma\u00f1ana y cuando volvemos a las nueve y media de la noche, la habitaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 sin hacer, por lo que llamamos por en\u00e9sima vez a recepci\u00f3n, donde no nos dan explicaci\u00f3n alguna, nos ofrecen mandar a \"alguien\" a hacerla en ese momento y la persona que aparece es el mismo t\u00e9cnico que solucion\u00f3 el problema del aire, por lo que no estimamos conveniente que sea \u00e9l quien tenga que dar la cara por otro \"error\" del p\u00e9simo servicio de este \"hotel\", \u00fanicamente se llev\u00f3 la basura e hicimos nosotros la habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nPero es que la cosa no termina aqu\u00ed, porque a falta de tres d\u00edas para dejar el \"hotel\", se rompe uno de los dos ascensores, por supuesto, porque aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 todo roto, y si dos ascensores son insuficientes para todos los hu\u00e9spedes, pues uno...en fin. Estamos en el piso veinte y no hay manera de encontrar hueco en el ascensor porque est\u00e1 hasta arriba de gente, por lo que toca bajar veinte pisos andando para luego buscarse la vida en el desayuno, y m\u00e1s te vale reponer fuerzas porque hay que subir los veinte pisos andando, ya que en el ascensor es imposible entrar, ascensor que tuvo que ser operado manualmente por el \"Jefe de Seguridad\" porque al ser el \u00fanico disponible no llega a los pisos superiores, ya que se dirige al m\u00e1s pr\u00f3ximo si le vuelven a llamar, y es necesario parar piso por piso de forma manual para que todo el mundo pueda subir y bajar; surrealista. En tres d\u00edas no fueron capaces de arreglarlo (adjunto foto que tom\u00e9 al marcharme del \"hotel\").\n\nPara la persona del \"hotel\" que vaya a contestarme pidi\u00e9ndome disculpas por vigesimo novena vez, NO LAS ACEPTO, son ustedes expertos en echar a perder las vacaciones de personas que estamos todo el a\u00f1o trabajando para tener unos d\u00edas de descanso y nos han arruinado parte de nuestro viaje. Si no he pedido una hoja de reclamaciones ha sido porque no vivo en Manhattan y no voy a poder continuar con el procedimiento de reclamaci\u00f3n, y mi \u00fanico consuelo es informar del p\u00e9simo servicio de su \"hotel\", que bien puede llamarse albergue, as\u00ed que si alguien est\u00e1 leyendo esta opini\u00f3n y le sirve de algo, que intente evitar este \"hotel\" por todos los medios si es que desea pasar sus vacaciones en paz. No pido un servicio de cinco estrellas, que evidentemente no las tiene, pero s\u00ed pido un m\u00ednimo de profesionalidad e inter\u00e9s en lo que se hace, como hacemos los dem\u00e1s en nuestros trabajos. Que me hayan descontado una noche no les ha servido para comprar mi opini\u00f3n favorable en Tripadvisor, porque no vuelvo a este \"hotel\" en toda mi vida ni aunque me lo regalen.\n\nEspero no volver a verles nunca m\u00e1s.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Terrific view! It''s small but totally fine. The bed was very comfortable. I would say that the lamp was too far from me to make it easy to shut before I fell asleep. That's not something to make you not stay. Another challenges my first day there. Spent a good part of the day with a friend and walking to see the Xmas tree that was being placed on that day. When I got back, my room wasn't cleaned! It was late afternoon. They said they would send someone immediately but I was exhausted and only needed new towels. I got them.\nThe darling people at the counter suggested whenever I left the room to tell the front desk when I needed that room cleaned. They clean the rooms of those checking out first.... assuming most people in NYC are out and about all day.\nI forgot when I arrived....I was given a \"Special Guest OF The Day sign on my door which gave me some chocolates, two extra water bottles and a lovely letter.\nMy room had some heat challenges. The wall thermostat wasn't working well. This happened on two separate days. I called and within a few minutes, they had an engineer come to fix it.\nI read there was some people who complained about the two elevators and how long they waited. I never experienced that at all.\nTheir breakfast was the typical Hampton\/Hilton with hot and cold choices. The make your own waffles was very popular! If I was to make any complaint, it would be their \"robust\" coffee. It was FAR from robust!\nFor anyone traveling to the NYC area, I would choose this hotel in a heartbeat. It's near enough to all the sights but far enough not to be in the middle of all the NYC drama.\nWhen I come back for the next documentary I'm in \"My SO Called Selfish Like\", I'll stay here!\nBy the way, I was refunded some money for the inconvenience of not having my room cleaned that first day and the heat challenges..","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We were met initially by a female staff member named Soule at the front desk.   She couldn't have been nicer!  My 2 grandsons, ages 3 and 4 were with us.   She left the desk to go into the kitchen and brought out 3 fresh cooked cookies for them.   We went out that evening and coming back one of my grandsons was asleep in a stroller.   The elevators were being used which was understandable and we were on the 2nd floor so I decided to carry the stroller up.  Soule insisted on carrying the stroller with me and we both carried it up.  She was absolutely terrific.  It continued the next morning when I was taking the 4 year old outside for a walk early.   We met Erika who immediately called him over, gave him crayons and post cards with areas to color.  She too was terrific.   I'm from NY and I'm not used to this kind of sincere service.

Friendly, helpful and professional staff. Well appointed room with really comfortable bed with top notch accessories. Great choice of food with only one small irritation in that the restaurant isn't really big enough for the number of guests and there are usually small queues forming at the toaster and waffle maker. Wi-fi is readily available as is a well appointed computer suite with 3 PC's, printer and shredder which proved extremely useful for 'checking-in online' for our return flight. There is also a very nice fitness suite. The hotel has approx. 20 floors but only has 2 lifts which can be very slow at busy times when they are being called at every floor. My family and I would definitely stay here again because the small irritations are far outweighed by there being so many good points. We walked around the local area and felt very safe.

We arrived early into the city around 9am on our train in grand central station. We were happy that the hotel was 3 blocks away as we knew we\u2019d be doing a lot of travel through there. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly staff. I told them we were checking in and they explained no rooms would be ready until later that day but they would gladly hold our luggage. The girl behind the desk was so impressed that my daughters only had one backpack each because she said most women need one bag for shoes, one for clothes and one for makeup. Lol. She also informed us that we were welcome to partake in the complimentary breakfast and use the bathrooms and gym if we wanted. We did grab some coffee and fruit but headed out for a bagel. When we finally got back to the hotel around 4pm to check in, we wee again greeted with smiles and friendliness by a different staff member. She retrieved our bags and directed us to the 14th floor. She also explained about free cookies and water bottles for guests. And then gave me a personalized bottle of water with my name on it. A little bit over the top behavior while doing so, but truly appreciated by me as it was nice to be treated so well. We hopped on the elevator, which had no issues as I read in other reviews and got to our floor pretty quick. Our room was around the corner and we were satisfied how clean the hallways were and especially our room. It\u2019s a nice sized room for the city. Not really small at all. 2 double beds and an ok view of the city, mostly apartments though. The bathroom was extremely clean, only issue was the shower drain was slow to go down. But other than that it was fine. We called immediately for extra towels, sheets and blankets and they came fairly quick. After showers and relaxing for an hour we headed back out to the city. Got back around midnight and good to know you need your room card to enter the hotel after 11pm. Back in our room we slept well on the beds. Thought they were pretty comfortable. Next morning we went down to breakfast which was crowded but a good amount of seating. The staff tries to keep up with demand. Food was good for a free breakfast with waffle maker, eggs, breakfast meats, etc. When we left for the day for the US Open we asked where we could leave our bags and they said we could leave them there for free until midnight. This was great because luggage storage places charge $10 a bag. After a long day at the open we came back, got our bags quickly and headed for our train. It was a good hotel and exactly what we needed for what we\u2019re doing. I highly suggest staying here. ","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We checked in. One of the elevators wasn't working. They said this happens a lot. So we were waiting a bit to get to our room on the 18th floor. We got to our room, Immediately put the Do not disturb sign on the door, we do this at EVERY hotel we go to. and it stays there til we check out. we ask for fresh towels when we need them, we clean the room as we need it to be to our standard, I don't want housekeepers going through our things which we have had done before, we have had electronics and things come up missing before, hence the reason the DND was on the door. We left to eat, and came back, the other elevator stopped worked and the one that was messed up before was very slow and our keys weren't working on the door. we had to go down to the desk to get our keys taken care of.... they gave us warm cookies, water and new keys. The next day, we went to breakfast went back up to our room and yet again our keys were having problems. We had to go back down to the desk and tell her this was a problem. She gave us new keys again and we got ready to leave for the day. We put the Do Not Disturb sign on the Door and went to leave. The front desk agent agent wanted to know if her engineer could go in the room to look at the door. I told her yes, But only he was authorized in the room. I made a point to say that OUT LOUD. we can back to the hotel. Again there was only 1 elevator working again and the other was REALLY SLOW AND THERE WAS A LINE, we get up to our room, and our KEY DOESN'T WORK. we have to go get new keys again. When we get into our room, housekeeping had been in our room. they had moved all of our luggage, put all of our prescription medications back in our medication bags, in the wrong bags (which mind you should have NEVER BEEN TOUCHED) they moved my laptop and camera equipment off of the bed to make the bed putting all of that on top of a really high cabinet. When I call down to the front desk, she argues with me telling me she checked with the housekeeper and the housekeeper told her the DND sign was on the suitcase when she went in the room. The engineer had been in the room before them. She continued to call me a lier and that her staff was right and that what I said didn't matter because what her staff said flew. I had to start taking videos everyday that we left after that of the DND being in the door along with one of my kids phones in it showing dates and times everytime we left the hotel. And everytime we came back to the hotel they had to make us new keys and there were a few times they had to let us in with a master key because even the keys they gave us didn't work. We ended up checking out of the hotel 3 days early after all of the headache. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AND I DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ELSE. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN AN APOLOGY FROM THEM. All I got was arguments that they were right and my entire family and the family (who we didn't even know that was in the room next to us) was wrong","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I've done this at other Hilton properties and kind of like the perk that one gets as a gold card holder with them.  This time my room was changed, I could no longer get a room with a king sized bed (sorry folks, I am quite tall and the only beds long enough are King, otherwise I sleep diagonally or with feet hanging over - like now!).  Ahh, and the digital key has never arrived.  I asked and they offered yet another physical key.\n\nIn sum, terribly frustrating to not be bale to enter my room.

Das Hampton Inn wird jedoch sicher nicht unser Favorit in NYC.\n\nZIMMER\nWir hatten ein King-Zimmer. Das Bett war gut, das Zimmer war sauber. Der Raum war ziemlich klein, gesch\u00e4tzt mit Bad ca. 14-15 qm, auch in Manhattan gibt es oft gr\u00f6ssere Zimmer in der Kategorie. Der Schrank war sehr klein, wir konnten die Koffer kaum ausr\u00e4umen, fanden aber auch f\u00fcr die beiden mittelgro\u00dfen Trolleys kaum Platz im Zimmer, Die Dusche war gut und gross. Die Kaffeemaschine war unten im Regal unter dem Waschbecken im Bad, das ist nat\u00fcrlich nichts. Gut: Man konnte das Fenster \u00f6ffnen, allerdings hatte es keine gute L\u00e4rmd\u00e4mmung, wenn es geschlossen war.\n\nPERSONAL\nSehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.\n\nFR\u00dcHST\u00dcCK\nDas beste was man \u00fcber das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck sagen kann war, es gab eines und es war im Preis inbegriffen. Wir waren 5 Tage im Hotel und unterm Strich war das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck weder von Auswahl noch in der Qualit\u00e4t auch nur halbwegs empfehlenswert. Auch im Vergleich zu anderen Hampton Inns war es unterdurchschnittlich. Es gab z.B. nie Bacon zum Ei, nie Cornflakes, kein fertig zubereitetes Obst (z.B. Melone, Trauben oder Ananas). Dass alles Plastik und Pappe ist war klar, aber auch beim Plastikgeschirr gibt es Unterschiede (ja!) und das hier Verwendete war kaum zu gebrauchen. An einem Tag gab es nicht mal die Plastikmesser, waren aus (so sorry), und man versuche mal, einen Bagel mit einem L\u00f6ffel zu bestreichen. Die Auswahl an Brot \/ Geb\u00e4ck und Joghurt war nicht gut. Ich kann die positiven Kommentare hier nicht nachvollziehen, klar unter dem Durchschnitt vergleichbarer Restaurants, auch in Manhattan.\n\nLAGE\nEine der ganz guten Lagen in Manhattan. Ca. 5 min. \/ 400m Fu\u00dfweg zur Subway 42 St und zur Grand Central Station. Ca. 10 min. Fu\u00dfweg zur 5th Ave und zum Bryant Park. Ca. 25 min. zur S\u00fcdostecke vom Central Park.\n\nZUSAMMENFASSUNG\nMan kann durchaus in das Hotel gehen, vor allem aufgrund der Lage, und es ist recht g\u00fcnstig. Die geringe Zimmergr\u00f6sse f\u00fchrt aber schnell zu einem beengten Aufenthalt und das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck empfanden wir als komplett einfallslos und von m\u00e4ssiger Qualit\u00e4t.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We booked under \u201cThe Long Weekender\u201d program which reduces the nightly rate to $99 if you stay at least 3 nights.   The rate included a free breakfast which was OK (nothing special). I did not like their coffee but there was a Dunkin Donuts about 100 yards away so I went there every morning for a better cup. The front desk staff were VERY friendly and welcomed me every time I walked by. This was probably the friendliest front desk staff that I have experienced. Our room on the 12th floor had a terrible view of the ugly building across the street (on 43rd street). The room noise was below average as I heard some hallway noise when the people next to us arrived after midnight.  The on-line pictures of the fitness room looked good but I did not have time to check it out. There is no need to use the fitness room when you are walking about 10 miles a day to see all the NYC attractions. The rooms were clean and the d\u00e9cor was newer.\n\nOverall I enjoyed staying at this nice hotel and recommend it.

Echter: misschien heb ik pech, maar een week in een kamer waar je de gesprekken van de buren letterlijk kunt verstaan is niet fijn. Tussen mijn kamer en die ernaast zit een deur, waarschijnlijk kan die open gemaakt worden waardoor en een grote kamer ontstaat. Maar dit betekent wel dat het zeer en zeer gehorig is. Letterlijk de telefoongesprekken van de buurman volgen (om 2 uur in de nacht) of het gebabbel van jonge meiden. Voor meer dan 300 euro per nacht.... Naast een karig ontbijt, er zijn betere opties. Kortom, als je hier al boekt, zorg dat je dus niet zo'n kamer aan de achterkant hebt.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were here for three nights in February, and it was perfect for our needs. It was very well located for the business we had to do, in midtown between Second and Third Avenues, with cabs readily available. And I always like to stay in a place with a lot of international guests - not only do I enjoy that for its own sake, but for some reason it seems a sure sign that the hotel will give us a quality experience. \n\nThe room was very nice. It was on the small side, but clean, very comfortable, and well serviced from day to day. My husband and I both slept as well as we sleep at home - a rare experience in a hotel. We were on the 16th floor and, because it was on a minor crosstown street, the street noise was not too bad. The bathroom was modern and in great condition. A refrigerator might have been nice, but isn't essential for our purposes. \n\nWe also appreciated that the window opened a little bit - just enough to let in fresh air as needed, not enough to be a security issue. That's not always the case in hotels, and it is great to have.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was generous: you could have anything from yogurt, toast, bagel, cereal to waffles, eggs, and sausage, according to your preferences. Specific items ran a little low sometimes, but only briefly - the staff was really hustling to keep up. Plus, there's coffee and tea all day, which is a boon for those of us who are caffeine addicts.\n\nThe desk crew was friendly and efficient. We didn't have a lot of questions, but they helped us where we needed it - recommending a good deli around the corner, and advising us about getting cabs back to Penn Station on our last day.\n\nThe only drawback - and this wasn't a big problem - is that there are only two elevators. At peak times, when everyone is coming to and from breakfast or checking out, and the cleaning staff is moving, there could be a bit of a wait. The rest of the time, no problem.\n\nWe would definitely put the Hampton Inn Grand Central at the top of our list for our next trip to New York.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This time we wanted to avoid congestion in that area and looked for a bargain price on the East Side.  A little looking found us the Hampton Inn\u2014Grand Central.  As the name says, it is a short distance from Grand Central. Just go out the Lexington Avenue entrance and continue on to East 43rd Street and you\u2019re there.  We were greeted by a fantastically upbeat front desk staff. We were there early and our room wasn\u2019t ready yet, but the staffer found us another room and we were quickly checked in.  The person at the desk even sang along with me to a song from the Sound of Music. (I\u2019m certain that\u2019s not in her job description.) The room, 1605, faced 43rd street and yes, there is traffic and construction noise. It\u2019s hard to get away from noise in this part of town.  The room itself was small, but it had everything we needed. There was a safe in the closet and that was much appreciated. The rooms don\u2019t have refrigerators, but they will bring you one if you ask. (Our room may have been too small to put one in.) Breakfast was the typical Hampton Inn fare.  The breakfast room was spacious and clean and the person in charge of it kept busy keeping everything replenished.  If the Hampton Inn breakfast isn\u2019t your style, there are plenty of coffee shops around.   Just a note \u2013 they are keeping the rooms up.

Of course, if you have traveled to New York during Christmas time the prices on hotels are very expensive. When I booked this Hampton Inn the price was lower than most hotels in the manhattan area. I am glad I stayed at this hotel even though this hotel doesn't have a lot of amenities. They are they typical Hampton, however, there is no vending machine for sodas or snacks. They do offer the Hampton breakfast, wifi, flavored water, checkin cookies, teas, coffee and hot chocolate always available. This hotel right outside of the craziness of times square which after seeing time square am very happy that I decided to stay on the outskirts but still close enough. It is a quick walk to Grand Central station but also walking distance to Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center and the UN building. You truly do not need to rent a car but use the subway which is $3.00 one way or $6.00 RT or a yellow taxi. I enjoyed my stay because of the staff especially the front desk gals and the gentlemen who was there the 3 nights we stayed there. They were extremely helpful and always pleasant and greeting us as we were coming in, as well as, going out.

You never know what kind of attitudes you might get in a NYC hotel, but I can say that the people working at the Hampton Inn were the best!  They also have the usual Hampton Inn breakfast, which is typical of Hampton Inn.  We were there during Thanksgiving week and the hotel was fully booked, but we never had a problem with lines.    This hotel is a short walk to Grand Central and Bryant Park.  It's also walkable to Times Square (about 15 minutes) and Rockefeller Center.  We even walked to Central Park.    The only downside is that the rooms are small.  This is typical for NYC, but we did find that for a family of 4, with 4 suitcases, it was a tight squeeze.   We also had a strange air flow situation where the draft from under the door created an air tunnel type of noise.  Once we figured this out we had to put towels under the door to keep the room quiet.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":3572587,"title":"As Expected","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-11-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"NYC hotel rooms are notoriously small so we didn\u2019t have \u201cbig\u201d expectations. I frequent Hampton Inns as they are usually a good value and this was the case with this hotel. Small closet and bathroom, not much space beyond the double beds and desk but nicely furnished and clean. Windows are well sound proofed (43rd is a fairly quiet block too). The fact that Hampton Inn makes a point of changing duvets (or at least the covers) is a big seller for me. Overall, perfectly adequate. \n\nThe breakfast is your typical Hampton Inn selection, tasty and plentiful... 1-2 rotating hot choices (omelettes, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, French toast sticks), make your own waffles (my kids always love this) breads\/pastries, yogurt, fruit, hard boiled eggs, coffee, tea, cocoa, juice and water... if you can\u2019t find something to satisfy you, than you\u2019re clearly too fancy for Hampton. \n\nI have found Hampton Inn staff members to usually be helpful and friendly and this was the case here. They were able to accommodate a very early check-in (I never expect it and always appreciate it), they saved a few cookies for my kids when we returned after a long day, and were great with my kids. They always welcomed us back upon our return. They were generous with the bottled water as well. \n\nThe fitness and business centers are as to be expected as well: clean and well maintained. \n\nA washer\/dryer would have been nice to do a quick load but in NYC it was easy enough to find a fluff n fold. The $15 isn\u2019t much more than a load would\u2019ve been and was certainly easier (they offered same day service and delivery for a premium, but next day was fine) \n\nHelpful hint... the 01 and 02 rooms are right next to the ice machines (which are not enclosed or in an alcove) so you will hear it.  With 8 rooms on a floor it shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue but as luck would have it 3-4 days of our stay someone got ice at 5:15AM. The wife and kids slept through it but I heard it... I don\u2019t blame the Hotel for that, but they easily could service 2-3 floors with a single machine and reduce the likelihood of guest complaints. ","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It's a relatively short walk to Times Square and Central Park.  We made the walk from lower Manhattan (World Trade Center) but it's about 3 miles.  The hotel itself is clean and the staff is incredibly friendly.  The rooms are a bit tight but it is NYC so unless you are paying top dollar you're not going to get huge rooms.  Rooms are clean and in good working order.  Beds are comfortable.  Walls are a bit thin so we did have to pound on the wall to get our neighbors to quiet down at 3 a.m.  Overall, I'd recommend staying here.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}
