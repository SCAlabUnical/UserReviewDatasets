The 2 rooms were not completely adjoining, as requested, they are separated by a space, due to the constant noise of engines, occupied by the internal air conditioning units.\nThe cleanliness of the hotel leaves something to be desired: apart from the fact that there are bottles, plastic bags and glasses that remain for hours and hours in the corridors, our rooms were left without cleaning or making the beds: on the 30th and the 31st, Even though on the 30th we spoke with the manager at 5:30 p.m., when we returned from a busy day and, eager for a refreshing shower, we found the bed unmade, without clean towels. Once the complaint has been made, the manager appears and apologizes, citing an increase in people in the hotel and promises that it will not happen again. Well, thank goodness it was compromised, because the 31st was worse, we arrived at 6:45 p.m. and the situation was worse: Nothing had been touched in the room since our departure at 7:30 a.m.: that is, almost 12 hours. And no one had touched anything. I went to complain to the reception, why they were not answering the phone and when I arrived and saw that the receptionist was almost alone, I asked him why he was not answering the phone and he replied that he had had a very stressful day and when I asked him about the \"non-cleaning \"From the rooms he told me that it was not his concern, that he had his job (he was talking to a beautiful lady).

It\u2019s NY, so rooms are small, which is ok.  Good location if you want to be in midtown.  Smallest sink I\u2019ve ever seen in a hotel or anywhere for that matter. .  .\n\nBUT, the HVAC system is TERRIBLE.  All night, it turns on and off about every 10 minutes, makes the room too cold, then it waits until you are sweating and turns on again.  The temperature was set at 70 - we didn\u2019t touch the thermostat.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not the worst.  The vents are positioned so that the air blows DIRECTLY  on you while you lay in bed.  You could catch pneumonia! It\u2019s unpleasant, disturbs sleep, and ruins the entire evening.  The best assessment of a hotel is whether or not you can get a pleasant, restful night\u2019s sleep. This hotel fails on that count, at least in the room we received.  Ask before you stay about the venting location - if it is across from the bed.\n\nThat said, while it wouldn\u2019t solve all the problems, at least they could add a plastic diffuser to the vent to reduce the air from blowing on guests while in bed.   How does a hotel not know about this problem and do something about it?  I would expect that from Hilton, but not Hyatt.  \n\nA good hotel is all about the details.  Those that don\u2019t pay attention to details or put profit above the details of the guest experience should be avoided.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is a 10-minute walk from Times Square and the Empire State Building, is nestled near all of the major subway lines running throughout New York City, and yet is a classy, quiet spot in a very vibrant area.  I had a serious problem initially during my stay which was promptly and professionally dealt with personally by the general manager (Anthony D.) and director of operations (Greg) to my complete satisfaction.  \n\nThe hotel is in very good condition, is tastefully decorated in a colorful, yet subdued motif, the rooftop observation deck has a great view of the Empire State building, and this stay increased my affinity for the Hyatt Centric brand's emphasis on location.  Just like the Centric Montr\u00eaal, it's very close to what you want to see, and getting around NYC on the subway is a cinch.

It did not live up to the the Hyatt standards I have grown accustomed to.  First things first, the complimentary breakfast for elite travelers is awful.  It isn\u2019t even as good as airplane food breakfast.  There is nothing interesting on the menu.  The fruit was melon and really unripe strawberries.  The coffee was also not good.  We opted to eat out at all subsequent breakfasts.  \n\nWe were upgraded to a King suite.  It was painfully dark and oddly designed.  Not a fan of the decor.  The room darkening shades were not functional so we had to crawl onto the furniture and fix them.  We couldn\u2019t get our room cool enough for sleeping.  There were no glasses in the bathroom for water.  The recycling bin was lined with a plastic liner.  That suggests that they do not recycle.The hanging area was open to the room like a VERY low level motel.  To turn on the shower, you had to stand in spray to get it to the right temperature.  The biggest problem of all\u2026\u2026the rooftop bar was closed.  it was beautiful and we were able to take the steps up to the roof and enjoy the view of the Empire State Building but it was closed so we walked through a closed bar to get to the roof.  Maybe we shouldn\u2019t have been there but it was open via the stairwell and it was delightful while we were there.\n\nNow for the good things.  The bed was comfortable.  Housekeeping was very sweet and good.  And the best thing was a tiny light that faintly lit the toilet from the bed.  It was motion activated and very faint so you were not awakened while using the restroom in the middle of the night. \n\nI wish we had chosen a different Hyatt property because the price for this hotel was not reflected in the quality.  We are Hyatt loyalists so this was very disappointing.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Hyatt describes its Centric brand as:  \"Upscale, cosmopolitan and highly customizable, these properties attract selective guests who want the best of what\u2019s essential and none of what\u2019s not \u2014 all at the center of a prime destination.\" I have stayed at several Hyatt properties and each time had a satisfactory experience. This however, was very disappointing for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Reserving for 4 adults and being provided 2 sets of wash cloths, hand towels, and bath towels.  When I called to request additional supply for 4 adults, I was provided only 2 additional bath towels and 2 hand towels.\n\n2.  Inadequate supply of in-room coffee - not enough pods with caffeine for 3 adults for one day!  The cream curdled and ruined the first cup made.  It took 3 calls and trips from staff to provide enough pods, sugar, and powder creamer for 3 adults to have coffee our first morning.  When serviced by housekeeping, still less than 3 pods of caffeinated coffee left for the room.\n\n3.  When checking in I was not acknowledged as an Explorist.  When I asked if I would receive free water, the manager replied \"We're a Centric and we don't have to give you water.\"  Not the friendliest explanation and not sure if that's true?\n\n4.  Our beds were not made properly.  Upon arriving, one queen had no flat sheet and the other queen had two flat sheets - one above the fitted sheet and another on top of the comforter\/duvet.  When housekeeping prepared our rooms on a subsequent day, the beds were made the same way.  Very odd!\n\nThe hotel is only 2 years old (according to staff).  There is no place in the hotel to purchase snacks or other items.  I asked for a Diet Coke and was presented with a bill of over $6 with a line to provide a tip.  \n\nThe rooftop restaurant\/bar is very nice - sophisticated decor and an amazing view of the Empire State Building.\n\nThe view from our room (208) was of a concrete wall.\n\nI'm so disappointed that I burned 50,000 points plus $1100 to stay four nights here.

But to have an overhead shelf, and but 2 drawers for storing clothes\/belongings is below the Hyatt brand watermark. Better to use the \"cabinet\" for the ironing board which didn't fit as cubbies. Second, the bathroom - no shelving or towel bars bath meaning towels go to the floor. Oh but there is one - count it, one peg at 7 feet above the floor for a bath towel. So, the \"keeping green\" really means the money the laundry service makes. Now, there was a shelf under the sink vanity large enough to hold CLEAN towels and a shaving\/make-up kit but little else. Third, avant garde lighting was insufficient and requires a call to front desk to understand how to operate. Fourth, seating? Fugeddaboutit.

Let's get start from the beginning.\nChecked in on 1\/12\/23 around 3pm. The Caucasian woman working at the counter (with French\/European accent) said my charge didn't go through on the room. I called to confirm with Hyatt\/Chase that there was a travel lock on my card. I fixed the problem, went back to check in with her and she goes \"do you have enough money to pay for the room now?\"...are you kidding me?!? I have a 25k limit lol. Totally inappropriate to make any assumption and comment like that. Then they take our bags because our room isn't ready so we leave for some dinner. We call back around 5 after dinner to see if the room is ready...it's not!!! The front desk receptionist says not until 6pm! 2 hours later than check in time!\nThen the night of the 15 around 8pm we call downstairs to request room service from the Italian restaurant next door....they don't even answer, followed by the receptionist saying \"I don't see anyone around to take an order\"...huh? \nThe room itself is totally small for even NYC. Nowhere to put bags. The bathroom doors don't fully shut or lock...you can hear it all!\nThe rooms are noisy as hell! Constant noise from surrounding rooms and upstairs...and we were on the 18th floor!

To be honest I cannot understand how Hyatt can have a hotel in NY with that lack of client services. The employees are very disrespectful and without any education (lot of times their answers were \"Yeah\" - with a \"I don't care about that....\" tone, without even looking at us and repeating the same several times. They even hanged the phone up when my wife call to ask for them to clean the room.\nThe first night (December 23rd) there were lot of noise coming from other room (through the ventilation system assume). We went to sleep at 10pm and after trying to sleep without success, at 3am I went to talk with the person at the reception. I told him that I could not sleep and I wanted him to do something. The security guard (that was there too) told me that the noise was coming from 17th floor (I was on the 18th floor) and that somebody already made a complaint about them. The person in charge of the reception told me that they already asked the customers to stop making noise and they will ask again. I return to my room and at 5am I had to go again to the hotel reception to complaint about the same noises (several persons laughing and shouting loudly). The hotel employee told me that they already asked them to stop making noise. I asked him to call the police or to do something about that. He said he couldn't do anything. \nI asked him to give another room to sleep. He asked me \"Now?\". I replied \"Yes, now. I want to sleep\". He told me to return to my room that he will bring me another key for another room. Around 15\/30 minutes later he brought me another key of another room. I cannot believe it was me (the client) who has ask for a clear solution (too late because I hadn't sleep in almost all night).\nThe other problem was that few days they did not clean the room (basic change of towels and made the bed) even if we requested that.\nOn Monday (Dec 26th) we left the hotel at around 11am and when we return around 5pm we found that the room wasn't cleaned at all. We called to request that to clean the room. One person (a man that was at the reception) talked with my wife and he hanged up (after saying \"Yeah\"...a couple of times) without giving her a clear answer. My wife called again and a woman asked her was the name of the housekeeper that was assigned to clean our room. My wife told her that we didn't know that and that was something they are supposed to know that. The same issue happened other days.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked this hotel with a pretty good deal back in April for around $375\/night after taxes and fees. The hotel only opened in 2021, so everything was still in great shape. But we mainly booked it for the location. We were smack dab in between the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center. Almost everything we wanted to do during our trip centered around our hotel, so the location was perfect. Although, after we walked about 20,000 steps our first full day - we definitely wished a subway stop was right outside the hotel doors!\n\nWe arrived at the hotel just after 6pm on Sunday evening from JFK. Our room was not ready yet and were told that it would be about 20-40 minute wait. After waiting about 10 minutes, the front desk gentleman, I believe his name was Shannon, let us know that they were actually upgrading our room which is why it was taking a long time. However, if we wanted a non-upgraded room, we could get checked in right away. We opted to wait. It took about an hour to get our room. But we got upgraded to the 19th floor when we did not choose a high floor room when booking. We had an incredible view of the Empire State Building! It was definitely worth the wait. They also gave us a voucher for a free breakfast at the hotel restaurant. We took them up on that our last day there. The breakfast was fine, but I'm glad it was free as it is definitely not worth the price! An okay bagel, egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich with a side of fruit was supposed to be around $30 I believe. Rico Bagel is like a block away and you can get an excellent bagel sandwich for $8. \n\nOne thing I do want to say is that Shannon mentioned that we could leave our luggage with them while we waited if we wanted to go out. However, when we took them up on that offer, the area they told us to put the luggage was not secure. So we ended up just waiting in the lobby. I would definitely recommend having a secure area for luggage to be held for guests. \n\nThe room was gorgeous. Small, but efficient. We were able to book synthetic bedding instead of feather when reserving our room, which was great. The beds were probably the most comfortable beds I've ever used in a hotel room! I also called a month before to confirm our booking and asked for a fan to be in our room. They had a nice tower fan in our room once it was ready, which made us more comfortable. \n\nThe room was small but efficient. It had a nice mini-fridge which we definitely put to use. They don't have ice machines, but if you ask the front desk, someone will bring you some ice. That was nice our first day when nothing was cold from the fridge yet. The shower is large and beautifully decorated. However, the shower door does not secure water very well. Not the best design. But we had plenty of towels to keep the water from being a nuisance. \n\nWe left a $5 tip for our housekeeper every day and had excellent service (tip your housekeepers!!). \n\nThree elevators and they are extremely fast!\n\nWe are from the upper Midwest and the last two days we were there it was 90% humidity and almost 60 degrees out. We looked a bit out of place with all of the New Yorkers in puffer coats - but it was hot for us! We also figured out our last night there that our thermostat had not been working the entire time. We had it set to 65 - thinking that's what it was at. But when we messed with it, we realized that it was set at 65 but it was actually 71 in there. I called the front desk and they had an engineer up to our room very quickly - even though it was really late. He had it fixed within ten minutes and for the first time since we got there, we actually had air out of our vents. We had to turn the air up to 68 as it had gotten too cold in there.  \n\nWe really had such a great experience and I would be very happy to stay there when we go back to visit!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Not entirely sure if the smaller room size was simply the NYC effect or the standard for Centrics. Even though we were upgraded to one of their bigger rooms with a balcony, the room was so small that it was hard to walk around the bed. The desk and closet were almost hidden behind the bed. We did appreciate the balcony, but it rained for most of our short stay, so we didn't get to use it as much as we would have liked. \n\nUpon checking in, we were told breakfast would end around 11:30. Of course, we are on vacation, so we wandered downstairs just before it ended, and were told that it closed half an hour ago. We were genuinely confused and tried to explain that the lady who checked us in told us 11:30. After going back and forth with the receptionist, we were told to go out, grab our own meal, and bring the receipt back for them to reimburse. Now, to be fair, I'm not sure there was a better way to remedy the situation, but due to having to go out and find a spot, we were quite rushed for our activities that day (nearly missed the ferry to Ellis Island). Apparently, the weekend receptionist told us weekend breakfast hours, but since this was a Sunday-Monday stay, the next day's breakfast used weekday breakfast hours. The bigger issue was more that the weekday receptionist was rather difficult to talk to and you could almost taste her anger in the air. \n\nSince we were in such a hurry, we were not able to take our suitcases to our next hotel (which I had planned to be on the way to the ferry), so we asked them to hold our bags for us. At the end of the day, when we returned to retrieve our bags, we were told that the receptionist had dropped his keys down the elevator shaft and our bags were locked in the storage room. He proceeded to promise to bring our bags over to our next hotel (I did not exactly trust him to do that safely, as one of our bags lost a wheel during our trip), but we had no other choice, so we left after half an hour of going back and forth. Ten minutes later, he called us back, saying he had found another way into the room. What should have been a simple minute-long process ended up becoming extremely stressful and took nearly an hour to resolve. \n\nThese two situations are obviously probably not what you would experience during your normal stay, but I can't help but feel disappointed by the attitude of the receptionists in each situation. One was extremely belligerent and stubborn while the other was almost just nonchalant and carefree.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was treated like their most important customer (you know the highest rewards tier). I was not really familiar with the immediate area and was tire and hungry. Edil quickly got me checked in and suggested a few places to eat in the area and where the closest Starbucks was\u2026 he also let me know when they closed !! I had questions about transportation and a few other items and Edil was more than helpful. His demeanor, attitude, and friendliness was a tremendous departure of what I\u2019m use to at other hotels.

It's removed from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and other popular midtown hotspots, but close enough to walk to them. Also, it's a short walk to many subway stations. \n\nWhile we initially thought we'd be visiting central park a lot during our trip, we ended up spending many of our evenings at Bryant park, which is a just a few blocks from the hotel. While much smaller compared to central park, this park feels a lot more activated, especially in the evening. There are movie and yoga nights on the lawn. There are games such as ping pong too!\n\nAs far as the hotel goes, it feels like a like new or recently renovated property. The rooms are good size and efficient. They service the rooms each day, which is refreshing nowadays.  The room does run a bit warm, however, you can ask for a floor fan.  They are super responsive to service requests. For example, my shower wasn't draining very well. They were knocking on my door to fix within 30 seconds after hanging up the phone. I know it's a small hotel but still very impressive. \n\nThe gym is a good size and never seemed full. \n\nWe only had breakfast one day there. It's a good breakfast with your typical offerings, but it is rather pricey. To give you an idea: our order of pancakes, oatmeal, American breakfast with coffee and OJ came out to $80 after tip.  Don't get me wrong, it was tasty. But maybe not an affordable daily option. \n\nLastly, the rooftop bar is not yet available for this property. \n\nOverall, great Hyatt property!

Never sure how to rate \"value\" for a NYC hotel. Newly remodeled - rooms are very sleek, pleasant; not huge (had a regular double queen and a king room). A few frustrations - lighting wasn't the best; no place to hang towels (even though you're encouraged bypass housekeeping service until the 3rd day). Housekeeping took items (partially eaten bags of chips and nuts; empty water bottle) as \"trash\" that we were not done with and that were NOT in the trash - even after we complained about it. It was noisy due to some kind of construction taking place all night across the street - but I doubt there are very few places in NYC where you can avoid this - not the fault of the hotel.  On the plus side: great location - just a few blocks from NYC Public Library and Grand Central station. Smaller hotel, so no long wait for the elevators, nor for front desk staff when checking in or out. Front desk and housekeeping staff were very friendly and responsive when we asked for additional towels and coffee. Depending on the price, I would definitely consider staying there again.

(One nit there was not a lot of drawer space; a little unit under the huge desk would have been much appreciated). I was on the back of the building. The room was relatively dark as it faced a courtyard of the backs of buildings. That was also a plus, however, as it was one of the quietest rooms I've had in NYC. The bathroom was surspisingly large with great counter space. Front desk was excellent; acknowledged by Hyatt status and offered me the appropriate benefits. One last thing, most NY hotels of this size only have two elevators, this one had three and this was much appreciated as I never had to wait. I would definitley stay here again!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

That said, other Hyatt hotels within its vicinity have offered these benefits to me, and even just a verbal recognition that those benefits aren't available would have been nice.\n\nThat said, once I did get my room, it seemed to be newly renovated - it was vibrant, clean, and up to what I expect for a Hyatt Centric - which is pretty high standards.\n\nI appreciated its abundance of light (natural & built-in), and the city view of the Empire State Building was awesome. I know there were reviews about the unrenovated rooms, but the new rooms are fantastic. On the 17th floor, it was very quiet - something appreciated with NY hotels.\n\nAC & water pressure\/heating was up to par for the very cold days during my stay.\n\nBreakfast was a bit of a mess. At the restaurant, it seemed it was understaffed and the staff seemed stressed, and as a consequence, service was inattentive with basics missed. I can't blame them, though, considering how much they had to handle. The food was tasty, though.\n\nIn general, staff were generally friendly - a good measurement for NYC hotels.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be my first choice in Midtown, I was generally happy with may stay & wouldn't hesitate at all to stay here again at this Hyatt Centric.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Reception did not have any idea as to when the water service was going to be restored. Also I must point out that nothing in the hotel website alerted customers about this major inconvenience. No alternative lodging ideas were offered. Overall this indicated to me that the hotel did not take any ownership of the issue. \nDeciding to checking (and praying that water would be restored soon, I checked in and no acknowledgment of my Globalist Hyatt status was offered. My assigned room was lugubrious with a view of walls of nearby buildings. A small workspace with an uncomfortable chair was not very inviting to do much there. \nBecause there was no operating restaurant in the property, coupons were offered to order breakfast on line through a provider app. Unfortunately it was not working in my phone so I ordered through my laptop using the coupon code .

However, that is fairly typical for rooms in NYC, I had simply hoped for more from a Hyatt.\n2. My room with a \"view\", that mind you I paid extra for, required you to crane your neck in the very corner of the room to see the Empire State building. The actual view as a series of water towers. Granted this might be the NYC version of view but it certainly is a more than a little misleading.\nThe bigger issues:\n3. At multiple points I saw staff members at the front desk with their masks off.\n4. I arrived at the hotel at 5:30 pm and still had to wait 45 minutes for my room to be cleaned. There is absolutely no reason why my room is not ready for me at 5:30 pm. \nThe biggest problem:\n5. One of our nights a fire alarm went off at 1 am. I have two young children who were obviously fast asleep. When the alarm was not shut off within a few minutes we obviously had to wake them up, dress them for the cold and then run down 18 flights of stairs. Only to be told that it was a false call. I am happy that it was a false call and that no one was hurt and nothing was damaged. However, I am very upset about the utter lack of acknowledgement from hotel management about the major inconvenience that this was for my and every other family staying there. It was an utter nightmare trying to get the kids back to sleep and absolutely affected the remainder of our trip because the kids were sleep deprived. It is unacceptable that there was not at the very least a letter of apology slipped under our door. Or perhaps some chocolates placed on the bed when it was made. Or a question by the front desk as we walked out the door that next morning asking how we were and sorry for the experience. Something. Anything.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":17762159,"title":"Credit were credit is due: Great service recovery.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-10-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"----- NEW REVIEW -----\nSome background: I've stayed this property twice. The first stay was terrible, and I rated this 1*. I've had to remove this review as TA wont allow me to post more than one review every 3 months. For this reason I've included the old review below.\n\nCredit where credit is due: after a first stay that was really bad (my other review is still up, below) this stay has been exemplary. The hotel, and in particular GM Anthony really did try to make things right. Often (and I personally think this is why people complain) guests are just after some points, but this is the easy way out; and, after spending those points, I'm sure guests are back to resentment.\n\nAnthony, on the other hand, took time out of his day and we had almost an half an hour discussion. After this discussion I made the decision to give the hotel another chance and I'm glad I did.\n\nBefore my stay Anthony and his team were of great help arranging the many packages I had arrive to the hotel, Amazon decided to deliver almost every item in a separate box resulting in 13 packages. These were all waiting for me when I got to my room. I've only had this happen at the Park Hyatt Seoul before and this was a really nice gesture.\n\nCheck in this time was extremely smooth and very swift. The woman at check in, I didn't catch her name, was very hospitable and a big difference when compared to my previous stay. This time I stayed in room XX07, and I can definitely recommend paying extra for this room category. The room is situated much farther away from the elevator and this meant a much better sleep at night. I will add, however, that this room is opposite a linen cabinet that I presume is used by housekeeping so there is some noise during the day. While this room faces the street, the windows are definitely well sound proofed, as the only traffic that was audible were police sirens. Normal traffic wasn't audible. Great.\n\nI tried the gym this stay and it was great for a hotel gym. The gym has three treadmills, an elliptical and stationary bike. Most importantly, however, the dumbells go up to 70 pounds. Most hotel gym only have weights up to 50 so this is something I particularly liked. The gym is of decent size, particularly for Manhattan. \n\nLocation is perfect. Comparing it to the Hyatt Centric Times Square, you are just a few blocks away from the craziness that is Times Square, and for this reason I actually prefer this hotel's location. Fifth avenue is around the corner and central park is 15 min away by foot. \n\nFor those thinking of using BLADE: I did a speed test on a week day at 4PM, and uber to the helipad + BLADE + transfer to T4 at JFK was two minutes slower than an uber straight to JFK. It can take up to 20min to get from the hotel to the helipad because of Manhattan traffic.\n\nI would like to thank Anthony for his hospitality and his efforts into making things right. This was a wonderful stay and I have already booked my next stay for my trip next month.\n\n----- OLD REVIEW, RATED 1* --------\nI'll start by saying I was really looking forward to my stay, having stayed at the Hyatt Centric Times Square property a few times, which is amazing. Long story short: book that one instead.\n\nPrior to arrival, requested a room on a high floor away from the elevator. Arrived at the property at 4PM - was assigned a room on the 8th floor with a view of a brick wall. I'm a Hyatt explorist member - and while this isn't the highest tier in Hyatt, you'd think they would at least assign a better room. Asked for a different room, but was told the hotel was fully booked (yet still selling rooms to the night across different categories at 4PM... interesting)\n\nWe put a DND sign to the room as soon as we entered. We had valuables worth 10k+ USD in the room that didn't fit the safe so we didn't want anyone to enter our room.\n\nOur bathroom had issues: the water wouldn't drain. I raised this and specifically asked if maintenance can fix this AFTER we checked out. Instead, maintenance shows up 15 min later, knocking the door with the DND sign hanging right there, so I sent them away. Spent 2 hours in the city, came back to see someone had entered our room. Foot marks in the bathroom, and 2 towels on the bed. Called the operator and asked why anyone would enter the room - was told 1802 requested towels. We stayed in 802. I understand mistakes happen but I asked the operator why anyone would enter a room with a DND sign on, and operator admitted that shouldn't happen. I ask for an investigation, the next day I get a different story: the leak in the bathroom had to be fixed. Clearly one of these stories is true. Got an apology email from the GM, who managed to spell my last name wrong. You'd think if you're in damage control mode to get your guest's name right.\n\nRooms are OK but walls paper thin - we overheard everything the couple next to us was discussing, even at the lovely time at 2AM. There is also CONSTANT beeping from the elevator, clearly audible in the room throughout the day. This drove us completely insane.\n\nOur flight is not until 10PM, but we are ready to check out at 8AM. We are completely done here.\n\nLocation is fine. Extremely small lobby, no bell man to assist with luggage.\n\nThe Hyatt Centric Times Square is usually around $20 more. Stay there.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Conveniently located at 39th and Madison, a very short walk from 5th Ave., this property is very clean and friendly.  I will be staying again! One note, the hotel states 5th and 39th, but if you are getting a taxi or ride share, go to Madison and 39th.  It is just on the left side of the street walking toward 5th.

Only issue is kitchen isn\u2019t open yet but should be soon along with their rooftop bar which should open by Spring. Terrific staff; incredibly friendly. Will stay again for sure.

Wall paper is scratched all over, some outlets did not work, poorly furnished edges, etc. No sound proofing whatsoever. We could hear neighbors above walking and people next door talking. We got a room facing inner yard and it was dark, noisy (there is an industrial fan outside). Even through we were on 11 floor, the noise was quite loud even with window closed. When I opened the window once the room was filled with a smell of burnt oil, I think the fan serves a restaurant. No body cream, no bathrobes. I stayed at Hyatt Centric Tokyo and it was amazing. NYC is nothing even close to the same standard. I guess its the city of low standards when it comes to hotels, so consider that when choosing where to stay.

Also I noticed the presence of General Manager Mark during check-in and General Manager Anthony during check out near by. This confirms for me that outstanding customer experience is number one priority of this Hyatt  team.\n\nIn fact, I felt so good that I plan to return again which is why I have booked my next two stays at this Hyatt.\nCharles","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
