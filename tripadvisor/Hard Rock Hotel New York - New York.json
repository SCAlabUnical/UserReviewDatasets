Absolutely amazing property and top level customer service.  The concierge greeted us with bottled water when we checked in and asked how he could be of service.  We explained to him that we were trying to check in early as we arrived at 9:30AM. Although they had no rooms available, he had a bellhop take our luggage to storage so we could explore the town.\n\nThe hotel is brand new and is completely amazing.  Lots of cool memorabilia on the walls and the customer service is top notch.  My only complaint is that the rooms are a little small but I guess that is expected in NYC.  An awesome stay to say the least and my wife and I will be looking to stay at other Hard Rock properties when we travel together and with family.\n\nStay away from the NYY Steakhouse.  Completely overpriced and a terrible atmosphere.  We walked in on a Monday night and were the only couple in the steakhouse.  We asked to see a menu and when we saw the prices we got up and left.  An 8 oz. steak was $60.00 USD and a baked potato was $15.00 USD.  NO THANKS!\n\n** Just so you are aware, the hotel charges $45.90\/night for a resort fee which they claim is for use of their in-room coffee maker, wi-fi and fitness facilities.  You should be able to opt of the resort fee if you choose not to use any of the facilities but you can't.  The charge is extremely pricey but is right up there with everything else you get charged for in NYC.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Literally a few steps away from the centre of everything in Time Square. So close to the action, yet so peaceful. It was a pleasure to return to the hotel each day after exploring the city. Small bijoux room but well equipped with a modern and stylish interior. Very comfortable bed,  Good WiFi, nice cocktails at the rooftop bar.\n\nWould have given 5 stars for my experience except for the following points. - If you are a tea drinker like myself bring your own bags as only coffee drinkers are catered to in the room. We had to request slippers to the room. I celebrated my 50th birthday during my 4 night stay and not even so much as a happy birthday wish from anyone or even a HRH note even though I informed the person at check in that that was the reason for my visit. Felt very impersonal. All said, I would definitely return to this hotel and would definitely recommend it.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We upgraded our room so we had a good city view and we were also impressed at the size of the room. (We got married during our trip to NYC so having a good sized room was helpful when it came to having people come in for hair and makeup!) I had forgotten to pack my steamer so was impressed to find a good quality steamer in the wardrobe! One thing we thought we may have during our stay was a lot of noise considering the location of the hotel. It was a compromise we were happy to make but there was no need - we found our room to be very quiet and comfortable. (The pillows were especially comfortable!) Housekeeping were excellent - our room was absolutely spotless throughout our stay. The staff at the hotel are all very friendly and cannot do enough to help ensure you have a great stay! The Sessions bar\/restaurant was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed the live music. The only slight disappointment was the RT60 rooftop bar. Gorgeous views but they seemed to have run out of a lot of things so choice was limited on the occasion we visited. Sessions seemed far better stocked! Wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel for future trips to NYC, we had a great stay!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The place has a cool as cucumber nice vibe and energy to it in design, relaxed ambiance, and outlook, and is especially fun with all the original rock paraphernalia (jackets, guitars, dresses) from iconic rock stars from all decades, including Beyonce, Aretha Franklin and Gene Simmons. We felt positive energy and attentiveness to our needs from all the staff, including the concierge, restaurant staff and housekeeping. Special shout out to Milton our breakfast server and Anita F. The location could not be more convenient to all the iconic sightseeing attractions of NYC like Times Square, Broadway shows, the MOMA museum, Rockefeller Center and Radio City, as well as the subway and other key mass transit hubs like Penn Station and Port Authority. We also love the unusual special feature that Hard Rock hotels have with the option to have an electric guitar or phonograph system with albums sent to your room for special listening pleasure. Ideal for music aficionados! My only criticism would be that our room was listed as two queen beds, but the beds seemed more like doubles.

On arrival we was hit with a five hundred dollar bill partly for the service charge that were expecting after reading some reviews for a gym that I was not going to use and really bad coffee pods in room use the shop next door really friendly guy  great two dollar coffee and for a deposit for damages that we have been told we will get back this week. Hotel it self is very nice lots to look at inside live music on the second floor bar  area in the evening's which was  lovely we only visited it twice unfortunately the bar staff on both nights were not very friendly had to walk to the bar myself and ordered drinks which is OK but not in a five star hotel that is charging twenty dollars for a glass of wine. Roof top bar was OK nice view of times square .   Rooms are nice beds are fantastic the door staff never open doors speed more time chatting to each other. All in all hotel was nice if your going to spend time in it but a waste of money if your going to be out and about and just need somewhere to sleep lots of good hotels that was much cheaper.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Scelto per la nomea del Brand hard rock e il tema musicale. POSIZIONE eccezionale in Times Square a due passi da tantissime attrazioni. Metro vicinissima. L'hotel \u00e8 carino anche se entrando non c'\u00e8 una vera hall da 5 stelle, ma un piccolo ingresso. reception al piano superiore con due banchetti attaccata alla zona bar che sa poco di grand hotel.. Siamo arrivati verso le 1615 e 3 stanze su 4 non erano pronte nonostante il check in sia alle 15. Non si sono neanche preoccupati di offrirci un caffe dopo 12h di viaggio. Siamo dovuti rimanere in attesa per piu di mezz ora. Personale non direi tanto gentile e problem solving. La stanza superior piccola , ma carina, letto molto comodo interni moderni e nuovi. Tuttavia nonostante ti chiedano 400$$ di cauzione il frigo bar \u00e8 vuoto e nella mia stanza comunque NON ERA FUNZIONANTE cosa che ho capito sapessero gi\u00e0 ma si son ben guardati dal dirlo e nel caso effettuare uno sconto sulla tariffa. Non sono stati in grado di risolvere e sono rimasta senza frigo. La pulizia lascia a desiderare. La polvere nell'armadio non \u00e8 mai stata rimossa. I pigiami mai piegati e gli accessori bagno  cuffia doccia o kit beauty x un solo ospite.\nATTENZIONE a chi patisce i rumori la notte. E' perennemente acceso il ventolone nelle camare ed emette un rumore fastidioso molto forte in continuazione e pare non sia disattivabile .Dicono obbligatorio dal covid....non saprei non mi \u00e8 mai capitato in alcun hotel. Ho dormito sempre con i Tappi.\npeccato perch\u00e8 nonostante la posizione in piena Times Square dall'esterno non si sentiva nulla, dunque ottima insonorizzazione.\nAnche il secondo giorno siamo rientrati verso le 16 e le stanze non erano ancora state rifatte; solo dopo sollecito.\nBello il rooftop al 34p anche se dalle 18 non sono ammessi under 21 e se qualcuno viaggia in famiglia non \u00e8 bello lasciare i 18enni in camera.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Firstly, I would say the location of this hotel is fantastic! Really convenient for Times Square, Rockefeller, Fifth Ave and there are a number of subway stations within minutes of walking. \nWe got checked in by Jose, who was by far the most pleasant employee we came across. \nOur room was beautiful and really spacious, clean and the views were lovely! We couldn't hear too many sirens, but I don't understand why people would book such a central hotel and then complain about sirens?! Didn't bother us at all! Bed was very comfortable and slept really well.\n\nThe reason why we didn't give this hotel 5 stars was because of the service by staff at both the lobby bar and the RT60 rooftop bar. The chap on the front desk of the RT60 (young guy, wears jewellery) was so unpleasant to deal with and was more interested in speaking with his friends than greeting us just stood around at the desk waiting to be seated (with a reservation). When we were seated, a number of staff walked past us with no offer of a drink. We asked if someone could take our order who said they would send over server to us.....still waiting....ended up going to the bar and getting our drinks there! bye bye tip!\nThe next evening, we went back and the same guy on the front desk was so unwelcoming and we cut our visit short and didn't both wasting anymore time there because of the poor service.\nWe also had a drink after a full day of sightseeing in the lobby bar, again waiting round for ages for someone to come over and ask us for a drink, despite us sitting on the seats right on front of the bar & no one else around! Ended up going up to the bar again and ordering drinks. There were 2 people folding napkins on the desk to the side with people waiting for drink orders- didn't make sense. We did not go back here.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant stay. Expensive, but that's NY! Rooms are great but service needs fine tuning.  ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was perfectly located in Times Square 1.5 blocks from the tree and had great finds near by like Max Brenner,  coffee shops and more. \n\nThe lobby\/ Sessions was beautifully decorated . Sessions had overly priced food but breakfast was truly delicious and the cocktails were really good. \n\nRt 60 missed the mark for us, though cool concept , to me, roof tops are special with good views and seasonal flair. Stayed true to Hard Rock brand but not to NYC. Nothing holiday about it and missed opportunity to jazz up the terrace for Christmas. Sessions had cozy domes for that purpose.\n\nThe room was as expected in NYC , cramped. Limited room to unpack ( double queens). The beds and linens were comfortable and very clean. The bathroom was cramped with no towel hooks but had good very products. Fridge was not working . TV had streaming which was appreciated for the teens.\n\nOur biggest complaint was the room smell ( like dog)  secondary was the lack of working elevators. \n\nOverall we did really enjoy it and the kids were very happy. I think that for the value of the price, location and overall vibe of this hotel most guests will find it great for a short trip. If staying longer is opt to spend more for more space. \n\nNote I didn't find many kids here.

Everyone made us feel welcome and looked after. \n\nI have saved the best until last\u2026 the concierge team were our guardian angels! There was terrible storm, our flight leaving NY was cancelled and we couldn\u2019t get another one for 3 days. I found a flight leaving Washington that evening but had to get there within 6 hours.

This hotel is in a fantastic location and we upgraded to a city room for $50 which provided us with the views of Times Square steps. The room was nice and clean with a very comfortable bed. \n\nHowever, from the moment your hotel experience starts it feels somewhat like a money making scheme. Yes I understand it\u2019s a business but this takes it to another level. For instance, we spent $3200 on the room and they then said we had to pay another $600 for the deposit. This wasn\u2019t made clear in the initial booking or at the check in desk when they took $3800 from the card without saying. What if we didn\u2019t have the money for this, would we have been turned away? Further to this, there is a compulsory $40 dollar fee per day which is added to your account, it\u2019s okay though $20 is for credit which cannot be rolled over so has to be spent on the hotel each day. Not only this, the room service is ridiculous. My partner and I would generally use room service however, there is a $5 dollar set up fee, 18% gratuity fee and that\u2019s before you\u2019ve even ordered or purchased anything. This was somewhat disappointing and meant we often just brought food to the room where required. \n\nAll in all, a nice hotel with some nice staff and attractions.

But no children allowed only between 4-6pm! Nowhere for us to have a drink at night as a family! Housekeeping continually came to our room at 5pm, majority of the time when we had returned to shower and change for dinner and they would ask us to wait in the corridor, really not convenient, why were they not coming in a morning when we were out! The room was booked for 4 people, we had 2 of everything\u2026. 2 robes, 2 towels, 2 wash cloths, 2 coffees, 2 cups and 4 coat hangers! There is absolutely no where to store your luggage, we had 4 suitcases on the floor and has to step over them constantly! And we had an awful view out of our window of a building site. We booked through a travel agent who told us we had breakfast for 2 included in the price, the hotel however said none of us were entitled to breakfast when we arrived!! We were flying back to the UK and leaving the hotel at 3pm, I asked if we could possibly pay for a late checkout (checkout is at 12pm) and they said yes I could for \u00a3250!!! \u00a3250 for 3 hours!!!! This holiday was booked 12 months in advance and we were all very excited about staying at the hard rock hotel, which had cost us a LOT of money\u2026 we were very deflated and extremely underwhelmed! A lot of money to see the lobby, reception and our room!!!!","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It allowed my daughter to continue to sleep when I was up early and in the shower. The cleanliness of the room and the entire hotel was also outstanding! \nThe overall vibe of the hotel was beyond our expectations as well. True to any Hard Rock establishment, everything throughout the building was music-themed. Even the tiny details in our room made me smile, such as the gold guitar pick on the wall next to the door where the privacy latch rested when not in use and the \"B-side\" label on the extra roll of toilet paper. At the end of the hallways on every floor is an image of a musical icon as well as related memorabilia in a glass case. My daughter and I took the stairs from the 33rd floor down to the 5th floor, stopping on each floor to see who was on the wall. It was like being in a museum! \nI would definitely stay here again and will most certainly recommend this hotel to my friends and family!! ","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Everything you could need is within 10 mins walk. The hotel is very well appointed. The beds are very comfortable, we didn\u2019t hear any noise from within the hotel but did hear some noise from outside though not enough that it stopped any of us having great nights sleep and I am particularly bad at sleeping in hotels. The bathrooms were beautiful and one of our rooms had a lovely tub with floor to ceiling window (and electric blind) which was a joy to soak in after a long day shopping and walking. The reception checked us in very quickly and Ryan (concierge) arranged for us to have two rooms together in a separate little hallway where we could Lock the door to the hallway and keep our doors open. This was so helpful as we had two teens with us and it meant we could be sure they were safe in their room without us. Ryan also arranged for a kind note with birthday wishes and a little surprise to be in the room on our arrival. I have to thank Ryan as sadly we never got to meet him. He was brilliant and provided us with so much information prior to arriving. Thank you Ryan. The roof top bar was great and again the staff were brilliant and found us a great table at a mins notice. Lovely cocktails up there to celebrate a birthday. I would happily stay here again and again. Beautiful decor, great amenities, lovely staff (apart from one lady in a blue dress with white flowers in the 2nd floor restaurant, who was quite rude on the day we departed) and great location.

Very near to Times Square and the subway. However the location makes it quite noisy which is fine if that\u2019s your vibe. There was lots going on in the hotel. It was the Pride Ball and various other events so very buzzy and fun. \nI do have a gripe about the room. We had a studio suite as we love a suite and thought a little more space would be nice. However in all honesty it simply wasn\u2019t worth the money. It didn\u2019t have a suite feel at all and barely qualified as a larger room. The sink was next to the coffee machine and front door, not in the bathroom. And that\u2019s because there was no bathroom as such. There was a toilet and the shower was in there right next to it and a bit of a tight squeeze. There was no hope of having a private shower if one of us needed the toilet and visa versa. It was a real shame. If you\u2019re going to call it a suite then you have to do better or don\u2019t bother. Having said that the bed was fantastically comfortable. The tv remote gave up working on the last day but we just left it. There was a Nespresso machine but no kettle or tea which was a shame as it is usually pretty standard in good hotels. But lovely Icelandic water was free and replaced daily. Staff were very friendly. On our last day we had lunch in the session\u2019s restaurant on the mezzanine. I had a very good Caesar salad and my husband a delicious burger. Both followed by cheesecake. There is building work on a hotel opposite which we heard at times but in all honesty we didn\u2019t spend much time in the room other than at the beginning of the day and the end. I would recommend this hotel but I would say choose your room wisely and it\u2019s probably quieter the higher you are.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was the only disappointment of our trip, but it meant so much to me. ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Initially I was a little concerned our balcony room was only on the 5th floor, but it was ideal - no significant city noise. The room was beautifully appointed and perfectly spacious, just perfect for myself and my 9 year old daughter. The chocolates on our first night from room service made her day! The entire hotel (that we saw) was unbelievably clean - main areas, elevators, and halls. Stellar housekeeping service on the 5th floor - even though we opted against daily service, the team checked on us every time they saw us in the hall to make certain we were all set. No trash bags in the room was a bit of a concern, I didn\u2019t want to dispose of food trash in an empty bin so that was a bit to manage, but I imagine it must be related to NYC plastic bag ban. This hotel is so perfectly situated between Times Square and Rockefeller Center, and the subway but yet tucked away enough you get some peace and quiet. Beware the views from the 5th floor balcony rooms aren\u2019t much, but still a bonus to have a balcony in the city! Mobile checkout was a cinch and the valet team was awesome. We came down about an hour and a half before departure on checkout day and let them know when we planned to leave and our car was waiting out front for us when we returned.

The location is superb, the staff was so friendly and accommodating, the room was a good size, the bed was extremely comfortable with a ton of pillows.  Best of all, it was IMMACULATE. Their housekeeping staff is outstanding. The rooms are well-equipped but there's no micowave, so be warned. Also I was a bit confused about the operation of the shower, but eventually sorted it out.  Had some water problems one morning as well, but those were momentary and did not impact my stay. Just don't panic if you can't get the water to turn on in the morning--give it a few seconds. I didn't completely love the food--it was good but oddly prepared in a few cases that did not really add anything to the result. The hotel is incredibly stylish and virtually brand-new.  Try the rooftop bar for amazing views, especially at night, out on the balcony.  Overall this was one of my best experiences at any NY hotel.

We were very excited to stay in the Hard Rock hotel. At Check in, we were given our room keys and asked if we needed help with our bags, no conversation and fairly blunt, not very welcoming experience. They also took my credit card and said it was for security but I would not be charged, again this was fine until I saw I had been charged $400 in holding, ($100 per night) we were not informed of this. The room was nice but small which is understandable for the location. What let the hotel down was the service from the staff.  From returning into the building, the security would not greet you, if anything we felt looked up and down and judged, no hello or welcome back, maybe this is just because we are a gay couple, and others may get a better experience. We got a drink in the lobby bar and had the rudest server, we were pretty much the only people at the bar and we got service which was not just poor, the barman was blatantly rude, ignored us, gave my partner a long dirty look. We had a chat with a nice lady from Chicago outside the hotel who had a similar experience.\n\nOn check out I was surprised to be hit with a $180 charge for fees that I was not told about at check-in.\n\nAdvise to management - The team need to be briefed to be more informative on fees, I get why they would hide them, but I would rather know about them as they are unclear on booking. Also the staff need to be refreshed that customers are paying a lot of money for the hotel and expect friendly service.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After being set at our table our server took our order and proceeded to ask if we wanted to share every item we ordered as if we could not afford to order separate plates. I had three beers all of which were warm or at room temperature. My steak was ordered medium, it was medium well on the edges. The center was at the correct temperature. Over all it was a quality steak but the seasoning was underwhelming. For 337 dollars I expected to get treated with some respect. We came back up to our room and headed to bed we came in late so this was around 1 am, expecting to get up around 9 to explore the city. At around 6 am our neighbors came home absolutely trashed. We were awaken to the sound of heavy thumping like furniture was being moved, yelling and partying. We have heard all of there personal problems, political views, and enough bro\u2019s to last me a lifetime. They continue to party as we speak (9 am now) and me and my wife have gotten no sleep. We text the number provided for assistance with no help. But room service did show up at 8:30 am and come into our room even though we had the do not disturb light on to clean.

Of course, when going to NYC, hotels can be hit or miss - either old and outdated in a great location, or beautiful but exorbitantly priced in an \"OK\" location.\n\nThis hotel was the best of all - great location, recently updated with cool decor and fun colors, and very clean. Our room was a classic queen - 2 beds - and it was roomy enough for the two of us to have space and not be in the way of each other. The bathroom was small, but efficient and very clean, and well-maintained. Inside of the hotel, it was quiet too!\nWe would 100% book here again.

On the first night, my credit card was charged USD 2\u2019600 and it was approved. HRH said there was a pb on their side and wanted to charge again. I refused since it had been approved already. On the next night we came back to the hotel at 11:00 pm and our room was locked (our keys did not work). We went back to the reception and they said they had to have my credit card again and would just make an \u201cauthorization\u201d on it. I did not have any choice but to accept (or would have no access to a bed for the night). The next morning I realized on my bank status that the amount of 2600 USD AND a second amount of 2500 USD had been charged on my credit card. Went to the manager: he told me they did not have the money, etc. Finally with the proof of my bank statement, realized the error. Nevertheless, it was too late for the bank to cancel the charge right away and I was left with an overcharge of 2500 for the next 7 days (time for the bank to process). Thus left me in distress in NYC. I had to get a bank transfer from a family member to cover my holiday costs in the meantime. \nI was forced to charge my credit card or would have been homeless > this is unacceptable from a hotel chain to treat a customer that way given that we were there for 7 nights !

Brittani reached out ahead of time and I explained our request for an early check in, as we were going to a matinee and wanted to get settled beforehand.  Our request was accommodated and made to feel effortless, which was appreciated.  \nWe upgraded to a deluxe room.  Word of caution\u2026 the room is tiny.  Very tiny.  But extremely well thought out.  Nods to rock are everywhere but tastefully done.  Special shout out for the Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga print in our room as well as the guitar pick used to keep the bolt from hitting the wall.\nBed was comfy and the duvet was patterned in guitars!  Loved it all.\nWe tried Sessions for dinner one night and breakfast one morning.  Cannot say anything but excellent on both counts.  Service was friendly and professional and the food arrived hot.  All was tasty.  There could be a few more choices on the menu, but what was there was well presented and moreish.\nAlso, tried the continental breakfast on the Sunday morning through private dining.  Just lovely and quite a good value.\nSo, why 4 stars instead of 5?\nWe didn\u2019t have hot water on the last morning of our stay.  We didn\u2019t even have lukewarm water.  It was cold, which was a shame as I enjoyed standing under the rainfall shower for quite some time.\nAlso, the amenities fee is high at $45 per person, per day.  I knew it before I booked so there were no surprises but all we took advantage of were the 2 bottles of water per day and 1 cup of coffee each.\nLastly, the cable was a bit spotty and went out completely on Saturday night for a bit.\nOverall, however, this hotel was just what we needed for a weekend of theatre going.  And we go to the theater a lot so we will definitely be back.\nLast point - I\u2019m not sure if this was planned or just by chance, but when we walked into our room they had the music turned to the show tunes station.  That won me over instantly.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel emails you ahead of your stay with the option to add on upgrades like the parking, but it only mentions the $75 price. The valet is run efficiently with friendly customer service. Call 45 minutes ahead on the day of your departure. \n\nThis is a small hotel with small but clean rooms. The bathroom is cramped  with NO hooks. I couldn't hang my dress and had to instead come out to get it in a provided robe (inconvenient if traveling with kids). There wasn't even a hook for the bath towel when showering. The bathroom door is frosted glass with (for us) Lady Gaga on it. You can't really see through it as far as privacy but if someone uses the bathroom in the middle of the night, the bathroom light shines into the bedroom through the glass. The bathroom door does not have a lock and there is no vent\/fan. Even for a shower. \n\nThere is a SMALL closet area for hanging clothes (but some would need to be short to hang over the drawers and safe) and only 3 small drawers. The room also has a small fridge. The beds were definitely comfortable. The curtains and shades were great darkeners. We never heard our neighbors and we were told the hotel was at almost 100% capacity. Since the room was tight and we had our stuff everywhere (and only stayed 2 nights), we opted out of room service and only requested towels. \n\nThe hotel offers some free options. My husband requested a Fender Telecaster ($200 credit card hold only), but there is no guarantee or pre-reservation. We came back to our room on day 2 to a different guitar that comes with a small amp that links to headphones).  It was fun for something different. \n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to friends who wanted this location. Any staff we encountered were friendly. Hard Rock: add bathroom hooks.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were assured by Brittany (\u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d) that our room would be ready after the play and indeed it was. She is an absolute treasure\u2014professional, welcoming and funny. When we went back to the front desk to pick up our keycards, we were treated with the same warmth and courtesy by her colleague (I am almost positive his name is Jay and that his favorite performer is J. Cole.)\nOur room was ergonomically ingenious and was perfect for our needs. It was immaculately clean and the bed and its furnishings very comfortable.\nIt was a special thrill to turn on the bathroom lights, slide the door shut and see a life-size Bruce Springsteen in our room.\nThe hotel\u2019s public areas were well-kept and staffed by other pleasant and accommodating personnel. A shout-out to Raul, who charmed us at breakfast and the evening before. The cocktails at both the downstairs bars and the rooftop bar were outstanding. The complimentary hot chocolate on offer was the best I have ever had\u2014and a real blessing on a 10\u00b0F day.\nWe had dinner at the NYY restaurant attached to the hotel and it, too, exceeded our expectations.

The package I selected (Press Play on your Holiday) also guaranteed early check-in. When we checked in at 1, our room was not ready. When it finally was ready, we did not have a separate bedroom and living space. While the front desk staff apologized and tried to accommodate a switch to a room that did have the promised separate bedroom and living space, there were none available on our first night. This was a major issue for us, as we had specifically selected the Hard Rock NYC for this feature, since it was a special birthday trip for me, but we were bringing our teenage daughter. We needed the privacy separation, and we paid almost 3 thousand dollars for 2 nights for a room that was supposed to have this. We were able to switch rooms on the second night, but that brought with it a whole new set of problems. We were told our bags would be moved from our old room to our new room while we were out sightseeing. When we got back around 4pm, the new room was ready, but our bags were not there. We called down and waited 2 hours for our bags, at which point I had to call again, as we were going to be late for our broadway show. My husband even went day to the front desk to see if he could get the bags himself. We ended up having to attend the broadway show in our sightseeing clothes, rather than the outfits in our luggage specifically for the show. I was extremely disappointed in the overall experience. We have stayed at the Hard Rock in Orlando and the service was excellent. I understand it is a new hotel that is still working out kinks, but for the amount of money I spent on an upgraded room package, I wish we had just stayed at a Hilton for a quarter of the price as we initially planned.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel did nothing to apologize and did not give a crap that they caused us such distress for the biggest day of my running career. \n\nOtherwise, the rooms are drab and small, the service in the bar \/ restaurant is horrible and the food is terrible.

Excellent location and with it being so new it is still nice and clean. Surprised by all the positive reviews on the service. We stayed for 4 days and I don\u2019t think the doormen spoke to us once. Not overly bothered by it but it was noticeable. \n\nI think this hotel caters more for families rather than couples. A lot of pretty bright lights but not a great deal of substance for the price behind it. $45 \/ night residence fee on top of the bill was extremely bizarre and still unsure what it\u2019s for and how they get away with not advertising it. I read in another review that it\u2019s for use of the coffee machine (of which we had none), use of the gym (of which we never even saw) and access to the Wi-Fi (which in any other hotel in the world would be included in the stay!?) \n\nRooms are small but the bed was really comfy. Shower was lovely. RT60 was alright but nothing special. I can\u2019t comment on the food as when I ordered a club sandwich they couldn\u2019t do it as they had run out of chicken\u2026\u2026 at 4pm!\n\nI think if the hotel was classed as a 4 star hotel (which in my opinion it is) and priced accordingly I\u2019d be giving it a much better review.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We travelled from the UK and stayed here early December 2022 for 4 nights, had 2 kind rooms one on floor 9 and one on floor 10. \nJ.C checked us in - he was efficient, attentive, welcoming and even provided us with complimentary drinks tickets for the NYY Steak House - although we never got to use them!  There was also a staff member who I believe was from the luggage \/ concierge department whose name I didn\u2019t get but his favourite artist was 2Pac who we met a few times in the lift, again talkative, welcoming and helpful. Although, every staff member we came across was just as friendly - not something you often get in international hotels! \nThe hotel it self is gorgeous, stylish, but most of all spotless! Our room was no different and house keeping did a basic sweep through daily which we were very appreciative of. The amenities provided in the rooms were just what we needed and the rooms were a very good size for a city hotel. Beautifully decorated for the Christmas festivities!\nWe spent an evening in RT60 - great vibe, again great staff, and we had fun, although when we arrived it was full of middle aged very drunk people dancing and falling over each other and others, this was quickly dealt with by security. The DJ was fantastic and read the room well, the bar tenders were attentive - and drinks were great. Prices were as expected in a NYC rooftop bar.\nWe couldn\u2019t fit NYY steak house into our trip really. We did try to pop in at 10pm for a drink in the week but was turned away because they were just closing, which was fine, but the main hotel bar was also closing, both seemed quiet so it was understandable, so we went out elsewhere for a drink.\nThe coffee shop sells amazing pastries!!\n\nOverall a 10\/10 for service, the hotel itself and the general experience. We will definitely be back! Thank you!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Arrival was great, we were greeted and helped with our bags. We checked in fine and went to our room. Bags were delivered to us. Room was quite small but clean and well presented. Furnishings were lovely and the bed was very comfy. The air con is a nightmare. You switch it off and it just keeps coming on throughout the night and it\u2019s really loud. We had room service breakfast twice which was nice. We ate breakfast in the restaurant once and it took almost an hour for our food to come (French toast, eggs, 1 sausage and potatoes). The hotel breakfast is so expensive and really not worth it. Room service was great for a change but head out to eat. We went to the rooftop bar on the Saturday evening but it was full, so we left and made a reservation for the following evening. It was nice but the music is very loud so don\u2019t go here if you plan to have conversations with your companions. The staff across the hotel were really friendly and helpful so no complaints. Our room was cleaned daily and had fresh towels and toiletries which was great. We had to pay a \u201cservice charge\u201d of around \u20ac380 for the use of the gym, the coffee machine and the wifi which is crazy money. We didn\u2019t use the gym, we were barely in the room to use the wifi and the coffee should be complimentary. We\u2019d rather not have the machine and avoid the charge given for it. Overall, we rate it a 4* because for the price it cost us, we didn\u2019t get a service or experience to match. You\u2019re paying for the \u201chard rock\u201d experience but really it\u2019s just a bunch of memorabilia on the wall that you can see by going into the Hard Rock Cafe for dinner.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms seem new and well taken care of. \n\nHowever, we had an issue arise that was not handled well. On our 2nd night,  a fire alarm went off in our room around 1:30am. After waiting a few minutes and hearing nothing, my wife and I decided to get out of bed, get dressed and head down the 27 flights of stairs.  By the time we got out to the street and walked back into the lobby, the manager was telling us that we needed to go back upstairs and that we shouldn\u2019t have come down, and that it was just a faulty smoke head. Apparently he had made an announcement while we were coming down the stairs, but this couldn\u2019t be heard from the stairwell. We went back up to our room and got back in bed, only to have the alarm go off again 10 minutes later. We waited for an announcement, but got nothing. Eventually I went back downstairs to ask what was going on. A hotel employee told me that everything was fine, and that someone had pulled the alarm by mistake. This was a different story than I got the first time which was a bit disconcerting. But nonetheless I went back upstairs to bed. About 10 minutes later, the alarm went off again. Once again, there was no announcement to reassure us that everything was fine, leaving us wondering what to do.  I was finally able to call the front desk after multiple attempts, and they told us they were trying to get it turned off and that everything was fine. \n\nThis whole experience was very disruptive and poorly managed. I understand that alarms can go off, but this was not managed well to provide reassurance to guests of their safety. It resulted in us losing several hours of sleep that night, which was the night prior to the NYC marathon which was why we came to NYC for this trip.  \n\nTo make matters worse, around 8am the next morning, the alarm went off again for about 5 minutes. We again wondered what to do, and someone finally came on to say they were testing the system, but not until 10 minutes or so after the alarm went off. \n\nThis experience was very disappointing in what was otherwise a good experience at the hotel.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They asked me to call my bank- after 30 minutes on hold, my bank told me that there was no issue on my end, there had been no attempts to run the card and that the problem was the hotel\u2019s payment system. The hotel finally ran the card and insisted it wasn\u2019t their fault. I left for my flight over an hour late and they were unapologetic. Hotel facilities are clean and comfortable but I won\u2019t stay there again.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The shower curtain and controls, were also not what we were expecting from a 5* hotel. \n\nThe fire alarm went off for quite a while during the early hours on marathon day, the tannoy system told us to stay where we were whilst it was being investigated before eventually advising that it was a false alarm - it stopped before going off again!  Not ideal for the runners or spectators staying in the hotel, and made the Sunday a very long day indeed! \n\nOn the plus side, the hotel was very central (1-2 mins to Times Square)  the beds were comfortable and the A\/C was especially welcome! \n\nUnfortunately, the positives wouldn't persuade me to stay again, I'd opt instead for the Crown Plaza or Hilton Midtown (both 4*) which have slightly more generous rooms and facilities that equal (if not better) the HR Hotel - unfortunately they had no availability for the dates that we needed though. \n","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I particularly like the high standard of room finish, paired with the soundproofed rooms. Literally, you hear no noise from the bustling Times Square right outside, not any of the clubs or restaurants in the hotel. Even though it can get super loud outside the building, you will not hear a pin drop once in your room. \n\nThe hotel also has a great personality, with different memorabilia on each floor to check out. Even the elevators always have great music in them! I have never stayed in a hotel with such a high specification, particularly in terms of the bathroom. In my opinion, the rooms alone are beyond 5-star, and I would definitely return here.\n\nLook closely, and you\u2019ll see hints of music such as plectrums on the door latch and the shape of guitars in the bed linen. Those beds by the way are so comfortable you\u2019ll have one of the best sleeps of your life. \n\nAs the hotel is new, you are one of the first people to stay in the rooms and it shows. Each day, the rooms are cleaned to perfection with immaculate attention to detail. The hotel also provides some complimentary amenities including coffee and water which is a nice touch. \n\nWhen you leave the hotel, there are always taxis hanging about to get to the airport easily. Being right in Times Square, you will not struggle to find any amenities within a short walk. \n\nHowever, just a couple of points where some improvements may be needed. \n\nHalfway through my stay, I went out to get coffee only to return to find my room locked. It turned out my card hadn\u2019t been swiped at check-in so they locked my room on me in case of \u2018incidentals\u2019. This was a bit abrupt considering I\u2019d paid in full and this wasn\u2019t my mistake. It took some time to resolve the issue at reception. The first agent told me my \u2018check out time\u2019 was at 12pm - I told her I wasn\u2019t leaving for another two days. She then simply said she couldn\u2019t help me any further and that someone else needed to take over. A bit more customer service training is needed there I\u2019m afraid. I shouldn't be locked out of a room I've paid for.\n\nAlso, the hotel emails you several times prior to and during your stay. I am on holiday (vacation) I do not check my emails during this time, so that\u2019s kind of annoying if I\u2019m honest. I spend all my time checking emails when working, so I don\u2019t do this when I\u2019m supposed to be relaxing. \n\nFinally, the bar in the hotel, while lovely, is eye-wateringly expensive. My boyfriend was charged for a whiskey that was barely a few raindrops worth in a glass. We ran up a $$$ figure bar bill very quickly, so it\u2019s perhaps a place to try once but we wouldn\u2019t pay for that each night. \n\nOverall, a wonderful stay in terms of the building itself and location - there's just a few refinements needed purely on the customer service side.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Instead, they have a $25 menu that only includes 2 pastries, fruit, juice and tea. The price should be between $25 and $30 per person and the menu should include a buffet breakfast to let you realise you're genuinely on vacation.

The waitstaff at Seasions (breakfast) were helpful and eager to please. You never felt like any of the staff interactions were forced or fake. Coffee shop staff (so friendly)\u2026.

In one direction around 5 minutes away is Rockefeller centre and the other direction is a stones throw away from Times Square which both have a metro station next to it to get you to other locations around New York in no time.\n\nWe arrived and were warmly greeted by the staff in the downstairs lobby, who I must say greet you each and every time they spot you which is a nice touch and feels very accommodating. \n\nAt the Check in desk we were warmly greeted and offered a bottle of water from the fridge. \n\nThe ladies at check in were very pleasant however we did have a slight issue with our room that had being booked. It was pre-booked before the hotel had even opened its doors at the beginning of the year in late February but when we arrived on the day we were told that this room was not available and was currently being occupied. However after speaking to the staff they managed to upgrade us and made sure we had a similar room to the one that was booked.\n\nThe next day as an apology for the mix up a bottle of champagne was delivered to the room while we were out that was accompanied by an apology note provided by the front desk manager Amerissa P, which was not expected but very much appreciated.\n\nThe hotel itself is very modern and slick, we walked through the restaurant but didn\u2019t eat anything so couldn\u2019t comment on the food but from the looks it seemed nice. We did do the the RT60 bar at the top which was great and easily booked via the website. It did seem popular as we saw a few none guests and locals make their way to the bar during our stay so it seems word is getting out about it.\n\nThe check out was very smooth and we were asked if we had transportation arrangements if not they would get a taxi to pick us up which showed the standard and class of the service that had received while staying at the hotel.\n\nThe only negatives I would give the hotel is the elevators, there are only a few of them and you require them to both get to your room, check in\/ out desk and the restaurant\/ bar so at times it can take a while to get one as you can imagine there are quite a few floors. This being only a small detail I would still highly recommend the hotel.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We stayed in the superior king with a balcony which offered great views. It\u2019s important to note that while we were on the 19th floor, most balcony rooms are on the 5th floor unless you upgrade to a suite so keep in mind the street noise. The room was amazing and clean, everything is still basically brand new. The bathroom in this room is a bit small. The vanity and mirror are in the hallway while the bathroom itself has a toilet and stand up shower with two hooks on the wall. The shower is spacious with the rainfall shower head option. We did hear the people next to use slamming doors and drawers at 2am but I bring a noise maker which helped with some of that. The hotel is fun with all of the music memorabilia and decor around. I also felt it was reasonably priced especially for the location. The subways are very close and easy, you can walk up to Rockefeller Center and Fifth Ave for shopping. I stayed about a block away earlier this summer with friends at a different hotel for around the same price and got an older room with less amenities. They offer online check in so you don\u2019t have to wait in a line, you can just pick up your keys although there was no line by the time we arrived around 7p. Check out is easy as well, you can simply check out through text. You can also communicate with staff through text at any time also.

We stood on the ground level for 5 minutes waiting to check in (after a long 18 hours travelling) to finally be told that we need to go to Level 2 for check in. When we checked in, the lady was pleasant enough but quite cold, no information given regarding the hotel, how to use the lifts, what floor we were on, restaurant or shop info etc. We also weren\u2019t informed that a deposit was going to be charged to our card (which was fine, but we weren\u2019t told, so when we enquired about it as an additional \u00a3200 was taken from our bank, we were made to feel like we should already and the response was quite condescending  and patronising). \n\nThe room was nice, no complaints there.\n\nWe visited the lobby for a drink twice during our stay. The first time, a waitress was so incredibly helpful and approached us as soon as we sat down and took our drinks order. The second time, couldn\u2019t have been more different. Two younger girls, spent the 30 minutes were there talking, laughing at the food reservation stand, completely ignoring all guests. We ended up ordering our drink at the bar and left.\n\nThe reason we won\u2019t choose to stay again is the lack of customer service, and \u2018Hard Rock\u2019 spirit with the staff. Literally nobody spoke to us as we arrived, checked in, walked through the hotel multiple times daily - the staff seemed extremely uninterested and to be honest, inadequately trained, which gave the impression of being stuck up and unapproachable. The only staff member I can remember that did acknowledge us and help us arrange our airport transfer was Rob, aka Kanye West.\n\nWe travel from the UK to NYC regularly and have stayed at many different hotels and although the hotel was nice, I\u2019d rate it worse for customer service and won\u2019t visit again. The reason we stayed at the Hard Rock is because we stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in London often and love it!! The music, the staff, the food, the service - everything is incredible and is a quarter of the price per night.\n\nAt \u00a3400 a night, I\u2019d expect to be acknowledged as we walked around the hotel and the shop - the service was that poor in the hotel shop that we walked to the Hard Rock shop and restaurant in Times Square and spent $500 on food and gifts there instead of the hotel.\n\nJust a poor overall experience. We were so excited to stay as were big Hard Rock fans, but unfortunately it didn\u2019t deliver and as nice as the rooms were, it\u2019s definitely not enough to bring us back, especially when we have experienced better hotel customer service in other NYC hotels for much cheaper.\n\nI actually also emailed concierge weeks before arrival to try and arrange something for my husband in the room upon arrival (obviously willing to pay an additional fee for the service) and I was told there was nothing that could be offered except a bottle of wine. When I replied stating neither of us drink wine and if an alternative could be provided, I received no reply despite emailing a further time. Definitely didn\u2019t feel like our custom was appreciated. \n\n","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Bad elevators, tiny bathroom, and indifferent  management!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-09-03","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"First, this is not a 5 star hotel. It is a 2 star that happens to be new.  Would never stay here again and tell anyone to avoid.\nYou read that the room is small, and that doesn\u2019t bother me usually. But this room is not well designed. The bathroom is tiny, as in you can almost brush your teeth while you are on the toilet. And from the shower also. There  is no way to put the bath mat under the shower door. Water gets everywhere. And there is no room by the sink for toiletries. The satellite signal for the TV was intermittent. Would go out every minute or so. I despise the mirrored wall - who wants to look at themselves in an almost floor-to ceiling mirror while in bed. Not me. The air conditioning worked decently at least. Every few minutes I would hear a loud noise from the window that was either door slamming  above me or some knocking sound. It would startle me, and I\u2019m a sound sleeper usually. The lighting system is confusing - as is how to operate the shower. Not labeled well, but once figured out they do work.  They should offer someone to show you to the room and explain those. But probably why they don\u2019t do that is because of the terrible elevators. They require a room key, which I appreciate. But you have to let the doors close before you swipe the key and then the reader didn\u2019t always work.  I cannot tell you how many times people missed their floors because of it. And at times the elevator waits were long. One elevator was different than others and had rear access. We couldn\u2019t figure that one out at all\u2026and someone from housekeeping had to show us how to use the R side. And then to top all of this off one the hotel has RT60, a rooftop bar, which is one of the reasons I booked. The first night we had access on the room elevator to 34th floor and just checked out the space. No one there greeted- would have ordered a drink but no server approached.  It was loud and kind of late so just went back to room. Then, after getting back from show, wanted a nightcap. Made a reservation on Open Table for 11PM to make sure would have a spot. Could not get elevator to work. A gentleman and I got off thinking maybe it was just that one, but no. Would let me go to 36th floor but not 34th. Called the number on reservation and someone at hotel answered. Said had to go down to first floor before being let up. Had no idea. Well as luck would have it, when I was heading down from 36th floor, someone was getting on from 34th floor. So I got off and tried to go to bar area. And right away the guy says you don\u2019t have a stamp- you have to go downstairs. At this point had had enough. Went down to 2nd floor to complain to front desk manager. She really was indifferent, even though my first  comment was I would never want to stay here again. I only told her about the elevator and RT60 situation, and she explained that on Saturdays they have different rules in place for RT60. And I said someone should explain that on check in.  She said yeah maybe so. \nAs much money as I paid for this room I am completely and utterly dismayed at this hotel. It is indeed new. But that\u2019s it. It\u2019s in a good location. But so are a lot of other better hotels certainly with nicer management.  Do not splurge on this hotel like I did or you\u2019ll regret it.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The cocktails were refreshing and well balanced. Grab a snack here if you're hungry before dinner. Grab breakfast at Sessions before checking out! \n\nService\nOverall service was great. I wanted to highlight Kyle from Sessions and Audra from RT60! Kyle's service was friendly and professional. I appreciate how he took the time to get to know us. Audra is a top-notch bartender! She made the perfect espresso martini for me.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Some of the best steaks I've ever had.\n\nService: Miguel and Adi were always helpful whenever I was looking for a cab\/waiting for my uber and went the extra mile to help me with my luggage. \n\nFrom office: Lorenzo, Ryan (concierge for helping me book the rooftop bar), and everyone from the front office were super helpful as well. (I forgot other names but everyone made sure I had an amazing experience)\n\nFacilities: The gym was really nice and new and I had a great time working out there.\n\nDefinitely a great hotel and will become one of my go-to hotels whenever I'm in the city. I'm sure I've missed a lot of names but I love how every staff is super positive and passionate about ensuring guests feel at home.\n\nBest,\nGuest of room 2803","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23627300,"title":"Objective review of the Hard Rock Hotel NYC","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-08-15","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We are ex-New Yorkers who visit the city once a year.  This time we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel.  In the past we have stayed at the Grand Hyatt next to Grand Central Station (when it was called the Grand Hyatt) and the Marriot Marquis on Times Square itself.  We arrived at the Hard Rock on Thursday and stayed till Monday morning.  Valet parking was convenient and easy, albeit expensive. We booked the Superior King room, one level up from the classic King.  We paid almost $400\/day. The Property looks great.  The room was flawless, after all this is a newly opened hotel.  The service was excellent.  Every person at the hotel was friendly and helpful.  The room was small. As we didn\u2019t know what we were going to wear, me and my wife brought 2 large suitcases (30 inches a piece). There were only 2 usable draws for clothes, each measuring about 18\u201d x 18\u201d x 7\u201d, and that\u2019s being generous. All measurements are estimates. The top drawer of the dresser is a safe. There is an 18 x 18 x 2-inch drawer next to the sink. My wife used it for makeup and other things.  We had to hang a lot of our clothes on hangars. There was no place to store the suitcases out of sight.  The bellhop offered to store the suitcases somewhere but we kept the spare clothes in our suitcases so we kept the suitcases in our room against the wall on each side of the large TV. The front desk offered to bring up a clothes rack, but there is really no room to put it.  It would just increase the clutter. \nThe bed was comfortable.  The shower was great.  The shower and toilet are behind a sliding door that doesn\u2019t lock but also has a 1 to 2 mm of open space when the door is closed; so, the sliding door does not close completely.  This is not a malfunction.  This is how the door was designed.  The sink and closet are opposite the bathroom.  The drawers are in the closet as is a full-size mirror on the closet door.  There is another sliding door that separates the sleeping area from the sink, closet, and the toilet\/shower room. The air conditioning was tentative.  It was in the 90s F with heavy humidity during our stay.  To save on energy the AC automatically is reduced when there is no one in the room.  It struggled to catch up after we got into the room.  We reported the AC issues to the front desk.  Someone came immediately (The hotel is very helpful), but the engineer couldn\u2019t override the system. We tolerated it.  I imagine that management (and our children) would comment that the energy saving aspect of the air conditioning was in the best interests of the planet.  On our last day, the AC seemed to work better, but the temperature had dropped into the low 80s.\n Our room was on the 8th floor facing south on to 48th street. We have a window facing what looks like a new apartment building whose interior is still under construction.  We could partially see the lights and signs of Times Square.   But the primary view out our window was one of hundreds of unfinished unoccupied apartments. There is a pull-down blackout screen that effectively blocked out all light.\n The fridge is really just a cooler with one 12 x 12 inch shelf (about 10 inches high)  It does not have a freezer.   Not sure if the King deluxe (one level up from what we had), comes with a larger fridge.  \nSession\u2019s restaurant was adequate.  The service, was excellent.   Our room came with a $90 credit towards breakfast.  Breakfast was expensive. We went over 90$ every morning by $16 to 30$, and that\u2019s just for the 2 of us.  There is a 18% service charge and that does not include gratuities.  The gratuity is against the $106 breakfast, not the $16 that we paid over our $90 allotment.   We did not go to the Hotels premier restaurant. The Rooftop bar was dramatic.  Our room included 2 free cocktails. The views are terrific.  We visited the work out area but did not use.  It is well equipped.  There is no pool.\nThe location of the hotel is great.  The shows were 1 to 3 blocks away. Times square is a half a block away. Central Park is walking distance.  Rockefeller center is 2 blocks away.  \nWe always do a lot of walking when we visit.  We walked to the South Street Seaport (5 miles).  But subways, Uber, Taxis, human powered carriages, bicycles are easy to get.  We also visited The Aquarium at Coney Island which was 35 minutes away by Uber. (over an hour using the subway).  If we stay here again, we will try to get a bigger room.  The rooms at the Marriot Marquis are bigger with more storage for less money.  We found the service at The Hard Rock was its strong suit.  The service was better than the other 2 hotels we have stayed at in New York City.  That counts for a lot. \nI spoke with someone at the Hotel on our last day about the shortage of drawer space.  The person said that the Hotel was designed for people who were going to stay briefly to visit Times Square and who, not in these words, were traveling light.  This person said that none of the upgraded rooms, although providing more living space, provided more storage space. \nDespite all that is mentioned above, we had a great time.  We were made to feel welcome.  Not sure if we will stay here again, but if we do we will take less stuff with us.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Even though small size is fairly standard in NYC; the lack of wall hooks, shelves and such, made the absence of storage space even more noticeable.  I also didn't like the fact you can't turn individual lights on or off at will, and can instead only pick among a handful of room \"presets\".\n\nAt check-in, I was clearly told my credit card deposit would have been fully refunded in the absence of damage to the room. At check-out, it was confirmed to me that there was no additional charge. Only upon my return home, I realised my card was actually charged $200+.

We were on a tight budget, as we were travelling for a month. I couldn't justify the room rate but then spotted a deal on one of the booking sites, which with a bit of a stretch made it affordable. I usually book directly with hotels rather than use booking sites so I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nWe arrived in New York at 8am on a red eye from Las Vegas. We were exhausted and the heat in New York this week was almost unbearable. Although check-in wasn't until the afternoon, we were able to leave our bags with the valet.\n\nAfter breakfast we wandered around for a while but we were just too hot and too tired to enjoy ourselves. I decided to return to the hotel and see if we could have an early check-in. I spoke with Brittany at the front desk who explained that while it wasn't yet time for guests to check out and there were few rooms of the type we had requested, she would do her absolute best. True to her word, as soon as a room became available she allocated it to us.\n\nLater that day the hotel sent us a beautiful bottle of prosecco, some cakes and a handwritten card as I had mentioned we were celebrating both a wedding anniversary and 18th birthday.\n\nThe hotel is very very stylish and cool. The rooms were a decent size for New York. It was spotlessly clean.\n\nStaff were friendly but unobtrusive. For example when we declined housekeeping, the staff member asked if we would like any clean towels or more coffee. Security was evident at the entrance, yet we never felt uncomfortable as we were always greeted with a 'have a nice day' or 'welcome back'\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this hotel enough.

This place far surpasses many of the high-end hotels in Times Square. Upon arrival, we were met by a pleasant gentleman named Miguel who grabbed our bags and escorted us to the second-floor lobby. In the beautiful lobby\/lounge we were met by 3 pleasant concierges who asked us what music we were into and what we would like to hear in our room. There was a quick check-in process and then escorted to our room again by Miguel who asked if we needed anything which he got and took to our room and we went to find lunch.\n\nThe room was small but it was beautiful. You could see they put a lot of thought into the elegance of each room. The restaurant\/lobby bar was another beautiful area with great food and drinks. We got the breakfast package which included daily eats which were amazing, especially the french toast. We didn't make it to the gym, but we did head up to the rooftop lounge, again another beautiful area with great music and drinks. The staff and security at the rooftop and second-floor lounge were always pleasant. Upon check out, we were met by Miguel who offered to upgrade our transportation back to the airport when he saw our crappy Uber pull up. The woman(executive) in the Youtube video at this location seems to be very passionate about creating a space of elegance for the hotel patrons and she far surpassed that idea. Hard Rock may want to send her to HR Punta Cana to whip that place in shape because they need it. Thank Miguel and the team at Hard Rock Times Square.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
