Perhaps this list will be helpful for you:\n\nThe pros:\n\n- we love this upper west side location\n- the common areas and the room were clean and modern\n- the staff was friendly and helpful\n-the bathroom was very nice\n- there are fabulous drinks and free fries for happy hour in the cozy lobby\n\nThe cons:\n- while the room is stylish, it is missing some things that would make it more comfortable like a luggage rack and storage. The bathroom had one hook and no towel racks. Maybe a larger room would be a better experience?  \n- I worked from our room for several days and there was very noisy construction outside all day long. Of you plan to be gone all day, this will not bother you, but if you are going to be in your room during the day, at least is spring of 2024, the rooms away from the street are very noisy.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We chose a double queen suite for the three of us. \n\nThe area was good with two subway stations nearby 72nd Street and 79th Street - these take you downtown very quickly and it\u2019s easy to get connections to go further afield. There\u2019s a cafe on the corner of the street where we got really good pastries and coffees for breakfast each morning. There are quite a few restaurants, cafes and shops nearby. \n\nWhen we arrived we received a warm welcome and were quickly checked in, our room was very nice and spotlessly clean. Great first impression! \n\nBeds were comfortable and bedding good quality, although I prefer a duvet cover rather than the bottom and top sheet configuration that tends to be used in the USA. There were two big drawers and a hanging rail as well as several other small drawers next to the bed and in the dressing table. \n\nThe bathroom was spacious by NYC standards with a good shower (rain head and wall mounted shower head). \n\nThe living area was very comfortable with a large sofa with chaise long section big enough to be a third bed!  Huge T.V.  under which is a big unit with lots of storage which also serves as a desk with a desk chair.  We ate our breakfast here most days and takeout one afternoon.  There are no plates or cutlery so make sure you bring\/buy some if you\u2019re planning to eat in the room. \n\nThe wet bar area has a sink, fridge, kettle, coffee machine and complimentary hospitality drawer. \n\nThe wardrobe is at the entrance to the room (in the living area) and is spacious and houses an iron, bathrobes, slippers, hairdryer (not very powerful compared to UK ones!) and umbrella. There were plenty of hangers and a floor to ceiling shelved section. \n\nThere are panels with buttons controlling the lights and blinds with a \u2018privacy\u2019 and \u2018service\u2019 setting which was handy. \n\nIf I was being really picky, there are a couple of things which would make it absolutely perfect, some hooks for coats in the living area somewhere and a heated towel rail in the bathroom.  Also, housekeeping was a little bit bit and miss, the hospitality drawer wasn\u2019t always topped up and I noticed the counter top wasn\u2019t wiped a couple of days, but overall the room was very clean and housekeeping more than happy to provide what you needed very quickly when called. \n\nWe unfortunately had some\nVery noisy people above our room, we probably could have moved rooms if we\u2019d asked but I didn\u2019t want to pack everything up again so we stayed put, it didn\u2019t interfere too much. \n\nThere are no other services available in the hotel, it\u2019s really just a serviced room. The Wallace Lounge is run separately and is only open in the evening. We ate there one night and the food was very nice. It\u2019s a shame this area couldn\u2019t be used to provide drinks and snacks in the day too as it\u2019s a very comfortable area to sit.  Even just providing tea\/coffee and drinks would have been nice.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My husband then came down and spoke to the same front desk lady ( Melvita) who was  also rude to him. My husband then asked for the front desk manager.\n\nMr. Justin Cordero then came to the front desk, he is the rudest man I have ever met in any hotel, take into account we spend our life traveling, and always stay at high end hotels. He proceeded to tell my husband that he has known the front desk lady for 20 years ( Melvita) and said that what my husband told him did not collaborate with what his front desk lady had told him. In other words he believed her. I am not sure what she told him as all I asked for was that the room be made up. \n\nHis tone was obnoxious, opinionated, rude and could not care, he was one of the worst front desk managers I have met in decades of traveling and his front desk colleague ( Melvita) who had the same attitude told my husband she will be rude to my husband despite the fact that it was in front of her manager after my husband told her how rude she was. \n\nWe will NOT be returning nor would I recommend anyone to stay at this hotel and if you have plans to stay at a New York hotel in the same price range, I know you will find a hotel without Mr. Cordaro or his front desk assistant Melvita\u2019s attitude and rudeness. \n\nMr Cordaro and Melvita  do not belong at the Wallace Hotel, as they are a let down to the rest of the excellent staff. Addressing a simple \u201ccan housekeeping\u201d please make up our room and addressing this request so rudely as they both did in front of other staff members does not set an example to the rest of the wonderful team.\n\nIf the general manager happens to read this review I would more than welcome to communicate  as to what transpired.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The washroom was very spacious and despite the fact that we were on a bust street of UWS we slept very well. We would definitely stay here on our next visit. The only con was that the hotel didnt have a restaurant onsite (which we knew while we were booking). But we reached very late in the night after an 18hr flight.

During certain periods while we were in the room, including late into the night, we could hear the constant sound of doors opening and closing loudly. It was frustrating and confusing because we couldn\u2019t understand why someone would need to go in and out of their room so often and especially through the night. It was unclear whether it was caused by one unusual guest (and maybe other guests were hearing it and going out to look in the hall causing even more door noises) or whether we were in a position where we could somehow hear every door in the vicinity.

We booked a suite which gave us plenty of space. The hotel is just two years old. It is in a solid older building that has been thoroughly renovated - everything is fresh and up-to-date. With only around ten (?) rooms on each floor, we almost never heard the voices of other guests in the hallway or adjacent rooms. Our room faced the quiet side street. Though we could hear some muted traffic noise from further away, it was barely noticeable and never loud enough to disturb sleep. The staff was friendly, helpful, and competent. We appreciated that there was both a coffee maker and a kettle for heating water for tea in the room. Large windows provided plenty of daylight, and the blackout shades controlled by switches on the wall were helpful.\n\nWe loved the UWS location!! There is an abundance of interesting restaurants within a few blocks, and there is a grocery store just a block away. It\u2019s not super-close to any of the major attractions (other than the Museum of Natural History and Lincoln Center), but it\u2019s an easy walk (or bus ride) through Central Park to the Met Museum and a slightly longer walk to Midtown. At times we used the subway or bus to get to Midtown and more distant places. There are subway and bus stops near the hotel.\n\nThe downside of this hotel for me personally was the bed. Even though I am not a large person, I need a firm, supportive mattress, and the mattress was too soft to be comfortable for me. However, the sofa in the living room was firm and perfect for me. I asked for extra bedding for it, and I slept there comfortably for the rest of our stay. The person at the front desk said I was the first person they had heard complain about the beds, so they are probably fine for most people. I'm mentioning it because there are probably other people like me who have to be careful about mattress comfort when selecting a hotel. My husband was ok with the mattress, but he said it wasn\u2019t as comfortable as he would normally expect in a hotel in this price range. \n\nOther, more minor drawbacks: flimsy plastic cups and paper cups for coffee\/tea, quality of the linens was good but not great, no restaurant on the premises (not a problem unless the weather is really bad - there are many options nearby). \n\nThis hotel has many positives! Considering the price we paid, we expected higher quality on a few of the things I mentioned. But this is Manhattan, where hotels are very expensive, and we had a large suite with many nice features. So, overall, it\u2019s probably not a bad value. If the beds were more comfortable for me, I would stay here again for sure!","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was our third stop in this trip, and we stayed at a Kimpton near Chelsea and at a Sonesta in D.C. and both experiences were far superior. They have the same star level at the Wallace but inferior guest ratings, so logically we were expecting outstanding here, maybe that\u2019s why it felt so short. The room we were at had no acoustic isolation, even light from the corridor got into the room at night. The pillows are fantastic, the bed itself is fine, but the blackout shades are a disgrace, as a lot of light passes on the bottom of it. The third party we booked from said we would have a bath\/shower combo and we were given a room for special needs, only a curtain in the shower so it was annoying to have water seeping through the floor. Staff was fine in general. The lounge was closed off to guests due to private events in 3 of the nights we were there, and it\u2019s open to the public so it gets pretty packed. If you like to be able to just walk in the hotel bar or restaurant after a long day, choose a different hotel. Another point, and this one made me wonder if it was cultural prejudice or discrimination, is that I specifically said that I was going to pay in cash for further charges at check out.  We prepaid for the room. They tried to charge my card for restaurant fees two nights before check out, but since I keep it blocked for safety reasons it didn\u2019t do through. In the morning, as we were going out to enjoy the last day on the city, I questioned the front desk and said I was going to pay cash, and the receptionist said that we could go ahead and pay at that moment. We had to go back to the room to take more cash. Whether it is hotel procedure or not, it left a very bad feeling. So all in all, is not a bad hotel, but when coming back to the city I would never stay here again.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were able to park on the street right out front. A bellman met us when we pulled up, we got a lovely greeting at the front desk, and we were very pleasantly surprised by our light, bright, quiet, spacious and very comfortable queen one-bedroom suite. The decor is a tad generic for me but it was quite nice nonetheless. Everything was new and fresh. The bedroom was in the back and was wonderfully quiet. We requested a high floor and got it. There was a nespresso machine, an electric kettle for tea, a mini fridge, and a microwave. \n\nThis hotel keeps it pretty simple-no restaurant, room service, valet parking-but honestly I think they fill a much needed niche for smart, friendly, well-run small to medium sized hotels in great locations. With the wonderful markets and food options nearby, we were actually happy to bypass yet another hotel breakfast and instead buy some delicious treats and cappuccinos for the room.\n\n We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better stay.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is like new but they kept a historic feel. First, the location is about as perfect as you can get. Central Park a very few blocks - Lincoln Center a little further but we walked there also, subway stop 3 blocks, Natural History Museum 3-4 block walk, Zabars (we nearly lived there) 3-4 blocks so - 100 out of 100 on location.\nRoom was also near perfect. We got the smallest suite they had and it was huge - had seating area, small refrigerator, counter top with eating area. They bring microwave on request. We asked for a quiet room and were on the 11th floor with a great view. They have small appreciated touches - free spring water in bottles, books on NYC in bookshelves, umbrella in the room, great housekeeping staff ( shout out to Verone - real nice), and front desk and engineer super friendly. It might be useful to get bellman to show you around the room when u arrive - sophisticated lighting system takes a minute to get comfortable with, buttons raise and lower shades, shower great but again a little tricky to learn, - all in all a great experience. The price? high. Not as high as many others but we felt we got our money\u2019s worth. The only thing I could think to improve - There is an evening bar off the lobby. It\u2019s overpriced and has a piano but when I stopped in there was canned music. The hotel apparently contracts it out - other hotels in the area have small bakeries or nice restaurants off the lobby - Would have been great to go downstairs snd find a great breakfast place. But Zabars is but a short walk and is a fun place to grab to-go food. We will def return to the Wallace.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hotel is supposedly a 5 star hotel.  I travel regularly.  I have NEVER been to a 5 star hotel that only has plastic glasses.  Spend the money to provide real glasses for water and also for coffee.  There IS a bar in the building.  Pay them to clean the glasses OR install a dishwasher in the building to clean glasses.  There is just no excuse for this.  You do NOT need a restaurant to be able to clean glasses.  We were constantly told that because you did not have a restaurant that you did not supply real glasses and coffee cups.  We were repeatedly told they only had plastic glasses.  We screamed and screamed until some real glass water glasses were found.  \n2. This hotel has no clear COVID policy in place about what the hotel will and will not do if a guest has COVID.  We checked out early because we were told that the hotel would not clean the room until we checked out even though scientific evidence shows with proper face mask that staff can not get covid from the sheets and linen.\n3. First day (before COVID) ask that bathroom floor be mopped and cleaned well (as it was very dirty).  Room was serviced but floor not cleaned.

I loved that the rooms were new and clean (no carpet!). It's also the nicest hotel close to Columbia. But there were a few things that made the stay less pleasant. One is that the walls are thin. I could hear the adjacent rooms very clearly. They also are understaffed: there's no room service, they don't help you with your bags or show you the room, and if you order Uber Eats, the doorman won't bring it up to you. To me these are the things that separate nice hotels from luxury hotels. \n\nSecond was a 2:30AM fire alarm that went off 3 times (most of us only left our rooms the first two times then ignored it the third time around 3:30). In the morning, I expected them to acknowledge the situation but it was like nothing happened but after talking to the front door man it turns out maybe one of the workers was smoking in the basement. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but the fact that we didn't get an apology letter... or even free coffee in the AM as a gesture that this unfortunately happened on a Sunday night before the first day of school. It then had me thinking about fire safety in the building. My room was on a high floor in the back, and there was no fire escape.

My husband, son and I had stayed here once before and loved it! We've been looking for a nice quality hotel on the Upper West Side since leaving as residents in 2014, so we've been thrilled to call The Wallace home whenever we come back to visit NYC. \n\nDuring this trip, we met my parents for a long weekend. As expected, The Wallace's impeccable customer service and high-end hotel was as we remembered it. We love the location as it is a short distance from the 1 train as well as Central park. The rooms are always super clean and luxurious -- we rented a one-bedroom Queen room and it's always more than enough room for our family of 3. \n\nSince we drive up to NYC anytime we visit, parking is always the biggest challenge for us. We don't usually pay for one of the garages, but have been lucky to find a spot on the street after searching for a little while. \n\nThis time, we brought our dog up too -- he's about 12 pounds and anything bigger would have felt a little cramped in the hotel room.

Our suite was lovely, clean, and spacious, and we would stay here again. The only reason I gave a rating of 4 rather than 5 was that the check-in experience was pretty miserable. \n\nCheck-in time is at 3pm, and we arrived to check in at 3:05. Our room wasn't ready but since we were told it would be ready in 10 minutes, so we decided just to wait in the lobby. After waiting quietly for 45 minutes, I asked for an update and was told that I needed to \"Try being patient.\" The room was finally ready at 4pm, with no apologies from the front desk staff for making us wait an hour with no updates. I fully understand that sometimes rooms aren't ready at check-in time, and had we been treated with respect and understanding, I still would have given the Wallace a rating of 5. But after waiting quietly for 45 minutes when we had been told it would be 10, I was shocked that I was scolded for not being patient enough.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"NONE"}

There is no on-site dining, but there are plenty of restaurant options within walking distance. A quirky bonus for me was that there was a Starbucks across the street for my morning cup of Joe.

The rooms were well appointed, the staff was incredibly friendly, and we liked the location (away from the hustle and bustle, near Central Park and museums). \n\nThe only disappointment was the room size. We had a two queen room, and it was uncomfortably small for a family of four. Another couple we were traveling with were upgraded to a larger room by the staff at no cost, and had we had the same experience, our stay would have been ideal, but unfortunately the cramped space made it difficult to unwind because we had to use every square inch of space just to unpack. I realize hotel rooms are not always spacious in NY (we\u2019ve visited several times), but this room for four was simply too small to be comfortable in. It felt like we were on top of each other at all times we were in the room and it made what would have been a five-star experience a four-star experience.\n\nI can\u2019t say enough about how wonderful the staff was, though. Every one was friendly, helpful, and provided a personal touch. Truly great. \n\nOverall, the hotel is great. Just make sure you get a big enough room to be able to fully enjoy how nice the hotel is.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very nice and new rooms. Good beds! We both have bad backs - we are super picky on this. Nice bathrooms that are also large by NYC standards. We have stayed in the king 1 bedroom (my favorite), the king suite, the queen 1 bedroom and the queen suite. They are all good. I even stayed in a basic room last time when there alone and it was perfectly nice. Love that they have a nespresso machine (I bring some of my own pods) and a small fridge that actually works. The location can not be beat. Right on the 1-2-3 line, next door to Citarella and Fairway, and tons of restaurants over on Amsterdam. I think they are now opening a small bar in the lobby.

Close to my departure date, I invited a lifelong friend with the same milestone birthday (we were born three weeks apart in the same town)  to join me for four of the nights.. I was extremely pleased with the lodging. The spacious, modern, 4th-floor room offered a really comfortable bed, plenty of storage space, a good-size safe, big-screen TV, quick and reliable wi-fi, a small refrigerator, two free bottles of water daily, a Nespresso machine and bath robes and slippers. The one small drawback to the bathroom for us was that it lacked the space we needed to conveniently place personal items and had no hooks to hang clothing items when enjoying the huge walk-in shower. Housekeeping kept the room immaculate. We experienced no noise issues whatsoever.\n\nThe staff was beyond gracious, from the doormen to those, who worked at the main desk, to Housekeeping employees. Everyone proved to be genuinely friendly and helpful, beyond what would be expected. Kudos to those responsible for  hiring. In communicating with the hotel before arrival, I mentioned our joint birthday celebration, and a bottle of wine greeted us when we entered the room. It was totally unexpected and a really nice touch. \n\nThe lobby, complete with fireplace, is charming and a pleasant place to sit. A bar is just being completed off the lobby and should be a welcome addition. There is no restaurant but plenty of cafes, grocery stores and restaurants exist in the neighborhood. Before coming, I asked the hotel about recommended places to eat closeby and immediately received two pages of suggestions, broken down into types of cuisine. \n\nWe made a reservation the first night at the nearby well-reviewed Sushi Yasaka, which I can highly recommend for those, who enjoy Japanese fare. It is a small restaurant, with tables spaced closely together. We also enjoyed Red Farm, a Chinese restaurant about a 1-minute walk from the hotel; and I had a lovely solo dinner at Elea (Greek cuisine), also within walking distance.\n\nThe Wallace sits in a pleasant, fairly quiet area, I found it easy to walk to such destinations as Central Park, the Guggenheim,  the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Lincoln Center. Two subway stations (72nd Street and 79th Street) provide easy access to other parts of the city.\n\nThroughout the years, I have often visited NYC and stayed in many different hotels. The Wallace is now my No. 1 choice, and I look forward to returning.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":121987,"title":"Excellent","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-12-31","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I agree with the other reviewers- this is a great small hotel.\nPositives:\nquiet, side street location\nquiet interior space- no noise heard from other rooms or the street below\nstylish and comfortable interiors\nexcellent comfortable mattress and nice bedding. The sheets are all cotton sateen and the pillows are a blend of synthetic fiberfill and feathers- apparently the duvet has the same composition.\nWe've stayed in a suite several times but I've also seen their lowest price single Q room and it was also very nice.\nOutstanding housekeeping service- I even had a maid try to put slippers on my feet LOL! Be sure to always leave a good tip for the housekeepers as they are the hardest working staff members at any hotel.\n\nWeak points:\nSome decent coffee needs to be available either in the room or in the lobby. The in-room Nespresso \"original\" pods are just dreadful and undrinkable. We even bought some half and half but it didn't help. The fake  \"creamer\" is also gross.\nI like that the lobby\/lounge sitting area is quiet and don't care about having a bar in the evening in that space. However, the hotel should consider one of two things:\npurchase an espresso machine for the lobby or hire a vendor to come in and make espresso drinks for purchase in the morning in the bar area.\nThe Kabuki hotel in San Francisco has an ideal set-up for a smallish boutique hotel and is a model The Wallace should try to emulate: A free, large self serve, automated at- the-touch of a button and easy to operate espresso machine with about 10 options incl hot and cold \nmilk. Along with 4 simple breakfast options: prepared off site by a vendor and brought fresh each morning to the hotel for purchase: a sweet pastry, meat and egg sandwich, tofu wrap for vegetarians and granola\/yoghurt bowl. A few pieces of fresh fruit - it doesn't need to be elaborate or extensive.\n\nYes, there is a P Quotidian across the street and I'm lucky to have a spouse who doesn't mind going out to fetch coffee but esp for single females who don't want to get dressed and made up to go out- the Wallace needs some in-house options. The PQ bakery has good coffee but we had a stale brioche one morning at this location so I can't give it a great review. There are also two nice French bakeries close by for croissants and coffee.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed in a B&B in Chelsea for years --- bought out this year by developers. This little place was our home away from home and was sad to see it go. Great location and the staff always made you feel like home. It was great.\n\nLife brings change, so we tried The Wallace. And sometimes in life you rekindle a special feeling quicker than you think. The Wallace is a special place.\n\nLike any excellent hotel, the rooms are very well appointed with great technology for lighting and blinds. The rooms and bathrooms are immaculate. The location is outstanding   a few block to either the 79th or 72 subway stop. Around the corner are two great coffee\/breakfast stops --- Viand Cafe and Mille-feullie (OMG Macarons).\n\nThe area of the hotel is out of this world. great -- quiet and nice with a short subway\/cab ride to many of the great locations in NYC. \n\nAgain you can find this in other hotels; so why the special part? The people. I think most of us in our professional or family life have learned over the last two years how special, special people are. It is a rare commodity.\n\nThe staff at The Wallace are just great and very special. With the storm that arrived in the northwest, they really helped us and others out with great ease and always made you feel at home. You can see they take great pride in their profession and their hotel. You feel the moment you walk in and more so by the time you leave.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Nakia and Angel who really were wonderful and the epitamy of professionals in the hotel industry. Thanks again for making our stay great.\n\nSo the Wallace becomes our new home in NYC ... see you next December 2023 and look forward to drinks and conversation at the new bar\/cafe area coming to the hotel. \n\n","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a suite on the 8th floor which had everything one could think of \u2026 plenty of cupboard space, a beautiful bathroom, two TV\u2019s , 2 King size beds, an unobtrusive sink and fridge area section ( in the lounge area). \nEverything worked at the push of a button- all the lights, the blackout blinds etc etc. Pristine. \nThe staff were super friendly and helpful. Although, being new, there is currently no food available on the premises it was no problem for the staff to bring a couple of wine glasses and plates for the one evening we were too tired to go out (bought some salad etc at the little fresh supermarket round the corner on the way back). There are also plenty of restaurants for breakfast lunch and dinner in the close vicinity so it suited us for that to be the situation. \nThe hotel\u2019s lounge and warm fireplace is also lovely to sit and relax after a long day seeing New York.\nI can highly recommend this little gem.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms and public areas are clean and well-appointed. Our room was one of the smaller ones, but still reasonable in size for NYC. Others have commented on the lobby fireplace. It is a great space, especially when it is frigid cold outside (which was the case when we visited). This was our first stay in the Upper West Side. Advantages: easy in and out from the city if traveling from the west; lots of restaurants and bakeries; relatively close to Central Park. Disadvantages: about a mile from the \"action\" in Midtown beginning at Central Park South, including more high-end restaurants, stores, and theaters. A major drawback of the hotel is that there is no food or beverage service. A cocktail lounge has been promised for months, but none was open when we stayed. It would be nice to have the option of breakfast in the hotel. Some have commented regarding a super-friendly staff. Perhaps we didn't have a chance to interact with them much, as we only stayed one night. Our impression was courteous and efficient, but nothing out of the ordinary for a fairly high-end hotel where you expect courteous and efficient. Overall, would consider staying again, especially in better weather when we could truly explore the neighborhood.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

They claimed they had contacted Magellan and  received no response. They were not helpful despite my having a written confirmed reservation for 3 nights. Since it was Fashion Week the Wallace only had a room for one night and said they were full for the rest of the stay. I could not reach Magellan and was forced to find another and more expensive hotel for the next two nights of my stay. As I was there for important business meetings, this was especially stressful. The next morning I asked the Wallace if they were still full and they said yes. No one seemed at all concerned about my situation and they insisted it was Magellan 's fault. When I asked Magellan for help they told me they investigated and determined it was the Wallace 's fault. Supposedly the Wallace despite admitting fault to Magellan would do nothing to compensate me for the costs I had to incur for this fiasco. And Magellan, despite being my agent and claiming to provide \"gold star service\", would not compensate me. So much for \"gold star service\". I won't be staying here again. Confirmations mean nothing.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It has been some time since I\u2019ve written a review, but I feel compelled after such a good 6-night stay here to write something.\n\nFirst off, before even arriving, we had excellent communication from the hotel. All my questions were answered in detail and with a great response time.\n\nAs regular NYC visitors, this was our first time basing ourselves in the UWS. I\u2019m so glad we did. There were great restaurants nearby, and of course the fabulous Beacon Theatre, where we caught a concert.\n\nThe hotel is so chic and sophisticated. But the ambiance is most definitely very warm and friendly. On arrival I was welcomed by Justin and Steven and it was a pure pleasure. I was accommodated with an early check in and we had also received a super upgrade which was just fantastic. The room was very elegantly appointed. I loved the fridge, secret ironing board storage and the drawer safe. Plenty of hangers and a lovely fresh bathroom with a good shower.\n\nThe hotel is new and gorgeous. Not quite like anything we\u2019ve experienced in NYC before. Our accommodation was bright, spacious and felt very homely\u2026 \n\nThe aroma in the lobby area was amazing. I loved entering there. That whole space will be even nicer once the hotel bar opens, as it will create more of an atmosphere.\n\nStaff wise, I found everyone to be extremely friendly. Most I can\u2019t name, but the door people, reception staff, housekeeping\u2026 all greeted us with warmth. We also bumped into the GM Mr. Freeman one day and he too was friendly and engaging. Very rare to even bump into a GM on the \u201cfloor\u201d of a hotel these days.\n\nAbsolutely will be making The Wallace our go to for future NYC visits. \n\nThank you Justin particularly for all your assistance and attention.\n\nIf I had to be constructive in my criticism, which I guess makes for a well-rounded review, I would have two pieces of feedback:\n\n1. The elevators are slow and can take some time\n\n2. There was no glassware in the room. My husband had bought a lovey bottle of wine for our anniversary and it was a shame to have to drink that out of plastic cups. However, I imagine this will be fixed once the bar is up and running and the hotel has glassware stocked.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a queen suite which was very spacious and perfectly appointed with all the right amenities. Some of them were never mentioned on their website such as a robe, an umbrella, an electric water kettle, and a bottle opener\/corkscrew. The lights in the room are electronically controlled and I was a big fan of the \u201cRelax\u201d setting which dims them down for the evening. The shades are also automatic and move with the touch of a button. The wet bar was a nice touch providing a place to sit with your morning coffee and a handy sink to use. The bed and furniture were all very comfortable. Don\u2019t miss the drawers under the bed where the ironing board and extra blanket are hiding. The safe is also hidden in the nightstand drawer. The \u201cresidential style\u201d of the hotel and the quite neighborhood made us feel like we were staying at a home rather than a hotel. It made coming back at the end of a busy day so much better. All of the staff at the hotel were very polite, easygoing, and friendly. \n\nOnly one minor issue\u2026 if your room has a terrace be prepared for dealing with a rather cryptic door lock. It\u2019s like opening a bank vault and requires an not-so-standard method of operating the lock. It also requires a firm, strong hand so my mom gave up on it and just climbed out the window. But that\u2019s what many New Yorkers do to anyways, right? Not a big deal. The staff will help you out. \n\nThe price of the rooms aren\u2019t cheap but are less expensive (sometimes much less) than comparable hotels and even \u201cnicer\u201d hotels. The fact that The Wallace is so shiny new certainly helps. Many of the comparable hotels are really showing their age.

The Wallace feels like it is still being beta-tested, so if you need a luxurious ground floor with a bustling social scene, this is not your spot. It could have coffee set up, or complimentary wine at 5 sort of thing, but clearly filling its vast lobby during COVID is not a priority. Our room was really fantastic (large, lots of windows w  views! that opened and let in fresh air, clean), with the small exception that there was no full-length mirror or magnifying mirror--two essentials for a woman of a certain age to get out the door looking her best. The mirror over the sink in the bathroom was not well-lit for make-up application or checking colors, and it was too small. Also made it hard to convince my husband that his bright blue running shoes clashed with everything he was wearing. We will definitely return.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Unlike the rest of the globe, The Wallace hotel could obviously care less about the safety or comfort of its guests who would like to avoid infection. I spent the day at a work conference, arrived back to The Wallace to find out I was locked out of my room. Why? Because management called me during the conference to schedule a housekeeping cleaning. Yep, You read correctly. I obviously could not answer, I was at work. Their solution was to lock me out of my room, which would force me to stop by the front desk before the day ended. Then!!! Management  escorted me to my room as if I were a criminal! I'm confused....is this a hotel in which I am paying for hospitality and comfort, or is this a college dorm? I practically live out of hotels as my job requires that I travel a ton throughout the year. I felt like I was back at college dealing with R.A's. It was awkward, embarrassing, and down right infuriating. I paid thousands of dollars to stay at their hotel and be humiliated. This is not good business practices Wallace. Their staff needs to revisit their hospitality manuals. This poor treatment will continue to cost you guests. Without us guests who literally pay to keep your lights on, you would be out of business. It would do you good to remember that fact if you would like to succeed in the business of hospitality.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I had to get out of bed to turn the lights off, had issues with the tv, and couldn\u2019t get the room service app to work. The room\u2019s decor resembled a funeral home.

The wet bar in our room had a small fridge that allowed us to keep some grocery items cold to have for breakfast and snacks. The 72nd Street subway station was also nearby which was great when we took the subway to Queens to see my family. Quick and easy! Our twins loved staying at this hotel because we were able to cast Netflix and some other shows for them on the tv. We loved the technology in the room with the ability to control lights and the shades remotely from a bedside panel. The finishes in our room and bathroom were well done and luxurious. Especially the marble bathroom with the amazing shower which had excellent water pressure!! The entire staff during our stay were awesome and super friendly. They were even accommodating and able to help us when our return flight was cancelled overnight on our last night.

The Wallace ended up as one of three finalists and I am so pleased with my decision to pick it.\n\nLocation:\nThis was probably my biggest concern heading into the stay.  The UWS looked lovely but I wondered if it was going to feel too far removed from the rest of Manhattan that we came to see.   By the end of our 4 night stay I would say location was one of my favorite features.  Subway service into midtown was an express stop or 4 regular stops and rook just minutes.  Access to lower Manhattan was relatively quick as well.  The neighborhood was great for grabbing breakfast and coffee and calm in the evening for grabbing dinner.   Central Park was easily accessible via walking a couple of blocks. \n\nLobby:\nThe lobby is impressive upon entry.  It's a very classy but modern design.  It's a shame the bar isn't open yet.  It will be a fantastic place to hang out.\n\nRooms:\nThe room was a hit with us.  Immaculately clean.  As they are pretty new everything was in pristine shape.  We had a single queen size bed and the room for plenty spacious for the two of us.  Every little detail is thought of for storage,  lighting, and all the automated controls.  Bathroom is good size with a very nice shower.  It had plenty of hot water.  Sleep quality was good too. It is o e of the quietest hotels I've been in, possibly due to the hallway layout.  We never felt like we heard everyone else coming and going which is nice.\n\nStaff:\nMy interaction with the staff was relatively limited, but check in and check out were both done quickly and efficiently.  The front desk staff simply look very polished in their dark suits which lends an air of elegant sophistication to the property.  The cleaning staff took care of our room when requested and did a nice job of restocking everything in the room \n\nFor most hotel stays, even if they are nice, they tend to be forgettable.  This is a location and property that I want to spend my time at during my next vacation in NYC.  Looking forward to returning.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We have stayed at hotels all over the world and I believe it\u2019s very safe to say that the Wallace experience ranks up there, easily comparable and even better in our opinion to some of the worlds finest properties. What makes a difference here is that in addition of being a five start hotel, the top notch staff led by the incredible General manager Mr. Victor Freeman is rare to come by, best in the business. They really do make  you feel like family here. You get that impression right away when you check in and are greeted by the super friendly, professional and attentive front desk staff. The Wallace has most definitely become our home away from home.\nMany thanks Victor and staff for yet another great and memorable stay.

I don;t know how much busier it might be without Covid. Just a short walk from the subway and near to restaurants and shops.\n\nMy holiday didn't start well because Virgin Atlantic failed to transport my luggage. Before I even checked in I spent about half an hour debating with myself whether to turn around and fly back to UK. The receptionist was very calm, helpful and patient with me, which was much appreciated, as I was very stressed. Eventually I checked i but I didn't sleep because I was very worried at not having my luggage and because I could hear AC fans outside the room all night  (I am very sensitive to noise). The next morning they offered me another room, which I declined because that too have AC fans, so the manager then offered me a suite! It was very nicely appointed with no AC fans. It had 2 huge TVs and a kitchen with coffee maker, kettle and fridge. More teabags would have been nice as mine were still in my suitcase in Heathrow! But I only had to ask for more. I accept that during Covid the hotel probably wasn't full, so can't guarantee anyone else would receive this treatment, but still, they didn't have to do it. \n\nThe staff were very considerate of my predicament and suggested places were I could by some essentials til my luggage arrived. And the doorman suggested a great diner near the subway for breakfast - Utopia - which I also recommend. Sadly there was no in house dining and no bar. Maybe soon ..... But they did offer a service for delivery of food from outside the hotel. \n\nI did have some problems with the electronic buttons for lights and blinds, but that was a v minor issue. \n\nAll in all it was a very nice stay with really helpful and friendly staff. If you are looking for a hotel near the subway but slightly apart from the usual noise and bustle of Manhattan this might be the place for you.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff was genuinely welcoming. After having landed early from a red eye flight, we were anticipating anything more than a bag drop off, but our room was ready! Spacious rooms (we loved the automation!), modern decor, clean, and awesome location to many, many restaurants (on Amsterdam and Columbus Ave,) and two subway stations. Central Park, Lincoln Park, and the river, were a short distance away too.\n\n5 stars for the staff, rooms, and location. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and have already done so to friends and family.\n\nSo why just 4 stars? I really wish there was a better way to note the minor, yet important issues that took away a star. \n\nWe ordered room service one day and although it was a couple of days prior to the NYC marathon, and we were okay with a delay of an hour in food being delivered, the food was soggy and stone cold! Very disappointing. The hotel's onsite restaurant wasn't open yet, so they had contracted with another food service. We were assured the experience would be no different than if the restaurant was onsite, but it clearly wasn't. Perhaps if they weren't as busy, but while a delay is understandable, the condition of the food was not.\n\nThe lobby was nice, but lacking amenities and 'personality'\/warmth. We were told this was coming, so perhaps this will change soon, although the website doesn't reflect this yet.\n\nThere were also a couple of issues with housekeeping. Slow -  we had to remind them a couple of times about the cooling (the heat kept turning on). The issue still wasn't resolved when we left. A couple of times, the toiletries weren't refilled and we had to ask. Hopefully, these are just growing pains and will be resolved quickly. \n\nFinally, a shoutout to the staff, who were very sweet to get a box of goodies and a hand-written note from the manager Steven with good wishes on our special occasion. Thank you to The Wallace staff for a very good stay!","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I usually have a tough time falling asleep at other hotels but at The Wallace it felt like home away from home. They had a large flatscreen tv in the room with a plethora of tv channels which I also thought was a nice touch. There is a spacious desk with great Wi-Fi which allowed me to get some work done on the road. But what I enjoyed the most about my room was the dual shower heads in the bathroom.

I understand that the owner purchased an older hotel and gutted it completely, creating what I would call a contemporary masterpiece.

The wear and tear will be very visible soon which is unfortunate as many things do work \n\nBathrooms are great, however products are cheap and I went to Aesop to buy soap, you\u2019d expect more from a \u201c5 star\u201d hotel. \n\nTech wise it\u2019s fantastic and has all the bells and whistles, from the plugs to the easiness of managing the lights and such and again, Service is great \n\nNo F&B facilities at all, an alternative of something called butler to deliver, I used it for breakfast and taste and all is mediocre, again not what you expect from a 5 star hotel. \n\nOveral, it was fine however nothing wow","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Gorgeous rooms and great service.  The hotel has real character.\n\nThe service was top-notch - everyone from the front desk manager (Justin Cordaro, who deserves particular praise) to the housekeeping to the doorman - all were friendly, professional, yet down-to-earth.  Service in NYC can be pretty hit-or-miss, even at very upscale hotels, so it was almost surprising to be treated so well.  The team here clearly takes pride in this hotel and what they do.\n\nI discovered the Wallace while looking for a hotel that was walking distance to Lincoln Center (treating my father to a weekend in NYC and a trip to the Met).  The property has just emerged from a top-to-bottom renovation and is now the right mix of modern and \"homey\" - sleek without being austere.  Rooms were very spacious (especially by NYC standards), spotlessly clean, and the beds incredibly comfortable.  Only quibble was that I had a bit of trouble figuring out the electric blinds at first, but that's definitely a first-world problem.\n\nHotel is still in soft-launch so no restaurant yet on-site.  So, don't stay here if you're the type to be grumpy without several in-house restaurants or amenities like a lap pool, etc.  Instead, stay here if you're looking for an elegant, smaller hotel with character in a \"real\" NYC neighborhood yet quiet and off the main drag, and walking distance to Lincoln Center and Central Park.

The decor is classic and comfortable. THE BEST New York hotel i\u2019ve ever stayed in. Because the hotel is 2 weeks old, there\u2019s no restaurant or bar, but there are restaurants everywhere to order from and the Beacon Liquor store is across the street and they have THE BEST wine on the planet. :-)\n\nIf you want a hotel thats new, clean and SUPER nice, The Wallace is your place!!! The staff makes you feel at home! \n\nIts also in a very convenient location.
