I could lie in the bath while looking out the window at the skyline. My room was right by the elevator but I was never disturbed. The Lower East Side is a wonderful neighborhood but I made a point to get back to my room and enjoy it as much as I could for my 3 night stay. When I had a Zoom meeting in my room, I ordered breakfast through room service and had a very delicious bowl of oatmeal. Since my stay at this hotel, I have stayed at two other high-end well reviewed hotels in nice cities, and neither served oatmeal anywhere near as good as The Ludlow. \n\nThe minibar provided some really nice choices including an Emergen C packet, which I used!\n\nMy only tiny complaint was that I had to meet someone at 7 am, and the hotel did not provide a coffee maker in my room, and they did not begin serving coffee in the lobby until 7 am and the coffee shop next door didn't open until 7 am, so I was a little strapped for caffeine before 7 am. But everything else about the hotel was so great, including the service. I hope to get the opportunity to return.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

After lots of research we decided on the Lower East Side and this hotel seemed ideal \u2026 we were not disappointed.\nI was initially worried we would be a bit remote but you are very handy for several subway lines and can be in all areas of the city very easily - but you are far enough from the centre to get a much different (and in my opinion better experience of New York).\nCheck in was quick and friendly, and having spotted a lovely open fire and bar on our way to our room we were sitting having a beautiful glass of wine 10 mins after checking in!\nI was also concerned before arriving about the room size, and yes it\u2019s cosy but it is gorgeous\u2026. Absolutely beautiful.  So bright and clean and had everything we could want, including an incredible view of the Empire Stare building and Freedom Tower, I would stay here again in a second.\nWe didn\u2019t eat in Dirty French because there were just too many other options around, but all the food we saw looked lovely and the restaurant always had a great atmosphere.\nWe did however enjoy relaxing in the bar, staff were so friendly and drinks were great.  We would really suggest asking the staff where they recommend locally, as we got directly ( and overheard) some great suggestions, most of which we tried and loved.\nMuch of the experience for us was the local area and I want to share some of our favourite places \u2026.. just next door Ludlow Street Coffee for morning drinks and pastries, Russ and Daughters cafe (go early and out your name in the list!), Subject cocktail bar (don\u2019t have too many) and enjoy classic movies (book in advance just in case),  Heavenly Hot Bagels (just great breakfast!), Death & Company for cocktails (you can\u2019t book, so we turned up just after opening), Restaurant Claud (a new place which I found before we travelled, you need to book in advance but it is just brilliant food\/wine\/service) and finally for a cosy excellent Italian meal, book a table across the street in Taverna di Bacco, you will love it!\nIn summary, a perfect, clean and cosy hotel in a brilliant area of New York - do not hesitate\u2026\u2026 book it!!\nThank-you Ludlow and Lower East Side, we will be back!!!","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I booked a Studio Mini as I was travelling solo, and it was honestly perfect. \n\nCheck in was easy with incredibly friendly staff. I had requested tea\/coffee facilities in my room (as the Studio Mini doesn't include this according to the website) and they had been arranged for my arrival. I had also requested a room with the shower \/ bathtub combo, which booking so last minute, I was hopeful for but didn't expect it - but they had accommodated the request, so I was delighted! I had emailed the hotel a few times before booking too, I always got prompt replies and they were very helpful. The pre-check in link is great too, if it's a special occasion you can pre-order items for your arrival, which was a nice touch. \n\nThe room was perfect, so well thought out and whoever did the design clearly thought about all of the small details that are often forgotten about. There were numerous hooks throughout the room to hang bags, coats, towels etc. which in small NYC hotel rooms, is always appreciated. I felt very safe and secure the whole trip too, which is always important as a solo female traveler.  \n\nIt was very clean and housekeeping turned it over beautifully each day (often when I'd only popped out for an hour, at different times, I'd come back and they'd turned it over already - I never saw housekeeping, so not sure how they know you're out - but it was a nice touch! It's always a pain returning after breakfast to brush your teeth and feeling in the way - but this didn't happen once, I don't know how they did it!). \n\nThe bathroom is just incredible, I'm obsessed with the design and again - so well thought out! The robes are comfy, the sheets are soft and there's some good black out curtains too. You can also open windows in the room \/ bathroom, which I always appreciate and not something you often get in NYC hotels. Good quality amenities too - I didn't get bath salts \/ bubble bath in my room, however a friend who had a Studio Mini on a different floor got given lots, so they gave me some - I think it was just a slip up that I didn't get it, but I'm sure if I asked, it would have been provided. They were such great quality too! Hair dryers in hotels are never great, and whilst it wasn't my Dyson, it was better than most hotel hair dryers I've used. \n\nNot that I used anything from the mini bar, but looking at it, they once again have thought about the small details. The snacks were high-quality and there were items such as worldwide travel adapters in case you forgot yours. There were also items such as bottle \/ corkscrews in the room, an iron \/ mini ironing board and the items you could request from room service were well thought out (e.g. sanitary products etc.) They really have thought about everything you might need \/ forget on a trip. \n\nI ordered room service the first night as I'd just landed and was too tired to go out, it came quickly and it was delicious. I had a few drinks in the bar downstairs most days and the cocktails were great, and the decor is amazing.\n\nThe location is perfect, a few minutes walk to iconic spots like Katz, Russ & Daughters and Clinton Street Bakery. I also walked most places I visited from the hotel, it is very well situated. Check out was friendly, helpful and I left my bags whilst waiting to head to the airport, which was no issue.\n\nAfter my last visit to NYC in October, with a very different experience in another East Village hotel, which was well below par to say the least, I had left thinking this is what I should expect in the area and that my expectations were too high. I had assumed that the poor quality, dirty rooms and lack of service were the New York experience. However, this was a totally different experience, in a beautiful hotel, with amazing staff and exactly what you'd hope for. It's a real credit to the whole team there. \n\nI have a few more trips planned in the next year and I will be booking The Ludlow again every single time. I've already recommended it to some friends travelling in a few weeks who are changing their travel plans to stay.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

We have a baby and a toddler, and having stayed at the Ludlow before, we weren\u2019t sure what to expect now being a family. \n\nFirstly, the staff were excellent. They were so friendly to our children and so welcoming. Nothing was too much and they recalled us every time we passed through the lobby. \n\nOur room was incredible. Great views, a lovely balcony and a real New York feel. Great decor, fantastic amenities and they were all prepped for us arriving with a cot and baby amenities in the room. They even had a baby lamb teddy and little robes - it was very cute!\n\nThe location is great. Really close to the subway, walking distance to Soho, Little Italy, and downtown. Easy to get cabs and close to the subway. There was even an enormous playground right behind the hotel.\n\nWe had room service on our first evening which was lovely, but we also had food delivered which was no bother. We had Nobu and Beauty and Essex with a skyline view while our little ones slept, and the hotel were great loaning us plates and cutlery. \n\nOur kids love to swim, so we were initially put off with it having no pool. One of our New Yorker friends told us how it\u2019s a couple of blocks from a 1920s public pool which is beautiful and clean (Hamilton Fish Pond). It was a lovely way to cool off in the late summer and as we went on a week day, it was really quiet (just take a lock). It\u2019s literally steps away.\n\nWe were sad to leave, and when we did, front desk gave us a later check out. We also forgot a phone in the room and the hotel shipped it to us (thank you, Joe). \n\nWe can\u2019t wait to return and recommend to families considering the Ludlow to do it. You won\u2019t be disappointed.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But we did not miss it and we did not even mention it. \nWould highly recommend and will definitely come back our next time in Manhattan.  ","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room (on 10th) wasn\u2019t large, but big enough, very quiet, stylishly decorated in great condition and clean, air con spot on, bathroom lovely, spacious enough  with good shower, great mirror, hot water temp and pressure spot on. I\u2019ll say again the staff were really helpful and the area was great too, it\u2019s a heady cultural mix and what we hoped NYC would be with great food options of every kind, high end modern shops mixed with real streets and people, a real community feel. Subway easy to get to on foot, safe and easy to get to midtown, downtown or Brooklyn. Area is very lively at night but we never felt unsafe with family (2 girls) on the streets. it was ok to grab a takeout coffee from the great coffee shop next door which was nice. For the Brits, if you want a kettle and tea in your room just ask and it\u2019s complimentary, the Nespresso machine is the std. We didn\u2019t ask so I grabbed tea from the coffee shop before we hit any breakfast.  Overall I would definitely return and recommend.

The hotel itself is OK. A bit too sparsely lit for my taste, but the rest of the interior is tastefully done. \nMy room however, was way too small. For me as a solo traveller (and I am not tall or big) with a medium suitcase, it already felt too cramped. I had a room directly next to the elevator. I believe these are smaller than other rooms. Unfortunately, the reception, when I mentioned my issues, could not move me. The only thing they could do was let maintenance remove a coffeetable so I had room to open my suitcase on the floor (no luggage racks here). I stayed for six nights and can\u2019t say I enjoyed staying in my room. Ofcourse, when you\u2019re in NYC, you\u2019re not in your room a lot. But for me, $3000  for six nights is a lot of money. Being able to move comfortably in your room, is not too much to ask for, right? Even for European standards (I regularly stay in Paris and Rome) the room was just too small. So I won\u2019t be returning. I don\u2019t want to run the risk getting stuck in a tiny room again. Can\u2019t comment on the breakfast or restaurants on site, but people seemed to enjoy themselves.

We had both breakfast and dinner in Dirty French and it was delicious! Breakfast was a particular treat as it was a lot less sweet than typical breakfasts I've had in the US which is much more my taste. The Duck special for dinner was BEAUTIFUL. There are a lot of really nice bars and restaurants close by and of course, you HAVE to get a sandwich from Katz Deli if you get a chance. If you're going to be spending a lot of time up close to Times Square etc., I'd get comfortable on the Subway as relying on Ubers is super expensive or the Open Top Bus tours take a long time to get from here back up as they go through the Financial District and can take forever!","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

We'd often grad a bagel for breakfast and eat it in the courtyard with a coffee from the restaurant.

I came to celebrate my friend's birthday and to relax too because I am a tired student midwife and nurse. I stayed in a studio mini on the 13th floor, and the view was great! I woke up to the most beautiful sunrise. The entire room was beautiful, the bed was sooo comfortable and the bathroom was GORGEOUS. I got the rain shower and tub combo (highly recommend you request this when booking!) and omg....I had the most relaxing bath! I ordered room service for breakfast from Dirty French, and the pancakes were absolutely DELICIOUS. I had dinner there and it was great too! Service was amazing and my food and mocktail were so good. Check in and check out were also SEAMLESS. There is also a Marshall's and CVS about a minute walk from the hotel in case you need to grab quick needs for your stay! \n\nWhat made my stay even more amazing was that Karen C. and Omar from concierge helped me surprise my friend for her birthday, who was also staying there in another room. They were AMAZING. They made a plan and called her to come to the lobby so I could decorate her room, and they surprised her with champagne FOR THE SECOND TIME since she arrived! When I was done decorating her room, I called them to send her back up and she was so surprised! It was so fun and pleasant to work with them and they went above and beyond; it felt like they were friends with my friend and trying to surprise her too lol! I am so grateful for them and couldn't thank them enough. They also roped in other staff members to help as well and it was just the absolute best.

This year due to COVID, staffing shortages, and school I couldn\u2019t take much time off. But I\u2019m exhausted and very much needed time to myself. I live in Connecticut and I chose to celebrate my 31st birthday in NYC at the Ludlow due to the beautiful soaking tubs, rain shower, and amazing views. \n\nRESERVATIONS \nThe amazing experience began when I placed my reservation over the phone. The staff member provided great details about each room, square footage, and dining options. She also asked if I was celebrating anything and I said \u201cmy birthday\u201d. She said she\u2019d make a note of it in the system, ensure I get a room with a tub and rain shower, and ensure I\u2019m on a high floor with a spectacular city view.  \n\nCHECK-IN\nTwo weeks later when I arrive, the front desk associate greets me and after verifying my ID she says \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d She then provides me with a complimentary breakfast voucher for my birthday and gives me to key to room 1701. The room on the 17th floor has a beautiful view of the city and the bathroom is incredibly luxurious and better in person. I\u2019m so happy when I arrived and could not wait to bathe and rest. 15 minutes later when I\u2019m settling in I get a knock on the door and it\u2019s a delivery of a complimentary bottle of champagne. The associate tells me happy birthday and he hopes I enjoy my stay. I call the concierge to thank them for the gift. \n\nSTAFF\n During my stay I 100% felt like I was at a resort due to the attentiveness of the staff. Every time I would pass the front desk they would say happy birthday, ask how my day is going, and ask if there\u2019s anything I need. I asked for ice and it was delivered within 5 minutes. I also forgot to pack a few items, the staff member walked with me outside and pointed me into the direction of a CVS and Marshall\u2019s - both which are only 2 minutes away from the hotel. Omar and Caren are absolutely an asset to the Ludlow and made my experience unforgettable. They helped my friends surprise me with balloons, a cake display, and more champagne for my birthday. They went above and beyond and asked me to come downstairs for a complimentary surprise which was a Ludlow mug, candle, boxes of water, another bottle of champagne, and champagne flutes. This was a diversion while my friends brought the balloons, cake, and decorations in my room. I return to my room surprised.  Amazing!! Unforgettable experience. 10 minutes after the surprise Omar delivers an edible arrangements package to my door as it was delivered to the hotel from my sister. Amazing service!!!\n\nDIRTY FRENCH\nI also ate the the restaurant, Dirty French, for dinner one night and the food was incredibly savory! The host greeted us warmly and promptly seated us and Jan was our waitress. She was funny, attentive, and provided great recommendations for drinks and food selections after asking our preferences.  \n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of staying at the Ludlow. Book it! My stay was all that I imagined it would be and more! The rooms are so cozy and luxurious. The staff is attentive. The restaurant is delicious. The hotel is so well located - I headed to soho for some shopping and it was a 10 minute Uber ride and I went to Fandi Mata in Brooklyn for my birthday dinner and it was a 15 minute Uber ride. Do your mind, body, and soul a favor and rest and reset at the Ludlow Hotel!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I had several intentions when booking this room\u2026the first\u2026it was romantic. Second, it would provide great content for her social media platform and, finally, it was a hell of a view for her to wake up to on her birthday. \n\nThe reality of that experience was taken away from us as soon as we walked into the Ludlow Hotel. We arrived at the hotel at approx 4pm, having checked in online about 1 hour before arriving. As soon as we walk to the counter, we\u2019re told the room isn\u2019t ready, but will be in a few moments. The manager at the desk hastily runs off as if he\u2019s going to take care of the situation. \n\nMistakes happen, we understand\u2026so we say we\u2019re willing to wait. However, I did ask myself, how could your #1 premier room not be ready 4 hours after checkout and when I also checked in online prior to arrival. \n\nWhile waiting, we\u2019re offered a room on the 10th flr. I reject it, and say I booked the Skybox Loft and expect that room. \n\nAbout 25 minutes goes by as we wait. The manager goes back and forth from the front desk and then says \u201cI have a few boxes to remove from the room and we\u2019ll escort you up to your room\u201d momentarily. We say ok. Then 2 minutes later the desk clerk comes to say \u201cyour room on the 10th flr is ready\u201d. We\u2019re in total shock. He then proceeds to say that the room I booked \u201cisn't technically guaranteed\u201d. \n\nInstead of making a scene and engaging in the glaring mediocrity, I immediately asked for a refund. Management\/ Staff didn\u2019t seem really apologetic that we were leaving.\n\nWhile I\u2019m upset for my girlfriend and I, imagine flying in to NY for vacation, and being told the room you booked isn\u2019t \u201ctechnically guaranteed\u201d so you have to take something of lesser value with no concessions. If you fly in and on vacation, you don\u2019t have much of a choice. I\u2019m glad I did. \n\nAs Black people, we understand that racism and classism exists in many forms so I\u2019m sure if we were of a different race or different class, my experience would be completely different. \n\nThankful that the Ink48, our usual hotel, had rooms available for the night.

We spent a lot of time out on the terrace, sipping coffee in the morning before hitting the streets or in the evening - taking in the stars. We will stay here again, most definitely but will probably upgrade to a King Terrace room. We found we were bumping into each other quite a bit (not always a bad thing.)

I had noticed the hotel a few months ago while dining at their terrific restaurant, Dirty French. This hotel is in a great location, surrounded by restaurants and bars. The hotel is really beautiful - as long as you like historic buildings. The lobby is lovely, and I especially liked the lobby bar, with big comfy couches and excellent atmosphere.  I had a small suite - with small being the key word. It had a tiny living room that was not really big enough to use, but a good place to store my luggage. The bed was quite comfy, but the bedroom was tight to move around. It is an old building, and has old building issues, including weird electrical that is hard to use, and a lot of street noise. I ended up plugging in my devices all over the room, because there is not a good central charging place. At one point the bathroom door wedged shut, and it took a lot of effort to get it open.\n\nIt has an well-done old fashioned bathroom, and there was plenty of hot water, and good toiletries. There is a mini-bar and Nespresso maker in the room. Service was very good.\n\nI stayed two nights, and enjoyed my visit. If you like older hotels, and are willing to deal with the normal issues they present, this is a great choice. The Ludlow also has a very sexy vibe - and if lack of space is not an issue - would be a good choice for couples.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Als Minuspunkt w\u00e4re vielleicht zu erw\u00e4hnen, dass die Beleuchtung im Wohnraum \"grenzwertig\" ist, aber in einer Stadt, die niemals schl\u00e4ft, kommt Licht bekanntlich auch von au\u00dfen herein ;). \nAuch die Rezeptionisten sind \"waschechte New Yorker\" und begr\u00fc\u00dfen einen tagt\u00e4glich mit einem gelangweilten und desinteressierten Gesicht, aber da ich mit ihnen wenig bis gar nichts zu tun hatte (Check-In\/Check-Out), war es mir auch egal, wenn sie mich beim \"Vorbeihuschen\" im Eingangsbereich keines Blickes w\u00fcrdigten. \nDas flie\u00dft jedoch nicht in meine Bewertung mit ein, denn bei einem City Trip sind mir ganz andere Dinge wichtig, und all diese hat das Hotel bestens erf\u00fcllt.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The decor and fit out it beautiful. From the moment we walked in it was a wow! The room are small bit have also a lovely fit out. The view was nice i would mot say it was anything fabulous but it was view. The bathroom was small with a great large shower head, only bigger enough for one person to be in there at a time and you had  to close the door to use toilet and shower. We found out the day before we left you could get a clothes rack to hang you clothes which would have been great to know on day one- as the wardrobe is tiny.\n\nThe girl and front desk was lovely, she was friendly and gave a run down on places to eat in the area. Nothing seemed to much trouble. The other staff - they said good morning\/ good evening but other than that were quite unapproachable. \n\nThere is a gorgeous lounge and under cover court yard that is lovely to fit at and have a very over priced drink at. We did that once or twice but paying $60 aussie for two drink was a little over the top. The restaurant at the hotel Dirty French had a great feel- even though you couldn\u2019t read the menu it was so dark, we order steak frits and asparagus side and it was amazing!   \nGreat first night meal in NYC.\n\nThe location of this hotel in the Lower East Side across the road from Katz deli was a funky area with a cool young crowd we love the location- except getting around on the subway system was difficult from here - especially if you not back by 8.30pm - the train line would be closed on weekends and you has to take two different lines to get where you want to be. We spent lot of wasted time travel to the site in Manhattan. This hotel was any cheaper than the ones in Manhattan - overall as much as i loved this hotel and thought it was stunning for convenience it would be better to stay uptown while site seeing and then head to the Ludlow once you are done.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Great Staff!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-02-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I stayed at The Ludlow this past Valentine\u2019s Day, as a special surprise staycation treat for my girlfriend. Prior to arriving, I contacted the hotel and the manager Ken was readily and available to assist with all my tedious request and set me up for such a wonderful and special stay. He even reached out to me after my stay to make sure everything went as planned. Before even arriving that afternoon, I received a text that my room was ready. I hadn\u2019t even registered as yet, and was being told my room was ready. Eric! I arrived later that afternoon and Lawrence, the lobby ambassador, with a great smile and personality greeted me at curbside and accommodated me with a space right in front of the hotel to unload and leave my car while I settled in. I checked in and my journey with Lawrence continued, he took me up to the beautiful Loft Queen Deluxe, which was to die for and showed me around!! I set up my room to complete the last leg of my big surprise and asked Lawrence to assist me, which he happily did, by recognizing my girlfriend, after briefly showing him a photo, and having him hand off a card key to her when she arrived. IT WAS PERFECT! I later went to the lobby bar and met the beautiful host, Deandra, who got us our cocktails and even sat with us and had a nice conversation with us while we enjoyed the space. It just felt like home. If I could afford to be there each week, I would. I've already recommended the property to so many of my friends and colleagues and I can't wait to be back to this Gem!","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room had a small lounge area which definitely made the room feel spacious and had a couple of small closets to hang clothes etc. I found the room to be a little too dark, even with all the lights on and on the 18th floor - I get the look they are going for but personally would like options. The bathroom was awesome, very light and bright with a large walk in shower, big bath and plenty of space on the vanity to spread toiletries out on. I loved the big window in there, but might not be for everyone. there was a curtain to close if you want more privacy. Check in was quick and easy, but in general I found the staff to be a little blas\u00e9. I didn't eat at the restaurant but did have drinks in the bar area and enjoyed the open fire.

My wife and I spent 4 nights here with our 15 year old daughter in a 2 bedroom space. It was disappointing to find that 1 room (our daughter's) had no natural light - it was like an anteroom to the front, where we stayed.That's a little primitive for this day and age. It was certainly clean enough, a little small for my preference, a bit boxy - and overall lacked any real character. Bathroom was very nice but in terms of atmosphere and decor the rooms were non-descript. The reception staff were helpful when asked for info or recommendations, charm itself in fact, but on arrival, there was no offer to help us with bags or anyone to show us the room. We were given the keys and left to get on with it. That is clearly hotel policy and not what you'd call getting off on the best foot.\n              The bar and lounge area was, by contrast, very comfortable and stylish although in the evening the atmosphere changed from family hotel into something else entirely. It made for interesting people watching. We had some drinks and bar snacks which were pretty good but paralysingly expensive. But hey, it's New York, right? We went down to breakfast one morning and it was good with customary polite, attentive service.\n                    So, a bit underwhelming, odd and slightly inadequate. We spoiled ourselves a few years back by staying at the Crosby Street Hotel and it was one of the best we've ever experienced. In comparison to this, it cost an arm and a leg although New York is eye wateringly expensive compared even to life in London. If you are fortunate enough to be able to make the choice I'd recommend spending the extra.\n              ps if you go to the coffee shop next door with all the vinyl records, by all means have the coffee, it's very good. But don't buy the fresh OJ if you suffer from a heart condition; the price may push you over the edge.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location is fantastic for exploring a vibrant part of the city, and subway access is easy to get to tourist or business destinations. The lobby bar is packed at night but feels like a comfortable living room during the day.\n\nI stayed in a Skybox Loft room and enjoyed the fantastic views. The queen bed was very comfortable, and water pressure was excellent. Despite this being a higher category room it still felt small, not uncommon for NYC. The living room looked bigger in pictures.\n\nMy 2 complaints about the rooms:\n- Lighting: great during the day with the curtains open but horrible at night. With all the lights on it was about as bright as a romantic bar, and reading in the living room was impossible.\n- Storage: there is only 1 small closet, and no drawers\/dressers (even the \"night tables\" are just small flat surfaces). I like to completely unpack on longer vacations, and this required some creative thinking. I had the same issue in a Studio Mini room last summer.\n\nI didn't rely on the staff for much assistance except for delivering the Sunday paper to my room after I'd left for the day, which was appreciated.\n\nI'd stay here again without hesitation, knowing the limitations of the rooms.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

He said what I was also thinking - the Ludlow and our room there. For having selected this hotel only from ratings and reviews on this site we managed to choose the perfect place for us - it says much about the value of honest reviews. The hotel is nicely located by shops and restaurants in the LES\/Soho area - far more intimate and user friendly than other areas in the city. But the hotel itself was the star. Hip, warm, intimate, friendly. Our renovated 15th floor corner room with ceiling height windows and terrace was beautiful and spacious for 2 with a comfortable sitting area and awesome views. The lounge with large central fireplace and cool decor and furnishings was perfect for our chilly stay. The staff was very friendly and Dirty French is a great attached restaurant. The service in the restaurant and lounge however is material for another review.

We were close to so many cool shops and restaurants. The room and bathroom were spotless. I look at EVERYTHING and it was super clean! The hotel was booked but we never heard any neighbors. I'm giving this hotel five stars but I did have one issue. We could see our neighbors using the restroom and taking showers. That means they could see us too. When I told the front desk (two young girls) they kind of laughed it off and said well you have to close the curtain at the window. Yea, I'm not an idiot. Of course we closed the curtain. There is a space above the curtain rod and the ceiling with a space big enough to see right through. I was pretty embarrassed when we realized this.

Great fried chicken restaurant next door and the iconic Katz deli down the road which you have to try once.\n\nThey double charged my deposit which I didn't get back for a couple of weeks.

Skybox Loft room was excellent: large bathroom & separate sitting room were standout feautures. \n\nBreakfast at 'Dirty French' was massively disappointing (boring menu, mediocre quality & over 30-minute wait.) Would not recommend eating at the Ludlow as there are plenty of far better options within a short walk (Russ & Daughters for breakfast, example.)\n\nThe other bizarre feature of the Ludlow is the anonymity of it's staff. It's difficult to recognise who actually works there & even more difficult to discern who's in charge. This was apparent to a number of guests we chatted with while staying at the Ludlow. You'd see people wandering around with suitcases but have no clue whether they were guests or staff. It was the same in the restaurant, barely organized chaos. We watched one fellow guest give up waiting for his breakfast to arrive & simply walk out.\n\nIn short, great rooms & location in the Lower East Side, but the rest of the 'package' at The Ludlow falls far short of what you would expect for the prices they charge.\n","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Long story short, they messed up our room bookings, told me it wasn't their problem and then lied and acted as if I booked something else. The literally did nothing to rectify the situation. They couldn't care less and that's unacceptable because you ultimately return to a hotel based on how you're treated.

I was on a quick weekend trip with my college age daughter who was beginning her Spring break.   It is a hidden gem just off of Houston.  The excellent, welcoming staff greet you with smiles and a quick check in.  It was a cold weekend so the large burning fireplace was a welcome site.  Lots of wood and comfy furniture make this one of the more cozy lobbies in the city.  Room was small (expected in NYC)  but well appointed.  Small closet, shelves, hooks, mini bar, flat screen tv, rain shower and a deep tub.  I heard no noise from the hallway or adjacent room. The restaurant, Dirty French, looked inviting but we opted to hit the city and grab a quick bite rather than dine.  \n\nBig Thank You - My daughter left her glasses on her night stand.  She contacted the Ludlow the next day.  They had them and sent them within days.\n\nPro Tips - The Ludlow is just off Houston on a very narrow street.  Walk up to the corner to flag a cab or meet your car. Other than the famed Katz's Deli which is across the street it is not near a lot.  You need to walk several blocks to get to the heart of SOHO, car\/taxi to mid town for theater will run $15-20 before tip.  The pillows are VERY soft.  There were 4 on the king bed in our room but would have preferred about 4 for each person because of the softness.  I'm sure they'd have brought more had I asked.  Bring ear plugs (I always do on trips to NYC) just in case your room fronts the street like ours did.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The King Studio was roomy and had a huge bathtub\/shower combo.  Hubby enjoyed a soak in the tub one night and the rain shower was easy to use and not wimpy.  One note, I'm on the short side ~5'1\" and it's a high leg up into the tub, so it wouldn't be good for someone with balance issues since there was no grab bar.  The room has a nice sitting area and since we were on the end of the hall, it was very quiet most of the time.\n\nThere is a fabulous restaurant in a garden-y type room off the lobby with very helpful wait staff.  We weren't really too hungry, but didn't feel like going out, so we ate there and ooh la la!  Very tasty French cuisine with a twist.  Portion size was just right (not too big), so we finished our meals.  The bar\/restaurant\/lounge area seems to be a local hot spot and was crowded and some of the noise trickled up to our room because we (3rd floor) overlooked that area on the first floor, but it was happy noise, so all good.\n\nIt was a married-couple getaway without kids for us, so we spent a little more for a romantic, unique hotel near shopping that we like in East Village - easy walking distance.  24 hour parking is right across the street and subway stops are a few blocks away.  We would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Four drinks were $80 before tip.  When we left our room to check out, there was the distinct aroma of the floor of somebody having gotten sick on the carpet.

What an amazing stay. This was perhaps one of the best boutique hotels we have stayed in and it was great experience having gone from chain hotels (e.g. Westin\/SPG) to The Ludlow in the lower east side.\n\nPositives:\n1. The location is incredible. If you want to spend time in NYC away from the tourists and enjoy the East Village and LES, this is the place to be. It was great visiting the LES where we lived 20 years ago and have it right at our door step. Sure having turned 40, we felt old and unhip walking through the lobby and past the Dirty French but staying at the Ludlow made us feel young again. The hotel is surrounded by great bars and restaurants --- Across from Katz's, down the street from Russ & Daughters, and a 10 minute walk to the subway.\n2. Our room was incredible --- the decor was unique and interesting and spacious. We had a two bedroom suite which allowed my wife and I to have privacy while our girls were able to do their own thing. The amenities were luxurious and everything was perfectly laid out.\n3. The garden had tables reserved for hotel guests. It was gorgeous and a great place to lounge and have a drink. Our kids ordered dessert and the staff were incredibly kind and accommodating. For a hotel that doesn't resonate as being for families, it was perfect for us and frankly it was great that no one seemed mind that our children were around.\n\nThe value was incredible, the atmosphere was amazing and the staff were excellent. There is no doubt that we will be visiting again ... perhaps this time as a get-away without kids.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Floor to ceiling windows, large bathroom with walk in shower and bathtub big enough for two. We opted for the Queen with bathtub.\nThe bed was super comfortable and the views over the lower east side\/ Brooklyn were wonderful to wake up too. There was also a bottle of red wine waiting in our room as a gesture for our honeymoon which I thought was lovely (my husband and I still have it at home as a keepsake!) The view from the rooftop terrace is INSANE. really takes your breath away. Everyone we came across in the hotel was very helpful and super friendly. It's got a very hip vibe to it! We had complimentary breakfast at their restaurant Dirty French (not sure if they still offer this) it was delicious and filled us up for our days of exploring the city. LES is such a wonderful area to stay with plenty of places to eat and drink, Sweet Chick next door and Russ and Sons were two of our favourites, not forgetting the incredible frozen margaritas happy hour at PIANOS bar.

However...if you are a light sleeper, you need to know that the hotel sits very close to the intersection of Ludlow and Houston Street and there is a LOT of traffic noise that goes on into the wee hours; and by wee hours, I mean it starts to quiet down around 2:30 to 3 in the morning (oddly enough, it is actually quieter in the neighborhood at 8 AM than at 3 AM) They will provide you earplugs free of charge at the front desk and you may very well need them.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I\u2019m sure you can imagine our anticipation to see my daughter as she has been living in New York for 3 years as well as all the \u201cBig Apple\u201d has to offer.  After 7 wonderful days with my daughter, we left the hotel along with my jewelry in the hotel room safe.  We called the hotel as soon as we realized.  The hotel said they had the safe opened and found nothing in it.  They can over-ride any combination.  We are outraged and terribly saddened. One of my losses was vintage gold earrings - a gift from my daughter - I can never replace them.  Is this the best of what can be expected from this establishment?   It has left a very bad taste for New York for us.   I would not recommend the Ludlow Hotel to anyone wishing to feel safe in a hotel in New York City.  Another much, much lesser issue we had is that when we ordered room service breakfast the attendant said that the hotel had run out of coffee and wouldn\u2019t have any for 2 or 3 days.

My wife was in NY on business and the hotel's location in Lower East Side was ideal for her work. I'm not sure I'd recommend the LES for a \"normal\" holiday visit as it's certainly not a tourist area. But if you know London, think Shoreditch, Brick Lane and you'll get the idea. \n\nOur 7th floor room had a big terrace which would have  been even nicer if NY hadn't been snowbound at the time! The room was on the small side as all NY hotel rooms seem to be but it was very well appointed with a very comfortable bed. \n\nWe only had breakfast in the hotel on our first morning - beware if you order \"morning potatoes\" and you're weight watching. My plate had no less than 12 roast potatoes!\nOther mornings we went to the little coffee shop two doors down - excellent raspberry muffins! We had dinner one night in the hotel's Dirty French restaurant - we were seated in the Garden Room which was actually better as we could hear what we were saying to each other! The food was excellent but it is expensive. It comes as a shock when you're retired and have to pay for these things out of your own pocket! The rate of exchange at the moment isn't helping. \n\nThe door staff, reception, room and waiting staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. If we had one gripe about the hotel it would be the bar and lounge service. The area is full of beautiful, trendy people (think fashion, social media types) all pretending to be really busy on their Mac books. Unless you fit into this category some of the bar waiting staff really give the impression they are doing you a favour by taking your order.

I have stayed on the lower east side before a few times in the past 10 years.  We are locals so to speak as we live on Long island and the city is a simple hour drive from home.  Simply stated, this was my absolute favorite stay in New York ever.\n\nThe hotel is simply wonderful in every way.  The rooms are immaculate and a normal size for a New York City hotel room.  We had a skybox loft on the 16th floor (goes up to 19).  It was slightly cramped but the view absolutely made up for that - GREAT views!  The bed was VERY comfortable and the roof was great to go up and chill and take in the views from the 20th floor.  The gym is located on this floor as well.  Our friends who booked one night to join us for a bit had a King loft and that room was a little larger and set up better.  It just didn't include a deep tub like our room.  I will book this room next time.\n\nThe lobby area is beautiful with tons of areas to relax, nice comfy couches and chairs and a crackling fire.  There is also a greenroom which probably has the roof open during the summer months.  Really pretty lobby.  At night, the lobby areas and restaurant get packed with a younger crowd into late night.  It is a happening place to be.  The neighborhood is one of my favorite parts of the city.  Anything you could want to eat or drink is in a two block radius.  The lower east side is jam packed with restaurants, bars and shops.  It is such a great area to just hang out and shop, etc.  \n\nThe hotel restaurant, Dirty French, was literally the finest meal I have EVER had ANYWHERE.  I do not say that lightly as I love to eat.  If you want to eat there you must make a reservation almost a month in advance as it is packed all the time.  The food was absolutely mind blowing and immediately became my new favorite restaurant in NYC.  I can't possibly recommend the restaurant more and I cannot wait to go back again - WOW!!!\n\nThe staff at The Ludlow were very nice and attentive to your every need - they do a great job and go out of their way to make sure you are happy.

All interior is modern and cosy, but at the same time looks luxury. The bar with fireplace, leather sofas and armchairs, and wooden floor - great spot to chill. There is as well restaurant. Breakfast is a la cart and you can pay straight after the meal or include in your final hotel bill. In the morning service is a bit slow at the restaurant as it's full of hotel residents, locals and business people, but food is yummy. Also, the famous Katz deli is just around the corner!!

Our Studio Queen room was pretty cramped (what you'd expect on Manhattan), but beautifully designed. I couldn't stop taking photos of the tasteful decor, very rustic chic. We used the rooftop fitness center (great view!) and hung out in the cozy lounge. The bathroom is gorgeous, with white marble and gold brass. I appreciated that the hotel left us a bottle of champagne (REAL champagne, not prosecco like most hotels). There were two minor issues: the person who checked us in was not very friendly, though everyone else at the hotel was wonderful. And it was extremely loud at night. This is saying a lot, as our room was up on the 12th floor and we're from Brooklyn and quite used to city noise.

The shops, galleries and restaurants are cool and there are very few tourists in this area--it's also more affordable than other areas of town. We've stayed at the Crosby Street Hotel before in Soho, and I would classify this as \"Crosby Street Hotel, light.\" It has a similar industrial chic vibe, but is more intimate in scale and a much better value. Our Queen Loft room was a decent size for two people (about $500\/night including taxes). I believe the smaller rooms are REALLY small. The closet is tight, but enough for about 10 hanging items. There is really no good place to put a rolling suitcase other than under the bed or in the middle of the floor. Perhaps some in room luggage racks could be added? The bed was SUPER comfortable, clean, white and fluffy. The ceilings seemed a little lower than most hotel rooms, but the big windows make up for it. Our view faced east and just above an outdoor parking lot\/garage. We had no issue with noise on the 7th floor, other than the occasional siren. You will have a nice sunrise from this side. The real view is on the roof, which is incredible of downtown (and the sunset). The bathrooms are very nice--big for NY and had retro finishes and a soaking tub with a view. The toiletries were divine. We also loved the lobby area and small bar next to the fireplace. It's a cozy hangout on a cold day. The restaurant area of Dirty French was a little too chaotic for my taste and unfortunately the smell from the kitchen creeps over to the hotel elevators and reception area. It was a combo of stinky cheese and old mop at all times. For a first impression as you walk in the door, it's heavy. Fortunately, it's contained to this area. For the most part, we really liked this hotel. We planned our trip around being in this neighborhood and it felt like a different country compared to our usual Upper East Side stays.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We're a couple in our early 50s and while yes, this place has a totally cool, hip vibe and is filled with gorgeous, fashionable people, what it lacks is attitude, making you feel completely comfortable regardless of your age. Best of all, it somehow manages to be far from 'trendy' which seems to be what makes it so timeless and comfortable... it's not trying to be cool, it just is, and you're not trying to be cool by staying there, you just are. The decor is stunning, the lighting is sexy and there's a definite buzz that fills the air. It's the kind of place you want to hang out in the lobby and have drinks (which we did). The restaurant, Dirty French, never stops, it is super popular with locals (according to one we know) and visitors alike. If you have any plans to eat there, make your resos now, they are booked about a month in advance. Ask to sit in the main room (they reserve the garden room to accommodate hotel guests which is incredibly generous - and very beautiful - but not quite the same).  The best we could manage in the main room was to eat there one night for dessert and after-dinner drinks which were all delicious. We were traveling with our two young teens and stayed in room 605 which was perfect - two bedrooms (one with a comfortable sitting area) separated by a hallway with the bathroom in the middle, two closets, two minibars, coffee machine, robes, slippers, everything you could need including the best stocked mini-bar we've ever seen full of unique surprises - I won't tell you because I don't want to spoil it but you MUST check it out! Definitely plenty of room for four and the bedding was exceptional. Windows opened for fresh air too which you don't usually find. We overlooked Ludlow Street and with the windows closed, couldn't hear a thing. We also didn't hear anything between the walls at any time. The sleek gym and open terrace on the 20th floor offered stunning views - we took our minibar Champagne and a couple of glasses up one night for a toast. The neighborhood, even though we were probably some of the oldest people around, was still the best place to stay. Walking around that area of the LES just south of Houston and then on the other side to East Village makes the trip in and of itself. So many small independent restaurants and shops, all buzzing, all hip, completely different day to night. One night we stopped for appetizers and drinks at as many places we could until we were stuffed, would recommend doing that too. Also, it's a great walk across Bleeker Street into West Chelsea and up onto the Hi-Line if that interests you. Consider taking their car to (and if they provide, from, we don't know but would inquire next time) the airport - it was about the same cost as a cab but 1000X more comfortable. Overall it was a 5-star experience and we would definitely stay there again. Highly, highly recommend.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But we walked a lot because it sometimes it was just faster on foot!\nThe covered atrium lounge has a very chilled vibe and great bar menu. \nThe Ludlow has a rooftop seated area which was cool. We also went across the road on our last night to the rooftop bar at the Hotel Indigo, Mr Purple. Awesome view of the whole Manhattan skyline!\nAwesome place to stay as a couple. We would love to come back.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We tried nearby places on subsequent mornings, and I can highly recommend the Clinton Street Baking Company nearby, (we went twice, and both times were gorgeous, the wait is worth it, and you can sit at the counter if you don't want to wait for a table), as well as Balthazar, which is a tiny bit further away but near some great shops. \n\nAs for dinners, we brought some food back to the hotel as we were jetlagged and exhausted after a day walking around- the Meatball shop around the corner was delicious and friendly, as well as Stanton Street Pizza for some truly local NY slices. Katz's is not for the faint of heart, but staff are friendly and the Pastrami is great. \n\nAll staff we encountered were professional and friendly, and we were given space to explore and were never bothered by anyone at the hotel, but always returned to a pristine room.

We found delicious food at our finger tips particularly the Italian restaurant Tre which was directly across from the hotel.

He got our rooms sorted out and gave us information on the hotel. \nThe rooms were a good size for NYC, and had quite a distinctive decor.  The windows were real and opened. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. \nThe choice of food on the room service menu was a bit disappointing, and a couple of items were not available. I also was told I couldn't have ice cream because it wasn't on the late night menu (really?) The mini-bar, however, was very well stocked.\nOther than that, it was a good stay and the bar\/restaurant looked to be wonderful! \nI'd go back to get the full experience.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My mother grew up around the corner from this hotel in the 40's and we came to NYC often growing up so I always come to this neighborhood when I am in town and have frequented numerous restaurants and bars in the area.  I had never stayed at The Ludlow and the rates were reasonable so I booked a room for the weekend.\n\nFirst....any of the staff that had anything to do with my room were friendly, courteous and just great overall (front desk, bellman, room service, etc.) I have never received a pot of coffee faster at any hotel....and two days in a row! \n\nAfter dinner (Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya...would highly recommend) we decided to have cocktails in the lounge of the hotel which is part of Dirty French, the restaurant in this hotel. Now there are a plethora of choices in this part of town for really awesome, creative cocktails and were hoping this experience would be the same. \n\nWe found a comfy couch and waited about 10 minutes until I had to ask the bartender if someone could come and take our drink order.  We ordered the same drink but since I don't care for tequila which was the main component of the drink I asked if I could have vodka instead.  We waited minimally 20 minutes (this is generous) for our drinks to arrive. \n\nWhen we tasted the cocktails mine tasted like tequila so I tried my friends and they tasted the same.  I immediately told the waitress and after more extended waiting two men came over to the table from the bar\/restaurant with my cocktail, a bottle of Ketel One (the brand of vodka I ordered) and incredible rudeness.  They asked who the person was who liked Ketel (with sarcasm), proceeded to measure out the vodka which they added to the rest of the ingredients in my drink, all the while with the most obnoxious attitude and sarcasm.  I honestly have never been treated so rudely in any establishment EVER.  I waited tables when I was younger and am currently a successful business woman with a career in sales and finance. I travel and dine out regularly. My friend and I were truly shocked and insulted.  I did reiterate this sentiment to the waitress who told me that she would \"let them know\".  So much for that.  A word to the bar.....the customer is always right and kindness goes a very long way. \n\nI give the staff of the hotel related to my room 5 stars and 1 for the Dirty French lounge. Unfortunately, because of the awful bar experience I would be very reluctant to stay here again.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Some background - we live in NYC and every few months stay somewhere for a night or weekend to get away from our hectic life of school and kids activities. So not new to NYC or hotels in NYC. We debated between this hotel and the Highline Hotel. Chose this one for the neighborhood as we already spend a lot of time on the west side. \n\nThe rooms themselves (we had a skybox loft) are nice. Small but we knew that coming in but we were here mainly for neighborhood and views. Bathrooms are nice but not spacious. But overall no complaints about the room except the AC. It is very noisy. It will wake you up throughout the night. \n\nThe biggest issue, which seems to be fairly common for hotels down here (like Sixty LES, but surprisingly not Standard East Village or Bowery Hotel) is the attitude of the people working the front desk. I don't know why it is so hard for the hotel to hire and train personable people to work the front desk. Instead they act as though they are working the line at s club and treat you like some rube tourist that is too much trouble to be nice to. I have never experienced this at hotels like the Mandarin, NY Palace, etc. Case in point. We asked for a late checkout. Lots of rooms available tonight, including our room class so not likely to be an issue of them being fully booked. We were told than anything after 12:30 incurs a half day charge. We pointed out that the book in the room stated that anything after 2:00 would be a half day charge. She responded as though we did not know what we were talking about and looked at us again like rubes from out of town. I then indicated I would be happy to go and get a copy of the house rules in the room to show her and then she said well it's 12:30 for your class of room. Clearly making it up as she was going along. Didn't care to argue the point so we will check out early. \n\nOf course the management is reading trip advisor and they know this is a common complaint. It has not changed so clearly this is either intended or unimportant. \n\nOverall fine but could be so much better if the staff at the front dropped the attitude. Probably will not be back.

The place is fabulous. \n\nlet's get the \"negatives\" out of the way. The room is small, BUT that is the case for almost all NYC standard rooms. We're in a Standard Queen Studio. Hallways are tight and narrow, but I believe it's original to the building as this looks like it was an older property that has been meticulously and lovingly updated.\n\nFor the good stuff. \n\nLocation: it's in in the Lower East Side. We purposely wanted to stay in a neighborhood and a non-big commercial chain property. It's walkable to just about everything you need and truly get to experience what it's like for a New Yorker who lives in this area. I'm from Chicago, so appreciate the true neighborhood feel this provides. It's a relatively safe area, lots of people and businesses around so we felt safe walking around even in the evenings.\n\nSO MANY RESTAURANTS!!! And good ones. There's a fair combo of old school joints and newer concepts. The famous Katz Deli is at the end of the block, so we had to have it even if we said we weren't going to the typical NYC touristy spots on this visit. A good gelato place Il Laboratorio Gelato adjacent to Katz. Walked to Union Square Market for some in-hotel goodies like water, fruit and snacks.\n\nThere's also a small gym on the top floor, which was a bonus to us so we didn't have to pay for a daily pass at a gym in the area. On the same floor a great rooftop to bring a drink up and just get a great view of the city.\n\nProperty: Just so  nicely done! the exterior, the lobby, the restaurants. I can go on! The attention to detail is spot. My favorite has to be the sun room toward the end of the main floor. Nice little respite from the hustle & bustle. \n\nRoom: As I said, small (235 sq ft). They did however really use the space wisely with bed frames that are elevated so you can put your suitcase under. Closets\/Shelves with storage. Our room has a Juliet-ish balcony...we can step out and get fresh air, but only one person can fit there. The bathroom is nice. Standup shower only, no tub for those who need\/want that. Great lighting for make-up. The finishes\/design is what I'd call updated vintage. Tree stumps for nigh stands, nice dark wood bed frame. The room also comes with a Nespresso Machine. Score! \n\nStaff\/Service: so nice and helpful. Opened doors, held elevators, greeted us each time. I noted on my booking it's our anniversary and they dropped off a nice bottle of sparking wine. A small touch that really made us feel special.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We literally put our bags down & walked across the road to Katz for their famous pastrami sandwich even though it was 1:00am! Lots of great cafes, restaurants & galleries all within walking distance. It's a hip & trendy area but streets are smelly & dirty especially after Friday\/Saturday night. An authentic old New York vibe.\n\nThe room was beautiful, especially the bathroom. The bath tub was massive, one of the best we've experienced! We also loved the touch of gold in all the fittings. Our only complaint is the size of the room. It was really really really small, we already had a skybox room so we can't imagine how tiny a standard room would be. We couldn't fully open our suitcases anywhere. Had to leave them in the narrow corridor to access them & zip them back up each time we headed out or wanted to close the bathroom door. We didn't bother unpacking or hanging any clothes up as there was literally no space.\n\nAside from that everything was fine. We enjoyed having breakfast in our skybox lounge every morning. Even managed to catch a glorious sunrise. They provided coffee but no water or tea. The gym on the top floor is small but adequate. Even if you don't want to use the gym, go up there for the rooftop view!\n\nWe had lunch at their restaurant Dirty French. Both food & service was incredible! They serve these complimentary flatbreads there that are highly addictive as warned by our waiter - he was not joking!\n\nOverall we were happy with our stay at the Ludlow for its location. It's suited more to a younger crowd, especially for those who want to party till late & to see & be seen. If you want a more spacious, quiet & comfortable stay then the Ludlow is not it.

There was little hanging space so could be a problem for a longer stay (e.g. not really anywhere to store a larger suitcase - perhaps under the bed could work).\n\nDaytime service in the lobby bar area was a bit slow during the day (it's fantastic at night).

Being that 3 of us work in hospitality management our expectations were high of a hotel charging what the Ludow charges - needless to say- we were impressed and want to meet again at the Ludlow next year!\n\nAs a former Food and Beverage Director I believe it is the details that set apart just a good F&B Outlet from a great one. The Dirty Frenchman (in house restaurant) is exceptional! We had a nice breakfast, and being that we all lived very long in Europe or are European, it is nice when being served a dish from the proper side and having the correct cutlerty set up for corresponding courses. The Servers were always authenticly friendly, prompt, competent, and non-intrusive.\n\nThe front desk team were equally well trained and helpful. Should you be in need of a taxi ask the front desk as the compant which they work together with  is much more comfortable than the regular city taxis. \n\nThe only qualm I have is paying $15 for a bagel with cream cheese on a room service order. Calculating from an industry norm Cost of Goods Sold at 25-30% the bagel would have to cost the hotel about $4 to produce or purchase, I can assure this was not the case. The F&B director should reconsider the food costing on room service items. A room service charge was also added to the bill which I can completely understand. Good personnel are expensive and should be paid well for working late nights, that said I think all together I forked out about $45 for a bagel (partially my fault as I am a generouse tipper).\n\nI look forward to my next stay at the Ludlow!

The restaurant\/pub on the ground floor is very good - upmarket steak and fish dishes etc - and is both an in-door dining room plus a glassed-in atrium area out the back (particularly pleasant).    You need to book, but they do give priority to in-house guests.  \n\nThe rooms are not huge, but they're very nicely decked out - shiny black-and-white tiled bathrooms, comfortable beds, a very comprehensive mini bar (which includes amongst other things, a Lovers' Intimacy Kit, the contents of which I will allow readers to imagine for themselves).    The neighbourhood itself buzzes all day and night, full of restaurants and bars and convenience stores and ice-cream parlours.  The subway is about two blocks away at Delancey and Essex, and covers two different lines, crosstown and uptown.   \n\nIt's about five minutes walk to Bleecker Street and from there into either the East Village or Greenwich Village, and you can spend a couple of days just exploring that area.     Or the whole of Manhattan stretches uptown from you.\n\nI was delighted with the Ludlow.   The staff were friendly, the rooms were good (it might be worth asking for one that doesn't face the street - there's a constant stream of cab drivers outside, which means a lot of horns), the meals and drinks were good, and we wandered around the Lower East Side very happily, if a bit footsore after a week.   Highly recommended, and I hope to return...","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I decided to try The Ludlow - liked what I read online (reviews), the neighbourhood and the fact that it was designed by the same people who did The Bowery Hotel (I've probably stayed there 100 times).  I had a king loft with small terrace and loved the room.  People - don't complain about the size of the room when you haven't done your research - their website clearly states the size and the studios are small (190 sq feet) so if you can't handle that don't book or or complain about it!!  The elevators move quickly most of the time but I found when it was backed up it was often staff using them (housekeeping mostly) and I think it would have been wise to have a separate elevator for service vs. guests.  Thought Dirty French was good and loved the neighborhood in general, so many great restaurants and shops.  Easy walk to the east and west village & soho, whole foods close by, subways etc.  My only wish would be to provide complimentary water at turn down service - Bowery does it as well as provide a little snack, I always thought that was a nice touch.  I think the front desk could be a little friendlier but the doormen were very good.  Nice gym, nice views of the city from the room and rooftop terrace; gorgeous property - bar\/lounge and covered outdoor area lovely.

The series of mishaps were as follows:  We checked in at 3:30 p.m., and the process was much longer than it should have been as were told that \"I have to move some things around.\"  That was a strange thing to hear during check in, but it was repeated twice.  \"I am sorry; I have to move some things around.\"  We finally proceeded to our room only to find that the temp in the room was 78 degrees, and the AC would not work.  I called the front desk and they told me to wait 10 minutes for it to \"kick in.\"  I nicely assured the front desk staff that I am very good with hotel AC units and am quite sure that it is not working, but he asked me to please try waiting.  After 10 min, I called back and told them the AC wasn't working.  A second gentlemen asked me to flip the fan switch from \"auto\" to \"on,\" and that should fix the problem.  I assured him that I really don't think the AC is working, but he asked to try this and please wait another ten minutes. He was sure that would fix the problem.  Ten minutes later I called back to tell them the AC wasn't working.  \"Oh,\" I was told...\"Did we send up a mechanic?\"  \"No,\" I said, you told me twice to wait 10 minutes.\"  So they sent up a mechanic, who told us that yes, they have had several units that day that have needed to be \"reset.\"    He proceeded to do what he had to do, and 45 minutes after we got to our room, we were finally able to leave the room, comfortable that the AC was fixed.  It is very puzzling why the folks at the front desk did not seem to know what the mechanic told us, and why they did not send him up right away.  \n   The following morning, a strange and unpleasant sulfur smell came from AC vent.  This lasted about an hour, then gradually faded, but it was enough to wake us and make us a bit nauseated.  \n   Then we went out for breakfast and returned to check out.  We got back to the room at 11:53 a.m., and although we were assured that check out time was indeed noon time, our room key no longer worked.  So we had to go back down to the desk, and they had to send someone up with us to unlock the room.  We were told that the key might stop working after check out time.  I told him that, no, I got back to the room at 11:53 a.m., and he told me \"yes, the keys sometimes stop working around that time.\"  That made absolutely no sense to us, and was the final of the comedy of errors that we experienced.  It seems that the Ludlow has some very serious kinks to work out.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If only the receptionists could bother to look you in the eye! Cold and cursory at best. \nA chic reception space gives on to a warm and buzzy bar. Quite a small space for the number of guests, but comfortable and good to meet people.\nThe elevator must be one of the slowest on the lower East Side. You think twice about dashing back to the room. The stairs are quicker.\nThe room was good. Stylishly fitted out, truly comfortable bed and a chic bathroom. Could do with some more drawers or shelves to store clothes, but good and welcoming space. \nWe checked in late and wanted to eat in the hotel. The restaurant was fully booked. We were met again by the cold and unapologetic staff, advised to 'try down the street'. Of course, we should have booked ahead, but just some charm would have worked.\nBreakfast is brisk and slight; just some self-service coffee and buffet items in the bar area. It's fine if a little functional. I would recommend finding a diner round the block.\nSo - stay here if you want a good room but you don't need to hang around.

There wasn't much of a welcome and given how tucked out the way they are it seems they're kept away from guests.\n\nOur rate included breakfast at the equally disappointing dirty French. Given the room rate we were expecting more than granola or pastries, we were even charged for a slice of toast to replace these items which I couldn't eat - which seemed mean.\n\nIndeed most of our stay felt about what wasn't available or included versus 'welcome thank you for staying'. The tone in the welcome manuals, signs and staff is all a bit too cool for school and here we found the famous American hospitality utterly lacking.\n\nThe location was quite convenient and there's some nice spots around.

Front desk people are helpful and responsive. The public spaces are quite to my liking -- Lower East Side vibe with a cutting edge, but still comfortable. The courtyard garden sitting area is particularly cool and restful.\n\nThe connection to the excellent Dirty French restaurant is a huge plus.\n\nBe careful when choosing a room. Go big or go home. I had a King Loft with Terrace and it was not huge but the outdoor access made it feel more spacious. The clothes hanging space in the wardrobe was inadequate and the bathroom was small. The robes and bath towels are skimpy. These are little things that the hotel could improve very easily.\n\nAlthough I had requested more than once that the second room, occupied by my (grown) children, be located near mine. They were placed in a room a dozen floors below and had a view of cars in a stacked parking garage. A polite request resulted in a room switch the next day. Unless you are getting a super-great rate, avoid room on the east lower floors.\n\nThe roof terrace could be spruced up and serviced. At the moment, it seems like a wasted asset. On the other hand, the lobby and courtyard areas are good choices for a post-shopping drink.\n\nAnyone who is a little tired of the more touristy areas will love the history and authenticity of this neighbourhood.

My husband and I are savvy packers but found it difficult to store the few clothes we did have.\n\nThe bathroom is a very nice size, showers are excellent however the towels were frayed on the edges, something I think shouldn't happen in a $400 per night hotel, and there was also a very noticeable hole in the bathmat.\n\nThe saving grace of this particular hotel room was the terrace.\n\nWe had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning, and were asked if we were guests of the hotel, keep in mind it was not super busy we were still asked to wait and then watched how another couple was seated before us even though they arrived later than we did. The waiter then claimed that he didn't speak to us initially and only after approaching him then proceeded to seat us.\n\nThe boys at the front door where always very helpful and friendly, hotel also offers to store your bags on check out until you need to come back for them to continue your trip.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had been clear when I booked that one room needed to have twin beds but on arrival this was not the case ( not entirely saying fault of the hotel ) The problems arose when we tried to resolve the issue - the reception staff did not appear to be interested and we felt demonstrated a poor attitude for a hotel of this calibre. We managed the first night by requesting a bed be made up in the sitting area. \nThe hotel is very stylish and the decor is great , it no doubt attracts a very trendy clientele and anyone wishing to experience the buzz  of New York would enjoy the hotel but it is very noisy, street noise until well into the early hours but also lots of noise of people chatting in the corridors after 2am. The final straw for us came when we tried the 'complimentary ' breakfast  which was supposed to be part of the Easter promotion - this was 1 item only from a choice of 3 - fruit , yoghurt or pastries and a drink . ( even a different milk had to be paid for ) . None of this had been made clear when the booking was made and we have never before experienced such limitations on a complimentary breakfast.\nWe ate in the onsite restaurant for dinner on arrival and the food was fabulous - very highly recommended.\nWe checked out after the first night and the Manager was apologetic but on this occasion the hotel just did not work for us.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Just in Ludlow Street where (predictably!) the hotel is situated there were a dozen great bars and four of five top class restaurants. Thai, Japanese, French, Italian - and that's before you add Dirty French in The Ludlow to the list.\nAfter The Ludlow organised a car from JFK, we arrived at the hotel and were greeted impeccably. Already the lobby bar was buzzing and our reservation at Dirty French was waiting. Even if you're a resident, don't chance your arm that you'll get a table, book at least two weeks in advance, it's that popular.\nGreat decor in the lobby, bar and restaurant, totally in keeping with the hotel's cutting edge reputation and our room matched perfectly. Let's be fair, NYC rooms are infamously small but our 7th floor dwelling definitely didn't come in the 'shoebox' category and with a big terrace overlooking the street which had a table and chairs and two loungers, we weren't complaining.\nDirty French was excellent although fatigue kicked in and we swerved the bar afterwards in favour of the biggest bed I've ever slept in.\nThe next morning we ventured out and with the subway at Delancey Street\/Essex Street just five minutes stroll, we began the most memorable week's trip in what is fast becoming my third favourite city (behind London and Rome).\nNot much else to add except every member of staff at The Ludlow was enthusiastic, warm, friendly and welcoming - there wasn't a single thing that was too much trouble. They gave New Yorkers a great name with none of the infamous attitude you sometimes find further Uptown.\nWe could walk comfortably to Greenwich Village, Soho and Tribeca and thanks to a recommendation from the hotel, we mooched up and down Bleecker St a couple of times and got a real feel for that part of the city.\nThree restaurant recommendations if you're going. Try Catch opposite the Gansevoort Hotel near Chelsea Market for outstanding seafood and sushi. If it's decent weather, try and get a table on the roof terrace.\nMezzaluna on the Upper East Side is the best traditional Italian I've had anywhere for a long, long time and, finally, Via Carota in Grove Street off Bleecker in the West Village for lunch takes some beating.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After lots and lots of research, I chose The Ludlow based on location, reviews and the cost during the Easter weekend as most hotels had upped their price significantly for the holiday. The Ludow prices were also a bit higher than usual during this holiday weekend (as expected), but with some added perks such as free continental breakfast during our stay as well as a free drink for each of us. Score! I had reserved a King Studio and requested a higher room just so that I would possibly be able to see the skyline at night. It was a long shot but I figured I would ask. Man on man did they deliver. I should have taken a picture of the room I stayed in (which was room 1506) as the view was wonderful.  We had a small balcony with a table and two chairs in which we were able to sit out and have a cocktail. (Yes it was a little cold but we sucked it up and because the view was really nice). The room itself was small but still very quaint and the both of us were able to move around the room just fine. The bed was huge and so comfortable, with the TV situated on the wall at the foot of bed so that on our lazy Saturday evening, after much debate as to whether or not to brave the cold weather at night once more and after walking all over NYC both Friday and all day Saturday, we decided to stay in, watch TV, drink some more cocktails, eat pizza, and just relax in our comfy bed which is something we rarely do seeing as we both live thousands of miles apart.  (We also underestimated just how cold it was going to be and did not bring heavy coats with us just jackets and sweaters). The bathroom was small but quite beautiful.

There are lots of other new hotels springing up in a neighborhood so it's fun to pop in and out for a look at their decor, and drinks. My favorite things about the hotel: the fireplace in the bar area with great art around it, the cozy little garden area out back, and our breakfasts in the restaurant with the friendly (and funny) waitstaff. The service in the bar left us cold, though. We spent a bit of time there all three nights of our stay, whether meeting our friends before a night out, or concluding the evening with a nightcap. We found that whether they were busy or not, the female server we had didn't seem to love her job much. The bar manager (?) was great though and fun to see in his creative outfits. The room is on the small side for sure, but comfortable. We were initially told we could have a late check-out and then told we couldn't, which was disappointing.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel features a very popular late night bar with great cocktails and service, a restaurant (Dirty French) which unfortunately we didn\u2019t get to try and a small, but adequate rooftop gym for those that need to run off those late night excesses.  The surrounding area offers a host of bars and restaurants to try whilst still in walking distance to the East Village, Chinatown or Soho.  Try Iggys just up the street for a local feel.\n\nThe Loft room we stayed in is strangely laid out for a hotel but very much matches the apartments and spaces of Downtown Manhattan.  Wonderful high beamed ceilings are a feature with a separate sitting room consisting of day bed and flat screen TV to greet you on entrance.  This is followed by a 12-15 foot hallway and offset bathroom.  The hallway leads to the King-sized bedroom with additional seating facilities (2 chairs and a lounge with coffee table) - again with a flat screen TV.  The bed was large but uncomfortably soft for my taste; as I\u2019ve said in other reviews I prefer a firm mattress and pillows.  This bed and pillows were seriously soft.  \n\nOther than the bed, the room was a great size with mini-bar and a good room service menu from the restaurant downstairs.  The separate sitting room offered options to those seeking some quiet TV whilst your partner sleeps.\n\nThe bathroom was spacious with a combined deep bath and shower.  I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for older or less mobile guests as it was a struggle to get into and out of though the bath was great for soaking. \n\nWiFi was free and laundry service available but we chose to use the next day Laundromat on the next corner.  $10 for a 10lb load.\n\nNegatives, the staff were friendly but there were some problems.  Check-in was a hassle but some responsibility rests on my shoulders as my name wasn\u2019t on the reservation, I was given a key and sent to an already occupied room (not good, this should never ever happen as it breaches security - thank God for the separate sitting room, I once did walk in on a couple when the same thing happened elsewhere) and whilst this is a good hotel you need to be aware that it is also a very, very popular night spot.  My recommendation, this is an hotel for the young visiting NYC to party but still wanting exceptional rooms and quality of service.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were always asked by the front desk and valets where we where going and if we needed any help.They often added their own suggestions to our plans which always made our plans that much better.\n\nThe bartenders in the lobby lounge kept the easy flow going at the bar with great drinks for mom and dad, complete with handmade sodas for the kids.\n\nMark (from Brooklyn) at the front door was especially helpful to us.

Very nicely decorated with a poster bed and modern bath. The view was fantastic and the terrace was the ideal place to enjoy a drink as the sun set. \n\nLocation. The lower east side is ideal for downtown or Soho and you're an easy taxi ride anywhere else you want to go. You'll find Katz's deli on the corner and if you want a hip place for dinner and dancing, check out Beauty and Essex which is a block away.

There is also a floor lamp and a TV in this room.\n\nFrom the first bedroom you pass through into a short narrow hallway with a wall-mounted coat rack and door to the bathroom.\n\nThru the hallway you come to the larger bedroom with queen bed, slightly larger closet than the 1st bedroom, which has mini fridge and safe in it. There is a wall-mounted TV facing the bed, long narrow wall table with small capsule coffee maker, sitting area with sofa, 2 chairs & coffee table next to a window overlooking Ludlow Street. \n\nOverall the rooms feel comfortable, welcoming, like you are in a home and not a hotel, but they are \u201ccozy\u201d. Not a lot of space to move around in between the furniture. At least the beds are high enough that you can store your suitcases under them.\n\nSLEEP QUALITY\/BEDS\nThe beds and bedding themselves were very comfortable, with soft sheets, and I think pillow-top mattresses. However the pillows were all very thin and soft. We asked for extra and had to pile them up. All four of us would have preferred firmer pillows.\n\nThe interior room by the door is obviously the more quiet and darker one. The larger room facing the street was also quiet with good blackout curtains. None of us had a complaint about light or noise.\n\nBATHROOM\nThe bathroom is beautifully decorated with brass fixtures, a deep bathtub and a large very well lit mirror above the single sink. There is a magnifying mirror hinged to the wall, hairdryer, good quality shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand soap and toothpaste. Towels were clean and soft. There are plenty of hooks for towels, and 2 bathrobes. There is a full-length mirror on the inside of bathroom door. DRAWBACKS: There is limited space to store toiletries. There is just a small sink surround and a small sill under the mirror. No shelves or drawers. We were 3 women getting ready each day, so that was challenging. The vanity lights all around the mirror are beautiful but really heat up the bathroom quickly. If you have a shower the glass partition mounted on the tub is not enough to stop the water from flowing onto the floor. We had to use the bathmat and several hand towels to absorb the water from each shower.\n\nHEATING\/AIR CON\nIt was very very cold in NYC during our stay. There is 1 thermostat in the suite, which was easy to use and quickly adjusted. Note that the larger room with window is always going to be a different temperature than the interior room by the door.\n\nFITNESS ROOM\nThis is a small room with 2 treadmills, a reclining bike, 2 cross-trainers, mirrors and free-weights. Awesome views over Manhattan. There is a water dispenser and cups, complimentary apples, and paper-towels dispenser. Not a lot of floor space.\n\nWIFI\nFree wifi with good speed throughout the hotel rooms and common areas. No need to enter a code.\n\nCLEANLINESS\nWe found all areas, the rooms, bathroom, linens, hallways, dining areas and fitness center immaculate. Everything was very clean and in good condition.\n\nSERVICE\nThe service was very friendly but casual. Not cloying or pretentious. The wait staff, doormen and housekeeping staff all were very friendly but not tip mongering, which is refreshing in NYC. Several times we asked at the front desk for suggestions of the best pizza, best Mexican in the neighborhood and they definitely came through! \n\nBAR\/LOUNGE\nThis area on the ground floor is decorated very hip, but cozy. Deep leather sofas, low lighting, a fireplace, a garden terrace area that is heated. Drinks are pricey but expertly mixed and you are paying for the atmosphere. It is a very popular lounge in the area, attracting older couples, business people, but mostly 20\/30-something very trendy people. The music is loud and, I\u2019m not sure if it is ironic, but when we were there it was mostly 80s rock ballads. Trip down memory lane\u2026\n\nDIRTY FRENCH RESTAURANT\nWe had breakfast one morning in the Dirty French, which is also very popular with locals. There are comfy leather booths and eclectic kitsch d\u00e9cor. The food was amazing. Everything. Our table had the eggs benedict, French toast and the duck hash. They bring you complimentary homemade pastries before your food arrives. The coffee was very good and free refills. I had a Bloody Mary, which was one of the best I\u2019ve had. Our waiter Kenyon was very friendly and knowledgeable. We just loved him. He made a small mistake with our order but it was quickly rectified and he brought complimentary sparkling wine as an apology before we even noticed the mistake. Totally unnecessary, but much appreciated!\n\nTO IMPROVE\nA few things that would have improved our stay:\n-Better selection of pillows\n-More space to store toiletries in the bathroom\n-Better partition to keep shower water from running onto floor\n-A mirror in each bedroom to allow for grooming outside of the crowded bathroom. Even just a mirror mounted on the inside of the closet doors would do.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll in my party would definitely stay again. The price point matches the location, amenities and overall feel of the hotel.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

First impressions were great, the room was a good size (Skybox Loft) with great views and a lovely bathroom. \n\nThe staff on reception were friendly throughout the stay and the location was perfect for us. You can take a leisurely walk anywhere throughout the City, get a cab to central NYC for about $10 or get on the Subway which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel.\n\nWe had a few problems with our stay. The first issue was a security guard banging on our door at 2am when we were asleep. He thought that we\u2019d phoned reception to say that somebody was running around, knocking on doors in the middle of the night. We had been asleep for 3 hours and no idea what was going on. It was a little disconcerting but the manager was brilliant the next day, offered us a bottle of wine and apologised profusely. This was absolutely fine as it was obviously an honest, unfortunate mistake.\n\nThe second problem was slightly more annoying. At 5am the fire alarm started going off and didn\u2019t stop for almost 2 hours. There was no fire and there was a constant voice telling us that it was a test. At about 6am I went to reception to enquire and there were quite a few unhappy customers there. It turns out that there was a problem in a kitchen which was causing the alarm. The hotel, once again, dealt with this very well, refunded our evening\u2019s stay and apologised for the mishap. \n\nThe reception staff were great throughout and dealt with all problems swiftly. The final problem has come since we\u2019ve returned to the UK. The bill that they served us when we were leaving had charged us for room service that another room had ordered. We realised this in the taxi on the way to the airport so messaged the Ludlow upon out return to the UK. We didn\u2019t receive a response for a week so sent a chase email which they then followed up, informing us that they had made a mistake and that the money would be refunded. This then didn\u2019t appear in our account for a further 5 days, which would have been fine. They then took the money back out of the account, put it back in again and finally, after a further week, removed the money from the account again. We\u2019ve had to instruct our bank to not accept any more withdrawals from the Ludlow as it appears they are taking money which is rightfully ours. \n\nSo after a great hotel stay, in what is a lovely hotel with amazing bedrooms, views and bathrooms, we now have an incredibly sour taste in our mouths as the hotel has essentially stolen money from our bank account. The rating that I've given is based on the hotel overall and not the terrible post stay service that we have received.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They gave us plenty of tips ie walk the Brooklyn bridge from the Brooklyn side rather than the Manhattan end to take full advantage of the NY skyline (in our excitement we would have done the opposite!).\nWe were celebrating our recent wedding and my 50th birthday and were delighted to find a bottle of champagne waiting for us on arrival. \nWe booked a Skybox Loft as we wanted the great views. A smidgeonly gripe was we would have preferred to have been higher up (we were on Floor 8 of 20). Also the room does not have much in the way of storage space - but we were aware of this prior to booking. Otherwise the room was amazing and the bed super comfy. Top quality furnishings and fixtures. A well stocked minibar for those who wish to indulge but we managed to abstain. Great and roomy bathroom - robes and hairdryer provided. The room was scrupulously clean. The wifi worked perfectly every time. The air con was quite noisy. \nWe ate the complimentary breakfast each day - my husband plumbed for the delicious granola and I had fresh fruit. On New Years Day it was a free service affair which we felt worked better than the waiter service of the other mornings. \nOn our day of departure the hotel arranged us a private transfer to the airport - we were so tired we had no energy to battle on the subway. The car was more like a limousine for the same price as a local cab - we were so grateful for this service. \nOn return we found we had been overcharged by mistake - however this was sorted out quickly when we contacted the hotel. \nWe would like to extend our thanks to all at The Ludlow - as cool a hotel as it is we older guests never felt out of place.

The hotel itself is well-done in a cross-over style of what I would call cozy \"modern chalet\" with some faux antique elements such as brass furnishings in the bathroom. We had a Skybox Room on the 11th floor which had a small living room section with windows on three sides and nice views over Downtown Manhattan. The bar downstairs is lively and quite nice for an aperitif, though the cocktails are ok but not outstanding. Be prepared to listen to an 80's music soundtrack there, which seems to be a hipster thing in that area of town but which is quite funny when you actually lived through that time in your own youth ... It is also a rather short walk to the more upscale shopping areas of Nolita and SoHo so overall a very good choice for a nice long weekend in the City.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was traveling with my husband and my two teens and we were all so thrilled with this hotel.  The public spaces are exactly as they appear in their website plus beautiful holiday decor.  The rooms looked great on the website and I felt they actually were better in person.  We had the Ludlow double which had a queen bed in the first room as you entered and then a king size bed along with a sitting area in the second room as you move towards the window.  In this set up the bathroom separates the two rooms.  The bathroom was very spacious.\nThe staff was friendly and professional and I particularly appreciated our fellow Floridian who checked us in.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay.\n\nRoom \/ facilities - we had a fifth floor room and a view of Ludlow street. Other reviewers have commented in the past about traffic noise being excessive but we didn't find this at all. Our bed was large and comfortable. The pillows were slightly too soft for me but this is a minor problem. The bedside tables are big enough only for a telephone. The bathroom was fantastic. The room was cleaned daily and spotless when we returned, the cleaning staff deserve compliments. The minibar is very extensive, it is however expensive but no more so than other large hotels I've stayed at in other cities.\n\nWifi - the hotel wifi is free, and seems to run prefect.y well. I was able to stream television programmes without any significant delay. \n\nBreakfast - we arrived for breakfast between 7 and 9 every day and were always welcomed by very friendly staff and were seated within a minute of getting there. The menu is good and the complimentary \/ free items were always pointed out by e waiting staff. We had the eggs, French toast and some of the other items. Can honestly say the food was great and the chef should be praised. The service from the waiting staff was extremely good, the only issue I had was that 1 or two items which we ordered didn't arrive with the main breakfast. The layout of the restaurant means that it can be difficult for the waiting staff to see if you need a refill of your coffee, this happens if you are sat behind a post. We were given a free breakfast on one morning because of a delay in it arriving, the restaurant did this without any prompting or complaints from us. The only slight issue we had with the restaurant \/ kitchen was with room service, when the food arrived it was lukewarm.\n\nOther - to get to the upper floors the only way seems to be by the elevator. It doesn't take very long for them to arrive but they are shared by the hole staff so can be crowded. We wanted to use the stairs to get a bit of exercise but couldn't find the ground floor exit. I'm not sure if the hotel has a policy on guests using the stairs but I'm sure we're not the only people who'd like the option of doing so. The hotel staff are all very friendly and accommodating and I found them uniformly excellent. \n\nWe were very happy with the hotel and aside from a couple of minor issues would quite happily stay here again.

It had a very cool vibe and was just off Houston. It's right down the street from the infamous Katz's deli (think Harry met Sally scene). Some good shopping was close by (Rag and Bone, fun Tom's store) and a pretty quick walk (say 10-15 minutes) to the great shopping of SoHo. It's definitely a haul to Flatiron and Midtown, but I think that's part of the fun of NY is walking everywhere. So...back to the Ludlow. Its definitely very hip and cool. They have a great little bar that is also a celebrity hangout...we had a great encounter with a celeb....all I gotta say is #ointb! Dirty French is also located within the hotel. Breakfast was included with our room which we ate once. The hotel was always bustling and fun. We stayed on the 14th floor in a skybox loft. I would definitely recommend that room. It had a queen bed (we usually sleep in a king but whatevs) but the best part was a 270 degree view from a cute little sitting area. The LES doesn't have super tall buildings so you could really see a lot of the city. The bathroom is pretty small but has super trendy brass fixtures which were cool. There was one small (tiny) closet and no dresser space so my husband had to keep most of his stuff in his suitcase on the floor. We stayed in the heart of it all in midtown in January at a fabulous luxury hotel but was glad for the neighborhood feel of the Ludlow during the insanely busy Christmas season. It was nice to be able to walk up to midtown, experience the madness, and then retreat to your nice little neighborhood hotel. All in all if you're looking for a trendy, nice fun place to stay that's off the beaten path (is there such a thing in NYC?) then I highly recommend the Ludlow.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had contacted the hotel prior to our arrival to ask if they could try and acknowledge my daughters 21st birthday in some way when we arrived in our room. This was the purpose of our trip. They said they would have a \"birthday amenity\" package sent over. We were also meant to have a free bottle of red wine with our booking.

When I mentioned it to reception, they offered to go out and buy a cake which I'd have to pay minimum $35 dollars for, plus a $10 runners fee!

The only problem is the designers of this cool new hangout have spent far too much on the design and not enough on the the little things which actually count. When we booked the room we booked it with breakfast included but to our surprise at breakfast on day 1, hotel guests are limited to 3 small choices! In all honesty I would rather have not had the breakfast included at all but my feedback would be to review this policy. It just leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The rooms are very nice and well designed but small. Remember in NYC rooms with size are rare and come with a hefty price tag.

Needless to say, the service was exceptional.  It's a brand new hotel, so obviously clean and fresh.  The decor is contemporary hipster, tastefully done with faux fur throws on the luxe purple chairs and beautiful hardwood furniture.  The bathroom is very cool with a Keith McNally restaurant feel.  We had a virtually unobstructed city view and we could even see the Williamsburg Bridge and did not experience any street noise.  The rooftop offers a fantastic 360 view of downtown.  The complimentary continental breakfast offers a nice spread, and you can even enjoy it in their garden courtyard.

Beyond what is a pretty funky space in the foyer (which is not without charm and ambience) the hotel itself is what lets it down.\n\nLittle Space: The smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in - in my life. Barely able to walk around the bed. We booked one of the higher categories of rooms described as a \"Queen Suite\" higher up with views. The room was NOT a suite. It was a bed and a very narrow space for walking around it. Cramped and no where to even leave your bags. The absence of space is so bad it shows in things like: in the bathroom the toilet paper dispenser is hidden underneath the sink; the ironing board is more an ironing plate (being one of those tiny dinky jobs that you set up on a table top except there was no table surface in the room large enough to put it on so you have to balance the little board - with hot iron - on the uneven surface of the bed).\n\nLittle Breakfast - a pet hate of mine this is one of those hotels that forces you to pay for the \"breakfast included\" option - but then when you turn up you discover that you have paid for breakfast but are only allowed two or three very limited options and that for all the normal breakfast goodies you need to pay up like everyone else. So unless filter coffee, orange juice and some fruit are what you want when travelling on holiday or business - assume the already inflated room price is exclusive of breakfast. \n\nLittle internet - wifi is patchy to non existent in the rooms - again all effort is spent on the lobby where internet is normal. \n\nLittle Value - in a city renown for overpriced hotels - and one I have travelled to on dozens of occasions in recent years - The LudLow Hotel stands out as a prime example of an overpriced hotel, with some cool public facing bits but which misses the mark as a place to stay. The breakfast restrictions make you feel cheap and nasty. There are no features to justify the price you pay, not location, not view (very uninspiring in a  city with plenty to inspire), no add ons to make the place feel special.\n\nIf you want my advice - maybe go to The Ludlow for a drink in the bar one night (quiet but happening crowd) or maybe a brunch and stay somewhere else in the area (there are plenty of options that may not be cheaper but give you much more bang for your buck).","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The bath was wonderful, its size was for 2 people, and we had views of the city from the window next to it. The bath with a glass of red wine made our day happy.\n\nOther weird point for a hotel of this category was the elevators... Only 2 elevators for a 20 floors hotel is not enough. And to make it worst they had NO service elevator. This was anoying for us the customers but overall for the service people who (very kindly) let the customers use the elevator before them. This made service staff wait and wait until the elevator was empty. This also made us stop in almost every floor.

The hotel's famed Dirty French restaurant is buzzing at night (and you get a table if you are staying in house) and the bar area is also a great bar with a relaxed energy. I loved the rooftop gym that is well equipped and the wifi works a treat.\n\nWe had a slight problem with our A\/C when we were there and a maintenance man was at our door in a matter of minutes. All room service and inquiries were answered super promptly.\n\nMy only gripe was that the continental breakfast was very light on and morning service can be slow (but very very friendly). I'd opt for the more expensive larger breakfasts - crepes, eggs etc. The Ludlow is a real East side gem. A round of applause!!!","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":6727310,"title":"Very disappointed","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-09-26","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"I booked the Ludlow having fallen in love with the pictures of the room and the area in which it is located.  It was a birthday trip for my boyfriend so I wanted the hotel to be excellent which is what I thought we would get at a five star boutique hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel did not meet our expectations. \n\nI will begin with the positive points. The decor of the hotel is excellent and our room was clean (but small) with an excellent view. The food (breakfast) in the hotel was very good. The area is great for bars and restaurants.\n\nThe main negative point of our experience concerned check-in\/payment. I had booked on booking.com and had selected a \"pay later\" option i.e. pay on check out. When we arrived to check-in, they asked for a bank card. I explained that we would be paying in cash - we had changed money in the UK to obtain the best exchange rate and avoid paying the fees associated with using our cards in the US. I was told that this was fine but that they still needed a card for us to be able to check in. What was not explained to me was that the hotel would be freezing the full booking amount plus incidentals from that card - near $2000. We did not expect this to be the case as no hotel has done this to either of us before. We are frequent travellers (although primarily in Europe) and are familiar with having to provide a card and even pay a deposit - but never the full amount. We were told this was to protect the hotel in case guests left without paying - which was a bit surprising Do people do this? Are hotels not insured against that? After some difficulty with the payment, we settled the bill on day 3 in full in cash. However, after doing so the hotel continued to extract smaller amounts from my account - near $200 - apparently this was automated and I will receive these amounts back but it could take \"up to 30 days\". Not ideal. \n\nAs a goodwill gesture, the hotel then offered us a complimentary breakfast (meaning items other than the 3 items the hotel offers as part of the rate). When we came to check-out this complimentary breakfast had not been communicated in our guest history. This led to a very awkward conversation where we (a) had to convince the front desk staff we weren't trying to skip paying the $42 bill and (b) the person who offered us the complimentary breakfast didn't have the authority to do so. Eventually the hotel agreed to remove the cost of the breakfast from our bill. To be honest, it was extremely embarrassing to have to \"fight\" over such a small amount and what should have been a nice gesture turned into another difficult experience.\n\nOther, more general negative points were:\n\n(a) staff attitudes at the front desk and at the hotel bar\/restaurant were poor and inattentive. As a general rule it would take 10 minutes after being seated to be served and when we were often served the wrong items or items were not brought out at all (not a huge issue when it's part of the complimentary breakfast but still not great). We felt the attitude of the staff was deliberate as the hotel strives for a \"cool\" and \"laid back\" image. \n\n(b) staff use of the hotel elevators. It seems that the hotel does not have a service elevator, so cleaners and other staff would use the same elevators as we did. Our room was on the 11th floor and it was a little annoying to get into an empty elevator and then have it stop multiple times on the way to the ground floor for staff to get in and out.\n\nFor guests who just want to get out and see New York these things were just annoying and frustrating.\n\nIn summary - this hotel has the potential to be incredible (great location, great views, good food) but the service does not fit with the standard that the hotel is trying to attain. Based on our experiences on this trip, we would not be able to recommend this hotel to others. ","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I loved both!  The Ludlow has the most comfortable beds ever. Really. Seriously! In fact we loved the hotel - liked its style, found the staff friendly and the breakfasts great (although worth noting that the inclusive options are very limited and hot breakfasts are charged for). Still, it wasn't a big issue. Occasionally the breakfast service was a bit erratic but always with a smile! We stayed in a King Studio which was absolutely fine (the bed, the bed!) and with a very nice bathroom but I'd have loved to have stayed in one of the loft suites not least because they're higher up the building. One small gripe - if you're staying there for a few nights, you'll probably struggle with the rather inadequate wardrobe space. It's worth requesting, as in any hotel, a room away from the lift. The streets of NYC aren't exactly quiet so if you need absolute silence, pack earplugs but, from my previous experience, that applies to pretty much any city hotel!  The views from the roof top are amazing. There's no bar up there but there is furniture and we simply took our drinks up there one early evening as the sun was setting. The hotel's bar is buzzing but has a really cool, relaxed, vibe.  So, there maybe a few minor niggles but I'd return to the Ludlow in a heartbeat. I thought it was much better value than any other Manhattan hotel that I've stayed in previously.  There are loads of restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and it's a very easy walk to Soho etc. \n\n","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The staff on reception were very helpful and always very attentive, welcoming you every time you entered the hotel. The rooms were absolutely stunning, we were on the 16th floor so had excellent views towards the Williamsburg ridge. The rooms are a touch on the small side but you get this in any big city like New York- where space is a premium.

As a bonus, they have a 20th floor patio area with tables and lounge chairs and indoor gym as well. \n\nThe vibe of the hotel is also a selling point.  It's cool, but not too cool where you feel like you don't belong.  The decor was 1920s speakeasy.  A lot of tile, wood, leather and brass.  The staff was really friendly and it felt more like staying in an apartment than a hotel, complete with a doorman and restaurant downstairs.\n\nThe location is the best in my opinion.  Lower East Side has turned into such cool neighborhood and is walking distance (15 minutes) to Soho.  On Friday and Saturday nights, Ludlow street is packed!  There are a ton of bars\/lounges\/restaurants around so be prepared for a lot of people on the streets.  That's what makes New York...New York!  Once you step into the hotel you can get away from all of the street noise and chaos.  We heard zero street noise in our room...maybe because we were on the 18th floor. Actually we never heard doors slamming or other guests on our floor which is unusual in a hotel.\n\nThe room itself was great!  The Skybox Loft has a separate seating area with two chairs and a small couch.  The bathroom was large for a hotel room, especially in New York .

The Ludlow is such a unique and stylish hotel. The bed in the hotel room was nick named 'the cloud' because it was so insanely comfortable! The hotel is near to lots of quirky restaurants, buzzing bars and pretty little shops. It is situated between the famous Clinton Street Bakery and Katz deli. It is sometimes a little loud at night but this didn't bother me in the slightest as you'll hear car horns and voices in most parts of the city late night\/early morning.\n\nAll tourist landmarks are a taxi ride away but you can walk it too. My mum and I got a taxi to the Highline (would definitely recommend this) and walked most of the way towards manhattan, we walked all the way up to central park - easily done but if you're short on time I'd recommend taking a cab. \n\nThe hotel was brilliant service wise. Breakfast had only three complimentary options but all were delicious, especially the coconut parfait with fresh granola which was ideal for me as I'm gluten intolerant. The concierge was wonderful at organising black cabs, booking restaurants, printing boarding passes and providing information about anything we needed. \n\nI would definitely stay here again, it was so lovely to feel like part of NYC rather than just a visiting tourist.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

This hotel exceeded all of our expectations, especially for NYC. We paid $328\/night for a skybox loft. The bathroom had a huge soaking tub and rain shower, the bed was gorgeous and super comfortable, and we loved the glass-enclosed sitting room with great views of the city. The rooms, and the whole hotel, had a very modern, luxurious vibe. We never heard any hotel or outside noise while in our room, though because the skybox rooms are at the end of the hall there likely was more privacy. The bar was great and had a hip, fun, but not-too-packed ambiance, even on a Friday night. We only went to the restaurant for the breakfast included in the room. It was pretty basic (croissants, fruit, and yogurt parfait, plus juice and coffee), but it was a sit-down affair, and did the trick. The staff was always very friendly and accommodating, and we especially were impressed that they didn't bat an eye when we asked to check in 3 hours early. The neighborhood was super fun--tons of cute bars, restaurants, coffee shops, pizza joints, delis, you name it, and close to several subway stations. It's funny, usually on a trip I don't really look forward to going back to my hotel room at night, but here I couldn't wait to get back to the neighborhood to get a drink and then retreat to my cozy, chic, clean room in the sky. We are in our early 30s, and this hotel seemed well-suited to young professionals and couples. We loved the Ludlow, and were sad to leave!","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It seems to be a real hotspot right now.\n\nNow to the negative point: service! It is very good at the restaurant and housekeeping\/room service, but 90% absent at the front door and mainly at the reception desk. Having thought during my first stay this was an exception, it has been confirmed almost as a motto during the 8 nights I just spent there. No \"Hello\", \"Good morning\", \"Welcome back\", \"Have a nice day\", \"Could I help you?\", \"No problem, let me see...\"... Even a basic smile to give you the feeling you are welcome. If it was just one person you would see it as an exception and an error of youth, but the feeling of arrogance and complete lack of interest in who you are, each time you pass the door, can be sensed across the board with everybody there.

Beautifully styled. Young, cool staff. Great location.\nThe rooms are well appointed with an interesting un-hotelish decor. They are in the small side, but that's New York real estate for you!\nThe biggest negative by far, and the constant conversation with other guests was the slowness of the elevators. With 2 elevators servicing all the guests and the staff it was way too slow. On several occasions the doors opened and there was no room to get in, as they were full with both guests and maid service trolleys. Other times guests just pushed on in, as they knew the wait for the next elevator would take some time. \nBreakfast was included, which was great. There seemed to be some confusion each morning over what exactly was included. The first morning we were offered all 3 items, the second morning we were \"guided\" to order 1 item and no juice was offered. The third morning the waitress took charge and decided what would be best for the table.  What we didn't understand was why there were only certain things available, when the prices shown reflected more options would be covered within the price range of the included breakfast. By day three the options feel limited.\nDinner at the restaurant was fantastic. Great menu, great food, great service. \nIf your familiar with New York, but not this part of town, it's an opportunity to explore a new neighbourhood. \nReading back, it sounds more negative than it really was.

It's just so convenient if you're visiting NYC for the best restaurants, cocktail bars and shopping\u2014even trips out to Brooklyn were easy. If you're sensitive to noise, you will probably notice street noise no matter what time of day, so bring earplugs or ask for a room on the other side of the building. It is LES so it's not quiet, like ever. If you want a peaceful stay, I would consider a different neighbourhood like the Upper West Side or get a room on a high floor in one of those huge hotels Midtown.\n\nBreakfast: Included in our stay was breakfast as Dirty French, the popular and hard-to-book restaurant in the lobby. Though guests are restricted to a few items, it is still an exceptional value-add to your stay. There is decent coffee, fresh squeezed OJ and good quality carbs\/fruit to get your day started. Easily worth $10-15\/pp per day.\n\nRoom: We were pleased to be upgraded to a King Studio which had a great amount of space by NYC standards. Very comfortable for two of us. My one complaint is that the air conditioner is loud and can start abruptly in the middle of the night. I also noticed that it drains through the same plumbing system in the shower and the dripping woke me up in the night. That was quickly resolved by tightening the faucet.\n\nOverall: We would definitely return for our next visit to NYC if we find reasonable rates. It's still a relatively new hotel so I suspect the prices will go up once people catch on.

Booked a queen room with a terrace, which turned out to be a great choice since the weather was so nice while we were there.  Rooms are small, but definitely not the smallest I ever stayed in while in NYC.  The bedroom was large enough for a queen size bed (very comfortable), two small chairs, and a side table and two small petrified wood-looking night stands.  Lighting is very cleverly mounted to the walls or pendants on the ceiling so it doesn't take up any more space on the floors or tables.  Not of ton of shelf or closet space. Bathroom was small, but had a good sized standing shower with good water pressure.  Rooms are pretty quiet and the door and windows to the terrace were double paned so you couldn't hear any street noise at all (we were on the 7th floor).  The terrace was the highlight, though - literally about as big as the bedroom with two low lounge chairs and dining room sized table with two chairs.  Great views and just an awesome place to hangout and have some wine (get some from September Wines down the block!).  I even took a nap on the terrace one afternoon.  \n\nSome other great things:\n- 20th floor is another great place to hang out - there is a fitness room up there, and a lovely area with lounge chairs with great views\n- Dirty French, the restaurant in the hotel, has great breakfast (that was included in our rate) and solid cocktails\n- Wi-fi is fast, which is great since it's free\n- Location is great - so close to many awesome places to eat (Katz's, Russ & Daughters, Mission Cantina, Beauty & Essex, etc.) and very close to a pretty convenient subway line\n- Super nice staff\n\nOverall, I highly recommend especially if you don't mind smaller than average rooms.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When you enter the hotel, you'll get the feeling that you're stepping into another era.  It's kind of dark, with leather couches and chairs in shades of brown. Behind the check-in desk you'll see shelving with \"keys\" for each room. Keys are actually magnetic key fobs that will let you open the door to your room.\n\nI didn't want to spend too much money, and knew that I just needed a bed to sleep in, so I got a Studio Full room...their smallest room. I would say that this room is good for one person.  I had one bag, which fit in the closet just fine, but if I had had suitcases the room would have felt even smaller.  AND if I had been traveling with someone, it would have been way too tight.  The decor of the room was charming, similar to what you would find in someone's guest room...a guest room of someone who has expensive and eclectic tastes with an interior designer's eye. The star of the room is the bathroom, which is bright white with old fashioned fixtures and tiled floors.  \n\nJust a quick note on service and amenities...bathrobe and slippers are provided.  There is a mini-bar, safe, free wifi in the room.  I forgot a shower cap and the front desk provided me with one.  I also let them know that a light in my room wasn't working. An engineer came up, changed the bulb and got it working probably about 10 minutes after my request.  I thought that response time was pretty good.  I was annoyed that the housekeeper knocked on my door the morning of my check out.  I'm pretty sure the housekeeping staff gets a list of who's checking out, so that they know the rooms they have to clean.  I don't think it's appropriate to knock on the doors of those guests due to leave, 2+ hours before check out time.  I was asleep when she knocked and could have stayed that way for a few more minutes.  Also, once I finally was up and leaving my room for breakfast around 10:45, I saw the housekeeper in the hall.  I had put the \"do not disturb\/ no\" sign on my door.  She looked at my door and gave an exasperated sigh...I guess she was bothered that she couldn't get in to my room and clean it. I did have breakfast in the restaurant, Dirty French.  The top portion of the breakfast menu is complimentary for hotel guests, as is coffee, tea or juice. I don't think this was mentioned anywhere when I booked the room, but I was told about it by the check-in desk and once again in the restaurant.\n\nAnyway, I think it was a really pleasant stay and I would return.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

We enjoyed the complimentary parfait and fruit each morning given that breakfast often isn't included in NY. \n\n- The maintenance team are very helpful - we unfortunately became well acquainted with them throughout our stay\n\nNow the negatives  \n\nThe rooms are small but that is a given with NYC although they are well laid out and nicely decorated. \n\nFront desk and management staff need to learn some customer service skills. \n\nThe basic utilities are poor and need immediate attention. The water in both the sink and bath are very slow draining to he point where a pool forms and the water takes ages to drain away. They were also dirty and never looked as though they had been cleaned properly. \n\nOur a\/c never worked properly - our room stayed a relatively constant 79 degrees although it did creep to 81 degrees on several occasions. Through this we became well acquainted with the maintenance team and their efforts to fix the problem. On one occasion the room was cool for two hours then heated up again making it pretty unbearable to sleep in. Each time we reported the problem to the front desk and were met with apathy at best. At no point did anyone follow up on the engineer's many visits. A call or email would have been expected at a minimum given that we had to call the engineer for three nights of our six night stay. The other three nights we didn't bother as it was clear that the issue was not being resolved. I also found that going to the frontdesk got a quicker response than calling them which was an even more fruitless experience. \n\nIt is our final night and another visit from maintenance has left us with a very noisy portable a\/c machine in the corner of our room - really not ideal as we now have the noise of that and the street. \n\nWe enquired about moving at 10:30 this evening having waited since 9pm for the a\/c to be looked at so we could actually get some sleep on our final night and this was met with hesitation and indifference. We were eventually and somewhat grudgingly told we could move rooms if we packed all of our things. I couldn't see the point of this as I am sure no one else would be prepared to stay in the room we are stuck in especially between now and tomorrow when we leave. \n\nTo sum it up, unfortunately disappointing on many levels. I would urge people to avoid, wishing we had sought alternative accommodation on night one. Will also be feeding back to Mr and Mrs Smith who we booked through - really not what I would expect from one of their hotels.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":6727310,"title":"Super-cool Lower East Side Hip Hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-07-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"The Ludlow is located in the hip, youthful and trendy Lower East Side - the best part of NYC if you ask me. The vibe is super-cool and Ludlow Street itself is filled with countless bars, boutiques, restaurants and is very lively at night. If that sounds like your kind of place, then the Ludlow is likely to be your kind of hotel. \n\nI think some reviews here are misleading partially because the Ludlow might not have been what the visitors were looking for in the first place. However, the hotel's website is a true reflection of the aesthetic of the hotel, and if you don't like it from the website you're not likely to like it in person. We LOVED it. \n\nThe style of the rooms, the lobby, the covered patio and the Dirty French restaurant were very much our cup of tea. The styling of the room we stayed in (a Skybox Loft - it's worth the extra if you can afford it) was gorgeous - exquisite throws, sofas, chairs and rugs. The views of Manhattan were astounding and the hotel gets serious brownie points from me for enabling guests to open the windows in their rooms. There have been some complaints here about the air con and the wifi in the rooms. Re: the air con, we never slept with it on at night anyway as the room had stayed cool during the day so it wasn't needed and re: the wifi issues, we had perfect access throughout our stay so maybe some teething problems have been fixed. \n\nIt's both unusual and fantastic to have breakfast included in the room rate and was definitely a selling point for me when we booked. Dirty French is a gorgeous place to eat breakfast (tiled floor, banquette seating, fluorescent pink cockerel statues (!!)) and start your day and the waiting staff were consistently brilliant - sweet, attentive and very hard working. Some reviewers have seemed disappointed by the range of items on offer but they were perfect for our tastes: a choice from granola, delicious pastries, fresh fruit, orange\/grapefruit juice and tea or coffee. If you do want to eat eggs\/pancakes etc these can be purchased at a supplementary cost. Seems fair enough to me. \n\nI have a top tip for future travellers, though. We found out on our last day that there was a roof terrace on the 20th floor! Unfortunately, no-one had told us about this when we checked in which was a shame as the views were great and the place was completely empty despite there being several sun loungers. There's no bar up there but we would've hung out there more had we known about it. \n\nAbove all, though, the Ludlow is the perfect place from which to explore the LES, Greenwich, the West Village and (crucially for us) it is super-near the Williamsburg Bridge which means you can walk into Brooklyn within forty minutes or take the F train and be there in ten. I think if you're exploring Manhattan as a family and want to see all the 'sights' then this is not the place for you, but if you're on a city break and want to pretend you actually live in NYC then it's ideal. \n\nSo be prepared for the hotel actually to be like the hotel it appears to be and you'll be happy. But if you're looking for a stuffier \/ more formal vibe, you're not going to get it at the Ludlow because that doesn't seem to be what it's trying to be about. \n\nPS - if you're still reading this long review, well done... but I have to write about the lift situation as so many people have written about it in their reviews. You DO have to wait for the lifts in this hotel. That is an indisputable fact, BUT the people you meet in that lift make it worth the wait! We waited with anticipation to see who would appear in the lift next: once again, if waiting for lifts annoys you then don't book into this hotel, but you'll miss out on meeting the most amazing range of diverse people.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The bathroom had an industrial glamour look and the bed was unbelievably comfy.  There has been lots of reviews where space has been an issue, but from what I have researched - most rooms in NYC are like this unless you are prepared to pay over the odds.  We were there only to sleep as we were busy site seeing, so for what we wanted it for the room size was fine.  Plenty of room under the bed for cases and a wardrobe for clothes.\n\nWIFI came free.

Thankfully, the fact you are in soho there is plenty to choose from.  So I would suggest you head out to eat.\n\nStaff were very friendly and accommodating to all your needs.  I know it comes as standard but even the small details like offering an umbrella when it was torrential rain made a difference.\n\nI would 100% come back here again if I came to NYC.  It made the trip staying in soho.  A lot more to see than your standard 5th Avenue.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Overall I was happy with our experience and I would stay here again for the right rate.\n\nPros\nThe location was excellent, the d\u00e9cor was lovely, the bed was very comfortable, beautiful bathroom (especially shower), nice robes\/slippers and I loved that there was free WIFI and breakfast and a newspaper included.  \n\nThe breakfast parfait and grapefruit juice were delicious.\n\nGood value for money.\n\nCons\nI expected the room to be small and it was.  I can cope with a small room but the thing I found difficult was that there was literally nowhere to put your clothes.  There is a wardrobe for things that you hang up but only one small drawer and one small high shelf for the rest of your clothing.  We were staying for one week and found it difficult to store two people\u2019s clothing.  \n\nWhile the breakfast was great to have, I never really understood how many items we were entitled to.  They were a bit vague.  There are three options; parfait (beautiful, though better on some days than others), pastries (we don\u2019t eat pastries) and fruit.  On the first day the girl told us to get all three between us to see what we liked.  From then on we ordered two parfaits and one fruit because we thought that was the three items we were allowed.  One day we were given a parfait each and a fruit each which was fantastic, while another day they brought our usual plus a basket of pastries\u2026I\u2019m still not sure what exactly the allowance is.  Also, the cups of coffee are tiny and I found it difficult to get a top up.  \n\nI had a parcel delivered to the hotel.  When I went to collect it I was informed that nothing had arrived for me.  I was told that if my name had been on it and it had been signed for then there would be a record which there wasn\u2019t.  I followed up on my side and got the name of the receptionist that signed for it.  They still couldn\u2019t find my parcel but eventually found it later that day.\n\nI\u2019d read in other reviews about the slow lifts and I have to agree.  One morning, one of the two lifts was broken and it was extremely slow.  There doesn\u2019t seem to be a service elevator so staff add to the elevator traffic.\n\nFinally, I have a major phobia of dogs.  One morning when I got into the lift a dog came running in jumping about.  I hadn\u2019t realised it was a pet friendly hotel and I was petrified.  In fairness, one of the doormen was there and apologised to me but surely dogs should be kept on a lead while in the hotel corridors etc.?","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Reception staff tried hard to be cool but did not really succeed with that. The hotel has only 2 elevators which are used by both guests, housekeeping staff and workers, so you nalways have to wait, never knowing for how long. Room was average size, some would rate it small. A good deal of traffic noise even if the room was in the 13th floor, but not so that night sleep was disturbed. Water in the sink took a looong time to run down, it was obstructed and has obviously been this for a long time. A hairpin was lying on the bottom of the toilet. It was still lying there when we left.\n\nBreakfast was disappointing. When we reserved the room, breakfast was included in room rate. However, when we sat down for breakfast we were told that this applied only for the top 3 items on the breakfast menu card. We ordered the top 3 items and an omelette each (not included, so you have to pay extra). Small fruit bowl, a small yoghurt bowl with granola and some pastries came immediately, and then the waiting began. After 20 minutes, still no omelette. Evententualy the waiter came and informed us that the omelettes will come \"momentarily\". Well, after8 or 9 minutes, still no omelettes. We then just raised and left the restaurant.\n\nThe bar has only french beers. They do have a really impressing selection of single malt whiskies, but 28 bucks for a standard Lagavulin 16 is massively overprized, especially when you get it measured by the milliliter, and it is served in a standard american tumbler glass, and you do not even get some water to dilute it with. Sorry, but if you try to appeal to whisky connaisseurs, you have to do better than that.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There was no place to store our luggage except under the bed (which, was fortunately quite high), the AC was very noisy (apparently the same in all rooms, as advised by the building engineer) and the showers were not especially hot. \nMoreover, while the hotel offered a fun and bustling restaurant and bar scene, the service was very slow on all occasions - meals were served without cutlery, toast without butter and on our last day, the restaurant simply ran out of pastries - one of only two options on the continental breakfast menu. Paid breakfasts were overpriced and underwhelming ($5.99 for a cafe latte). \nUnfortunately, it seems the Ludlow has been overwhelmed by its success and has been unable to keep pace.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

So many things made this the perfect place to stay- the location, the comfort, and the staff.  \n\nWe loved that a train was only a couple blocks away, and that we were surrounded by delicious food, adorable shops, and aside from that- our room had a KILLER VIEW of both the Freedom tower *and* the Empire State Building! We could get to Brooklyn or midtown in one fell swoop.  Our bed- even though it was just a queen sized bed- felt enormous and incredibly comfortable.  The shower was so spacious (and the overhead spout- so posh!) as was the bathroom itself - and the studio was all we needed for the two of us to come home to after busy days enjoying the city.  The rug, the throw on the bed, and the chairs all had added softness to them which made us feel at home.  Also- aside from other reviews, we found the elevator to be perfectly quick- and heard no noise from our neighbors! \n\nBut the best part was the staff.  Everyone was willing to help out- and the hostess at Dirty French- Sid- even totally hooked us up with some to-go-coffees before we jaunted out for our busy day.  We got stuck having to stay an extra night and they got us into a room no problem, handled our bags with ease and brought them to our room... And all with a smile.  Just a really great place to stay, hang, call home -everything.  \n\nHuge props to the owners and the staff- we will stay here every time we come to the city!!","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was immaculate and fantastically cleaned everyday, full marks to the maids, truly. The terrace was a little drab and might have been more useable with different furniture, there was a dining table with six bistro chairs. A recliner of some sort would have been more useable, to enjoy the outside. Also, the three planters were bare and filled with just earth, no flowers\/plants. The bar is very cool and a nice place to be. The restaurant is also loud, noisy and cool and the food is delicious. I had two different salads, fabulous, but what was amazing was the bread you are given, a hot, oily, salty flatbread served with a smear of goats cheese. Heaven! I didn't quite understand which items were complementary at breakfast the first day but after that just stuck with the granola\/yogurt which was nice but repetitive. I think they could expand the complimentary breakfast idea. Good location for the subway. Sometimes there was a very strong smell of roasting meat in the hotel which I didn't like, was that from Katz's next door? Another negative were the lifts, sometimes you can be waiting ages, up to 10minutes, for a lift to stop. All in all, recommend, and sad to leave","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

The taxi accidentally dropped me at the high rise next door, also named Ludlow. If you're forcing your roller bag through a rotating door you're at the wrong place. \n\nThe Studio Queen is small but styled beautifully and great fixtures but it would have been nice to have some sort of nook to manage my bag. The minibar next to the bed was well stocked with many local items. Economy Candy is around the corner so I just went there instead for my candy fix but did go for Uncle Jerry's pretzels. The XL sized Maison Martin Margiela bath robe was too small so maybe I shouldn't have. \n\nAt the time I stayed, the elevators were shared by the cleaning staff. It's entirely possible service elevators were yet to be put into commission. But I spent many waits chatting with friendly guests through our shared elevator experiences. \n\nThe air conditioning was state of the art but very loud and I wound up turning it off to have uninterrupted sleep. I could sleep wonderfully with it on or off, just not when it came on abruptly startling me awake each time. \n\nFor the Lower East Side, noise at night was not so bad. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. I didn't go to the hotel bar at night but it was where they had the continental breakfast set up with pastries, bagels, fruit, juice, coffee, etc. There is a nice courtyard if the weather is nice. \n\nThe F Train is nearby and many places nearby to grab a bite including The Lobster Joint (casual), Whole Foods, Il Laboratorio del Gelato (I recommend scoops of Armagnac and amaretto crunch), and many other places. I did not find many cute shops anywhere in the area, though. The Tenement Museum is close by. \n\nAll in all, a very nice hotel in an area very accessible and with many things to do in walking distance.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"SOLO"}
